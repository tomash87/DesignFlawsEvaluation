One of the main health threats to the endangered European bison (Bison bonsasus) is bovine tuberculosis, the pathogenesis of which in this species is not fully known. The aim of the study was to confirm a possible case of vertical transmission from a pregnant European bison with generalized tuberculosis to its 12-week-old foetus. Materials and method. During the autopsy it was found that the bison had become pregnant, despite an advanced stage of tuberculosis. Material collected from the organs and foetus was placed on Lowenstein and Stonebrink media and incubated at 37°C for 12 weeks. Results. Mycobacteria were isolated from the lungs and lymph nodes; however, the tissue of the foetus and fragments of the reproductive system were negative. Conclusion. Vertical transmission was excluded, although it cannot be ruled out that infection could occur as pregnancy progresses"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deda","uid":"btz9n5ZEfjQ8kaVG7tKm2Hw","uuid":"e711ee8e-d6f5-4f65-bd9b-29d4fe201466","name":"Instytut Gruźlicy i Chorób Płuc","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709479878c28a0473bdef3","5e709410878c28a0473b5a55"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deda","parentUuid":"e711ee8e-d6f5-4f65-bd9b-29d4fe201466","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deda","rootUuid":"e711ee8e-d6f5-4f65-bd9b-29d4fe201466","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947c878c28a0473be3c1"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"300-302","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709307878c28a0473a17c9","5e70947f878c28a0473be87a","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c1","5e709479878c28a0473bdef3","5e709410878c28a0473b5a55","5e70923d878c28a047392444","5e70923a878c28a0473920fd","5e70923a878c28a047392112"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547705a","mniswId":"1204","title":"Annals of Agricultural and Environmental Medicine","issn":"1232-1966","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"761f7660-d21f-4cb0-b78c-7c6b42d2b952"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Pregnancy","intrauterine infection","foetus","bovine tuberculosis","Mycobacterium caprae","European bison"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747056503363"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"625926dd2467f037448198f3","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Mazurek","documentHash":"292bff47-d40a-4636-b37f-cdad347ac122"},{"objectId":"625926dd2467f037448198f2","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Pelec","documentHash":"57378375-c71b-45a0-8f55-6eae9f88df99"},{"objectId":"625926dd2467f037448198f1","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Bełcik","orcidId":"0000-0002-5322-2569","documentHash":"bcf1efbd-bb04-4dfc-867c-3ff32a5d6a64"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Korpysa-Dzirba","uuid":"0F6E5299BA1DE2C04CCB23BB69EE8BB0AF924331950608E7B9E07C962AC58BA926288AB7400DBD5FDFA0B8F25E5B3E11F82C54FC732A0E0269E9C0A9EB906901","orcidId":"0000-0002-8266-581X","documentHash":"a20ea112-853c-4a02-89cc-69a1868143b6"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d3e","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Różycki","uuid":"EDB5A4A5E5695886180E1E731AFC64C841487D978E10D582350E1705DD7A068F0AEDC71760C9936BF219656EF91B9728C467322E45795FA2B16E89EE268A1FA8","orcidId":"0000-0002-8125-973X","documentHash":"c9364cd3-5397-46bc-bd82-22a204693887"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b50","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Cencek","uuid":"7D7F433A7A31D1A4D080277B2FE49ED9F5B45115086FAEDA03BCF07F6AB6D09B61EC0E8015CEEA44A992C6D7E5DD06BB406798BF1E7065879BA9ED1F3FC8E8D3","orcidId":"0000-0003-3649-7867","documentHash":"7aa79c92-3af1-40b7-85e2-872b041c4104"}],"objectId":"625926dd2467f037448198ed","doi":"10.3390/jcm11030485","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/11/3/485/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Analysis of a Trichinellosis Outbreak in Poland after Consumption of Sausage Made of Wild Boar Meat","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"An outbreak of trichinellosis due to the consumption of sausage made from wild boar meat unexamined for the presence of Trichinella spp. was reported in Poland in December 2020.

L3 larvae are one of the major etiological factors of human anisakiasis, which is one of the most important foodborne parasitic diseases. Nevertheless, to date, Anisakis secretome proteins, with important functions in nematode pathogenicity and host-parasite interactions, have not been extensively explored. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify and characterize the excretory-secretory (ES) proteins of A. simplex L3 larvae. ES proteins of A. simplex were subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis, and the identified proteins were then analyzed using bioinformatics tools. A total of 158 proteins were detected. Detailed bioinformatic characterization of ES proteins was performed, including Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, identification of enzymes, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways analysis, protein family classification, secretory pathway prediction, and detection of essential proteins. Furthermore, of all detected ES proteins, 1 was identified as an allergen, which was Ani s 4, and 18 were potential allergens, most of which were homologs of nematode and arthropod allergens. Nine potential pathogenicity-related proteins were predicted, which were predominantly homologs of chaperones. In addition, predicted host-parasite interactions between the Anisakis ES proteins and both human and fish proteins were identified. In conclusion, this study represents the first global analysis of Anisakis ES proteins. The findings provide a better understanding of survival and invasion strategies of A. simplex L3 larvae."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de0","5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","5e7094fa878c28a0473c84a2","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","5e709341878c28a0473a5b50"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"246","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de0","5e7094fa878c28a0473c84a2","625928e22467f0374481a257","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","5ebed528752340254fc40172","5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","5e709341878c28a0473a5b50","625928e22467f0374481a25d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceac","mniswId":"15767","title":"Pathogens","issn":"2076-0817","eissn":"2076-0817","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0aee51de-2ae0-4570-a31e-61056cf6d598"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"624566072467f01551379135","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"317c4e86-f309-446e-b40e-afbd59b3c255"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["allergen","bioinformatics","Anisakis simplex","pathogenicity","proteomics","secretome"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058098898"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"625926892467f03744819882","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Michalski","documentHash":"ecfb8eb5-7a8f-4ec2-b3f3-db35529452d8"},{"objectId":"5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d47","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Nawrocka","uuid":"EBE32826F2491E214CA0AFC4EEA02786FEA4A499AF027659085E6926AF5823B364154DB516E1E0DDAF195E1E849947670A95C606ADD8B170A79D3E1144B3DE3B","documentHash":"53491847-cc60-4f79-bb1f-a22d3a13c011"},{"objectId":"5e70947e878c28a0473be61c","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Durkalec","uuid":"1F7C624B21B309061D407671A4CA819E68A789AA0443FA4D45E7A6CA85687562613BB0F346CE23AEF5FB6B8919CA94C2ECC7E7A582126B60E457F2A00005BFCC","orcidId":"0000-0001-6036-7953","documentHash":"da7b2a40-70f8-4ffd-8232-e71aa0b1808e"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d2e","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Posyniak","uuid":"92DC06402710A27C3F4BEAA2905BD38DBF391EC88AC5782A34AEF8D5CC50DC9053AFCA4589CCFF4A4027B9C1B373A29748E9892CD7D44F10230EA260A95904E2","documentHash":"bf315d6e-353b-447e-87f7-0b5a67482104"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cbb","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Michalski","uuid":"C4FE00263E94E0E65071E21DE9411DB1052A5DCDAF93799127F66021AB7FA48E9D7F4A53E2475707EF39F8D34AA9F53860138C602C833A8B6CD84BF0C4C81E14","orcidId":"0000-0003-1004-9193","documentHash":"8948d1c3-9dbc-48cd-9269-475cdd5046fc"}],"objectId":"625926892467f0374481987e","doi":"10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.132045","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0308814622000061?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Simple and reliable determination of total arsenic and its species in seafood by ICP-MS and HPLC-ICP-MS","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Quantitative, rapid, selective and sensitive methods for the determination of total arsenic (tAs) and six arsenic compounds (arsenite (As(III)), arsenate (As(V)), arsenobetaine (AsB), arsenocholine (AsC), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), dimethylarsonic acid (DMA)) in seafood were developed. The measurement of the tAs concentration was performed using quadrupole inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Microwave-assisted extraction was used for the isolation of arsenic species. The separation and quantification of analysed compounds were performed by ion-exchange chromatography coupled with ICP-MS in one chromatographic run using ammonium carbonate-based buffers, which has little effect on ICP-MS sensitivity compared to commonly used phosphate buffers. The results of validation and proficiency tests confirmed the reliability, robustness, and applicability of the developed procedures to various types of matrices.

Each snake was tested for the presence of A. alata mesocercariae using the AMT and MSM methods. 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA), cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI) and 28S ribosomal RNA (28S rRNA) genes were amplified by PCR and sequenced for the purpose of species identification. Fifty grass snakes were infected with helminths. The molecular characterization of trematodes allowed us to identify A. alata in 30 snakes (58.8%), Conodiplostomum spathula (Dubois, 1937) in 16 snakes (31.3%), Strigea falconis (Szidat, 1928) in 12 snakes (23.5%), and Neodiplostomum attenuatum (Linstow, 1906) in 2 snakes (3.9%), while, in 4 snakes (7.8%), the trematodes species could not be identified. Based on the analysis of 18S and COI sequences, Crenosoma vulpis (Dujardin, 1845) was identified in four snakes (7.8%), while nematodes collected from three snakes remained unidentified. The tapeworm sample was identified as Ophiotaenia. The obtained results indicate that grass snakes are an excellent vector of A. alata and may be a potential source of infection for mammals, e.g., wild boars and foxes, which results in an increased risk of alariosis for consumers of raw or undercooked game meat."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d79","5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","5e709341878c28a0473a5b50"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"156","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6259277c2467f037448199c4","6259277c2467f037448199c5","5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","6259277c2467f037448199c7","6259277c2467f037448199c8","6259277c2467f037448199c9","5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","5e709341878c28a0473a5b50","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d79","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceac","mniswId":"15767","title":"Pathogens","issn":"2076-0817","eissn":"2076-0817","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0aee51de-2ae0-4570-a31e-61056cf6d598"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"624566072467f01551379135","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"317c4e86-f309-446e-b40e-afbd59b3c255"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["grass snakes","parasites","trematodes","Alaria alata","environmental risk"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058099096"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61d510b87523401fc110f98b","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Osiński","uuid":"E22F565289E96FFCC790C3308B040EACB2014326B501B5584615FF116FC560A28AE9E18D03E00DCF6D65AC2D936D26FA7601EAB0455821EA61DAE48F80069623","documentHash":"93775440-a1c8-4c66-9841-5b6d3406f789"},{"objectId":"5e70947a878c28a0473be056","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Patyra","uuid":"70AEA1536F3D1DD275C8505B021D0A3CC7548B85668DF4614DD25CD31CEF0BFD91FA03E71F0B483A2FBF8AF3B27E24667A7617657EC1F5313A96730402DBF2D0","orcidId":"0000-0002-3827-2314","documentHash":"85c16763-62f2-4d5c-8a34-6ecfc4c5e227"}],"objectId":"625e86152467f03847f27517","doi":"10.21521/mw.6638","publicUri":"http://www.medycynawet.edu.pl/images/stories/pdf/pdf2022/042022/2022046638.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Natural and organic fertilizers as a source of environmental contamination with antimicrobial substances","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"abk","content":"Veterinary antibiotics (VAs) are widely used worldwide to treat and prevent infectious diseases, as well as to promote growth and improve the feeding efficiency of food-producing animals in livestock activities.

To gain knowledge on the occurrence of ABBVs in Poland, samples originating from dead birds of the Anseriformes order collected in 2016–2021 were tested with a real time RT-PCR method targeting the ABBVs genome. A total of 514 birds were examined, including 401 swans, 96 ducks and 17 geese. The presence of ABBV-1 RNA was detected in 52 swans (10.1% of all tested birds) from 40 different locations. No positive results were obtained for ducks and geese. Sequences of about 2300 bases were generated for 18 viruses and phylogenetic analysis was performed. A relatively low genetic diversity of the examined ABBV-1 strains was observed as all were gathered in a single cluster in the phylogenetic tree and the minimum nucleotide identity was 99.14%. The Polish strains were closely related to ABBV-1 identified previously in Denmark and Germany, but a limited number of sequences from Europe hinders the drawing of conclusions about interconnections between Polish and other European ABBVs.

This study’s main goal was to assess their exposure to indirect poisoning by anticoagulant rodenticides (AR). This study presents the investigation results of 40 white-tailed eagles’ suspected poisoning cases in the years 2018–2020 in Poland. In all tested liver samples, using a liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry method, at least one of the AR (bromadiolone, brodifacoum, difenacoum, flocoumafen) was detected and confirmed. The other tested AR compounds (chlorophacinone, coumachlor, coumatetralyl, difethialone, diphacinone, warfarin) were not detected. The mean concentration of the sum of rodenticides was 174.4 µg/kg (from 2.5 to 1225.0 µg/kg). In 20 cases, the sum concentration was above 100 µg/kg and in 10 cases it was above 200 µg/kg. Interpretation of cases of AR poisonings should take into account their concentration in the liver, anatomopathological lesions, circumstances of death/finding of the animal, and elimination of other possible causes of poisoning.

After their administration to animals, up to 90% of the initial dose of the antibiotic is excreted in the feces and/or urine, which can be applied to farmland as natural or organic fertilizers. In this work, an analytical method was developed with the use of HPLC-FLD for the detection and quantification of five sulfonamides (sulfaguanidine, sulfadiazine, sulfamerazine, sulamethazine and sulfamethoxazol) in poultry and pig feces, slurry and digestates. The method was validated according to EU requirements (Commission Decision 2002/657/EC and VICH GL49). Linearity, decision limit, detection capability, detection and quantification limits, recovery, precision, and selectivity were determined, and adequate results were obtained. Using the HPLC-FLD method for all analyzed matrices, recoveries were satisfactory (77.00–121.16%), with repeatability and reproducibility in the range of 4.36–17.34% to 7.94–18.55%, respectively. Decision limit (CCα) and detection capability (CCβ) were 33.87–67.63 and 53.36–92.00 µg/kg, respectively, and limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were 13.53–23.30 and 26.02–40.38 µg/kg, respectively, depending on the analyte. The forty-four samples of natural and organic fertilizers were analyzed, and four samples showed sulfamethoxazole in the amount from range 158 to 11,070 µg/kg.

The  bacterium  often  affects  poultry  as  part  of  multiple infections  causing  very  serious  clinical  signs  that  are usually  not limited only to the respiratory system. This study’s main objective was the retrospective detection and identification of ORT in turkey flocks. Material and Methods: ORT identification was performed in 6,225 samples taken from 133 different flocks between 2015 and 2020. Molecular methods were used, specifically real-time PCR and traditional PCR. We focused on partial 16S rRNA gene sequences of isolates, which were compared with sequences obtained from GenBank. The reaction products were analysed phylogenetically. Molecular methods indicating secondary infections was carried out, and the bacterial composition of the upper respiratory tract was 16S metasequenced for selected flocks to identify any other pathogens. Results: The presence of ORT was detected in 30.83% of samples by real-time PCR and 28.57% by PCR. Phylogenetic analysis of the PCR products from the turkeys samples  showed  that  their  sequences  resolved  into  two  main  genetic  groups.  Tests  for  the  occurrence  of  secondary  infections showed the presence of Mycoplasma gallisepticum and M. synoviae in some samples but the total absence of Bordetella avium. The upper respiratory tract in turkeys was dominated by two major phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. At the genus level, the genera Ornithobacterium, Mycoplasma, Gallibacterium, Avibacterium, and Escherichia-Shigella were found which may include pathogenic bacteria that can cause clinical symptoms. Conclusion: The results of the analysis of multiple infection carried out in flocks with respiratory signs are probably associated with outbreaks of ornithobacteriosis in turkey flocks in Poland."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de5","5e7094af878c28a0473c1b6b","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"66","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"77-84","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de5","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5a","5e7094af878c28a0473c1b6b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research","issn":"2450-7393","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c3fc9638-cd0e-40bb-89b9-22dee2de8b67"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058102608"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"608a55de9543c73526c48c68","name":"Beata","lastName":"Lachtara","uuid":"282991714039C961E3319F2426A2863D93470CCBE543F8EC7CE3808AE7F95DEC9E25A5232A45D0AAB8B01CF326F9497B266A34643AE9A696A6239B39FF83989E","documentHash":"a6cf7b97-c844-48db-a522-0850505ee499"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d66","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Wieczorek","uuid":"77FE94937137879573023F0D11FD72EFFDFDC4214863FDBF15FEEF0A6BDFD2ABA69978BCCFC9FF88D0F012F09560030758068F57DE1D27D7EB8B20C442DC9439","orcidId":"0000-0001-8268-3885","documentHash":"e54d106b-ea77-4715-815a-37b17126e9c0"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Osek","uuid":"09D7D5320F1FC606BCE9C2D945933A9AD76A02E8625F591A249FCC889F47698A9DDB27A314BD598D2BEBE05552FA565585514F11E04F6B15DA221089044711E2","orcidId":"0000-0003-2295-8837","documentHash":"6dc7582e-e613-4ee9-9ee7-81d949533982"}],"objectId":"6299cc014097072c2b79ed31","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fsn3.2910","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Listeria monocytogenes in foods—From culture identification to  whole-genome characteristics","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Listeria monocytogenes is an important foodborne pathogen, which is able to persist in  the food production environments. The presence of these bacteria in different niches  makes them a potential threat for public health. In the present review, the current  information on the classical and alternative methods used for isolation and identifi\u0002cation of L. monocytogenes in food have been described. Although these techniques  are usually simple, standardized, inexpensive, and are routinely used in many food  testing laboratories, several alternative molecular-based approaches for the bacte\u0002ria detection in food and food production environments have been developed. They  are characterized by the high sample throughput, a short time of analysis, and cost\u0002effectiveness. However, these methods are important for the routine testing toward  the presence and number of L. monocytogenes, but are not suitable for characteris\u0002tics and typing of the bacterial isolates, which are crucial in the study of listeriosis  infections. For these purposes, novel approaches, with a high discriminatory power  to genetically distinguish the strains during epidemiological studies, have been de\u0002veloped, e.g., whole-genome sequence-based techniques such as NGS which provide  an opportunity to perform comparison between strains of the same species. In the  present review, we have shown a short description of the principles of microbiologi\u0002cal, alternative, and modern methods of detection of L. monocytogenes in foods and  characterization of the isolates for epidemiological purposes. According to our knowl\u0002edge, similar comprehensive papers on such subject have not been recently published,  and we hope that the current review may be interesting for research communities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d66","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9","608a55de9543c73526c48c68"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-30","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9","608a55de9543c73526c48c68","5e709342878c28a0473a5d66"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c175","mniswId":"6705","title":"Food Science & Nutrition","issn":"2048-7177","eissn":"2048-7177","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"444aa444-2e50-4ba7-acd9-5b9396bbed5a"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["classical methods","genotyping","identification","Listeria monocytogenes","molecular methods"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058127903"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6299d11e4097072c2b7a18ff","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Chrzanowska","documentHash":"32250de2-701f-41c7-a68d-b9e7815fed05"},{"objectId":"61de4b387523403b69b1ed5b","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Adamska","uuid":"F815269EDB2352CD6093E4FBE2A885F08A8D96E81E6018312B075BB80513DE75118276AFB8B3D80A7EBA8588E6BB2ED09715CC47C103BC45E9E38D3CDCC60F3C","documentHash":"caf9244a-2237-470d-a477-6ea78bcc9d09"},{"objectId":"5e7094af878c28a0473c1b6b","name":"Anna","lastName":"Sawicka-Durkalec","uuid":"74F41A0F85AC155F46A6CCFB26EB711F025B465228066B5B84B02AC6321B340B5E150BCF2A66F7C1772D185C02BC942B7AE9B4870C2127F7D8BF9A52EE8941FA","documentHash":"bedf887e-9c8e-4e06-b951-662b20cf6e92"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de5","name":"Olimpia","lastName":"Kursa","uuid":"75402E2E14C8ED8034D357B13AFDE45E9969ED0E1013DCAC5AC579ED65B4C512BE817796CCDCBBC958F09F10CA0E27A409B73C9E9AF9FD4C4A298A3D7F324E63","orcidId":"0000-0002-0058-1568","documentHash":"6ee44e6d-ce9a-41d7-99e0-5633dff83f06"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d5a","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Tomczyk","uuid":"E3C5238621862F074D46922CB3B17195CE27A83F2C9C06B0BA49A69FEE2FB90EC33B4FDD96A897D15FCA91F90109B062B91A53DADD2FC97CF132051ED597C664","documentHash":"b7a3ee18-b481-4390-a3be-5aeac0b34bca"}],"objectId":"6299d11e4097072c2b7a18fa","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/10/5/987","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The Microbial Community of the Respiratory Tract of Commercial Chickens and Turkeys","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Respiratory tract health critically affects the performance of commercial poultry. This report presents data on the microbial community in these organs from a comprehensive study of laying chickens and turkey breeders. The main objective was to characterize and compare the compositions of the respiratory system bacteria isolated from birds of different ages and geographical locations in Poland. Using samples from 28 turkey and 26 chicken flocks, the microbial community was determined by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. There was great variability between flocks. The diversity and abundance of upper respiratory tract (URT) bacteria was greater in chickens than in turkeys. At the phyla level, the URT of the chickens was heavily colonized by Proteobacteria, which represented 66.4% of the total microbiota, while in turkeys, this phylum constituted 42.6% of all bacteria. Firmicutes bacteria were more abundant in turkeys (43.2%) than in chickens (24.1%). The comparison of the respiratory tracts at the family and genus levels showed the diversity and abundance of amplicon sequence variants (ASV) differing markedly between the species. Potentially pathogenic bacteria ASV were identified in the respiratory tract, which are not always associated with clinical signs, but may affect bird productivity and performance. The data obtained, including characterization of the bacterial composition found in the respiratory system, may be useful for developing effective interventions strategies to improve production performance and prevent and control disease in commercial laying chickens and turkeys."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny -

This combined method was effective to detect and isolate most of the E. coli or Salmonella spp. strains harbouring different mcr genes from food-producing animals and food products and might thus be used as a harmonized protocol for the screening of mcr genes in food-producing animals and food products in Europe."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094e4878c28a0473c62ff","5ebede04752340254fc42880","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-10","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6299be654097072c2b797ef5","6299be654097072c2b797ef6","6299be654097072c2b797ef7","6299be654097072c2b797ef8","6299be654097072c2b797ef9","6299be654097072c2b797efa","6299be654097072c2b797efb","6299be654097072c2b797efc","6299be654097072c2b797efd","6299be654097072c2b797efe","6299be654097072c2b797eff","6299be654097072c2b797f00","5e7094e4878c28a0473c62ff","5ebede04752340254fc42880","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5c","6299be654097072c2b797f04","6299be654097072c2b797f05","6299be654097072c2b797f06","6299be654097072c2b797f07","6299be654097072c2b797f08"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478cd6","mniswId":"13598","title":"Letters in Applied Microbiology","issn":"0266-8254","eissn":"1472-765X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"00319c02-59ed-4dd4-acf6-085527761fa3"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Colistin resistance","E. coli","mcr","Salmonella","screening"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128172"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a3776","name":"Ioannis","lastName":"Bossis","documentHash":"99467773-66b9-45cb-a186-4b46cee2fe9e"},{"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a3775","name":"Alessandro","lastName":"Giusti","documentHash":"0646b734-d98e-409f-998b-18b316472632"},{"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a3774","name":"Amadeu","lastName":"Griol","documentHash":"caff0598-87d5-4188-a8d4-8d264cbe6b95"},{"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a3773","name":"Carlos","lastName":"Sanchez","documentHash":"2d9dd071-5e08-4303-ab22-688687f88db0"},{"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a3772","name":"Sara","lastName":"Recuero","documentHash":"8b97c7ce-6db1-47ec-a0ea-5f420c454fa9"},{"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a3771","name":"Clare","lastName":"Squires","documentHash":"e2aa28d4-bb6a-4fc7-ba11-a072b5ab92d9"},{"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a3770","name":"Athanasios","lastName":"Gelasakis","documentHash":"fb45db5c-8ec7-413d-a294-9e099cb64df7"},{"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a376f","name":"Balka","lastName":"Gyula","documentHash":"18bcb28c-d19b-45a5-a3cc-1ae43bb43342"},{"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a376e","name":"Lilla","lastName":"Denes","documentHash":"ac3fb764-0b24-4e5d-881c-75121f77f636"},{"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a376d","name":"Martina","lastName":"Benedetti","documentHash":"8fdf78bd-473b-4976-8501-96ab6489ca83"},{"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a376c","name":"Lapo","lastName":"Nannucci","documentHash":"0da7c46a-f89b-4438-bf44-86ca71ab1913"},{"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a3769","name":"Georgios","lastName":"Manessis","documentHash":"bb84b746-5dba-4a27-9404-5a06ae3f4902"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a660f","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Frant","uuid":"2AD73901C2B1BDDF66264197B4E2A40BB43C9F170B0D3D9252C79378D973DED6BA0DD7DB0E3F16FB50489E4717CA62BAE671805ED94AD0C5F9B3478EE3C561FE","orcidId":"0000-0002-7169-3735","documentHash":"b81b59e2-56af-4ed2-bfbe-bdf26cc5f824"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d6b","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Woźniakowski","uuid":"6D282CFCD3A7758B6F62BC672552908C0AA3BFA7E8AEA251B82246AFAA5A380A7601C034C662EDB06D1DAC96FEDDFDEE170F3BCD44E519D0E60AD2F0542F38F5","orcidId":"0000-0002-1333-4275","documentHash":"207a7d5b-ae39-4599-8ff4-03f9d039e209"}],"objectId":"6299d3b54097072c2b7a3767","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/14/5/988","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Point-of-Care and Label-Free Detection of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome and Swine Influenza Viruses Using a Microfluidic Device with Photonic Integrated Circuits","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Swine viral diseases challenge the sector’s sustainability by affecting productivity and the health and welfare of the animals.

WGS data were used for phylogenetic analysis that also included M. bovis global dataset. Thirty-seven M. bovis/caprae isolates from Bulgaria were studied and 34 of them were SNP genotyped. The isolates were subdivided into 3 major phylogenetic groups. Type Mbovis-13 (Eu2 complex [western Europe and northern Africa]) included one isolate. Mbovis-37 type included 5 isolates outside of known clonal complexes. The Bulgarian M. caprae isolates formed a sub-group within the Mcaprae-27B cluster which also included 22 M. caprae isolates from Poland, Spain, Germany, and the Republic of Congo. The Bulgarian M. caprae isolates share their latest common ancestors with Spanish isolates. The Mbovis-37 group shares a distant common ancestor (pairwise distance 22-29 SNPs) with an isolate from Poland but was very distant (> 200 SNPs) from the rest of the tree. The Mbovis-13 group shares a common ancestor with two human isolates from Germany. Phylogeographically, both M. bovis clades had limited circulation in northeastern Bulgaria while the majority of the studied isolates (M. caprae) were from central and western provinces. A phylogenetic network-based analysis demonstrated that 11 Bulgarian isolates were separated by 1 to 6 SNPs within four clusters, mostly forming pairs of isolates.\nThe obtained WGS analysis positioned the Bulgarian isolates within the global phylogeography of M. bovis/M. caprae. Hypothetically, the observed phylogenetic diversity may not have resulted from livestock trade routes, but instead may reflect the deeply rooted M. bovis/M. caprae phylogeography of Europe. A high level of genetic divergence between the majority of the studied isolates suggests limited active transmission of bTB in Bulgaria during the survey period. At the same time, a possibility of the endemic presence of circulating bTB strains in the form of the latent persistent disease cannot be ruled out."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60a738179543c758682b6456"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62bab421409707490d7a8c2b","62bab421409707490d7a8c2c","62bab421409707490d7a8c2d","62bab421409707490d7a8c2e","60a738179543c758682b6456","62bab421409707490d7a8c30","62bab421409707490d7a8c31","62bab421409707490d7a8c32","62bab421409707490d7a8c33"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454773ef","mniswId":"2654","title":"BMC Veterinary Research","doi":"10.1186/s12917","issn":"1746-6148","eissn":"1746-6148","websiteLink":"https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/","documentHash":"4360595b-0c33-4e38-a964-93915c95c2cf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e135162467f00328bfab4c","year":"2022","volume":"18","number":"1","documentHash":"4193b97a-6889-4332-99f3-7387205b9b6f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Whole‑genome sequencing","Mycobacterium bovis","Mycobacterium caprae","cattle","Transmission","Phylogeography","Bulgaria"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058141870"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60a738179543c758682b6456","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Radulski","uuid":"884C68E493FED1FCA705BDA92235CA75DA53F5BD924591BAD3CF9461D3D197280F4C6263046E76F43689A89A7F134D7030E7702104B78A13C46FB185D087B223","documentHash":"a6aecbdf-127b-477b-a21c-1ba416c1eeba"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c1","name":"Monika","lastName":"Krajewska-Wędzina","uuid":"48D96FF61147929F46D201644057AF91FD057455FC10757C30FB62096A475BDC285317D0DC9C8B59939D198E75553F0070726157DEA9152E0CC73FA3968F8714","orcidId":"0000-0002-5826-2068","documentHash":"59c09ee7-3423-47a7-a7e0-af93754cdebf"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d55","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Szulowski","uuid":"576547A141E53A165904F3B0D29C64A4BF19FB3126FB649DBE043AEACD1C65E6EB53808DF97DD8B969FE53D26D4430A7A4832E5BBE347F01553CB9B6A0FD6C1F","documentHash":"ca545536-b374-433d-942d-d71db6c88699"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cb3","name":"Marek","lastName":"Lipiec","uuid":"99D34DD10FC128F474E1D79FE96A6FF2D2E2C9B6C3F0F51FA3B74C896A3FF1FABE620E0B34B63F850E666345D0727684A9CBB59BA79D24BAB27AEE28E98771C7","documentHash":"b42fadfc-6682-4ad6-9f5e-1ab5a8ca8147"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"APRIL","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"62ba9fc5409707490d7953d4","doi":"10.3390/ani12080964","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/12/8/964/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Infection of a Free-Living Wild Boar (Sus scrofa) with a Bacterium from the Mycobacterium kansasii Complex","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The most numerous group of bacteria in the genus Mycobacterium is the nontuberculous mycobacteria.

The submandibular lymph nodes of a wild boar shot by a hunter were examined in order to confirm or exclude infection with bacteria of the genus Mycobacterium. In culture, a bacterial isolate was obtained after 12 days of incubation on Petragnani and Stonebrink media. A multiplex PCR clearly indicated that the isolate was a nontuberculous mycobacterium. The results of species identification attempts via both molecular biology methods and mass spectrometry confirmed that the isolated strain belonged to MKC. The described case of a wild boar infection with MKC is the first documented case in Poland and only the second in Europe, and in confirming the presence of this pathogen among free-living animals, this report implies that MKC is of great concern.

Given the wide range of potential sources of microbial contamination that may come into contact with feed, a variety of microorganisms, including pathogenic ones, can be expected. Microbiological contamination of feeds depends on environmental factors, which are a natural, primary source related to the microflora carried on feed materials and coming from soil, water and air. Microbial contamination may also emerge secondarily in the processing and distribution stages of feed, but also in the breeding stage, where feed may be contaminated by animals showing disease symptoms or asymptomatically. A wide variety of pathogenic microorganisms that are transmitted symptomatically or asymptomatically can cause economic losses to feed producers and farmers, and some of them due to their zoonotic nature can also pose a potential risk to consumers. New feed materials appear on the market, i.e. Insect Processed Animal Proteins, which are part of the strategy of replacing traditional protein sources. These materials are under investigation for their benefits as well as for microbiological safety.

We tried to adapt avian IAV (avIAV) to the pig by serial passages in vivo and assessed the occurrence of point mutations and their influence on viral fitness in the pig’s body. Material and Methods: A total of 25 in vivo avIAV passages of the A/duck/Bavaria/77 strain were performed by inoculation of 50 piglets, and after predetermined numbers of passages 20 uninoculated piglets were exposed to the virus through contact with inoculated animals. Clinical signs of swine influenza were assessed daily. Nasal swabs and lung tissue were used to detect IAV RNA by real-time RT-PCR and isolates from selected passages were sequenced. Results: Apart from a rise in rectal temperature and a sporadic cough, no typical clinical signs were observed in infected pigs. The original strain required 20 passages to improve its replication ability noticeably. A total of 29 amino-acid substitutions were identified. Eighteen of them were detected in the first sequenced isolate, of which 16 were also in all other analysed strains. Additional mutations were detected with more passages.  One  substitution,  threonine  (T)  135 to  serine  (S)  in  neuraminidase  (NA),  was  only  detected  in  an  IAV  isolate  from  a contact-exposed piglet. Conclusion: Passaging 25 times allowed us to obtain a partially swine-adapted IAV. The improvement in isolate replication ability  was  most likely related to S654 to glycine (G) substitution in the basic protein (PB) 1 as well as to aspartic acid (D) 701 to asparagine (N) and arginine (R) 477 to G in PB2, glutamic acid (E) 204 to D and G239E in haemagglutinin and T135S in NA."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709487878c28a0473befdb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d2d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"66","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"9-19","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709487878c28a0473befdb","625e75ff2467f03847f2378b","625e75ff2467f03847f2378d","625e75ff2467f03847f2378e","5e709342878c28a0473a5d2d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research","issn":"2450-7393","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c3fc9638-cd0e-40bb-89b9-22dee2de8b67"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["avian influenza virus","pig","in vivo adaptation","mutation","viral fitness"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145563"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62592a172467f0374481a6d7","name":"Heike","lastName":"Schmitt","documentHash":"06739c06-dc92-4c38-929e-10b47f46fe18"},{"objectId":"62592a172467f0374481a6d6","name":"Lidwien A.

Here, we describe AMR levels of European pig and broiler farms and determine the potential risk factors. Methods We collected faeces from 181 pig farms and 181 broiler farms in nine European countries. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to quantify the relative abundance of four antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) [aph(3′)-III, erm(B), sul2 and tet(W)] in these faeces samples. Information on antimicrobial use (AMU) and other farm characteristics was collected through a questionnaire. A mixed model using country and farm as random effects was performed to evaluate the relationship of AMR with AMU and other farm characteristics. The correlation between individual qPCR data and previously published pooled metagenomic data was evaluated. Variance component analysis was conducted to assess the variance contribution of all factors. Results The highest abundance of ARG was for tet(W) in pig faeces and erm(B) in broiler faeces. In addition to the significant positive association between corresponding ARG and AMU levels, we also found on-farm biosecurity measures were associated with relative ARG abundance in both pigs and broilers. Between-country and between-farm variation can partially be explained by AMU. Different ARG targets may have different sample size requirements to represent the overall farm level precisely. Conclusions qPCR is an efficient tool for targeted assessment of AMR in livestock-related samples. The AMR variation between samples was mainly contributed to by between-country, between-farm and within-farm differences, and then by on-farm AMU."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094e4878c28a0473c62ff","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"77","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"969-978","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62592a172467f0374481a6c3","62592a172467f0374481a6c4","62592a172467f0374481a6c5","62592a172467f0374481a6c6","62592a172467f0374481a6c7","62592a172467f0374481a6c8","62592a172467f0374481a6c9","62592a172467f0374481a6ca","62592a172467f0374481a6cb","62592a172467f0374481a6cc","62592a172467f0374481a6cd","62592a172467f0374481a6ce","62592a172467f0374481a6cf","62592a172467f0374481a6d0","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5c","62592a172467f0374481a6d3","62592a172467f0374481a6d4","62592a172467f0374481a6d5","62592a172467f0374481a6d6","62592a172467f0374481a6d7","5e7094e4878c28a0473c62ff","5e709342878c28a0473a5d6c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478463","mniswId":"10126","title":"JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOTHERAPY","issn":"0305-7453","documentHash":"cd4d94d6-cce9-4acf-af74-fadeb654d260"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62592a172467f0374481a6da","year":"2022","volume":"77","number":"4","documentHash":"1d04c4f2-a044-407d-b6ac-042c03ae933a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["drug resistance","microbial feces","genes","suidae"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145716"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61de4b387523403b69b1ed3a","name":"Beata","lastName":"Król","uuid":"583651ADEB85DC046239B4B345DBB800466CED414858A0C6F1442F42BCCCDD7A850FC5B984B9F810B3250DAE3DA0AD4D16668258204C02D01D47A7BE697060C3","documentHash":"32d9eae2-3c1c-44fb-884e-7ddb6301c9ae"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d45","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Sieradzki","uuid":"E683966D80B2D25E3C328EA851BD586C0472525E3BF01A9391F4CFD4B3F65F1F46532DB713B7C10AFF4976DD80575F012203ACF5477F56F8E07C4E4FE7E562D3","orcidId":"0000-0003-0078-9024","documentHash":"3d5edc21-d5bc-4bd0-bbae-b58942fe9b8f"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cba","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Mazur","uuid":"CDA3FBC4552E8997F2BFF1545A06761F10FA1F36CFF68CFC1EB63E36D7EF25366493F19293292AC767B3BC5FEE2A7DAAD0C1859018FC67C022F75E76574E5A25","documentHash":"bd90e7e1-0d99-480a-9c0b-ad7934dc2eb0"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5caf","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kwiatek","uuid":"483AF17960E9A333131A70EFECF6469DB4B390ED1FC80958251A4DC48A21C1BB31E13F4FFF4619F4F3D2845908B5F84A67F567F444E8C826335B0675F5060620","documentHash":"2cd83ba7-a483-4b03-b3b0-14728060cac8"}],"objectId":"625e87192467f03847f27733","doi":"10.21521/mw.6604","publicUri":"http://www.medycynawet.edu.pl/images/stories/pdf/pdf2022/00-artwait/2022016604.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Analysis of feed in terms of the presence of genetically modified oilseed rape","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The labeling of products containing GMOs above 0.9% results from the provisions of the law in force in the European Union.

In this study, we detect and estimate the level of BLV proviral DNA by qPCR in DNA samples from 119 cattle naturally infected with BLV, from 18 farms located in four different geographical regions of Kazakhstan. Furthermore, we conducted the phylogenetic and molecular analysis of 41 BLV env-gp51 gene sequences from BLV infected cattle. Phylogenetic analysis showed the affiliation of sequences to two already known genotypes G4 and G7 and also to a new genotype, classified as genotype G12. In addition, a multivariate method was employed for analysis of the association between proviral load and different variables such as the geographical location of the herd, cattle breeds, age of animals, and the presence of particular BLV genotypes. In summary, the results of this study provide the first evidence on molecular characterization of BLV circulating in cattle from Kazakhstan."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cad","5e709342878c28a0473a5d36","61d510b87523401fc110f98b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"180","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6259285e2467f03744819ddd","5e709342878c28a0473a5d36","6259285e2467f03744819ddf","6259285e2467f03744819de0","61d510b87523401fc110f98b","6259285e2467f03744819de2","6259285e2467f03744819de3","5e709342878c28a0473a5cad"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceac","mniswId":"15767","title":"Pathogens","issn":"2076-0817","eissn":"2076-0817","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0aee51de-2ae0-4570-a31e-61056cf6d598"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"624566072467f01551379135","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"317c4e86-f309-446e-b40e-afbd59b3c255"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bovine","leukemia","virus","BLV","proviral","load","phylogenetic","analysis","genetic","variability","Kazakhstan"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145946"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70947a878c28a0473be056","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Patyra","uuid":"70AEA1536F3D1DD275C8505B021D0A3CC7548B85668DF4614DD25CD31CEF0BFD91FA03E71F0B483A2FBF8AF3B27E24667A7617657EC1F5313A96730402DBF2D0","orcidId":"0000-0002-3827-2314","documentHash":"85c16763-62f2-4d5c-8a34-6ecfc4c5e227"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5caf","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kwiatek","uuid":"483AF17960E9A333131A70EFECF6469DB4B390ED1FC80958251A4DC48A21C1BB31E13F4FFF4619F4F3D2845908B5F84A67F567F444E8C826335B0675F5060620","documentHash":"2cd83ba7-a483-4b03-b3b0-14728060cac8"}],"objectId":"625e85952467f03847f2714b","publicUri":"http://www.medycynawet.edu.pl/images/stories/pdf/pdf2022/00-artwait/2022036623.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The use and control of antimicrobial substances in animal feed – EU regulations and the risks related to their presence","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Animal feeds are routinely subject to contamination from diverse sources, including environmental pollution, activities of microbes, and veterinary drug residues.

These compounds, including triphenylmethane dyes (malachite green, crystal violet, brilliant green, ethyl violet, methyl violet 2B, pararosaniline, victoria blue B, victoria blue R, victoria pure blue BO), phenothiazine dyes (methylene blue, azure A, azure B, azure C, new methylene blue, thionine), phenoxazine dye (nile blue A), acridine dyes (acriflavine, proflavine) and xanthene dyes (rhodamine B, rhodamine 6G) constitute pharmacologically active substances (PASs). For the optimisation of sample preparation, different solid-phase extraction (SPE) sorbents and a wide range of pH (from 2 to 12) of water samples were tested. Finally, water samples were preconcentrated and cleaned up on diol SPE cartridges. Extracts were analysed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) operating in the positive electrospray ionisation (ESI+) mode. The chromatographic separation of the 20 pharmacologically active dyes was achieved within 5 min by using a pentafluorophenyl (F5) analytical column and mobile phases of ammonium acetate buffer (0.05 M, pH = 3.5) and acetonitrile with gradient elution. The developed method was validated proving to be suitable for the determination of all tested compounds.

Results: The serum contents of IgG, IgM and IgA had highly similar profiles in PDS-affected sows and healthy ones. A significantly higher concentration of IgG at 28 and 14 days ante partum compared to days 3 and 7 post partum was only observed in Group H. The mean cortisol content remained at a highly similar level throughout the entire experiment in both groups.

Environmental pollution is caused, among others, by the use of antibacterial substances on a large scale, excretion of unchanged forms of antibiotics with feces and urine, as well as fertilization of arable land with manure. The paper outlines problems resulting from the excretion of antibacterial substances by farm animals and the introduction of these substances in the form of natural or organic fertilizers into arable soils. It reviews the available publications on the presence of such substances in fertilizers and soil, as well as methods of their degradation and their influence on soil and the environment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947a878c28a0473be056","61d510b87523401fc110f98b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"78","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"173 - 183","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61d510b87523401fc110f98b","5e70947a878c28a0473be056"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478e2c","mniswId":"14214","title":"Medycyna Weterynaryjna-Veterinary Medicine-Science and Practice","issn":"0025-8628","eissn":"0025-8628","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"5f7ed625-bfbb-4d31-8464-ad34e7a26384"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["natural fertilizers","organic fertilizers","antibacterial substances","environmental pollution","soil","bacterial resistance"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172623"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709486878c28a0473bef46","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kycko","uuid":"7D908C2F077DBB366F6AE8DAA10DC3C2E43A1C47BCB4AA10A0FF662D58B4B360775EC13E3272D44922C32C4C6CC7D03FDAB8FCE4D8C634EEA4D221DD01DACF84","documentHash":"23eaf0cc-603e-452f-98ae-9a8e88ca6373"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9","name":"Monika","lastName":"Olech","uuid":"9B0A0406A7EDD36FA4801C73080BC03B173E473705A47493F0C38433544479A4BC660CBD60F16ACD61F83868583404238E4E4A1F03B9A0CA29DCC3BD5AAC93DD","orcidId":"0000-0002-8356-5423","documentHash":"0959a77d-a9cb-4a8e-bec6-b983807c59b8"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cad","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Kuźmak","uuid":"DCBC0C5773B0C346D5DBB40E3262D8E29184B62793C0D18E82B24E595E4F33FDCB74C41AEC4D6B60F253051482EC522138B936B5ED82B4345F33391A0BD19DAB","documentHash":"b123658e-4d9a-4155-9ddf-df23aa13556a"}],"objectId":"6299d8524097072c2b7a9742","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/14/4/735","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Molecular Characterization of Small Ruminant Lentiviruses Isolated from Polish Goats with Arthritis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Previous studies revealed that the small ruminant lentivirus (SRLV) population in Poland is highly heterogeneous. All SRLVs detected from Polish sheep and goats so far have belonged to subtypes B1, B2, A1, A5, A12, A13, A16, A17, A18, A23 and A24. However, all characterized strains originated from asymptomatic animals. This is the first study that characterizes the molecular properties of SRLVs isolated from different organs of six arthritic goats. Segments from three genomic regions (gag, LTR and env) were analyzed. In addition, we quantified the SRLV proviral load in the blood and different organs and examined its association with different degrees of histopathological lesions. All sequences obtained from the goats involved in this study were homogeneous, showing an average degree of variability of 4.8%, 3.7% and 8.8% for gag, LTR and env, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the sequences from the analyzed goats were clustered within SRLVs group A and formed a new subtype within this group, tentatively named A27. The histopathological examination of the lung, mammary gland, synovial membranes of joints and brain of the analyzed goats revealed evidence of inflammatory processes associated with SRLV infection, which was confirmed by positive immunohistochemistry assays. No significant correlation was observed between histological features and alterations in the sequences from different tissues. No tissue-specific signature pattern was identified. It was shown that animals with a higher proviral load showed more lesion severity in various SRLV-affected tissues, indicating a positive association between these two parameters. Our results also revealed differences in the SRLV load between animals even though the sequences derived from all of the goats were closely related, suggesting that host factors may restrict and control viral replication. This study provides new information about SRLV variants isolated from arthritic goats; however, more studies, including the isolation and characterization of biological properties of these viruses, should be performed to evaluate their pathogenic potential"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cad","5e709486878c28a0473bef46","5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1999-4915","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9","5e709486878c28a0473bef46","5e709342878c28a0473a5cad"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a80","mniswId":"20156","title":"Viruses-Basel","issn":"1999-4915","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c72f1236-b911-4c6f-9bf1-900887cba75f"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CAE","goat","lentivirus"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172632"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"608a55de9543c73526c48c68","name":"Beata","lastName":"Lachtara","uuid":"282991714039C961E3319F2426A2863D93470CCBE543F8EC7CE3808AE7F95DEC9E25A5232A45D0AAB8B01CF326F9497B266A34643AE9A696A6239B39FF83989E","documentHash":"a6cf7b97-c844-48db-a522-0850505ee499"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d66","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Wieczorek","uuid":"77FE94937137879573023F0D11FD72EFFDFDC4214863FDBF15FEEF0A6BDFD2ABA69978BCCFC9FF88D0F012F09560030758068F57DE1D27D7EB8B20C442DC9439","orcidId":"0000-0001-8268-3885","documentHash":"e54d106b-ea77-4715-815a-37b17126e9c0"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Osek","uuid":"09D7D5320F1FC606BCE9C2D945933A9AD76A02E8625F591A249FCC889F47698A9DDB27A314BD598D2BEBE05552FA565585514F11E04F6B15DA221089044711E2","orcidId":"0000-0003-2295-8837","documentHash":"6dc7582e-e613-4ee9-9ee7-81d949533982"}],"objectId":"6299bf2d4097072c2b79838c","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.866462/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Listeria monocytogenes – How This Pathogen Survives in Food-Production Environments?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is the causative agent of human listeriosis, a severe disease, especially dangerous for the elderly, pregnant women, and newborns. Although this infection is comparatively rare, it is often associated with a significant mortality rate of 20–30% worldwide. Therefore, this microorganism has an important impact on food safety. L. monocytogenes can adapt, survive and even grow over a wide range of food production environmental stress conditions such as temperatures, low and high pH, high salt concentration, ultraviolet lights, presence of biocides and heavy metals. Furthermore, this bacterium is also able to form biofilm structures on a variety of surfaces in food production environments which makes it difficult to remove and allows it to persist for a long time. This increases the risk of contamination of food production facilities and finally foods. The present review focuses on the key issues related to the molecular mechanisms of the pathogen survival and adaptation to adverse environmental conditions. Knowledge and understanding of the L. monocytogenes adaptation approaches to environmental stress factors will have a significant influence on the development of new, efficient, and cost-effective methods of the pathogen control in the food industry, which is critical to ensure food production safety."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d66","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9","608a55de9543c73526c48c68"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"866462","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9","608a55de9543c73526c48c68","5e709342878c28a0473a5d66"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d5f","mniswId":"6848","title":"Frontiers in Microbiology","issn":"1664-302X","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"afb63551-e8d3-4dc4-9e7a-1c75301b51de"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Listeria monocytogenes","stress response","food processing","bacterial persistence","molecular mechanisms","food safety"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172768"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6299cf024097072c2b7a052d","name":"Anna","lastName":"Gal-Cisoń","documentHash":"9a7c02b0-0d58-4ee5-8bbb-31b6c5c592c2"},{"objectId":"609b48fd9543c73526c48db5","name":"Anna","lastName":"Ziętek-Barszcz","uuid":"C79B25D061C888B608C52BFC9A99067A950574F010AB0F594E3D1611FFC7E6275D032D19C640A081625F3DA7A7A3B012BEA88B6BE8C9A63ED46316F6CFA6FFDF","documentHash":"e517232b-3a40-449b-8d55-4574aea8321c"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d88","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Bocian","uuid":"4239FC4F1A6A56B4C449D55C845F70D206FD0316490BE74E000F9F96750190FD162A48D60125604A3F67FE1FC3BA677DB5B766BCA6E3D70F855ED39F57117E92","orcidId":"0000-0002-8204-5856","documentHash":"c3f73129-bb4a-4ed7-aaf9-f0ea97957b91"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a660f","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Frant","uuid":"2AD73901C2B1BDDF66264197B4E2A40BB43C9F170B0D3D9252C79378D973DED6BA0DD7DB0E3F16FB50489E4717CA62BAE671805ED94AD0C5F9B3478EE3C561FE","orcidId":"0000-0002-7169-3735","documentHash":"b81b59e2-56af-4ed2-bfbe-bdf26cc5f824"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d4e","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szczotka-Bochniarz","uuid":"5A50EFE8836EA63AA5BA231195E3DDEB25840BF56F1B77D19D94CD5E6748C7E4E32CFF39CFC6D8497A6D9A3C605C8A92492E03B7B9C14044428FA1775ABD8590","documentHash":"cc1ff5e7-22b6-4115-a0ab-d029278b2b6f"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc0","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Niemczuk","uuid":"82AA2E7CCF0C6F87FC9C29C9C294AC35E29D444F944ED9F1FA82BB7FF88B5C2DF9A8411764C95A57F695D0609991E5125471404AD969DADA833F258105E54B44","orcidId":"0000-0003-1611-9770","documentHash":"a1f14ea1-835c-4507-ba6c-be8782ab8fbd"}],"objectId":"6299cf024097072c2b7a052a","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/12/9/1170","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"African Swine Fever (ASF) Trend Analysis in Wild Boar in Poland (2014–2020)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"African swine fever (ASF) is a lethal hemorrhagic disease of Suidae, i.e., domestic pigs and wild boars.

In order to analyze the changes in the molecular and serological prevalence of ASFV in wild boar population in Poland, real-time PCR and ELISA/IPT tests were conducted. In the analyzed period (2014–2020), most of the ASF-positive wild boars were molecular/virus-positive, however, over the years the percentage and the number of seropositive animals has increased. At the beginning of the epidemic, the disease was limited to a small area of the country. Since then, it has spread to new provinces of Poland. From the beginning and until today, most notifications of ASF-positive wild boars were for carcasses (passive surveillance), however, the number of serologically positive animals is still increasing.

The mechanisms presented in this review developed by the bacteria have a significant impact on reducing the ability to combat bacterial infections in humans and animals. Moreover, the high prevalence of multi-resistant strains in the environment and the ease of transmission of drug-resistance genes between the different bacterial species including commensal flora and pathogenic like foodborne pathoges (E. coli, Campylobacter spp., Enterococcus spp., Salmonella spp., Listeria spp., Staphylococcus spp.) favor the rapid spread of multi-resistance among bacteria in humans and animals. Given the global threat posed by the widespread phenomenon of multi-drug resistance among bacteria which are dangerous for humans and animals, the subject of this study is the presentation of the mechanisms of resistance in most frequent bacteria called as “foodborne pathoges” isolated from human and animals. In order to present the significance of the global problem related to multi-drug resistance among selected pathogens, especially those danger to humans, the publication also presents statistical data on the percentage range of occurrence of drug resistance among selected bacteria in various regions of the world. In addition to the phenotypic characteristics of pathogen resistance, this review also presents detailed information on the detection of drug resistance genes for specific groups of antibiotics. It should be emphasized that the manuscript also presents the results of own research i.e., Campylobacter spp., E. coli or Enetrococcus spp. This subject and the presentation of data on the risks of drug resistance among bacteria will contribute to initiating research in implementing the prevention of drug resistance and the development of alternatives for antimicrobials methods of controlling bacteria."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d66","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"1079","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709225878c28a04739098d","5e709225878c28a047390aca","5e709225878c28a047390a2b","5e709225878c28a0473909fc","5e709342878c28a0473a5d66","5e709227878c28a047390b7f","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b9bb","mniswId":"1353","title":"Antibiotics","eissn":"2079-6382","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"491ddc91-9d9f-4982-aa71-dd451a3b74fc"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058176018"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094fa878c28a0473c84a2","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Dąbrowska","uuid":"0E7227B332348FF8DC5E82EC47B887E7A0601EBFAE082C826922C3C6276B8D52F21EED1FC75D476978D68FCE27E81696EAAB5EC923869D26BE23BD1D9887989E","documentHash":"e1835c75-f191-4377-b8ef-ca4c5a6988b5"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de0","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Kochanowski","uuid":"22232E0EEDA0B86B551A138FD411D8AD5D9D0AC9E4AE59C77A6370EA12B87E7E4672884EAE5A819DD42801D310BB1EC3B47A1E2C825D4712CEAE5DAFB07121E4","documentHash":"d7c306c3-b933-482a-ade4-610f87bbba34"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c5","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Zdybel","uuid":"E1894A82CA0C5116AD0F2449FF8A8079689129491CC8714CFB197BEE9F32491A94AED5B0B0D6DDEC7673645BA92040566572EF875D09BF31AC26B015A3BDEF1D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7297-2082","documentHash":"c7678981-6c62-4d87-8594-a1ec6cd118c0"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Sroka","uuid":"D54BE4B84093A5FF9739FB665CBF54EE2891B37B53478AF0F1029745E62033C7B88C51B2D726FDAE584BE9DC2EE3F8CEA3FA851EB5B8089D8737B1A062F9CDC5","orcidId":"0000-0002-7372-7636","documentHash":"f04c53ae-faa6-4609-a0d2-57b9784ca2da"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Karamon","uuid":"6FC652281DC3E7CEE5831D48F355BCC0E37B505605D00AA8D389A74796325ECB25D4E136854D3D774EDD0E3C95277099BB6981BCE201CE127F3B8AE5C7651C14","orcidId":"0000-0002-5830-167X","documentHash":"0d343e52-20ea-4cfe-a213-5c134e4fef07"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b50","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Cencek","uuid":"7D7F433A7A31D1A4D080277B2FE49ED9F5B45115086FAEDA03BCF07F6AB6D09B61EC0E8015CEEA44A992C6D7E5DD06BB406798BF1E7065879BA9ED1F3FC8E8D3","orcidId":"0000-0003-3649-7867","documentHash":"7aa79c92-3af1-40b7-85e2-872b041c4104"}],"objectId":"62ba9d10409707490d794b56","doi":"10.3390/pathogens11050604","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/11/5/604/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Comparison Study of Four Extraction Methods Combined with PCR and LAMP for Feline Tritrichomonas foetus Detection in Fecal Samples","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Abstract: Feline trichomonosis occurs worldwide, with gastrointestinal symptoms such as chronic large-bowel diarrhea and abdominal pain. The inclusion of molecular methods in diagnostic and epidemiological studies has necessitated an effective method for extracting DNA from feces. We tested four extraction commercial kits: ZR Fecal DNA MiniPrep (50 preps) (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA), QIAamp® DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA), UltraClean Fecal DNA Kit (50 preps) (MO BIO, San Diego, CA, USA), and Sherlock AX/100 isolations (A&A Biotechnology, Gdynia, Poland). We assessed the sensitivity of detection of Tritrichomonas foetus in spiked fecal samples for the four kits combined with two molecular assays: PCR and LAMP. The extraction efficacy was quantified using defined aliquots of fecal samples spiked with 5 μL of suspensions containing serial dilutions of trophozoites (0.1; 1; 10; 100; 1000; 10,000), with six replicates for each\nconcentration. In our study, we proved that the ZR Fecal DNA MiniPrep (50 preps) kit combined with LAMP and PCR had the highest efficiency among all the compared methods for the detection of feline T. foetus from fecal samples."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de0","5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c5","5e7094fa878c28a0473c84a2","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","5e709341878c28a0473a5b50"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"604","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094fa878c28a0473c84a2","5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de0","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c5","5e709341878c28a0473a5b50"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceac","mniswId":"15767","title":"Pathogens","issn":"2076-0817","eissn":"2076-0817","documentHash":"1508288b-7046-40cc-ab52-8940553afd1b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62ba9d10409707490d794b5f","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"5","documentHash":"10d94005-be84-4f60-98e7-e1aab97f96da"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Tritrichomonas foetus","extraction methods","DNA"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185503"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60c2fd6c9543c7233654360e","name":"Adrianna","lastName":"Rudawska","uuid":"9300B2A434CF1629E06CDD08807044C54DA29093FBA0AC8017DBDE90D3E70EC1509C66ADD01A488358390A572A6FC2D5E0CBF78774A20469C8D6F29CB5F171CA","documentHash":"84cfc56e-c77e-43ea-9784-21e7ac5af9eb"},{"objectId":"5ebedbf2752340254fc41f7a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Pietruszka","uuid":"85A6F5AE644E8C724095D4D71E9BF74BB2952E2C88AC4E78684EDECB0424BF872773BEBEE710C76F7B7CBFA3BD1E71006A68D1D8DEA3A749789AF958E1F8EE3F","documentHash":"9772a87b-cdb9-4429-af2d-14548c2c0abe"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b68","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Jedziniak","uuid":"DCD8C61F090FCDB42589ECD4D30BC4F07DF1A48D10CB58D28E1887BBF8E5C91C1A764BCE5DD19D7C91FF78DF169D6B1526C1FC81E50250D50A1EF803542B7CE7","documentHash":"d2888220-8bd1-4995-b8e9-9c4b4e30d1a4"}],"objectId":"62bab1c9409707490d7a4b34","doi":"10.3390/toxins14060405","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6651/14/6/405","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"An Interlaboratory Comparison Study of Regulated and Emerging Mycotoxins Using Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry: Challenges and Future Directions of Routine Multi-Mycotoxin Analysis including Emerging Mycotoxins","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The present interlaboratory comparison study involved nine laboratories located throughout the world that tested for 24 regulated and non-regulated mycotoxins by applying their in-house LC-MS/MS multi-toxin method to 10 individual lots of 4 matrix commodities, including complex chicken and swine feed, soy and corn gluten. In total, more than 6000 data points were collected and analyzed statistically by calculating a consensus value in combination with a target standard deviation following a modified Horwitz equation. The performance of each participant was evaluated by a z-score assessment with a satisfying range of ± 2, leading to an overall success rate of 70% for all tested compounds. Equal performance for both regulated and emerging mycotoxins indicates that participating routine laboratories have successfully expanded their analytical portfolio in view of potentially new regulations.

In this study, we wanted to investigate the effect of this virus on the course of co-infection with other viruses in rainbow trout. For co-infection we used viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV) and salmonid alphavirus (SAV) field strains and infected rainbow trout divided into eight groups; I; IPNV, II; IHNV, III; VHSV, I; SAV, V; IPNV+IHNV, VI; IPNV+VHSV, VII; IPNV+SAV, and the control group. We assessed apoptosis in white blood cells and used a real time RT-PCR to analyze RNA obtained from the internal organs of the fish. During single infection and co-infection the level of expression of immune genes such as interferon and toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3) was assessed. The highest mortality during the experiment was observed in group III infected by VHSV. The average percentage of apoptotic cells was higher in groups without co-infection, especially in groups II and III. Interferon expression was higher in singly infected groups, the highest being in the heart in group III, while expression of the TLR-3 gene was generally raised in all tested organs in all groups. We found that co-infection with IPNV had a positive impact on the course of infection with the viruses listed because it lowered mortality, reduced apoptosis in co-infected cells, and positively affected fish health."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d33","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d88","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0df2","5e709437878c28a0473b83ce"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"658","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0df2","5e709437878c28a0473b83ce","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d88","5e709342878c28a0473a5d33"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceac","mniswId":"15767","title":"Pathogens","issn":"2076-0817","eissn":"2076-0817","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0aee51de-2ae0-4570-a31e-61056cf6d598"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62bab308409707490d7a6188","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"6","documentHash":"9d697207-dc2d-4214-8319-b5daa1f73b15"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["co-infection","apoptosis","propidium iodide"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058189321"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6393fd3a7523402e0617af58","name":"Iga","lastName":"Dalidowska","uuid":"56C8D67FD8F9685CD79C781D5B323A530D0AEDFF56947F40D61EE767E88AC820C4806D1EB9A2BEAAA015BF4381BB1BEBD430F4A21B908C4B2D969F3E8C7B89CF","documentHash":"c3a7b965-38a8-4a7b-8e75-66cb46baaebe"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d46","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Smreczak","uuid":"F8B30A918C22AAD1AA7AE9C5D3FFDA47CF609511E7B465B3BCBAF192AC2D6E73CBFF8ADD21B9DEBE21AC0F4F803AD82290024E1D251CA1FB5298A962E7B5045D","documentHash":"0eb77885-82a5-455a-bf63-fa54b05c12cc"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Orłowska","uuid":"31BF3815E53225FB0CCBD915D008C5800C01531C4DF23A9161299EACAECAACC43C5DEA5344E221B38BC386F46E015ADAD2196E2D56A8455B3D8E58853C8AB669","documentHash":"55bf4618-fd65-42f2-b46f-274ea3353e1c"},{"objectId":"5e70927a878c28a047396743","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Bieganowski","uuid":"393B2AB65B7BFEEA523C30F574B8E2197DBAD02546CC376C3A47E69AF3A28893F589FC79D29C6C9A1CE6D0F83BCF050354F75F192A4650FCFC099088D7C3BB82","orcidId":"0000-0002-1169-4517","documentHash":"f5aea770-1032-4eb7-87d5-183b208dc2e2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62d15c324097073a4bc8ac96","doi":"10.3390/ijms23136946","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/13/6946/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Hsp90 Activity Is Necessary for the Maturation of Rabies Virus Polymerase","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Mononegavirales is an order of viruses with a genome in the form of a non-segmented negative-strand RNA that encodes several proteins. The functional polymerase complex of these viruses is composed of two proteins: a large protein (L) and a phosphoprotein (P). The replication of viruses from this order depends on Hsp90 chaperone activity. Previous studies have demonstrated that Hsp90 inhibition results in the degradation of mononegaviruses L protein, with exception of the rabies virus, for which the degradation of P protein was observed. Here, we demonstrated that Hsp90 inhibition does not affect the expression of rabies L and P proteins, but it inhibits binding of the P protein and L protein into functional viral polymerase. Rabies and the vesicular stomatitis virus, but not the measles virus, L proteins can be expressed independently of the presence of a P protein and in the presence of an Hsp90 inhibitor. Our results suggest that the interaction of L proteins with P proteins and Hsp90 in the process of polymerase maturation may be a process specific to particular viruses."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

This is the first study to investigate the effect of experimental supplementation for calves with the combination of two feed additives-one containing Lentinula&amp;nbsp;edodes enriched with selenium (Se), and the second containing pancreatic-like enzymes, fat-coated organic acids, sodium butyrate, and silicon dioxide nanoparticles-on the serum Se concentration, selected immune parameters, and the average daily gains in the calves. During the study, the serum Se concentration was examined by means of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and the immunoglobulin and cytokine concentrations with ELISA assays. The white blood cell (WBC) count with leukocyte differentiation was examined with the use of a hematological analyzer, and the percentages of subpopulations of T lymphocytes and monocytes, phagocytic activity, and oxidative burst of monocytes and granulocytes with the use of a flow cytometer. The average daily gains of the calves were also evaluated. In summary, the supplementation of the experimental calves with the combination of two feed additives resulted in significantly higher serum Se concentrations, and the immune systems of the calves were not suppressed while the examined feed additives were being delivered. Although not statistically significant, some positive effects on the calves were seen: a tendency towards the improvement of some of the immune parameters evaluated, and a tendency for higher average daily gains in the calves."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defb","uid":"biMkjldDwyEilXl7rx-ushQ","uuid":"2c5489cb-fc19-40bb-b145-deea13bb2bfd","name":"Instytut Zootechniki - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947d878c28a0473be523"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defb","parentUuid":"2c5489cb-fc19-40bb-b145-deea13bb2bfd","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defb","rootUuid":"2c5489cb-fc19-40bb-b145-deea13bb2bfd","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

The main detection methods are based on the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In order to prevent an uncontrolled spread of ASF, new on-site techniques that can enable the identification of an early-stage disease are needed. We have developed a specific immunological SPR-based assay for ASFV antigen detection directly in liquid samples. The developed assay allows us to detect the presence of ASFV at the dose of 103 HAD50/mL."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d4e","5e709347878c28a0473a660f","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e49"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"13","pagesFromTo":"7463","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62f26777409707569c05bd1a","62f26777409707569c05bd1b","5e709347878c28a0473a660f","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4e","62f26777409707569c05bd1c","62f26777409707569c05bd1d","62f26777409707569c05bd1e","62f26777409707569c05bd1f","62f26777409707569c05bd20","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e49"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","eissn":"1422-0067","documentHash":"30236fd5-adc3-4b09-b2c8-6a106b437fa9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62bc2c9d4097070fda661c5e","year":"2022","volume":"23","number":"13","documentHash":"aaadb7ea-cf54-485a-99f9-229c44b9a630"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["African swine fever virus (ASFV)","detection","antibody","indirect ELISA test","surface plasmon resonance (SPR)"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058214096"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6253edba2467f02e69a1fd39","name":"Robin A.

The only way\nto prevent the disease is to break its epizootic chain. To ensure effective control of Trichinella spp., a range of preventive and control measures have been undertaken. These efforts have been focused on controlling Trichinella in domestic pigs, the main source of the disease. Artificial digestion is also the reference point for other methods for Trichinella risk control. Descriptive data validation of the digestion assay was presented in 1998 based on results published by scientific laboratories. Herein, we supplement those data by characterizing the method’s performance in inter-laboratory comparisons. The source of data was the results of Proficiency Testing conducted in 2015–2019. Samples were contaminated by 0, 1, 3, and 5 larvae. In total, 7580 samples were examined by the laboratories. Based on Proficiency Testing results, the main parameters characterizing the method performance in field conditions were established as follows: specificity, 97.3%; sensitivity, 86.5%; accuracy, 89.2%; uncertainty, 0.3; limit of detection (LOD), 1 larva; and limit of quantification (LOQ),\n3 larvae."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d79","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de0","5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","5e709341878c28a0473a5b50"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"525","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6259293e2467f0374481a42d","5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","6259293e2467f0374481a42f","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d79","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de0","5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","5e709341878c28a0473a5b50"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"FOODS","issn":"2304-8158","websiteLink":"https://doi.org/10.3390/foods8100467","documentHash":"ef1a9e8c-2661-4476-b116-692933ac116b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"621f4b2c2467f0747981ed27","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"4","documentHash":"559d7221-9485-4352-8ee2-01dc858ea37d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Trichinella spp.","validation","magnetic stirrer method"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058225028"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c1","name":"Monika","lastName":"Krajewska-Wędzina","uuid":"48D96FF61147929F46D201644057AF91FD057455FC10757C30FB62096A475BDC285317D0DC9C8B59939D198E75553F0070726157DEA9152E0CC73FA3968F8714","orcidId":"0000-0002-5826-2068","documentHash":"59c09ee7-3423-47a7-a7e0-af93754cdebf"}],"objectId":"625ea1302467f03847f2da08","publicUri":"https://www.lecznica-online.pl/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Znaczenie witamin w żywieniu alpak","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Ponieważ chów i hodowla alpak stają się w Polsce coraz bardziej popularne, chcielibyśmy, we współpracy z wieloma specjalistami, przybliżyć Czytelnikom Lecznicy fizjologię tego gatunku i ich problemy zdrowotne.

Little research has been done on the role of dust in the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in farms. Concentrations and potential determinants of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in farm dust are at present not known. Therefore in this study absolute ARG levels, representing the levels people and animals might be exposed to, and relative abundances of ARGs, representing the levels in the bacterial population, were quantified in airborne farm dust using qPCR. Four ARGs were determined in 947 freshly settled farm dust samples, captured with electrostatic dustfall collectors (EDCs), from 174 poultry (broiler) and 159 pig farms across nine European countries. By using linear mixed modeling, associations with fecal ARG levels, antimicrobial use (AMU) and farm and animal related parameters were determined. Results show similar relative abundances in farm dust as in feces and a significant positive association (ranging between 0.21 and 0.82) between the two reservoirs. AMU in pigs was positively associated with ARG abundances in dust from the same stable. Higher biosecurity standards were associated with lower relative ARG abundances in poultry and higher relative ARG abundances in pigs. Lower absolute ARG levels in dust were driven by, among others, summer season and certain bedding materials for poultry, and lower animal density and summer season for pigs. This study indicates different pathways that contribute to shaping the dust resistome in livestock farms, related to dust generation, or affecting the bacterial microbiome. Farm dust is a large reservoir of ARGs from which transmission to bacteria in other reservoirs can possibly occur. The identified determinants of ARG abundances in farm dust can guide future research and potentially farm management policy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d5c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"208","pagesFromTo":"112715","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["625925a42467f03744819715","625925a52467f03744819716","625925a52467f03744819717","625925a52467f03744819718","625925a52467f03744819719","625925a52467f0374481971a","625925a52467f0374481971b","625925a52467f0374481971c","625925a52467f0374481971d","625925a52467f0374481971e","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5c","625925a52467f03744819722","625925a52467f03744819723","625925a52467f03744819724","625925a52467f03744819725","625925a52467f03744819726","5e7094e4878c28a0473c62ff","5e709342878c28a0473a5d6c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b10","mniswId":"5839","title":"Environmental Research","doi":"10.1016/j.envres","issn":"0013-9351","documentHash":"32c2ca88-ff69-422c-a4dc-40a1a7e85500"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62051c2a2467f04219d1c39a","year":"2022","volume":"208","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"ae61fea4-983c-4a24-846f-9b7112e6ce61"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Dust","Antimicrobial resistance","Livestock","Risk factors","One health","Pig","Poultry","Environment"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058225298"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"625e75942467f03847f2362b","name":"Miklós","lastName":"Gyuranecz","documentHash":"5dc618fa-db7c-4d93-ad28-2627f64fd29f"},{"objectId":"625e75942467f03847f2362a","name":"Zsuzsa","lastName":"Kreizinger","documentHash":"5edbef70-ef36-40c4-b11e-77888928efa2"},{"objectId":"625e75942467f03847f23629","name":"Szilárd","lastName":"Jánosi","documentHash":"482c4af4-a39a-417b-b11b-19a35ee20394"},{"objectId":"625e75932467f03847f23628","name":"Krisztián","lastName":"Bányai","documentHash":"bf6a18af-7bd7-452e-bd67-6cbee872473b"},{"objectId":"625e75932467f03847f23626","name":"Veronika","lastName":"Hrivnák","orcidId":"0000-0002-2333-7410","documentHash":"cc31e610-9926-4830-91a3-08ab3131eb3b"},{"objectId":"625e75932467f03847f23625","name":"Alexa","lastName":"Mitter","documentHash":"bd2d67e8-906a-4b45-960e-49494aadeb4c"},{"objectId":"625e75932467f03847f23624","name":"Áron Botond","lastName":"Kovács","documentHash":"b23caa1c-03a0-4ea2-9629-d9f6cb2fe260"},{"objectId":"625e75932467f03847f23623","name":"Katinka","lastName":"Bekö","orcidId":"0000-0003-2688-5516","documentHash":"fb9290e5-3ece-45a4-b6fe-2ffa9ce089c2"},{"objectId":"625e75932467f03847f23622","name":"Dénes","lastName":"Grózner","orcidId":"0000-0002-2154-7537","documentHash":"ccc0a313-8334-4995-8658-4992d4b3a061"},{"objectId":"5e7094af878c28a0473c1b6b","name":"Anna","lastName":"Sawicka-Durkalec","uuid":"74F41A0F85AC155F46A6CCFB26EB711F025B465228066B5B84B02AC6321B340B5E150BCF2A66F7C1772D185C02BC942B7AE9B4870C2127F7D8BF9A52EE8941FA","documentHash":"bedf887e-9c8e-4e06-b951-662b20cf6e92"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d5a","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Tomczyk","uuid":"E3C5238621862F074D46922CB3B17195CE27A83F2C9C06B0BA49A69FEE2FB90EC33B4FDD96A897D15FCA91F90109B062B91A53DADD2FC97CF132051ED597C664","documentHash":"b7a3ee18-b481-4390-a3be-5aeac0b34bca"}],"objectId":"625e75932467f03847f23620","doi":"10.1016/j.vetmic.2022.109362","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0378113522000323?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Identification and detection of mutations potentially associated with decreased susceptibility to macrolides and lincomycin in Mycoplasma anserisalpingitidis isolates","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Mycoplasma anserisalpingitidis infection is associated with the inflammation of the genital tract and cloaca, embryo lethality and decreased egg production in geese, leading to serious economic losses.

There is no commercially available vaccine against M. anserisalpingitidis, thus treatment of waterfowl mycoplasmosis relies mainly on antimicrobial therapy. However, M. anserisalpingitidis isolates with decreased susceptibility to macrolides and lincomycin have been reported before. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of tilmicosin, tylosin, tylvalosin and lincomycin were determined against 82 M. anserisalpingitidis isolates originating from Hungary, Poland, China and Vietnam. Whole-genome sequence analyses revealed two mutations in the 23S rRNA coding regions and one mutation in the 50S ribosomal protein L22 coding gene possibly correlating with decreased susceptibility to the examined antibiotics. Mismatch amplification mutation assays coupled with melt analysis (melt-MAMAs) were designed to detect the nucleotide substitutions. This study is the first to describe resistance-related mutations in the goose pathogen M. anserisalpingitidis. The developed molecular assays support targeted antibiotic usage, hence their use may help to reduce the development and spread of antibiotic

The optical biosensors are based on evanescent wave technology and, in particular, on Resonant Rings (RRs) fabricated in silicon nitride. The novel biosensors were packaged in an integrated sensing cartridge that included a microfluidic channel for buffer/sample delivery and an optical fiber array for the optical operation of the PICs. Antibodies were used as molecular recognition elements (MREs) and were selected based on western blotting and ELISA experiments to ensure the high sensitivity and specificity of the novel sensors. MREs were immobilized on RR surfaces to capture viral antigens. Antibody–antigen interactions were transduced via the RRs to a measurable resonant shift. Cell culture supernatants for all of the targeted viruses were used to validate the biosensors. Resonant shift responses were dose-dependent. The results were obtained within the framework of the SWINOSTICS project, contributing to cover the need of the novel diagnostic tools to tackle swine viral diseases."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny -

Therefore, this study evaluated the performance of different commercially available selective agars for the detection of CPE using spiked pig caecal and turkey meat samples and the proposed EFSA cultivation protocol. Eleven laboratories from nine countries received eight samples (four caecal and four meat samples). For each matrix, three samples contained approximately 100 CFU/g CPE, and one sample lacked CPE. After overnight enrichment in buffered peptone water, broths were spread upon Brilliance™ CRE Agar (1), CHROMID® CARBA (2), CHROMagar™ mSuperCARBA™ (3), Chromatic™ CRE (4), CHROMID® OXA-48 (5) and Chromatic™ OXA-48 (6). From plates with suspected growth, one to three colonies were selected for species identification, confirmation of carbapenem resistance and detection of carbapenemase encoding genes, by methods available at participating laboratories. Of the eleven participating laboratories, seven reported species identification, susceptibility tests and genotyping on isolates from all selective agar plates. Agars 2, 4 and 5 performed best, with 100% sensitivity. For agar 3, a sensitivity of 96% was recorded, while agar 1 and 6 performed with 75% and 43% sensitivity, respectively. More background flora was noticed for turkey meat samples than pig caecal samples. Based on this limited set of samples, most commercially available agars performed adequately. The results indicate, however, that OXA-48-like and non-OXA-48-like producers perform very differently, and one should consider which CPE strains are of interest to culture when choosing agar type."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61de4b387523403b69b1eda7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"193","pagesFromTo":"106418","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["625927212467f03744819936","625927212467f03744819937","625927212467f03744819938","625927212467f03744819939","625927212467f0374481993a","625927212467f0374481993b","625927212467f0374481993c","625927212467f0374481993d","625927212467f0374481993e","625927212467f0374481993f","625927212467f03744819940","625927212467f03744819941","625927212467f03744819942","625927212467f03744819943","625927212467f03744819944","625927212467f03744819945","61de4b387523403b69b1eda7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478888","mniswId":"11861","title":"JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGICAL METHODS","issn":"0167-7012","documentHash":"188d1963-bed9-486a-b456-c50ac35c9b40"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"625927212467f03744819948","year":"2022","volume":"193","documentHash":"e1341b5c-965e-4030-bb11-77f729d1213d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Selective agar","Carbapenem resistance","Carbapenemases","Enterobacteriaceae","Salmonella","Animal"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058225546"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"625e988d2467f03847f2b503","name":"Agata","lastName":"Raczyńska","documentHash":"143352b7-5eda-401c-9aab-fdde52bb371e"},{"objectId":"625e988d2467f03847f2b502","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Najbar","documentHash":"c6a9a409-538d-499b-a4ba-4716cb4d32c0"},{"objectId":"625e988d2467f03847f2b501","name":"Pamela","lastName":"Turcewicz","documentHash":"a879ae82-64ed-4cae-9399-eef95d6e033c"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c1","name":"Monika","lastName":"Krajewska-Wędzina","uuid":"48D96FF61147929F46D201644057AF91FD057455FC10757C30FB62096A475BDC285317D0DC9C8B59939D198E75553F0070726157DEA9152E0CC73FA3968F8714","orcidId":"0000-0002-5826-2068","documentHash":"59c09ee7-3423-47a7-a7e0-af93754cdebf"}],"objectId":"625e988d2467f03847f2b4fe","publicUri":"https://www.vetpol.org.pl/dmdocuments/ZW-01-2022-05.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Alpaki-nowy gatunek hodowlany w Polsce.

The first part presented general knowledge about sexual dimorphism, conception and the course of pregnancy. The second part of the \"Reproduction\" describes delivery and neonatal care.\nBreeding females in good condition should give cria every or nearly every year. In alpacas, early embryonic death and early fetal death are a significant problem, therefore early pregnancy diagnosis should be confirmed by repeated ultrasound examination around 40-50 days of pregnancy and 80-90 days of pregnancy. Most parturitions take place between spring and autumn. Due to the anatomical structure of the fetus (exceptionally long neck and limbs), obstacles to parturitions often occur, therefore it is advisable to monitor the perinatal period and delivery using cameras. In the first hours after birth, the breeder should observe that the cria has standed its feet, consumed the colostrum and released meconium. The mammary glands of the female secrete colostrum 24 hours after delivery, so its supply to neonatal is very important. The survival of cria depends largely on conditions in the first few days after delivery."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947c878c28a0473be3c1"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"97","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"42-46","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947c878c28a0473be3c1","625e988d2467f03847f2b501","625e988d2467f03847f2b502","625e988d2467f03847f2b503"]},"journal":{"objectId":"64f04bfacf9a7471b0ea4134","mniswId":"201684","title":"Życie Weterynaryjne","issn":"0137-6810","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"0f017680-7d06-42bd-85cb-d40e4b8585a4"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["South American Camelids (SAC)","alpaca","reproduction","parturition","neonatal care","Poland"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058225603"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"633c0e644097074f73505106","name":"Gontarczyk","lastName":"Aneta","documentHash":"1be42b4e-cd94-4c05-bb6d-4258d968f92a"},{"objectId":"633c0e644097074f73505105","name":"Bełcik","lastName":"Aneta","documentHash":"0f8f1b61-587f-402f-af82-85efa3175930"},{"objectId":"61de4b387523403b69b1ed6b","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Samorek-Pieróg","uuid":"3783194BFCA06516ADD2AF810422352CDEE48638DA79F07D9B10911A37657F58DE0C609EFC747E042B7883145FBF805185921620D826DD200E7D3E0EF0569CEF","documentHash":"2810224a-efd7-412c-b30b-2231565a8e03"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de0","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Kochanowski","uuid":"22232E0EEDA0B86B551A138FD411D8AD5D9D0AC9E4AE59C77A6370EA12B87E7E4672884EAE5A819DD42801D310BB1EC3B47A1E2C825D4712CEAE5DAFB07121E4","documentHash":"d7c306c3-b933-482a-ade4-610f87bbba34"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d79","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Bilska-Zając","uuid":"CA37D40E9E6221954C0E1F92525EB13B265614DDB637B5261A39B130F380056543A7F0D2E0AE9B7220F35F148187F484510166AABC45E68EC5A47A105D08B099","documentHash":"fb1618f1-0e83-472f-b325-e0c87f8a8872"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Korpysa-Dzirba","uuid":"0F6E5299BA1DE2C04CCB23BB69EE8BB0AF924331950608E7B9E07C962AC58BA926288AB7400DBD5FDFA0B8F25E5B3E11F82C54FC732A0E0269E9C0A9EB906901","orcidId":"0000-0002-8266-581X","documentHash":"a20ea112-853c-4a02-89cc-69a1868143b6"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d3e","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Różycki","uuid":"EDB5A4A5E5695886180E1E731AFC64C841487D978E10D582350E1705DD7A068F0AEDC71760C9936BF219656EF91B9728C467322E45795FA2B16E89EE268A1FA8","orcidId":"0000-0002-8125-973X","documentHash":"c9364cd3-5397-46bc-bd82-22a204693887"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Karamon","uuid":"6FC652281DC3E7CEE5831D48F355BCC0E37B505605D00AA8D389A74796325ECB25D4E136854D3D774EDD0E3C95277099BB6981BCE201CE127F3B8AE5C7651C14","orcidId":"0000-0002-5830-167X","documentHash":"0d343e52-20ea-4cfe-a213-5c134e4fef07"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b50","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Cencek","uuid":"7D7F433A7A31D1A4D080277B2FE49ED9F5B45115086FAEDA03BCF07F6AB6D09B61EC0E8015CEEA44A992C6D7E5DD06BB406798BF1E7065879BA9ED1F3FC8E8D3","orcidId":"0000-0003-3649-7867","documentHash":"7aa79c92-3af1-40b7-85e2-872b041c4104"}],"objectId":"633c0e644097074f73505104","publicUri":"https://agro.icm.edu.pl/agro/element/bwmeta1.element.agro-1433a3a8-c7d0-409d-b9e7-e6045e416553","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Sytuacja epidemiologiczna włośnicy w Polsce – I półrocze 2022 r.","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this study was to present the current situation of trichinellosis, basing on the results of examination of the tissues of animals hunted in Poland.

By applying phylodynamic tools to virus sequences collected during the epidemic, we investigated when the first infections occurred, how many infections were unreported, which factors influenced virus spread, and how many spillover events occurred. HPAIV was likely introduced into poultry farms during the autumn, in line with the timing of wild birds’ migration. In Germany, Hungary, and Poland, the epidemic was dominated by farm-to-farm transmission, showing that understanding of how farms are connected would greatly help control efforts. In the Czech Republic, the epidemic was dominated by wild bird-to-farm transmission, implying that more sustainable prevention strategies should be developed to reduce HPAIV exposure from wild birds. Inferred transmission parameters will be useful to parameterize predictive models of HPAIV spread. None of the predictors related to live poultry trade, poultry census, and geographic proximity were identified as \nsupportive predictors of HPAIV spread between farms across borders. These results are crucial to better understand HPAIV transmission dynamics at the domestic–wildlife interface with the view to reduce the impact of future epidemics."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d65"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"8","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"1-10","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["633e79ff4097077179641f22","633e79ff4097077179641f23","633e79ff4097077179641f24","633e79ff4097077179641f25","633e79ff4097077179641f26","633e79ff4097077179641f27","633e79ff4097077179641f28","5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d65","633e79ff4097077179641f29","633e79ff4097077179641f2a","633e79ff4097077179641f2b","633e79ff4097077179641f2c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d5cf","mniswId":"20153","title":"Virus Evolution","issn":"2057-1577","eissn":"2057-1577","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"6187260a-4511-4184-a13e-35ff74ac3e58"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"633e79ff4097077179641f21","year":"2022","volume":"8","number":"2","documentHash":"fed8a65a-ed82-4995-bcdc-5fc48129fb3a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["phylodynamics","highly pathogenic avian influenza","virus transmission and evolution","domestic–wildlife interface"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058247208"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"633d6021409707220fbef05f","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Kalicki","documentHash":"22e79455-5324-440b-a775-90936c4e7c10"},{"objectId":"60a738179543c758682b6456","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Radulski","uuid":"884C68E493FED1FCA705BDA92235CA75DA53F5BD924591BAD3CF9461D3D197280F4C6263046E76F43689A89A7F134D7030E7702104B78A13C46FB185D087B223","documentHash":"a6aecbdf-127b-477b-a21c-1ba416c1eeba"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c1","name":"Monika","lastName":"Krajewska-Wędzina","uuid":"48D96FF61147929F46D201644057AF91FD057455FC10757C30FB62096A475BDC285317D0DC9C8B59939D198E75553F0070726157DEA9152E0CC73FA3968F8714","orcidId":"0000-0002-5826-2068","documentHash":"59c09ee7-3423-47a7-a7e0-af93754cdebf"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d55","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Szulowski","uuid":"576547A141E53A165904F3B0D29C64A4BF19FB3126FB649DBE043AEACD1C65E6EB53808DF97DD8B969FE53D26D4430A7A4832E5BBE347F01553CB9B6A0FD6C1F","documentHash":"ca545536-b374-433d-942d-d71db6c88699"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cb3","name":"Marek","lastName":"Lipiec","uuid":"99D34DD10FC128F474E1D79FE96A6FF2D2E2C9B6C3F0F51FA3B74C896A3FF1FABE620E0B34B63F850E666345D0727684A9CBB59BA79D24BAB27AEE28E98771C7","documentHash":"b42fadfc-6682-4ad6-9f5e-1ab5a8ca8147"}],"objectId":"633d6021409707220fbef05e","doi":"10.26444/aaem/145158","publicUri":"http://www.aaem.pl/pdf-145158-76544","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Pulmonary mycobacteriosis of sitatunga antelope caused by  &lt;i&gt;M. avium&lt;/i&gt; ssp. &lt;i&gt;hominissuis&lt;/i&gt;","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction and objective:\nMycobacteriosis are diseases caused by acid-fast mycobacteria other than M. leprae and tuberculous mycobacteria. Animal mycobacteriosis is often caused by M. avium ssp. hominissuis. Many species of animals are susceptible to infection with this bacterium, even those kept in Zoological Gardens. The aim of the study was to determine the species of bacterium responsible for causing the disease in the tested animals.\n\nMaterial and methods:\nTissue samples of two male sitatunga antelopes (Tragelaphus spekii) were analyzed. Lymph node and lung samples were subjected to anatomical examination and Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Real-time PCR was performed to confirm or rule out tuberculosis mycobacteria infection. In order to isolate the bacterial strain, tissue samples were inoculated on both solid and liquid media. HainLifescience CM tests, mass spectrometry and New Generation Sequencing were used to determine the mycobacterial species.\nResults:\nResults showed that atypical mycobacteria are responsible for the antelope disease. The results of the HainLifescience CM test and mass spectrometry indicated that the mycobacterium responsible for causing mycobacteriosis was M. avium. New Generation Sequencing helped to identified a subspecies that was M. avium ssp. hominissuis.\nConclusions:\nThe sitatunga antelope is an animal susceptible to infection by M. avium ssp. hominissuis. Considering the wide range of hosts and the easiness of interspecies transmission of the pathogen, as well as its zoonotic nature, the mycobacteriosis induced by this microorganism should not be underestimated."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d55","5e709342878c28a0473a5cb3","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c1","60a738179543c758682b6456"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"220-223","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60a738179543c758682b6456","633d6021409707220fbef05f","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c1","5e709342878c28a0473a5cb3","5e709342878c28a0473a5d55"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547705a","mniswId":"1204","title":"Annals of Agricultural and Environmental Medicine","issn":"1232-1966","eissn":"1232-1966","documentHash":"b31b4b25-9a38-44f0-af3e-954c16558214"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cff45740970733e795137e","year":"2022","volume":"29","number":"2","documentHash":"2111501a-c703-4369-b6ef-cde9b47a46fe"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["zoonosis","mycobacteriosis","M. avium ssp. hominissuis","sitatunga antelope"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058247222"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"633d3f56409707220fbb7934","name":"Martin","lastName":"Löchelt","documentHash":"0928ef77-97f1-485d-b217-9733247fafff"},{"objectId":"61d510b87523401fc110f98b","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Osiński","uuid":"E22F565289E96FFCC790C3308B040EACB2014326B501B5584615FF116FC560A28AE9E18D03E00DCF6D65AC2D936D26FA7601EAB0455821EA61DAE48F80069623","documentHash":"93775440-a1c8-4c66-9841-5b6d3406f789"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d3c","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Rożek","uuid":"2BAB6A780316EFAAEC320E5E97DE5D890B7DFDE6551280034295D7F59E9A180EE8C421F5E30C72D662E7E7773800F0F26871C9E41F0D0A2C369158F5326F233A","documentHash":"3bf29025-fb55-4f72-8572-1e655c2f0494"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d34","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Rola","uuid":"CA7CCA550D77B38C39C512D0BF1E1DD989B16A76C798CB003E76583649A413F1CC14D38A1D3A86639806ABD695B555AEFBBA4519ACEEB3448008E1F7F45415DE","documentHash":"9968525a-6722-4aa3-9451-1d6ca31f42fa"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cb7","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Materniak-Kornas","uuid":"62F3AC42F6F58B8EB3F647DB6DE655B54F3BC6DFBD2CEC8FF5E8F98D6A4E462083AD785F23F6EC0001353AC886D27CAF632723E964667D4E121A978657CA445C","orcidId":"0000-0002-2795-597X","documentHash":"850a4011-29f0-4e0d-8626-d7a604886193"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cad","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Kuźmak","uuid":"DCBC0C5773B0C346D5DBB40E3262D8E29184B62793C0D18E82B24E595E4F33FDCB74C41AEC4D6B60F253051482EC522138B936B5ED82B4345F33391A0BD19DAB","documentHash":"b123658e-4d9a-4155-9ddf-df23aa13556a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"AUGUST","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"633d3a77409707220fb92a3e","doi":"10.3390/v14091973","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/14/9/1973/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Occurrence of Equine Foamy Virus Infection in Horses from Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Equine foamy virus (EFVeca) is a foamy virus of non-primate origin and among the least-studied members of this retroviral subfamily. By sequence comparison, EFVeca shows the highest similarity to bovine foamy virus. In contrast to simian, bovine or feline foamy viruses, knowledge about the epidemiology of EFVeca is still limited. Since preliminary studies suggested EFVeca infections among horses in Poland, we aimed to expand the diagnostics of EFVeca infections by developing specific diagnostic tools and apply them to investigate its prevalence. An ELISA test based on recombinant EFVeca Gag protein was developed for serological investigation, while semi-nested PCR for the detection of EFVeca DNA was established. 248 DNA and serum samples from purebred horses, livestock and saddle horses, Hucul horses and semi-feral Polish primitive horses were analyzed in this study. ELISA was standardized, and cut off value, sensitivity and specificity of the test were calculated using Receiver Operating Characteristic and Bayesian estimation. Based on the calculated cut off, 135 horses were seropositive to EFVeca Gag protein, while EFVeca proviral DNA was detected in 85 animals. The rate of infected individuals varied among the horse groups studied; this is the first report confirming the existence of EFVeca infections in horses from Poland using virus-specific tools."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d3c","5e709342878c28a0473a5d34","5e709342878c28a0473a5cb7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"1973","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cb7","5e709342878c28a0473a5d3c","5e709342878c28a0473a5d34","61d510b87523401fc110f98b","633d3f56409707220fbb7934","5e709342878c28a0473a5cad"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a80","mniswId":"20156","title":"Viruses","issn":"1999-4915","eissn":"1999-4915","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses","documentHash":"204f8987-0c7c-441b-9f4a-748747147d4e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"633be3ad4097074f734d4961","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"9","documentHash":"d6c030d5-95ee-41df-a420-c9eff2aedbad"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["equine foamy virus","horses","diagnostics","ELISA","PCR","prevalence"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058247441"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6299d7ae4097072c2b7a903e","name":"Heike","lastName":"Schmitt","documentHash":"c367407d-c5b4-41b7-817c-184ac3d1c34a"},{"objectId":"6299d7ae4097072c2b7a903d","name":"Lidwien A.

We present a comparison of ARG abundance across various animal species, production environments and humans in Europe. AMR variation sources were quantified. The correlation of ARG abundance between qPCR data and previously published metagenomic data was assessed.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted in nine European countries, comprising 9572 samples. qPCR was used to quantify abundance of ARGs [aph(3′)-III, erm(B), sul2, tet(W)] and 16S rRNA. Variance component analysis was conducted to explore AMR variation sources. Spearman’s rank correlation of ARG abundance values was evaluated between pooled qPCR data and earlier published pooled metagenomic data. ARG abundance varied strongly among animal species, environments and humans. This variation was dominated by between-farm variation (pigs) or within-farm variation (broilers, veal calves and turkeys). A decrease in ARG abundance along pig and broiler production chains (‘farm to fork’) was observed. ARG abundance was higher in farmers than in slaughterhouse workers, and lowest in control subjects. ARG abundance showed a high correlation (Spearman’s ρ > 0.7) between qPCR data and metagenomic data of pooled samples. qPCR analysis is a valuable tool to assess ARG abundance in a large collection of livestock-associated samples. The between-country and between-farm variation of ARG abundance could partially be explained by antimicrobial use and farm biosecurity levels. ARG abundance in human faeces was related to livestock antimicrobial resistance exposure."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094e4878c28a0473c62ff","5e709342878c28a0473a5d6c","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-11","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6299d7ae4097072c2b7a902b","6299d7ae4097072c2b7a902c","6299d7ae4097072c2b7a902d","6299d7ae4097072c2b7a902e","6299d7ae4097072c2b7a902f","6299d7ae4097072c2b7a9030","5e7094e4878c28a0473c62ff","6299d7ae4097072c2b7a9032","6299d7ae4097072c2b7a9033","6299d7ae4097072c2b7a9034","6299d7ae4097072c2b7a9035","6299d7ae4097072c2b7a9036","6299d7ae4097072c2b7a9037","6299d7ae4097072c2b7a9038","6299d7ae4097072c2b7a9039","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5c","6299d7ae4097072c2b7a903b","6299d7ae4097072c2b7a903c","6299d7ae4097072c2b7a903d","6299d7ae4097072c2b7a903e","5e709342878c28a0473a5d6c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478463","mniswId":"10126","title":"JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOTHERAPY","issn":"0305-7453","eissn":"1460-2091","documentHash":"0a5ecdd0-c22b-41e9-beb5-792cbe17a4d3"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6299d7ae4097072c2b7a9041","year":"2022","documentHash":"a337107d-1e18-4e63-85df-b0ce1cd7e867"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["resistance","qPCR"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058264649"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebedd26752340254fc424a4","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Opolska","uuid":"F2D203374927E61071F70F279457FCDEFEFE43BE99759D0541924DC75911D6F4794D79CB30CDB551FAF5825A4196644915458A253C5026E78037ED49D228FDE3","documentHash":"53883f6c-5a56-4112-822e-536e165a956c"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0def","name":"Anna","lastName":"Lisowska","uuid":"DACDB5B33E016683B6C3AE247380BF2E5EC908115FAF7C45643A476F1F28A8371F1D6B6411BC388B5BCEC61BDF90732F3C336AD8313EA5CCA4D909A17D46412C","documentHash":"92988d97-a378-4a23-94cb-76d9a9e67f4a"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c3","name":"Anna","lastName":"Pikuła","uuid":"A283B6B2F9E05F2D0E1FAEE12806ECE15D9CABC0E6866E08C1F96C30B82D46ACBF225A28ACC0ACEC7D764DBABA3C442150A97FD6381E3F12E114994BBE205BFB","documentHash":"7e3962ab-978c-4183-9b98-9dd234001dd8"},{"objectId":"5e7093f1878c28a0473b3c5c","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Sajewicz-Krukowska","uuid":"DDB7A0F5B8C8D5B834B319010AF5032BC9DF8CAE6291DFE20CCC4DE2DF7DBD0E6BD0D557C21141F5A30E0A757284EFFCAF42A80CBDACCECA72FA564F58754E0F","documentHash":"bba12a9c-3a4d-4dac-8be6-fd85904df577"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b5a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Domańska-Blicharz","uuid":"44C5DFE3C33AA49F72079D496E2377ECFB06FF9CECAF80BDDBA1D06D13EA5BC0296FA0DF1BE18E01648F10BC82C3BF11F8D0520B236A22625EBD476B49E108A6","orcidId":"0000-0002-0642-3931","documentHash":"be2eaa91-303e-4813-a127-8bc4b12d6232"}],"objectId":"6299d5824097072c2b7a5aa2","publicUri":"https://mdpi-res.com/d_attachment/viruses/viruses-14-01023/article_deploy/viruses-14-01023.pdf?version=1652264537","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Molecular epidemiology of turkey coronaviruses in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The only knowledge of the molecular structure of European turkey coronaviruses (TCoVs) comes from France.

Out of the 648 flocks tested, 65 (10.0%, 95% CI: 7.9–12.6) were positive for TCoV and 16 of them were molecularly characterized. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains belonged to two clusters, one formed by the early isolates identified at the beginning of the TCoV monitoring (from 2009 to 2010), and the other, which was formed by more recent strains from 2014 to 2019. Our analysis of the changes observed in the deduced amino acids of the S1 protein suggests the existence of three variable regions. Moreover, although the selection pressure analysis showed that the TCoV strains were evolving under negative selection, some sites of the S1 subunit were positively selected, and most of them\nwere located within the proposed variable regions. Our sequence analysis also showed one TCoV strain had recombined with another one in the S1 gene. The presented investigation on the molecular feature of the S gene of TCoVs circulating in the turkey population in Poland contributes interesting data to the current state of knowledge."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebedd26752340254fc424a4","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0def","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c3","5e7093f1878c28a0473b3c5c","5e709341878c28a0473a5b5a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1023","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709341878c28a0473a5b5a","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0def","5ebedd26752340254fc424a4","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c3","5e7093f1878c28a0473b3c5c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a80","mniswId":"20156","title":"Viruses-Basel","issn":"1999-4915","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c72f1236-b911-4c6f-9bf1-900887cba75f"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["coronavirus","Poland"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058264652"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"633be81c4097074f734da1d1","name":"Skubida","lastName":"Piotr","documentHash":"6d475094-051a-4ea3-9b0c-f6213c3e9997"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e48","name":"Marta","lastName":"Skubida","uuid":"A2A69BE989F80F23F32F1DB1CB68CE647F38A2402005378958F5A41359FE7BBEC2AB7F944815C263E0B0F701EDE6B1470E30D2C52AD49E1425649716A89425B0","documentHash":"df08bfcc-d2a3-473b-b0e4-d2e106fddaaa"}],"objectId":"633be81c4097074f734da1d0","publicUri":"https://miesiecznik-pszczelarstwo.pl/numer/lipiec-2022","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Sprawozdanie z 59.

Additionally, there is a group of arboviruses that, although important for animal breeding, are not a direct threat for human health. Those include, e.g., Schmallenberg, bluetongue, or African swine fever viruses. This review focuses on arboviruses and their major vectors: mosquitoes, ticks, biting midges, and sandflies.

When applied to soil, both thep-CA-based formulation and Porter 250 EChad a similar overall effect on soil fungal communities and significantly altered the structure of fungal communities at all of thetimes examined. Shifts in the fungal community composition concerned less than 2% of the total number of amplicon sequencevariants (ASVs). The strongest impact of the formulations on soil microbiota was recorded at the fourth week of treatment. TwoASVs assigned toBotrytisandChromelosporium,known as plant pathogens, and an unidentified ASV fromDiversisporalesencompassing the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), were significantly depleted in soil samples treated withp-CA in compar-ison with Porter 250 EC.CONCLUSION: Thep-CA-based preparation has the potential to be used as an alternative to synthetic fungicides. It shows a sim-ilar effect to Porter 250 EC on the organization of soil communities, determining changes in the character of the communities offungi in general, at any given time. Moreover,p-CA caused a reduction in ASVs belonging toBotrytisandChromelosporium(plant pathogens) and ASVs ofDiversisporales(containing arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) in comparison with the commercialcompound that was analyzed"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709341878c28a0473a5b68"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-11","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["633bd65c4097074f734b6e23","633bd65c4097074f734b6e24","633bd65c4097074f734b6e25","633bd65c4097074f734b6e26","633bd65c4097074f734b6e27","633bd65c4097074f734b6e28","633bd65c4097074f734b6e29","633bd65c4097074f734b6e2a","5e709341878c28a0473a5b68","5ebedbf2752340254fc41f7a","5e7092bc878c28a04739bd05"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478b75","mniswId":"13005","title":"JOURNAL OF THE SCIENCE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE","issn":"0022-5142","eissn":"1097-0010","documentHash":"bae31be1-8118-4225-9495-62970f7707dd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62987de34097075714384c10","year":"2022","documentHash":"4e02b130-a598-4a53-ac69-59a1059900c7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["natural substances","antifungal activity","plant pathogen"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058265263"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6299dab64097072c2b7aa3c1","name":"Rafael","lastName":"Mateo","orcidId":"0000-0003-1307-9152","documentHash":"04503dd0-0e1a-4e3f-a961-cca3e50919a4"},{"objectId":"6299dab64097072c2b7aa3c0","name":"Judit E.G.","lastName":"Smits","documentHash":"f73d0383-9b3c-4c64-86ed-812b36797d6d"},{"objectId":"6299dab64097072c2b7aa3bf","name":"Jennifer","lastName":"Pareja-Carrera","orcidId":"0000-0003-0194-5527","documentHash":"b781e75d-2e88-4e1f-8d4d-5ff61a02910f"},{"objectId":"6299dab64097072c2b7aa3bd","name":"Mónica","lastName":"Martínez-Haro","orcidId":"0000-0002-4326-5805","documentHash":"1603ef55-e523-47f2-8194-792e52e6c9ea"},{"objectId":"5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d47","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Nawrocka","uuid":"EBE32826F2491E214CA0AFC4EEA02786FEA4A499AF027659085E6926AF5823B364154DB516E1E0DDAF195E1E849947670A95C606ADD8B170A79D3E1144B3DE3B","documentHash":"53491847-cc60-4f79-bb1f-a22d3a13c011"},{"objectId":"5e70947e878c28a0473be61c","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Durkalec","uuid":"1F7C624B21B309061D407671A4CA819E68A789AA0443FA4D45E7A6CA85687562613BB0F346CE23AEF5FB6B8919CA94C2ECC7E7A582126B60E457F2A00005BFCC","orcidId":"0000-0001-6036-7953","documentHash":"da7b2a40-70f8-4ffd-8232-e71aa0b1808e"}],"objectId":"6299dab64097072c2b7aa3ba","doi":"10.1016/j.envres.2022.113575","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0013935122009021?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Factors influencing lead, mercury and other trace element exposure in birds from metal mining areas","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Non-ferrous metal mining is considered one of the largest sources of toxic metal released to the environment and may threaten ecosystems, notably biota. We explored how birds that inhabit non-ferrous metal mining sites are exposed to mercury, lead, and other trace elements by analyzing their feathers and verifying which factors may influence element concentrations in feathers. We sampled a total of 168 birds, representing 26 species, with different feeding habits and migration patterns in a non-polluted reference site and two historical metal mining areas: Almad´en, which is considered one of the most heavily mercury-contaminated sites worldwide, and the Sierra Madrona mountains where lead has been mined since ancient times. The quantification of aluminum (Al), arsenic (As), barium (Ba), beryllium (Be), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), mercury (Hg), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), selenium (Se), thorium (Th), thallium (Tl), uranium (U), vanadium (V) and zinc (Zn) was performed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Feather analysis revealed contamination by Hg and Pb, in Almad´en and Sierra Madrona, respectively. We found that granivorous birds had the lowest feather Hg levels compared to those found in omnivorous, insectivorous, and piscivorous species, whereas feather Pb was about twice as high in granivores and omnivores, than in insectivorous and piscivorous birds. We also found differences among study sites in 13 elements and confirmed the influence of feather age, migratory patterns of the birds, and external deposition of elements, on metal concentrations in the feathers. Our results highlight that despite the cessation of metal mining in the study areas, local avifauna are being exposed to Hg and Pb from abandoned mines and old tailings sites, indicating that appropriate measures are needed to protect biota from overexposure to these toxic metals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947e878c28a0473be61c","5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d47"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"212","pagesFromTo":"113575","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947e878c28a0473be61c","6299dab64097072c2b7aa3bd","5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d47","6299dab64097072c2b7aa3bf","6299dab64097072c2b7aa3c0","6299dab64097072c2b7aa3c1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b10","mniswId":"5839","title":"Environmental Research","doi":"10.1016/j.envres","issn":"0013-9351","documentHash":"32c2ca88-ff69-422c-a4dc-40a1a7e85500"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6299dab64097072c2b7aa3c3","year":"2022","volume":"212","documentHash":"06fe78b6-feb1-44c3-8401-0e8313218df5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Feathers","Trace elements","Toxic elements","Mining activities","Feeding habits","External deposition"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058265303"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b5b","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Dudek","uuid":"1C236F39CBEBF0222678F951AF88B126D140208B5163B55E8C071114CA662533C5091A9A508F004E10111CC585F5B5B8960B4FE4DD6655438133A4486E6B6E7B","orcidId":"0000-0002-3271-3748","documentHash":"82e1f788-1bf1-4bd4-a410-133526ffd169"}],"objectId":"6299c7fb4097072c2b79c7ce","publicUri":"https://agro.icm.edu.pl/agro/element/bwmeta1.element.dl-catalog-556d7a1e-4dad-4d0f-a18d-ede77ff81c59","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Mycoplasma bovis a syndrom oddechowy bydła","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Przez długi czas bakteria ta uważana była jedynie za wtórny czynnik etiologiczny syndromu oddechowego bydła, odpowiedzialnego za znaczące straty w hodowli tego gatunku zwierząt.

A total of 5,577.8 tons were sold in 2020 for\nanimal treatment, including 5,507.7 tons used for food production animals, which was 5.6% more as compared to 2019. In Poland, 856.7 tons were sold, making 15.4% of total European antimicrobials consumption. EMA has developed a unit of measurement to monitor antibiotic use and sales across Europe as mg/PCU, where PCU means Population Correction Unit, and takes into account the animal population as well as the estimated weight of each particular animal at the time of treatment with antibiotics. Differences of sales of various antimicrobial classes between the countries (mean is 89.0 mg/PCU) in Europe was observed, from 2.3  mg/PCU in Norway to 393.9  mg/PCU in Cyprus (187.9  mg/PCU in Poland). These values show that between 2020  and 2021  in Europe and in Poland antibiotics use has increased 5.9% and 1.9%, respectively The largest proportions of the sold antimicrobials were accounted for penicillins (31.1%; 27.7  mg/PCU), tetracyclines (26.7%; 23.8  mg/PCU), and sulfonamides (8.8%; 6.4 mg/PCU). For the antimicrobials classes from the list of critically important antibiotics with highest priority in human medicine, namely 3rd and 4th generation of cephalosporins  fluoroquinolones, other quinolones, and polymyxins, the sales for food-producing animals accounted for 0,2%, 2.6%, 0.2%, and 2.8%, of the total sales in the 31 countries in 2020  respectively. In Poland, the highest consumption\nof antimicrobials were noted for penicillins (61.1 mg/PCU), tetracyclines (45.3 mg/PCU), and macrolides (24.8 mg/PCU). For the period 2011–2020, an overall decline in sales of 43.2% was observed, from 161.4 mg/PCU in 2011 to 91.6 mg/PCU in 2020. During this period, sales decreased by more than 5% in 19 countries  whereas in four others sales increased by more than 5%, including Poland, where a total increase from 126.3 mg/PCU in 2011 to 197.9 mg/PCU in 2020 was noted.

and Planning of a Transdisciplinary Investigation into Farmland Pollinators: Rationale, Co-Design, and Lessons Learned","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"To provide a complete portrayal of the multiple factors negatively impacting insects in agricultural landscapes it is necessary to assess the concurrent incidence, magnitude, and interactions among multiple stressors over substantial biogeographical scales. Trans-national ecological field investigations with wide-ranging stakeholders typically encounter numerous challenges during the design planning stages, not least that the scientific soundness of a spatially replicated study design must account for the substantial geographic and climatic variation among distant sites. ‘PoshBee’ (Pan-European assessment, monitoring, and mitigation of Stressors on the Health of Bees) is a multi-partner transdisciplinary agroecological project established to investigate the suite of stressors typically encountered by pollinating insects in European agricultural landscapes. To do this, PoshBee established a network of 128 study sites across eight European countries and collected over 50 measurements and samples relating to the nutritional, toxicological, pathogenic, and landscape components of the bees’ environment. This paper describes the development process, rationale, and end-result of each aspect of the of the PoshBee field investigation. We describe the main issues and challenges encountered during the design stages and highlight a number of actions or processes that may benefit other multi-partner research consortia planning similar large-scale studies. It was soon identified that in a multi-component study design process, the development of interaction and communication networks involving all collaborators and stakeholders requires considerable time and resources. It was also necessary at each planning stage to be mindful of the needs and objectives of all stakeholders and partners, and further challenges inevitably arose when practical limitations, such as time restrictions and labour constraints, were superimposed upon prototype study designs. To promote clarity for all stakeholders, for each sub-component of the study, there should be a clear record of the rationale and reasoning that outlines how the final design transpired, what compromises were made, and how the requirements of different stakeholders were accomplished. Ultimately, multi-national agroecological field studies such as PoshBee benefit greatly from the involvement of diverse stakeholders and partners, ranging from field ecologists, project managers, policy legislators, mathematical modelers, and farmer organisations. While the execution of the study highlighted the advantages and benefits of large-scale transdisciplinary projects, the long planning period emphasized the need to formally describe a design framework that could facilitate the design process of future multi-partner collaborations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy

This pilot study evaluates two tests based on detecting cellular immunity for this purpose: interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) and tuberculin skin test (TST). Ten animals were subjected to ante-mortem and post-mortem examinations. IGRA was performed using a commercial test, and the comparative TST was performed in the eyelids. The lesions were assessed post-mortem and material was collected for mycobacterial culture. The isolated strains were subjected to genotyping. At post-mortem examination, five out of ten individuals demonstrated both tuberculous lesions and positive culture results (Mycobacterium caprae).

Infection with BVDV causes a disease with a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, most often mild, although infections with this virus constitute a serious economic problem all over the world. The virus is characterized by a high genetic variability, while the accumulation of single mutations leads to the formation of its new variants. The aim of this study was to better understand the complicated pathogenesis of this disease at the molecular level via the analysis of the transcriptome of cells infected with this virus. The bovine kidney cell line (MDBK), the cytopathic (cp) reference strain, and two non-cytopathic (ncp) BVD virus field strains were used in transcriptomic studies. The cell transcriptome was tested 24 and 72 h after infection. The results of the microarray analysis revealed changes in the expression levels of numerous genes. Genes with changed expression as a result of infection with the cp strain caused changes in the expression levels of a large number of genes and enriched a number of pathways. Genes with increased expression levels were enriched among other pathways involved in the cell cycle, while genes with reduced expression levels enriched pathways mostly related to metabolism. Genes with increased expression levels as a result of infection with ncp strains enriched a much smaller number of pathways, among them, pathways related to signaling activity 24 h post-infection and serine biosynthetic pathways both 24 and 72 h post-infection. Pathways enriched by genes with reduced expression levels were related to the innate immune response (72 h post-infection) or metabolism (24 and 72 h post-infection). The results of microarray studies can help us to better understand the host’s response to BVDV infection"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d2c","5e709342878c28a0473a5cad","5e709342878c28a0473a5d36","60c3400e9543c72336544275"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"1276","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c3400e9543c72336544275","5e709342878c28a0473a5d36","5e709342878c28a0473a5cad","5e709342878c28a0473a5d2c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a80","mniswId":"20156","title":"Viruses","issn":"1999-4915","eissn":"1999-4915","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses","documentHash":"204f8987-0c7c-441b-9f4a-748747147d4e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62baba47409707490d7ac3b2","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"6","documentHash":"07b1b457-1532-421d-8f74-93fdeacb7ada"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bovine viral diarrhea virus","microarrays","transcriptome","cell culture"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058289464"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62bab4ce409707490d7a8dc9","name":"Max","lastName":"Hansen","documentHash":"758c3d9c-bb21-4baf-938b-d8a6025b330b"},{"objectId":"62bab4ce409707490d7a8dc8","name":"Jens Jørgen","lastName":"Sloth","documentHash":"b00e7efa-4ca0-4cd8-b281-269b2ec10db4"},{"objectId":"62bab4ce409707490d7a8dc7","name":"Heidi","lastName":"Amlund","documentHash":"733ea384-5b7c-4d88-b66e-8bf04923aeb6"},{"objectId":"62bab4ce409707490d7a8dc6","name":"Lucas","lastName":"Givelet","documentHash":"a25ba223-b42d-4a68-8a48-248245f2fb9a"},{"objectId":"5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d5f","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"0CF56F05BC1444EC145C3F9F0244C34241EA3CE9FB305488E439778D5EDD3A940A6ECE07460B993634F9796A71C9C4319F62AE41108C670F05C6624E05EEA4EC","orcidId":"0000-0001-5960-8254","documentHash":"d89286dd-bb34-4422-b2fa-1ad1323c6916"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"MAY","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"62bab4ce409707490d7a8dc3","doi":"10.2903/j.efsa.2022.e200410","publicUri":"https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.2903/j.efsa.2022.e200410","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Risk assessment of rare earth elements, antimony, barium, boron, lithium, tellurium, thallium and vanadium in teas","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"n recent years, a great intensification in the use of various elements especially in modern technologycan be observed. However, the anthropogenic activities, including industrialisation, urbanisation orintensive agriculture, have led to the release of many of the elements into the environment. Theconsequence of the accumulation of the elements both in soil and water systems is their presence inthe food chain. Inhalation and consumption of the contaminated food and beverages have beenindicated as the main pathways of the exposure to many elements. Due to the fact, that tea isconsidered the second most popular beverage worldwide and its consumption is constantly increasing,it is crucial to evaluate the safety of the product, especially for toxic elements contamination. Thus,the aim of the project was to evaluate the contamination levels of rare earth elements (REEs) includinglanthanides, scandium (Sc) and yttrium (Y) and also antimony (Sb), barium (Ba), boron (B), lithium(Li), tellurium (Te), thallium (Tl) and vanadium (V) in teas.

We propose contrasting hypotheses for this emergence: (i) resident viruses have been maintained, presumably in wild birds, in northern Europe throughout the summer of 2021 to cause some of the outbreaks that are part of the most recent autumn/winter 2021 epizootic, or (ii) further virus variants were reintroduced by migratory birds, and these two sources of reintroduction have driven the HPAI resurgence. Viruses from these two principal sources can be distinguished by their hemagglutinin genes, which segregate into two distinct sublineages (termed B1 and B2) within clade 2.3.4.4b, as well as their different internal gene compositions. The evidence of enzootic HPAI virus circulation during the summer of 2021 indicates a possible paradigm shift in the epidemiology of HPAI in

Under the supervision of EUCAST representatives, this working group adapted the CLSI M45 document to the ISO 20776 standard after testing and validation. These adaptations included the comparison of various culture media, culture conditions and AST methods. A Standard Operation Procedure was derived and an interlaboratory validation was performed in order to evaluate the method. The results showed pros and cons for both of the two methods but also indicate that it is not necessary to abandon Mueller–Hinton without additives for the AST of B. melitensis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy

describe the susceptibility of Escherichia coli to medically important antibiotics, collected over four periods (2004–2006, 2008–2009, 2013–2014, 2017–2018), from food-producing animals at slaughter. Intestinal contents from cattle, pigs and broilers were randomly sampled (5–6 countries/host; ≥4 abattoirs/country; one sample/animal/farm) for isolation of Escherichia coli; antimicrobial susceptibilities were centrally determined by CLSI agar dilution. Clinical breakpoints (CLSI) and epidemiological cut-off values (EUCAST) were applied for data interpretation.  In total, 10 613 E. coli strains were recovered.In broilers, resistance percentages were the lowest (P ≤ 0.01) in the latest time period. A significant decrease in MDR over time was also observed for broilers and a tendency for a decrease for pigs. Resistance to meropenem and tigecycline was absent, and resistance to azithromycin was 0.2%–2.0%. Also, low resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (1.1%–7.4%) was detected in broilers. Resistance to colistin varied between 0.1%–4.8%. E. coli from broilers showed high resistance to ciprofloxacin (7.3%–23.3%), whereas for cattle and pigs this was 0.2%–2.5%. Low/moderate resistance to chloramphenicol (9.3%–21.3%) and gentamicin (0.9%–7.0%) was observed in pigs and broilers. The highest resistance was noted for ampicillin (32.7%–65.3%), tetracycline (41.3%–67.5%), trimethoprim (32.0%–35.7%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (27.5%–49.7%) from pigs and broilers, with marked country differences. MDR peaked in pigs and broilers with 24 and 26 phenotypes, with 21.9%–26.2% and 18.7%–34.1% resistance, respectively.\nIn this pan-EU survey antibiotic susceptibility of commensal E. coli varied largely between antibiotics, animal species and countries. Resistance to critically important antibiotics for human medicine was absent or low, except for ciprofloxacin in broilers and ampicillin in pigs and broilers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094e4878c28a0473c62ff"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"77","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"3301-3311","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6391a39c40970764e07bbd70","6391a39c40970764e07bbd71","6391a39c40970764e07bbd72","6391a39c40970764e07bbd73","6391a39c40970764e07bbd74","6391a39c40970764e07bbd75","6391a39c40970764e07bbd76","6391a39c40970764e07bbd77","6391a39c40970764e07bbd78","5e7094e4878c28a0473c62ff","6391a39c40970764e07bbd79","6391a39c40970764e07bbd7a","6391a39c40970764e07bbd7b","6391a39c40970764e07bbd7c","6391a39c40970764e07bbd7d","6391a39c40970764e07bbd7e","6391a39c40970764e07bbd7f","6391a39c40970764e07bbd80","6391a39c40970764e07bbd81","6391a39c40970764e07bbd82"]},"journal":{"objectId":"60e72a2d2467f01e930e7d31","title":"Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy","issn":"0305-7453","eissn":"0305-7453","documentHash":"2c947f04-31f4-4130-95d0-68ade9f2870b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"638f23464097074044829c38","year":"2022","volume":"77","number":"12","documentHash":"501c5d19-3cdc-40a3-968e-1890358617f6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["European-wide antimicrobial resistances","Escherichia coli","healthy food animals"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058327939"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63907c3a409707120cc79e7d","name":"Yang","lastName":"Wang","documentHash":"42434b2a-4cbf-42b3-9f71-3923a6edb86b"},{"objectId":"63907c3a409707120cc79e7c","name":"Yongsheng","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"77f3b106-5468-475c-a916-0290407d02d8"},{"objectId":"63907c3a409707120cc79e7b","name":"Alexei D.","lastName":"Zaberezhny","documentHash":"a3339fba-5958-4e2c-8b92-6f7d64b7fa1a"},{"objectId":"63907c3a409707120cc79e7a","name":"Luoyi","lastName":"Zhou","documentHash":"1aa8897e-8b77-4a96-8153-341604ed808a"},{"objectId":"63907c3a409707120cc79e79","name":"Xiaoyun","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"d34891f9-6a34-442a-8d80-6c1c5a9e2692"},{"objectId":"63907c3a409707120cc79e78","name":"Qian","lastName":"Hou","documentHash":"f6208670-05b0-42f9-bba4-4ea67c07fa3e"},{"objectId":"63907c3a409707120cc79e77","name":"Yanjun","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"cc060f59-d9cc-43a2-9b29-9d6eb9a1a881"},{"objectId":"63907c3a409707120cc79e76","name":"Weibing","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"7ed5d897-c984-4123-90e7-2b4f9a2781b4"},{"objectId":"63907c3a409707120cc79e75","name":"Yaozhong","lastName":"Ding","documentHash":"6e1c5410-a6b2-471c-8ddb-33b2606a5677"},{"objectId":"63907c3a409707120cc79e74","name":"Danian","lastName":"Chen","documentHash":"dbc36cba-b282-4d61-97d1-6f490d6662c1"},{"objectId":"63907c3a409707120cc79e73","name":"Yunwen","lastName":"Ou","documentHash":"1ae1e305-6337-4ed8-80b0-1e3401c08adf"},{"objectId":"63907c3a409707120cc79e72","name":"Miaomiao","lastName":"Li","documentHash":"872466f5-13e5-4b07-a138-002120b18606"},{"objectId":"63907c3a409707120cc79e71","name":"Jie","lastName":"Zhang","documentHash":"d610f1a3-f489-4392-bb02-930a38278b96"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d4e","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szczotka-Bochniarz","uuid":"5A50EFE8836EA63AA5BA231195E3DDEB25840BF56F1B77D19D94CD5E6748C7E4E32CFF39CFC6D8497A6D9A3C605C8A92492E03B7B9C14044428FA1775ABD8590","documentHash":"cc1ff5e7-22b6-4115-a0ab-d029278b2b6f"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d2b","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Podgórska","uuid":"E3FB69D94109DE92198EBFBF30082B9458237A6355B9B21E100A6D5262E9777DA40BE545D81C14FC07F65384997084D970796E443AA1A69EAC58466E8C2C753D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7608-6926","documentHash":"c4be02d5-d46e-4de6-bfe4-e316c6deb58d"}],"objectId":"63907c3a409707120cc79e70","doi":"10.3389/fmicb.2021.758064","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.758064/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Development and Clinical Validation of a Potential Penside Colorimetric Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Assay of Porcine Circovirus Type 3","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"abk","content":"Porcine circovirus type 3 (PCV3), a novel circovirus, imposes great burdens on the global pig industry. The penside tests for detecting PCV3 are critical for assessing the epidemiological status and working out disease prevention and control programs due to the unavailability of a commercial vaccine. A one-step molecular assay based on visual loop-mediated isothermal amplification (vLAMP) was developed for simple and rapid detection of PCV3. We compared its sensitivity and specificity with TaqMan quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and applied the developed assay in the epidemiological study of (n = 407) pooled swine sera collected from almost the entire mainland China during the years 2017–2018. We also explored the feasibility of the vLAMP assay for detecting raw samples without a prior DNA isolation\nstep to expand its application capability. Results showed that the vLAMP assay could reliably detect the PCV3 cap gene with a detection limit of 10 DNA copies equal to that of the Taqman qPCR assay. In the epidemiological study, the PCV3 positive detection rate for 407 swine pooled sera detected by the vLAMP assay was 37.35% (152/407), whereas it was 39.01% (159/407) for Taqman qPCR. For the detection method without genome extraction, the results kept satisfactory specificity (100%) but displayed lower sensitivity (100% for CT < 32), indicating the direct detection is not sensitive enough to discriminate the samples with low viral loads. The one-step vLAMP is a convenient, rapid, and cost-effective diagnostic for penside detection and will enable the epidemiological surveillance of PCV3, which has widely spread in mainland China"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d2b","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63907c3a409707120cc79e71","63907c3a409707120cc79e72","63907c3a409707120cc79e73","63907c3a409707120cc79e74","63907c3a409707120cc79e75","63907c3a409707120cc79e76","63907c3a409707120cc79e77","63907c3a409707120cc79e78","63907c3a409707120cc79e79","63907c3a409707120cc79e7a","5e709342878c28a0473a5d2b","63907c3a409707120cc79e7b","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4e","63907c3a409707120cc79e7c","63907c3a409707120cc79e7d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d5f","mniswId":"6848","title":"Frontiers in Microbiology","doi":"","issn":"1664-302X","eissn":"1664-302X","websiteLink":"http://www.frontiersin.org/Microbiology","documentHash":"deb1269d-858f-44fd-b8a6-ceb480f729b8"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6218d3732467f05591fbe022","year":"2022","volume":"12","documentHash":"1d385ed6-0ea6-411e-98fc-b50564058ce2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["vLAMP","PCV3","diagnosis","penside","one-step"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058328074"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0ddf","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kaupke","uuid":"BB4CD2E891EE29C149E16224967B6459994EDA1FD1864612676536B0873CAF6716213A6EA983883AB4AB95E3FDCD1257ABD4434268B52114615B9242AA80452C","orcidId":"0000-0003-2930-9346","documentHash":"aea3f641-2f16-497b-ad21-2822cc05a109"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d41","name":"Artur","lastName":"Rzeżutka","uuid":"96C85B61D3E6BA3657F0A0E04C8CE4A1016EFBE59FEB907FB5C3839E3A19929363BE5F9B8C71F56D60D507D45A0D3B09927E0D5EF05EB658908558DB427DC4C1","orcidId":"0000-0001-6301-1143","documentHash":"2a5cb6f9-9a99-43f2-80dc-4cb29ef3c1cf"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"JULY","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"62f26be7409707569c05d608","doi":"10.1186/s12917-022-03328-y","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12917-022-03328-y.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Population genetics of Cryptosporidium parvum subtypes in cattle in Poland: the geographical change of strain prevalence and circulation over time","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) is a cosmopolitan parasite that infects various livestock animals including cattle. Microsatellite typing tools for identification of C. parvum subtypes are currently employed to better understand the species-specific epidemiology of cattle cryptosporidiosis. The aim of this study was to analyse the population genetics of C. parvum strains infecting cattle and recognise geographical distribution and time-span correlations in subtype prevalence in Poland. In total, 1601 faecal samples were collected from 2014 to 2018 from healthy cattle from dairy, meat and mixed breeds at the age of 1 week to 4 months. The 267 farms visited were randomly selected and represented all Polish provinces. PCR-RFLP based identification of C. parvum at the 18 small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) locus was performed, followed by strain subtyping by GP60-PCR. \nResults: The overall prevalence of C. parvum in Polish cattle was estimated at 6.2% (100/1601). Animals below the age of 1 month were the major host for this parasite. Excluding one breed, that of dairy-meat mixed, there were no significant differences observed between breed and presence of C. parvum infections (95% TPIAll breeds: 1.67–73.53%; POPR=0.05 - 0.95). Infected animals were detected in 15 out of 16 Polish provinces, with significant regional prevalence differences (Kruskal–Wallis rank sum test, Kruskal–Wallis χ2 = 13.46, p<0.001). When the population genetics of C. parvum strains were analysed, 11  parasite subtypes from the IIa and IId genetic families were identified. Compared to other parasite strains, IIaA17G1R1 and IIaA17G2R1 appeared at statistically significantly higher frequency (F-test, F = 3.39; p=0.0003). The prevalence of C. parvum subtypes in cattle was breed-related (Chi-squared test, χ2 = 143.6; p<0.001). \nConclusions: The analysis of the population genetics of C. parvum subtypes showed that strains from the IIa subtype family predominated in the tested cattle population. However, relations in changes of subtype prevalence and circulation over time were observed. They were associated with the disappearance of some strains and emergence of new variants from the same genetic family in different geographical locations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0ddf","5e709342878c28a0473a5d41"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0ddf","5e709342878c28a0473a5d41"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454773ef","mniswId":"2654","title":"BMC Veterinary Research","issn":"1746-6148","eissn":"1746-6148","documentHash":"683390a3-50fd-4f46-8874-f21aaa628b82"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e135162467f00328bfab4c","year":"2022","volume":"18","number":"1","documentHash":"4193b97a-6889-4332-99f3-7387205b9b6f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cryptosporidium","parvum","cattle","prevalence","molecular","detection","subtyping","population","genetics"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058328118"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62f26a19409707569c05d09b","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Bełcik","documentHash":"ccc71e56-cc36-4452-94fb-89c96b386140"},{"objectId":"62f26a19409707569c05d09a","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Włodarczyk","documentHash":"58e0b6a5-c252-47cc-834d-f6f33da2254f"},{"objectId":"62f26a19409707569c05d099","name":"Lesław","lastName":"Sobieraj","documentHash":"088dac28-05fe-4895-843f-7f0a56d7202d"},{"objectId":"62f26a19409707569c05d098","name":"Adam","lastName":"Brzana","documentHash":"c3d4db28-a996-423a-b758-177562145334"},{"objectId":"61de4b387523403b69b1ed6b","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Samorek-Pieróg","uuid":"3783194BFCA06516ADD2AF810422352CDEE48638DA79F07D9B10911A37657F58DE0C609EFC747E042B7883145FBF805185921620D826DD200E7D3E0EF0569CEF","documentHash":"2810224a-efd7-412c-b30b-2231565a8e03"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Korpysa-Dzirba","uuid":"0F6E5299BA1DE2C04CCB23BB69EE8BB0AF924331950608E7B9E07C962AC58BA926288AB7400DBD5FDFA0B8F25E5B3E11F82C54FC732A0E0269E9C0A9EB906901","orcidId":"0000-0002-8266-581X","documentHash":"a20ea112-853c-4a02-89cc-69a1868143b6"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Sroka","uuid":"D54BE4B84093A5FF9739FB665CBF54EE2891B37B53478AF0F1029745E62033C7B88C51B2D726FDAE584BE9DC2EE3F8CEA3FA851EB5B8089D8737B1A062F9CDC5","orcidId":"0000-0002-7372-7636","documentHash":"f04c53ae-faa6-4609-a0d2-57b9784ca2da"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Karamon","uuid":"6FC652281DC3E7CEE5831D48F355BCC0E37B505605D00AA8D389A74796325ECB25D4E136854D3D774EDD0E3C95277099BB6981BCE201CE127F3B8AE5C7651C14","orcidId":"0000-0002-5830-167X","documentHash":"0d343e52-20ea-4cfe-a213-5c134e4fef07"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b50","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Cencek","uuid":"7D7F433A7A31D1A4D080277B2FE49ED9F5B45115086FAEDA03BCF07F6AB6D09B61EC0E8015CEEA44A992C6D7E5DD06BB406798BF1E7065879BA9ED1F3FC8E8D3","orcidId":"0000-0003-3649-7867","documentHash":"7aa79c92-3af1-40b7-85e2-872b041c4104"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"JULY","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"62f26a19409707569c05d096","doi":"10.3390/pathogens11080835","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/11/8/835/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Molecular Confirmation of Taenia crassiceps Cysticercosis in a Captive Ring-Tailed Lemur (Lemur catta) in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Abstract: (1) Background: Taenia crassiceps is a cosmopolitan tapeworm endemic to the northern hemisphere with an indirect lifecycle. Its definitive hosts are carnivores, and its intermediate hosts are rodents and rabbits. Nonhuman primates in zoos appear to be highly susceptible to T. crassiceps cysticercosis. The aim of this study was to confirm the presence and the molecular characterization of T. crassiceps cysts isolated from a captive ring-tailed lemur. (2) Methods: Surgery revealed multifocal, transparent saccules containing several thin-walled tapeworm cysticerci. In some of the metacestodes,\nsingle or multiple exogenous buds from daughter cysticerci were spotted. A molecular analysis was performed to confirm our morphological examinations, using two protocols to obtain the partial nad1 and cox1 genes of the Taenia sp. (3) Results: On the basis of morphological features and molecular analysis, the cysticerci were identified as T. crassiceps metacestodes, and products taken from the PCRs were sequenced. With respect to interpreting the sequencing results of the obtained amplicons, we compared them with data in the GenBank database, proving that, in this case, the causative agent was indeed T. crassiceps.

We conducted a semi-field experiment to examine the single and interactive effects of the novel insecticide flupyradifurone (FPF) and nutritional stress on fitness proxies in the solitary bee Osmia bicornis. Individually marked bees were released into flight cages with monocultures of buckwheat, wild mustard or purple tansy, which were assigned to an insecticide treatment (FPF or control) in a crossed design. Nutritional stress, which was high in bees foraging on buckwheat, intermediate on wild mustard and low on purple tansy, modulated the impact of insecticide exposure. Within the first day after application of FPF, mortality of bees feeding on buckwheat was 29 times higher compared with control treatments, while mortality of FPF exposed and control bees was similar in the other two plant species. Moreover, we found negative synergistic impacts of FPF and nutritional stress on offspring production, flight activity, flight duration and flower visitation frequency. These results reveal that environmental policies and risk assessment schemes that ignore interactions among anthropogenic stressors will fail to adequately protect bees and the pollination services they provide."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709486878c28a0473bef2a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"289","issue":"1984","pagesFromTo":"20221013","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6391a6f440970764e07bfa3a","6391a6f440970764e07bfa3b","6391a6f440970764e07bfa3c","6391a6f440970764e07bfa3d","6391a6f440970764e07bfa3e","6391a6f440970764e07bfa3f","5e709486878c28a0473bef2a","6391a6f440970764e07bfa40","6391a6f440970764e07bfa41","6391a6f440970764e07bfa42","6391a6f440970764e07bfa43","6391a6f440970764e07bfa44","6391a6f440970764e07bfa45"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c2851454793ab","mniswId":"16564","title":"Proceedings of the Royal Society.

In turn, particularly at the farm and policy level, this leads to misunderstandings, low acceptance, poor implementation, and thus suboptimal biosecurity along the food ani- mal production chain. Moreover, different views on BSMs affects making comparisons both at the policy level as well as in the scientific community. Therefore, as part of the One Health EJP BIOPIGEE project, a work group i) collected and discussed relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria for measures to be considered in the context of biosecurity and ii) conducted a systematic literature review for potentially existing definitions for the term BSM. This exercise confirmed the lack of a definition of BSM, underlining the importance of the topic. In the pool of articles considered relevant to defining the term BSM, specific research themes were identified. Based on these outcomes, we propose a definition of the term BSM: “A biosecurity measure (BSM) – is the implementation of a segregation, hygiene, or management procedure (excluding medically effective feed additives and preventive/curative treatment of animals) that specifically aims at reducing the probability of the introduction, establishment, survival, or spread of any potential pathogen to, within, or from a farm, operation or geographical area.” The definition provides a basis for policymakers to identify factual BSMs, highlights the point of imple- mentation and supports to achieve the necessary quality standards of biosecurity in food animal production. It also enables clear, harmonized, cross-sectoral communication of best biosecurity practices to and from relevant stakeholders and thus contribute to improving biosecurity and thereby strengthen the One Health approach."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d6f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"100433","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63907b75409707120cc7897d","63907b75409707120cc7897e","63907b75409707120cc7897f","63907b75409707120cc78980","63907b75409707120cc78981","63907b75409707120cc78982","63907b75409707120cc78983","63907b75409707120cc78984","5e709342878c28a0473a5d6f","63907b75409707120cc78985","63907b75409707120cc78986","63907b75409707120cc78987","63907b75409707120cc78988"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5b878c28514547ce22","mniswId":"15405","title":"One Health","issn":"2352-7714","eissn":"2352-7714","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"a24a4141-5e31-403b-8ccf-d414f3a83d69"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63907b75409707120cc7897c","year":"2022","volume":"15","documentHash":"b26898b0-a5eb-4fa6-a611-04f986a65064"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Biosecurity","One Health","Livestock","swine","Zoonotic disease prevention"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058346633"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63d1d90b4097071d34b9d7ea","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Anusz","documentHash":"1287be93-5e3e-4c53-8875-441daec3bf5f"},{"objectId":"63d1d90b4097071d34b9d7e8","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Cuper","documentHash":"de67458e-c27b-42ce-b352-9c497f7ac3c8"},{"objectId":"63d1d90b4097071d34b9d7e7","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Filip-Hutsch","documentHash":"51131fa8-eac5-460c-89c7-9566bc553b60"},{"objectId":"63d1d90b4097071d34b9d7e6","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Nowak","documentHash":"930b68a2-c55f-4816-ad2d-119736ee6cd3"},{"objectId":"63d1d90b4097071d34b9d7e5","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Żmuda","documentHash":"c0c26c4a-0777-4f24-a3ec-97609bac41a1"},{"objectId":"63d1d90b4097071d34b9d7e4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Didkowska","documentHash":"eaa443c0-30ef-480a-bdff-85208adb8140"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be87a","name":"Blanka","lastName":"Orłowska","uuid":"611F08B84589B99368A3A9FFF46E87EC3DB64A8E39C44A7D885305577D29E1680C59647824724EE8668AA0A0BB07901566FD2E97B4F7CCEB8234D1BD387A441F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6599-3582","documentHash":"7bf0b459-a078-469d-ac63-9723dfe2bc50"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c1","name":"Monika","lastName":"Krajewska-Wędzina","uuid":"48D96FF61147929F46D201644057AF91FD057455FC10757C30FB62096A475BDC285317D0DC9C8B59939D198E75553F0070726157DEA9152E0CC73FA3968F8714","orcidId":"0000-0002-5826-2068","documentHash":"59c09ee7-3423-47a7-a7e0-af93754cdebf"}],"objectId":"63908d02409707120cc9f51f","doi":"10.24425/pjvs.2022.142032","publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/dlibra/publication/142032/edition/124385/content","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Suspicion of bovine tuberculosis in sheep in the Małopolskie Voivodeship (southern Poland)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Bovine tuberculosis (BTB) in sheep (Ovis aries) is caused by Mycobacterium bovis and \r\nMycobacterium caprae. Even though sheep have been considered less sensitive to BTB than \r\nother ruminants, they have been subject to increasing numbers of tuberculosis cases and it has \r\nbeen suggested that they may act as a disease reservoir in some regions. Aim of the study: \r\nFollowing a report of tuberculous-like gross lesions (repeated cases of purulent or caseous lymphadenitis and a single case of serosal tubercles on the peritoneum) from veterinarians working \r\nin a slaughterhouse in the Małopolskie Voivodeship, southern Poland, the aim of this study was \r\nto conduct ante-mortem BTB diagnostics in three flocks with suspected BTB. The animals for \r\ntesting were selected randomly from the flocks; a blood sample for interferon-γ release assay \r\n(IGRA) and a single tuberculin skin test (TST) was performed on each sheep.

We present a case of contamination of free-range eggs that is previously unreported in the literature. The aim of our study was a source investigation after finding a high level of PCDD/Fs in samples of eggs from one of the inspected farms. Samples of hens’ eggs, muscles, and livers and the feeds and soils were analyzed. The results showed that the soil samples taken from the paddock contained high concentrations of PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs expressed as toxic equivalents (TEQ) (72.9 ± 18.2 pg WHO-TEQ g−1 dry mas (d.m.)) and a high concentration of NDL-PCBs (207 ± 46.9 ng g− 1 d.m.). The investigation found that the cause of the soil contamination was oil leaking from the farm’s tractor engine. The oil contained very high concentrations of PCDD/F and DL-PCBs (1013 ± 253 pg WHO-TEQ g− 1 oil) and 5644 ng g− 1 of NDL-PCBs. The source of the contamination was confirmed by the similarity of the PCDD/F and PCB profiles in the hen eggs and the soil contaminated by engine oil. The dietary intake of toxins resulting from consumption of the eggs is provided. For children, the consumption of contaminated eggs would result in an intake of double the tolerable weekly intake (TWI), while for adults, it would be approx. 60–70% of TWI."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny -

Rules for the carcasses sampling of species susceptible to Trichinella spp. infection and examination are laid down in Commission Regulation 1375/2015, where the magnetic stirrer method for pooled-sample digestion is recommended (Commission Regulation 1478/2020). All personnel involved in the examination should be properly trained and participate in quality control programs. Proficiency tests (PTs) play a key role in the quality verification process. This paper presents the results of PTs organized for 68 Polish laboratories in 2014–2019. Results were assessed qualitatively at three levels of sample contamination (0, 3, 5 larvae) and quantitatively at one level (5 larvae). The laboratories have achieved the average correct qualitative results 100%, 96.2% and 96.8% for the samples contaminated with 0, 3 and 5 larvae, respectively. In the quantitative evaluation, an average 94.1% of the reported results were correct. The data from PTs enabled us to define, for the first time, validation parameters of the digestion method for the horse meat matrix in a large-scale experiment including: specificity (100%), sensitivity (95.6%), accuracy (97.1%), the limit of detection (LOD) (1.14 ≈ 1) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) (3.42 ≈ 3)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d79","63983ca4409707085965ef00","63983ca4409707085965ef01","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de0","61de4b387523403b69b1ed6b","5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","5e709341878c28a0473a5b50"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d3e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","issue":"21","pagesFromTo":"14356","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d3e","5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","63983ca4409707085965ef00","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d79","63983ca4409707085965ef01","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de0","61de4b387523403b69b1ed6b","5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","63983ca4409707085965ef02","63983ca4409707085965ef03","5e709341878c28a0473a5b50"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","issn":"1660-4601","eissn":"1660-4601","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"bad4d5e4-600e-403a-9e35-0edb9dd89452"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"635796264097072c1f9eebac","year":"2022","volume":"19","number":"21","documentHash":"f95a714f-56c2-478c-8da3-fe117a4d8338"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["horse meat","proficiency tests","Trichinella spp.","Validation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058360586"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094dd878c28a0473c59a4","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Łopatek","uuid":"9866727E1F8C364999BF9AB3860220A98654BDE82FF2A8FDD3190FFECF025FCC3B267E2CCAC2DE32511A24F090AA869A1F2D261353DFE1CECDDD35D7C476A0E5","orcidId":"0000-0002-7071-0839","documentHash":"3a51f646-3043-4bfc-beb6-9d3bfd2694ce"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d66","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Wieczorek","uuid":"77FE94937137879573023F0D11FD72EFFDFDC4214863FDBF15FEEF0A6BDFD2ABA69978BCCFC9FF88D0F012F09560030758068F57DE1D27D7EB8B20C442DC9439","orcidId":"0000-0001-8268-3885","documentHash":"e54d106b-ea77-4715-815a-37b17126e9c0"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Osek","uuid":"09D7D5320F1FC606BCE9C2D945933A9AD76A02E8625F591A249FCC889F47698A9DDB27A314BD598D2BEBE05552FA565585514F11E04F6B15DA221089044711E2","orcidId":"0000-0003-2295-8837","documentHash":"6dc7582e-e613-4ee9-9ee7-81d949533982"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"NOVEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"63984f54409707085967a768","doi":"10.3390/foods11213521","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/11/21/3521/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Prevalence and Antimicrobial Resistance of Bacterial Foodborne Pathogens Isolated from Raw Bivalve Molluscs Subjected to Consumption in Poland during a Ten-Year Period","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiological contamination of raw bivalve molluscan shellfish (BMS) available on the Polish market and determinate the antimicrobial resistance of the obtained isolates. A total of 1000 mollusc samples were tested for the presence of Salmonella spp., L. monocytogenes, V. parahaemolyticus, and S. aureus using the ISO standard methods. Additionally, the bacterial isolates’ susceptibility to antimicrobials was determined using the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method. The obtained results showed that Salmonella spp. was detected in 31 (3.1%) samples, and 51.6% of the bacterial isolates were classified as Salmonella Typhimurium. A total of 74.2% of the Salmonella isolates were sensitive to all antimicrobial agents, whereas three isolates were multiresistant. L. monocytogenes was isolated from 18 (1.8%) BMS, and the isolates belonged to serogroups IIa, IIb, and IVb. Most of them were resistant to ceftriaxone (77.8%) and oxacillin (55.6%). V. parahaemolyticus was present in 24.2% BMS. These isolates were mainly resistant to ampicillin (77.3%) and streptomycin (64.0%). Moreover, 15.2% of the bivalve molluscs were contaminated with S. aureus. Most isolates belonging to this species were resistant to penicillin (84.9%). A total of 60 (6.0%) bivalve molluscs were contaminated with more than one pathogen simultaneously. In addition, the tested bacteria were more likely to be identified during the warmer period (53.9%) compared to the samples analyzed in colder months (35.7%). The obtained results indicate that raw bivalve molluscs from the Polish market are frequently contaminated with bacterial foodborne pathogens, which may be resistant to antimicrobials."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094dd878c28a0473c59a4","5e709342878c28a0473a5d66","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"21","pagesFromTo":"3521","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d66","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9","5e7094dd878c28a0473c59a4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"Foods","issn":"2304-8158","eissn":"2304-8158","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"827d8888-1217-4c9f-a068-b8a2e5756417"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6362635a4097072c44ac512b","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"21","documentHash":"0212fe73-3d22-434c-8955-423a984395d9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["foodborne pathogens","raw bivalve molluscs","prevalence","antimicrobial resistance"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058364730"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c6","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Szacawa","uuid":"DD43CD53336D1E5297A82642902BD389F928A8486E324B79CBA86546EB4532E8DB8BFFC5C8D38396248D3DC10B3EF1780F09FA0DEC786C12A0A0BDA76B446C17","orcidId":"0000-0003-1815-5724","documentHash":"ff75ac41-419e-43d3-8b98-82ee0c2db7c8"},{"objectId":"5e709437878c28a0473b83ce","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Wasiak","uuid":"A60741B2F6C44684B8210C6BD88CE38D65085F1FEA69C024C4C683AD43FB6C5E3603FFD8A7EA6613888E258108EABBC0F2F5DA5B9D13E30D9BFCFA81627948F0","orcidId":"0000-0002-2279-5460","documentHash":"afe435e4-1c3d-46e2-8a2a-f6b817d9bd81"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d33","name":"Michał","lastName":"Reichert","uuid":"4394EEC51A6B6D1F4DFCB1A7C07A5F8A251A042E9BCA371EAAA432AFE6A8EE1872E16213AA074CCC239D3E7A1034FC416FD93B99D94E0730A905E1D770B3DC27","documentHash":"9da7cc50-be87-4406-af94-e5a72d0e6a2e"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b5b","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Dudek","uuid":"1C236F39CBEBF0222678F951AF88B126D140208B5163B55E8C071114CA662533C5091A9A508F004E10111CC585F5B5B8960B4FE4DD6655438133A4486E6B6E7B","orcidId":"0000-0002-3271-3748","documentHash":"82e1f788-1bf1-4bd4-a410-133526ffd169"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b2e","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Bednarek","uuid":"AA380B7BF0343A0E6141C8BEB7A3A3EBA04C0325698ADAC0767395B7733F03E24AC85A07BDC4328B7A7E130BDBCB2936B49228B3631DD800F1FFE3014F1E0747","documentHash":"32d8ef0b-98a5-4824-a096-10d65df496a1"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"NOVEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"6398509b409707085967e212","doi":"10.3390/pathogens11111317","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/11/11/1317/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The Effect of Pegbovigrastim Injection on Phagocytic and Oxidative Burst Activities of Peripheral Blood Granulocytes and Monocytes in Calves Challenged with Mycoplasma bovis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Mycoplasma bovis (M. bovis) is an important pathogen affecting cattle, causing various diseases including pneumonia which mainly occurring in calves. Control of M. bovis infections is difficult due to the lack of commercial vaccines in most parts of the world and increasing trends of antimicrobial resistance in field isolates of the pathogen; therefore, it seems reasonable to look for new solutions for the prevention of the infection. Pegbovigrastim is a pegylated form of naturally occurring circulating cytokine in cattle that affects bovine leukocytes and some cell functions. Most studies on pegbovigrastim have focused on reducing the occurrence of mastitis and other diseases occurring during the periparturient period in cows, while this study attempts to use pegbovigrastim in the prevention of respiratory diseases in calves, which are largely caused by M. bovis. Based on previous observations on the immunostimulatory properties of pegbovigrastim in cattle, for the first time, the effect of its injection on the number and phagocytic and oxidative burst activities of peripheral blood granulocytes and monocytes in calves experimentally infected with M. bovis was investigated. Pegbovigrastim administration in the calves significantly stimulated an increase in peripheral blood granulocyte and monocyte counts and phagocytic activity of the cells, especially granulocytes, which was also generally expressed in the course of M. bovis infection. In response to pegbovigrastim administration, a general increase in the oxygen burst activity of the cells was observed. This effect was also shown despite ongoing infection with M. bovis which, taken together, may indicate a beneficial effect of pegbovigrastim injection on the immunity of the affected animals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d33","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c6","5e709341878c28a0473a5b2e","5e709341878c28a0473a5b5b","5e709437878c28a0473b83ce"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"1317","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947c878c28a0473be3c6","5e709437878c28a0473b83ce","5e709341878c28a0473a5b2e","5e709342878c28a0473a5d33","5e709341878c28a0473a5b5b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceac","mniswId":"15767","title":"Pathogens","issn":"2076-0817","eissn":"2076-0817","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0aee51de-2ae0-4570-a31e-61056cf6d598"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63778b3e40970701fd41bee3","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"11","documentHash":"1528ac6f-f914-4c1b-b674-9dba206d9ab3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Mycoplasma bovis","calves","pegbovigrastim","phagocytic activity","oxidative burst","granulocytes","monocytes"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058365278"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"609baaf79543c73526c48dd8","name":"Anna","lastName":"Madejska","uuid":"CFB35C6A933AC3A2AC658068C54F9F909CF3B709B089227DCFE1F8223D2EA78E2D174ED555AAA2A97E5F4D4CFD65A2912784223D9769A088827AD6A69ABCAB9E","documentHash":"73de5337-1cce-4a17-8f5f-c45bbc2b327f"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e0f","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Pawul-Gruba","uuid":"FAB3C7BA0DC0C247826838CFCAF7B2449A21A8C4A953A2ADF2FAF02A582252A6A745E3BCB7FCD176E498498BE263763EAC78FB21885EAFB488C611988B165460","documentHash":"26f2d3ce-5484-4a5a-95cc-e213858f3584"},{"objectId":"5e709486878c28a0473bef2a","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kiljanek","uuid":"7B8EE9A0E65E07520912836B1EE79CA197A21E4DC1CD1DF337A2F539C881566E8B7ED89405D31A6EE523CE4147368897A0A0017AD0DF9642E78CCFE22BEB224A","orcidId":"0000-0001-7222-0983","documentHash":"15e05adf-9642-4726-8587-72bd29897624"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Osek","uuid":"09D7D5320F1FC606BCE9C2D945933A9AD76A02E8625F591A249FCC889F47698A9DDB27A314BD598D2BEBE05552FA565585514F11E04F6B15DA221089044711E2","orcidId":"0000-0003-2295-8837","documentHash":"6dc7582e-e613-4ee9-9ee7-81d949533982"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"NOVEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"639869e840970708596a35fa","doi":"10.3390/molecules27238194","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/23/8194/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Development of a High Performance Liquid Chromatography with Diode Array Detector (HPLC-DAD) Method for Determination of Biogenic Amines in Ripened Cheeses","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Biogenic amines (BAs) are organic, basic nitrogenous compounds formed during the decarboxylation of amino acids. A method for the determination of eight biogenic amines (tryptamine, 2-phenyletylamine, putrescine, cadaverine, histamine, tyramine, spermidine, spermine) in ripened cheeses was developed and validated. Cheese samples with the addition of internal standards were extracted with 0.2 M perchloric acid and pre-column derivatized with dansyl chloride at 60 °C for 15 min, purified with toluene and dried under a stream of nitrogen. The samples were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography with diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). The method was validated with the BAs at three concentration levels: 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, respectively. The obtained values of correlation coefficient (R2) ranged at 0.9997–0.9998 for all of compounds.

Several thousand people die each year of infections by the  rabies virus (RABV). Oral rabies vaccination (ORV) of wildlife was successfully implemented in many European countries and led to rabies being brought under control there. In Poland, ORV was introduced in 1993 using vaccines containing an attenuated strain of the rabies virus. However, attenuated rabies viruses may have residual pathogenicity and cause the disease in target and non-target animals. Material and Methods: A red fox carcass was tested as part of national rabies surveillance, and its brain was screened for RABV infection using two conjugates and a fluorescent antibody test (FAT). The rabies virus was isolated in mouse neuroblastoma cells by rabies tissue culture infection test (RTCIT), and viral RNA was detected by heminested reverse transcriptase PCR  (hnRT-PCR)  as  well  as  by  quantitative  real-time  RT-PCR  (rtRT-qPCR).  An  amplicon  of  600  bp  was  subjected  to  Sanger sequencing.  To  differentiate  between  vaccine  and  field  RABV  strains,  PCR-restriction  fragment  length  polymorphism  (PCR-RFLP) using the Dra I, Msp I, Nla IV and Mbo II restriction endonucleases was performed. Results: The rabies virus  was detected in the fox’s brain using FAT,  RTCIT  and  molecular  tests.  The  PCR-RFLP  revealed  of  vaccine-induced  rabies,  and  full-length genome analysis showed 100% nucleotide sequence identity of the isolate with the reference sequences of Street Alabama Dufferin Bern (SAD Bern) vaccine strains and other vaccine-induced rabies virus isolates detected in animals and deposited in GenBank. Conclusion: We detected vaccine-induced rabies for the first time in Poland in a fox during routine rabies surveillance"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cc4","5e709342878c28a0473a5d46","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"66","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"473-477","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d46","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc4","63ad8bf74097070d11c00331","63ad8bf74097070d11c00332","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5b","63ad8bf74097070d11c00333"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebffdcead49b31ccece4fb3","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research","issn":"2450-8608","documentHash":"287fa6d2-77d3-4359-b58d-23d047d5d8d7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"636a1f574097073ba70ff96a","year":"2022","volume":"66","number":"4","doi":"","documentHash":"8257bc00-3a3e-4273-aba5-7fe23cc68ccc"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fox","rabies","SAD Bern","vaccine-induced rabies","sequencing"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058371462"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63ad843a4097070d11becbef","name":"Marta","lastName":"Demkowska-Kutrzepa","documentHash":"2f530bcf-41ff-4066-81ca-adda0df3d082"},{"objectId":"63ad843a4097070d11becbee","name":"Monika","lastName":"Roczeń-Karczmarz","documentHash":"d2e4adf9-608c-4654-a0af-55cf7c30197f"},{"objectId":"63ad843a4097070d11becbed","name":"MAGDALENA","lastName":"Włodarczyk-Ramus","documentHash":"6191b9b1-4b6d-422b-96bc-fece93c49d21"},{"objectId":"63ad843a4097070d11becbec","name":"aLEKSANDRA","lastName":"Kominek","documentHash":"5fe708dd-b7c9-40d0-8416-dc67df25cceb"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c5","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Zdybel","uuid":"E1894A82CA0C5116AD0F2449FF8A8079689129491CC8714CFB197BEE9F32491A94AED5B0B0D6DDEC7673645BA92040566572EF875D09BF31AC26B015A3BDEF1D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7297-2082","documentHash":"c7678981-6c62-4d87-8594-a1ec6cd118c0"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Karamon","uuid":"6FC652281DC3E7CEE5831D48F355BCC0E37B505605D00AA8D389A74796325ECB25D4E136854D3D774EDD0E3C95277099BB6981BCE201CE127F3B8AE5C7651C14","orcidId":"0000-0002-5830-167X","documentHash":"0d343e52-20ea-4cfe-a213-5c134e4fef07"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b50","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Cencek","uuid":"7D7F433A7A31D1A4D080277B2FE49ED9F5B45115086FAEDA03BCF07F6AB6D09B61EC0E8015CEEA44A992C6D7E5DD06BB406798BF1E7065879BA9ED1F3FC8E8D3","orcidId":"0000-0003-3649-7867","documentHash":"7aa79c92-3af1-40b7-85e2-872b041c4104"}],"objectId":"63ad843a4097070d11becbeb","publicUri":"https://annals-parasitology.eu/go.live.php/PL-H256/2022-vol-68-suppl-session-ix.html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"In vitro effectiveness of acaricides avaible on the market in Poland against national populations of dermanyssus gallinae","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The control of poultry red mites Dermanyssus gallinae (De Geer, 1778) is very difficult due to the high resistance of these parasites to acaricides. The aim of the study was to determine the resistance of D. gallinae mites from various farms in Poland to commonly used acaricides and to indicate the most effective preparations available on the market for their control. The research was carried out in 2015–2019 in 42 cage farms for laying hens located in 13 voivodeships of Poland. The research was carried out on 10 acaricidal preparations in relation to red mites, available on the market, containing, among others, active substances: avermectin, cypermethrin, permethrin, bendiocarb, carboxylate, phenoxy benzyl, carbamate and silicon dioxide. The research was carried out using the own method (Cencek et al. 2011; Zdybel et al. 2011), assessing the sensitivity of mites collected from farms 24 hours after application. It was established that the sources of mite\ninfestation in the farms covered by the study were hens, eggs and egg collection nets brought from other farms. In most farms, the most intense infestations of red mites occurred in late spring. Acaricides containing bendiocarb – FICAM 80 and\npreparations containing silica BIOBECK (silicon dioxide) and RECIDAL SIL (diatomaceous earth) showed the highest effectiveness against the majority of the red mite population. Their maen effectiveness was 97.3%, 94.2% and 91.02%, respectively. Contrary to preparations containing pyrethroid compounds.

For this reason, animal feed can contribute significantly to the presence of these compounds in food. The aim of this study was to present the concentrations of dioxins and PCBs as well as congener profiles in feed exceeding the acceptable limits (277/2012/EU). In addition, an attempt was made to identify the source of contamination for the different types of contaminated feedstuffs. Among a total of 743 samples of feed materials from the Polish market tested between 2013 and 2021, exceedances of the maximum levels of dioxins and PCBs were found in 21 samples (2.8%). The largest group among the non-compliant feed samples were feed materials of plant origin (43%) followed in decreasing order by vegetable oils and fats of animal origin (24%), materials of mineral origin (9%), and fish oils and meals (5%). The exceedances of the dioxin limits in the category feed materials of plant origin were only caused by dried materials (pulp, dried alfalfa, dried apple).

The accurate and early detection of PEDV infection is essential for the prevention and control of the spread of the disease. Many molecular assays have been developed for the detection of PEDV, including reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification assays. Additionally, several serological methods have been developed and are widely used for the detection of antibodies against PEDV. Some of them, such as the immunochromatography assay, can generate results very quickly and in field conditions. Molecular assays detect viral RNA in clinical samples rapidly, and with high sensitivity and specificity. Serological assays can determine prior immune exposure to PEDV, can be used to monitor the efficacy of vaccination strategies and may help to predict the duration of immunity in piglets. However, they are less sensitive than nucleic acid-based detection methods. Sanger and next-generation sequencing (NGS) allow the analysis of PEDV cDNA or RNA sequences, and thus, provide highly specific results. Furthermore, NGS based on nonspecific DNA cleavage in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)–Cas systems promise major advances in the diagnosis of PEDV infection. The objective of this paper was to summarize the current serological and molecular PEDV assays, highlight their diagnostic performance and emphasize the advantages and drawbacks of the application of individual tests."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"1074","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceac","mniswId":"15767","title":"Pathogens","issn":"2076-0817","eissn":"2076-0817","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0aee51de-2ae0-4570-a31e-61056cf6d598"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"633be89f4097074f734da9c7","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"10","documentHash":"fcc5f1e9-b6db-4be4-9c96-f1ad83738dc8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["porcine epidemic diarrhea virus","pedv","molecular diagnostics","serological diagnostics"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058382601"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"633bd8de4097074f734ba72e","name":"Yolanda","lastName":"Revilla","documentHash":"ddbd78e2-e06d-4dd1-94ad-b407eba7e39c"},{"objectId":"633bd8de4097074f734ba72d","name":"Lihong","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"4c2cc15e-aade-42be-8af1-16983eec0ab3"},{"objectId":"633bd8de4097074f734ba72c","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Pérez-Núñez","documentHash":"2db6d6d8-47dc-4fa4-ab25-63f36e002b5e"},{"objectId":"633bd8de4097074f734ba72b","name":"Krzesimir","lastName":"Szymankiewicz","documentHash":"2a0d3e76-c8a1-409e-bc0d-86c69ca4bb5f"},{"objectId":"5ebee176752340254fc4382c","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Juszkiewicz","uuid":"50ABB5A7520BDFB7433A732D6D5A88DF8FBC6734349F089686A6A6F347E1156A7520F3E4149C02EFB645B9140370E036BED11EF289270AC847C3C9A1B64B15EE","orcidId":"0000-0002-5705-4099","documentHash":"24fde698-0820-4915-a18e-6b11f03d4eac"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e49","name":"Marek","lastName":"Walczak","uuid":"21A80CCFF451C47DAACD79135936ED58DB4B863C7DAFCB2294E5CD3BFF3A4714E6C3DA150586FE86A64E197F08E90074F2171195EC1B4617D33D96798A46B57E","documentHash":"988887b4-5991-42b1-86b7-dcc413c5c96e"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d6f","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Żmudzki","uuid":"6A24DA6F24E5648C3CD81BDB606998267EBEB924EEF6ED396FD0375CDE9B696E78D80194CDCBED0F0FC6C2F28A4AE0A64FB3DF0E66FF158685638130800AEA72","orcidId":"0000-0002-2039-9384","documentHash":"19570bbb-4840-4156-9050-b269294452c2"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d4e","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szczotka-Bochniarz","uuid":"5A50EFE8836EA63AA5BA231195E3DDEB25840BF56F1B77D19D94CD5E6748C7E4E32CFF39CFC6D8497A6D9A3C605C8A92492E03B7B9C14044428FA1775ABD8590","documentHash":"cc1ff5e7-22b6-4115-a0ab-d029278b2b6f"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc0","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Niemczuk","uuid":"82AA2E7CCF0C6F87FC9C29C9C294AC35E29D444F944ED9F1FA82BB7FF88B5C2DF9A8411764C95A57F695D0609991E5125471404AD969DADA833F258105E54B44","orcidId":"0000-0003-1611-9770","documentHash":"a1f14ea1-835c-4507-ba6c-be8782ab8fbd"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"AUGUST","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"633bd8de4097074f734ba72a","doi":"10.3390/v14081756","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/14/8/1756/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Non-Invasive Sampling in the Aspect of African Swine Fever Detection—A Risk to Accurate Diagnosis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"African swine fever remains one of the most economically important and dangerous diseases of the Suidae family. Until now, neither a safe vaccine nor a treatment against ASF has been available, which is why prevention of the disease involves biosecurity measures and early recognition based on accurate diagnosis. Nowadays, different strategies for ASF detection are discussed to reduce both animal suffering and the costs of ASF surveillance. This article aims to indicate the risk, with regard to non-invasive sampling, for the detection of ASFV. In this study, we analyzed data from three independent animal trials, in the framework of the detection of positive samples in different matrices (blood, sera, oral and rectal swabs) collected from nineteen domestic pigs infected with similar doses but under different scenarios, including different ASFV strains or routes of infection. Genetic material of ASFV was found in all matrices, but detection occurred earlier in the blood samples than in the oral and the rectal swabs. Furthermore, analyses revealed that at relevant sampling timepoints, PCR-positive blood samples were detected more frequently and reached higher percentages (up to 100% during fever) than oral and rectal swabs. Moreover, mean Ct values in blood samples collected from animals infected with virulent strains were significantly lower than in oral and rectal swabs, ensuring a higher probability of ASFV detection. High Ct values and occasional shedding in all tested matrices, in the cases of animals infected by an attenuated ASFV-strain, showed that blood sampling may be necessary to confirm the presence of anti-ASFV antibodies in sera. This study showed that during veterinary surveillance, blood sampling (for both PCR and serological analyses) is essential for the accurate diagnosis of ASF and provides the highest probability of detection of the disease."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d6f","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4e","5ebee176752340254fc4382c","633bd8de4097074f734ba72b","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc0","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e49"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"1756","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d4e","5e709342878c28a0473a5d6f","5ebee176752340254fc4382c","633bd8de4097074f734ba72b","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc0","633bd8de4097074f734ba72c","633bd8de4097074f734ba72d","633bd8de4097074f734ba72e","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e49"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a80","mniswId":"20156","title":"Viruses","issn":"1999-4915","eissn":"1999-4915","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses","documentHash":"204f8987-0c7c-441b-9f4a-748747147d4e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"630c8b004097075e8cd18c91","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"8","documentHash":"264b5a16-1813-4477-adcc-d21aa60c6881"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ASF","ASFV","sampling","detection","diagnosis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058382605"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"633e815940970771796461a3","name":"Ilona","lastName":"Paprocka","documentHash":"a43e8ed3-129f-40c0-8ef2-2b8ee8071ce6"},{"objectId":"633e815940970771796461a2","name":"Marilyne","lastName":"Bescond","documentHash":"7ec0ad6c-f044-40f4-8e0d-8c4cc95ea374"},{"objectId":"633e815940970771796461a1","name":"Ioana M.","lastName":"Barbu","documentHash":"46d4150e-29fd-429c-8974-da292aa4a281"},{"objectId":"633e815940970771796461a0","name":"Stanislava","lastName":"Vonsovic","documentHash":"aeebb5b7-1fdd-40e8-9cb6-3fa045886cda"},{"objectId":"633e8159409707717964619f","name":"Nelly","lastName":"Jardy","documentHash":"5f39eebe-6673-47e5-a870-348e70b94d50"},{"objectId":"633e8159409707717964619e","name":"Theo W.","lastName":"Prins","documentHash":"8e42380d-a75b-403b-abe5-676ac9112f02"},{"objectId":"633e8159409707717964619d","name":"Christophe","lastName":"Genouel","documentHash":"8006e58b-24fd-4ece-bc89-57f3114b1da3"},{"objectId":"633e8159409707717964619c","name":"Leo W.

Hydrolysates of animal proteins (HPs) are frequently used as feed ingredients. Nevertheless, clear criteria for legal use and methods for monitoring feed applications are not available. Here, a range of methods have been used and evaluated for characterizing a set of 26 samples of hydrolysed proteins, ‘hydrolysed’ feather meals and processed animal proteins (PAPs), with verification based on an additional set of eight samples. Methods included determination of ash content, sediment (mineral fraction) content, protein content, species identity, solubility, protein solubility, size exclusion chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). After a comparison of results obtained with water and SDS, water was chosen as the solvent for environmental and occupational reasons. Typical HP samples have a protein content higher than 60%, a solubility exceeding 50% and a virtual absence of a mineral fraction. The first discrimination between HPs and PAPs could be based on the absence or presence, respectively, of a mineral fraction. An approach for HP characterization is designed using a Hydrolysation Index (HI) based on the fraction of peptides smaller than 10 kDa, the solubility of the sample and the fraction of soluble proteins. A simplified version (HIs), exclusively based on the fraction of peptides smaller than 10 kDa and the solubility of the sample, shows a trend among the samples highly comparable to HI. Values for HI and HIs exceeding 60% would characterise HPs. Feather meals, which are heat treated instead of treatment by a chemical process of hydrolysation, range among the PAPs and should not be indicated as “hydrolysed.” The HIs can be used as an easy parameter for classifying HPs and for legal enforcement."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d5e","5e709342878c28a0473a5caf"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"39","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"1674-1690","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["633e8159409707717964619c","633e8159409707717964619d","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5e","633e8159409707717964619e","633e8159409707717964619f","633e815940970771796461a0","633e815940970771796461a1","633e815940970771796461a2","633e815940970771796461a3","5e709342878c28a0473a5caf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477d03","mniswId":"6677","title":"Food Additives and Contaminants Part A-Chemistry Analysis Control Exposure & Risk Assessment","issn":"1944-0049","eissn":"1944-0057","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"48bee250-f5a4-46ca-8059-9d795e901306"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["animal protein hydrolysates","processed animal proteins","animal feed","hydrolysation index"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058382616"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0def","name":"Anna","lastName":"Lisowska","uuid":"DACDB5B33E016683B6C3AE247380BF2E5EC908115FAF7C45643A476F1F28A8371F1D6B6411BC388B5BCEC61BDF90732F3C336AD8313EA5CCA4D909A17D46412C","documentHash":"92988d97-a378-4a23-94cb-76d9a9e67f4a"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c3","name":"Anna","lastName":"Pikuła","uuid":"A283B6B2F9E05F2D0E1FAEE12806ECE15D9CABC0E6866E08C1F96C30B82D46ACBF225A28ACC0ACEC7D764DBABA3C442150A97FD6381E3F12E114994BBE205BFB","documentHash":"7e3962ab-978c-4183-9b98-9dd234001dd8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"AUGUST","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"633d5daa409707220fbe9e85","doi":"10.3390/pathogens11101081","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/11/10/1081/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Genetics and Pathogenicity of Natural Reassortant of Infectious Bursal Disease Virus Emerging in Latvia","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Infectious bursal disease virus is an immunosuppressive pathogen that, despite applied vaccination, is affecting the poultry industry worldwide.

Phylogenetic maximum likelihood inference of the B-segment sequence clustered the reassortant strain together with the US antigenic variant E strain. However, the obtained full-length sequence of 25/11/Latvia/2011 revealed that not only reassortment but also dozens of mutations shaped the unique genetic makeup. Phenotypic characterization showed no mortality and no clinical signs of disease but a severe bursa of Fabricius atrophy and splenomegaly in the convalescent birds at 10 days post infection. The results obtained indicate that the acquired genetic constellation contributed to a decrease in virulence; nevertheless, the infection causes severe damage to lymphoid organs, which can lead to impaired immune responses."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0def","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c3"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"1081","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947c878c28a0473be3c3","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0def"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceac","mniswId":"15767","title":"Pathogens","issn":"2076-0817","eissn":"2076-0817","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0aee51de-2ae0-4570-a31e-61056cf6d598"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"633be89f4097074f734da9c7","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"10","documentHash":"fcc5f1e9-b6db-4be4-9c96-f1ad83738dc8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["infectious bursal disease virus","reassortment","viral evolution","virulence"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058382657"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"633c0aa04097074f73501e2c","name":"Skubida","lastName":"Paweł","documentHash":"7f1a51fe-e3a7-4f1f-92c2-149ad81123f0"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e48","name":"Marta","lastName":"Skubida","uuid":"A2A69BE989F80F23F32F1DB1CB68CE647F38A2402005378958F5A41359FE7BBEC2AB7F944815C263E0B0F701EDE6B1470E30D2C52AD49E1425649716A89425B0","documentHash":"df08bfcc-d2a3-473b-b0e4-d2e106fddaaa"}],"objectId":"633c0aa04097074f73501e2b","publicUri":"https://miesiecznik-pszczelarstwo.pl/numer/wrzesien-2022","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Sprawozdanie z 59.

In this study, we screened two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), 4H1E8 and 7H9A6, that specifically recognize the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of H7N9 influenza virus and display highly neutralizing activity against H7N9 virus. The epitopes recognized by two MAbs are nearly all conserved within all known H7 subtypes. Characteristic identification showed that two MAbs have high avidity for the HA protein but no hemagglutinin inhibition activity or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Mechanistically, the 4H1E8 and 7H9A6 antibodies inhibit the pH-dependent conformational change of HA and block the HA-mediated membrane fusion. More importantly, 4H1E8 and 7H9A6 exhibit promising prophylactic and therapeutic effects against lethal challenge with H7N9 virus. Moreover, 4H1E8- and 7H9A6-treated mice displayed inhibition of pulmonary viral replication and reduced lung lesions after viral challenge. Together, these findings indicate that antibodies 4H1E8 and 7H9A6 recognize unique epitopes in the HA protein and possess the neutralizing activity and protective efficacy against the H7N9 influenza A viruses. IMPORTANCE In 2013, H7N9 influenza viruses appeared in China and other countries resulting in more than 1,500 individual infections or death. There are still limited studies on vaccines or drugs for humans against H7N9 influenza viruses. Alternative approaches against H7N9 virus infection need to be developed. Here, we identified two monoclonal antibodies (4H1E8 and 7H9A6) that possess neutralizing activity by blocking the pH-dependent HA-mediated membrane fusion. Additionally, the two monoclonal antibodies protect mice against the H7N9 virus challenge prophylactically or therapeutically. Therefore, our study demonstrates that 4H1E8 and 7H9A6 could be used for the prevention and treatment of the H7N9 influenza virus, and the conserved epitopes we identified may contribute to the development of a broad H7N9 vaccine and provide insights into unique antiviral approaches."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d58"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"96","issue":"18","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["633d5762409707220fbe4d93","633d5762409707220fbe4d94","633d5762409707220fbe4d95","633d5762409707220fbe4d96","633d5762409707220fbe4d97","633d5762409707220fbe4d98","633d5762409707220fbe4d99","633d5762409707220fbe4d9a","633d5762409707220fbe4d9b","633d5762409707220fbe4d9c","5e709342878c28a0473a5d58"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478be1","mniswId":"13165","title":"Journal of Virology","issn":"0022-538X","eissn":"1098-5514","documentHash":"0fa3d935-24f8-4b97-84b4-4d412c63f327"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"633d5762409707220fbe4d92","year":"2022","volume":"96","number":"18","documentHash":"69503010-089a-4947-9bbe-9912c59f85dc"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["H7N9 influenza virus","monoclonal antibody","hemagglutinin","prophylaxis","therapy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058382925"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"633bdb184097074f734bfca1","name":"Didkowska","lastName":"A","documentHash":"16c7a0de-9ecd-40fc-a2e8-ab5001f86664"},{"objectId":"60a738179543c758682b6456","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Radulski","uuid":"884C68E493FED1FCA705BDA92235CA75DA53F5BD924591BAD3CF9461D3D197280F4C6263046E76F43689A89A7F134D7030E7702104B78A13C46FB185D087B223","documentHash":"a6aecbdf-127b-477b-a21c-1ba416c1eeba"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c1","name":"Monika","lastName":"Krajewska-Wędzina","uuid":"48D96FF61147929F46D201644057AF91FD057455FC10757C30FB62096A475BDC285317D0DC9C8B59939D198E75553F0070726157DEA9152E0CC73FA3968F8714","orcidId":"0000-0002-5826-2068","documentHash":"59c09ee7-3423-47a7-a7e0-af93754cdebf"}],"objectId":"633bdb184097074f734bfca0","publicUri":"https://www.vetpol.org.pl/zyciewet/czasopismo/cat_view/90-zycie-weterynaryjne-wybrane-artykuly/687-rocznik-97-rok-2022/699-nr-8-2022-sierpien","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Występowanie zakażeń Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex u zwierząt.

Tuberculosis in cattle and other animal species is mainly caused by Mycobacterium bovis and, to a lesser extent, Mycobacterium caprae. Tuberculosis is a chronic, debilitating disease characterized by the formation of tubercles, most commonly observed in the lymph nodes, lungs, pleura, peritoneum, and less often in the intestines, liver and spleen. Despite decades of eradication efforts and an overall downward trend, the incidence of cases in cattle is not uniform and clusters of infection are still common. Other species are presumed to play a key role in maintaining the disease in the environment. Therefore, tuberculosis control measures should not be cattle limited but include small ruminants, as evidenced by the increased incidence of tuberculosis in sheep and goats, especially in endemic multi-host systems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60a738179543c758682b6456","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c1"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"97","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"546-549","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947c878c28a0473be3c1","633bdb184097074f734bfca1","60a738179543c758682b6456"]},"journal":{"objectId":"64f04bfacf9a7471b0ea4134","mniswId":"201684","title":"Życie Weterynaryjne","issn":"0137-6810","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"0f017680-7d06-42bd-85cb-d40e4b8585a4"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Mycobacterium bovis","Mycobacterium caprae","Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex","tuberculosis","small ruminants"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058382941"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61de4b387523403b69b1ed5b","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Adamska","uuid":"F815269EDB2352CD6093E4FBE2A885F08A8D96E81E6018312B075BB80513DE75118276AFB8B3D80A7EBA8588E6BB2ED09715CC47C103BC45E9E38D3CDCC60F3C","documentHash":"caf9244a-2237-470d-a477-6ea78bcc9d09"},{"objectId":"5e7094af878c28a0473c1b6b","name":"Anna","lastName":"Sawicka-Durkalec","uuid":"74F41A0F85AC155F46A6CCFB26EB711F025B465228066B5B84B02AC6321B340B5E150BCF2A66F7C1772D185C02BC942B7AE9B4870C2127F7D8BF9A52EE8941FA","documentHash":"bedf887e-9c8e-4e06-b951-662b20cf6e92"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de5","name":"Olimpia","lastName":"Kursa","uuid":"75402E2E14C8ED8034D357B13AFDE45E9969ED0E1013DCAC5AC579ED65B4C512BE817796CCDCBBC958F09F10CA0E27A409B73C9E9AF9FD4C4A298A3D7F324E63","orcidId":"0000-0002-0058-1568","documentHash":"6ee44e6d-ce9a-41d7-99e0-5633dff83f06"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d5a","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Tomczyk","uuid":"E3C5238621862F074D46922CB3B17195CE27A83F2C9C06B0BA49A69FEE2FB90EC33B4FDD96A897D15FCA91F90109B062B91A53DADD2FC97CF132051ED597C664","documentHash":"b7a3ee18-b481-4390-a3be-5aeac0b34bca"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"AUGUST","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"633c0c814097074f73502c3e","doi":"10.1038/s41598-022-19268-4","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-19268-4.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Bacterial communities of the oviduct of turkeys","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Bacterial communities in the reproductive tract of avian species play an important role in keeping birds healthy and encouraging growth.

The microbial composition and relative abundance of bacteria differed between individual birds. Among the 19 phyla detected in turkey oviduct were unique taxa like Planctomycetes or Petescibacteria. Differences in composition of bacterial diversity were found at the family and genus level. Oviducts contained also several genus with well-recognized avian pathogens like Escherichia-Shigella, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, and Ornithobacterium.

The aim of the research was to assess the parasitological contamination of organic fertilizers applying for admission to trading in Poland in 2018–2020. The research material consisted of 513 samples of organic fertilizers. The samples were tested with our own accredited methods. Live eggs of parasites of the genus Ascaris, Toxocara or Trichuris were found in a total of 119 samples (23.2%), including 37 samples from biogas plants, which constitutes 33.3% of contaminated samples of this type, 59 samples of fertilizers based on sewage sludge (42.0%) and 23 samples of other organic fertilizers (9.3%) from fertilizer production plants. The most contaminated with parasite eggs were samples from municipal sewage treatment plants and biogas plants. Live Ascaris spp. Eggs were found in 78 samples, 53 samples of Trichuris spp. Eggs, and 48 samples of Toxocara spp. The total number of parasite eggs in these samples ranged from 300 to 750,000 eggs per kg DM. samples. The eggs of the genus Ascaris and Toxocara were the most numerous. The lowest number of live eggs of intestinal parasites was found in the samples of other organic fertilizers. The obtained results indicate the necessity to conduct parasitological tests of organic fertilizers before placing them on the market in order to eliminate potential threats to the environment and human and animal health."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c5","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","5e709341878c28a0473a5b50"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"68","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"81","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709341878c28a0473a5b50","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c5","63ad84fa4097070d11bed332","63ad84fa4097070d11bed333","5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479c1d","mniswId":"20901","title":"Annals of Parasitology","issn":"2299-0631","eissn":"2300-6706","websiteLink":"http://www.annals-parasitology.eu","documentHash":"2522246a-aaac-4cb8-ae6e-83a4e210e9fd"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["organic fertilizers"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058389130"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63b2cbf34097074fed0104e8","name":"Carlos M.","lastName":"Franco","documentHash":"6097f832-c029-4d05-a1fb-4dc65554eb5f"},{"objectId":"63b2cbf34097074fed0104e7","name":"Alberto","lastName":"Cepeda","documentHash":"917f6809-c420-413e-bf57-12c14e804620"},{"objectId":"63b2cbf34097074fed0104e6","name":"Ignacio","lastName":"García-Presedo","documentHash":"c55bcb5f-2d9f-43d9-94c9-67fcd6e7c29c"},{"objectId":"63b2cbf34097074fed0104e5","name":"Alejandra","lastName":"Cardelle-Cobas","documentHash":"9e5b0c69-2fab-4b1c-a0ca-5bd9757d25ec"},{"objectId":"63b2cbf34097074fed0104e4","name":"Carolina","lastName":"Nebot","documentHash":"ccce4e7e-751a-4a7f-97f6-8d21d5329f39"},{"objectId":"5e70947a878c28a0473be056","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Patyra","uuid":"70AEA1536F3D1DD275C8505B021D0A3CC7548B85668DF4614DD25CD31CEF0BFD91FA03E71F0B483A2FBF8AF3B27E24667A7617657EC1F5313A96730402DBF2D0","orcidId":"0000-0002-3827-2314","documentHash":"85c16763-62f2-4d5c-8a34-6ecfc4c5e227"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"63b2cbf34097074fed0104e3","doi":"10.3390/molecules28010216","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/28/1/216/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Identification and Quantification of 29 Active Substances by HPLC–ESI-MS/MS in Lyophilized Swine Manure Samples","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Veterinary drugs are frequently employed to treat and prevent diseases in food-producing animals to improve animal health and to avoid the introduction of microorganisms into the food chain. The analysis of the presence of pharmaceutical residues in animal manure could help to evaluate the legal and illegal practices during food production without harming the animals and to correctly manage manure when it is going to be applied as a fertilizer. This article describes a method for the simultaneous analysis of 29 active substances, mostly antibiotics and antiparasitic agents. Substances were extracted from lyophilized manure with a methanol:McIlvaine solution and analyzed with HPLC–ESI-MS/MS and a C18 HPLC column. The method was validated following European guidelines, the achieved trueness was between 63 and 128% (depending on the analytes), and the linearity was between 100 and 1500 µg/kg. The applicability of the method was demonstrated in 40 manure samples collected from pig farms where tetracycline was quantified in 7.5% of the samples. These results show the viability of this non-invasive method for the control of the legal and illegal administration of pharmaceuticals in food-producing animals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947a878c28a0473be056"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"28","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"216","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63b2cbf34097074fed0104e4","63b2cbf34097074fed0104e5","63b2cbf34097074fed0104e6","5e70947a878c28a0473be056","63b2cbf34097074fed0104e7","63b2cbf34097074fed0104e8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":"10.3390/molecules","issn":"1420-3049","eissn":"1420-3049","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules","documentHash":"184d7608-03fd-4b64-ac86-b4321a9365f0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63b16a7340970703c609de15","year":"2022","volume":"28","number":"1","documentHash":"a65426a5-8712-4989-937f-587390126e1b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["swine","drugs","manure","non-invasive method","HPLC–MS/MS"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058414853"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bc0aec4097075486202c30","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Tłuścik","documentHash":"cd619f1f-79f8-41bc-96db-778957544427"},{"objectId":"63b4f2b975234021979cd504","name":"Milena","lastName":"Skóra","uuid":"43EBD1C9F3A4EF54A84EFFA15FBAABB892B39679DD0642F2C653BE03D13D29F9DB4A7C42A95202D89C435FEA94BF289DDF022ECF059FBC36F0EC369F58473EA0","documentHash":"df6aad05-c1b8-419b-a802-8b7d0b307cf4"},{"objectId":"5ebee49e752340254fc44641","name":"Renata","lastName":"Kwit","uuid":"4D78B20CBFF991A2F16AF1B2F7312A7EEE9A715258A456D4A11F48DB80C60D1FBC1E42AD84E3BB95D5340D72EA6EACC21D196399D27C37C8A4AEFADD037B2B7F","documentHash":"d09f25c6-1ec3-4799-b6ef-bd605cd724ad"},{"objectId":"5ebee286752340254fc43cdb","name":"Anna","lastName":"Lalak","uuid":"0F0E0A073E080F42474EEAD1E0536C80F7D0E964E36397A33C3A2D8AFB15920D6A559FD9EE66E270645F447AC06EEFCD95C377DAF4C31BCCC4E213EAD022AFC3","documentHash":"2c88e924-b150-4dcc-8689-37bb421c9a8f"},{"objectId":"5ebede2d752340254fc42949","name":"Marta","lastName":"Pietruk","uuid":"DC5C8C0DA95E8406A15C1EDB6D5406A221B3CBF5E0248E21E305B8BF830C01BEB6F90B7FA2A12C5D493EF2C3AF4C8C66EE462CEB0C6D54D105D483D30210CE3D","documentHash":"621c2116-06f2-49f7-812f-a43f9de8c3dc"},{"objectId":"5e7094e4878c28a0473c62ff","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Skarżyńska","uuid":"BF5F909D80BD570BA26874B18FC1AD54F20352CF1777FA6BCD1870923EE3F3CEF3D0A8BBC56D5065BE239B8AB64379EB520DD667F718A45F88585A0CB7586307","orcidId":"0000-0001-5666-9510","documentHash":"8e423ef0-fc2d-4451-a85e-d3a8480205bc"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d6c","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Zając","uuid":"E22B9BA408D67CDB5671F2643034D9593874BD17FE9AC02B2A30001B9B2E4C5298AFCBD87CADFBAB0D79212EB9863263B32F089E9920CBBDC0FFD3ECDCCBC65E","orcidId":"0000-0002-8155-7614","documentHash":"833e52a9-4909-4cd8-935b-275195f84609"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d5c","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Wasyl","uuid":"C5ED1757437A5677E196DA08E4AA40E3BCE245B9A5E1C3A37991653501DAC643CEDB4A1A1EEAA522F34E2F1C4B7C40B294F5E325464AC798E4B89C8E5CB9808B","orcidId":"0000-0002-1068-8414","documentHash":"b1e4ce6d-47cc-4c73-aefe-79b312bb2775"},{"objectId":"5e709297878c28a047398949","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Skrzypiec","uuid":"8C647302B20A6BCE65C6C4307432EA064F4CFE6AC23BA5968BAB631B55790A997CFC9BD5254EF86A2C3096660212D3004F8D9AE3A3F6D743416A938B1D2BEB21","documentHash":"070e76cf-d536-4170-a405-8d52f75ebf14"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"63bc0aec4097075486202c2e","doi":"10.1016/j.dib.2022.108721","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2352340922009258?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Draft genome sequences data of four Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Dublin archival strains originating from animals in Poland, 1956 – 1957","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Dublin (S.

Eight genetically very distinct groups, known as assemblages A to H, have been recognized in the G. duodenalis species complex, two of which (assemblages A and B) infect humans and other mammalian hosts. Informative typing schemes are essential to understand transmission pathways, characterize outbreaks and trace zoonotic transmission. In this study, we evaluated a published multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) scheme for G. duodenalis assemblage A,which is based on six polymorphic markers. Methods: We genotyped 60 human-derived and 11 animal-derived G. duodenalis isolates collected in Europe and on other continents based on the published protocol. After retrieving previously published genotyping data and excluding isolates whose sequences showed allelic sequence heterozygosity, we analysed a dataset comprising 146 isolates.\nResults: We identifed novel variants at fve of the six markers and identifed 78 distinct MLST types in the overall dataset. Phylogenetic interpretation of typing data confrmed that sub-assemblage AII only comprises human-derived\nisolates, whereas sub-assemblage AI comprises all animal-derived isolates and a few human-derived isolates, suggesting limited zoonotic transmission. Within sub-assemblage AII, isolates from two outbreaks, which occurred in Sweden\nand Italy, respectively, had unique and distinct MLST types. Population genetic analysis showed a lack of clustering by geographical origin of the isolates. Conclusion: The MLST scheme evaluated provides sufcient discriminatory power for epidemiological studies of G. duodenalis assemblage A."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny -

The effect of a chokeberry leaf extract (ChLE) addition at concentrations of 0.01 %, 0.05 % and 0.1 % on the sensory and physicochemical properties of burgers prepared from DFD meat during refrigerated storage under vacuum for 10 days was assessed. The pH, water activity, texture, colour, degree of lipid oxidation, and content of α-tocopherol were measured. The extract at concentrations of 0.05 % and 0.1 % significantly influenced lower levels of lipid oxidation and higher content of α-tocopherol on each tested period. Moreover, these concentrations had a beneficial effect on the instrumental and sensory evaluation of texture parameters and on overall quality.

Vaccines based on live attenuated viruses seem to be most effective for vaccination against challenging pathogens like Cyprinid herpesvirus 3. However, there are still knowledge gaps how these vaccines effectively protect fish from the deadly disease caused by the epitheliotropic CyHV-3, and which aspects of non-direct protection of skin or gill integrity and function are important in the aquatic environment. To elucidate some elements of protection, common carp were vaccinated against CyHV-3 using a double deletion vaccine virus KHV-T ΔDUT/TK in the absence or presence of a mix of common carp beta-defensins 1, 2 and 3 as adjuvants. Vaccination induced marginal clinical signs, low virus load and a minor upregulation of cd4, cd8 and igm gene expression in vaccinated fish, while neutralisation activity of blood serum rose from 14 days post vaccination (dpv). A challenge infection with CyHV-3 induced a severe disease with 80-100% mortality in non-vaccinated carp, while in vaccinated carp, no mortality was recorded and the virus load was >1,000-fold lower in the skin, gill and kidney. Histological analysis showed strongest pathological changes in the skin, with a complete destruction of the epidermis in non-vaccinated carp. In the skin of non-vaccinated fish, T and B cell responses were severely downregulated, inflammation and stress responses were increased upon challenge, whereas vaccinated fish had boosted neutrophil, T and B cell responses. A disruption of skin barrier elements (tight and adherence junction, desmosomes, mucins) led to an uncontrolled increase in skin bacteria load which most likely exacerbated the inflammation and the pathology. Using a live attenuated virus vaccine, we were able to show that increased neutrophil, T and B cell responses provide protection from CyHV-3 infection and lead to preservation of skin integrity, which supports successful protection against additional pathogens in the aquatic environment which foster disease development in non-vaccinated carp."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d33","5e709342878c28a0473a5cb8","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"787021","pagesFromTo":"1-19","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63bc0c9b4097075486205304","5e709342878c28a0473a5cb8","63bc0c9b4097075486205305","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4b","63bc0c9b4097075486205306","63bc0c9b4097075486205307","63bc0c9b4097075486205308","63bc0c9b4097075486205309","63bc0c9b409707548620530a","63bc0c9b409707548620530b","63bc0c9b409707548620530c","63bc0c9b409707548620530d","63bc0c9b409707548620530e","5e709342878c28a0473a5d33","63bc0c9b409707548620530f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d5d","mniswId":"6843","title":"Frontiers in Immunology","issn":"1664-3224","eissn":"1664-3224","documentHash":"6b154b99-72d3-4a42-8bcc-3211ee11bd8a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6225c6472467f0548a015a20","year":"2022","volume":"13","documentHash":"fae910d8-18c4-473b-9011-0dfd3a56b0a2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CyHV-3","KHV","live attenuated virus"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058431846"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bc150f409707548621ace0","name":"Jeong Hee","lastName":"Kim","documentHash":"c3d193d3-73d4-4302-ae04-f0aa908a2282"},{"objectId":"63bc150f409707548621acdf","name":"Kyungyoung","lastName":"Song","documentHash":"34580a80-e59b-463a-9b99-ce2857483a4a"},{"objectId":"63bc150f409707548621acde","name":"Yun Seong","lastName":"Choi","documentHash":"75836062-a6fd-4216-9188-001c8c41a38f"},{"objectId":"63bc150f409707548621acdd","name":"Hyun Jin","lastName":"Hwang","documentHash":"59184555-d499-45e4-bd6a-0cdb552242b3"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a660f","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Frant","uuid":"2AD73901C2B1BDDF66264197B4E2A40BB43C9F170B0D3D9252C79378D973DED6BA0DD7DB0E3F16FB50489E4717CA62BAE671805ED94AD0C5F9B3478EE3C561FE","orcidId":"0000-0002-7169-3735","documentHash":"b81b59e2-56af-4ed2-bfbe-bdf26cc5f824"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"JANUARY","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"63bc150f409707548621acdb","doi":"10.3389/fvets.2022.1037728","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2022.1037728/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Development and validation of a fast quantitative real-time PCR assay for the detection of African swine fever virus","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a double-stranded DNA virus that causes African swine fever (ASF), a lethal hemorrhagic fever that is highly contagious among domestic pigs and wild boars. Due to the high mortality rates and highly contagious nature of the ASF, it is important to develop a fast detection method for ASFV with high sensitivity and specificity to take an immediate action to stop wide spread of the virulent disease. Therefore, a fast and quantitative molecular detection method of ASFV is presented in this study. A total of 24 genotypes of ASFV have been identified based on nucleic acid sequences of the major capsid protein p72. The primers and probe of the present assay was designed to detect all of the p72-based genotypes of ASFV. The turnaround time for PCR detection was within 50 min which is at least about two-times faster compared to other PCR assays. Limit of detection (LoD) was 6.91 genomic copies/reaction for the most virulent genotype II. LoD values for other genotypes were within 10–20 copies/reaction. Cross-reactivity of the assay was validated using a panel of pathogens related to swine disease, and no cross-reactivity was observed. Positive and negative clinical samples (50 samples each) obtained from sick and healthy animals, were used to validate the assay. The results showed that 100% agreement for both positive and negative samples. In summary, the assay described in this study offers the advantage of rapid detection of all genotypes of ASFV with high sensitivity and specificity.

The main source of human exposure to dioxins is food of animal origin, whereas feeds are the main route of exposure of farmed animals to dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls. The aim of the study was to simulate dioxin passage from feed to tissues on farm animals using transfer models, and, in addition, to assess the risk to consumers of food of animal origin. From over 700 feed samples analyzed over the course of 9 years (2013–2021), those exceeding the maximum permissible levels set down in Commission Regulation No 277/2012/EU were selected. These samples being derived from real cases of dioxin contamination made it possible to present the most realistic picture of the effects these feed materials could have had if they had entered the food chain. Three species of animals were selected (laying hens, dairy cattle and slaughter pigs), for which feed materials with dioxin contents exceeding the maximum permissible level were selected in accordance with the nutritional recommendations. The calculated PCDD/PCDF concentrations in chicken eggs, cow's milk and pork were above the maximum permissible level in most cases."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0dfa","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c4","5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d63"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"313","pagesFromTo":"137379","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d63","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c4","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0dfa"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775f8","mniswId":"3525","title":"CHEMOSPHERE","issn":"0045-6535","documentHash":"ca7a4227-9b2a-46cb-a2a2-53056fa5e040"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63b5226c409707109b234448","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"313","documentHash":"6f74f048-25ab-4eda-929b-774d2318bab3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dioxins","feeds","transfer","risk assessment"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058431945"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bbfa4840970754861e8687","name":"Frank M.","lastName":"Aarestrup","documentHash":"30f71146-2e6d-4cac-965d-cfe37ca4c2bb"},{"objectId":"63bbfa4840970754861e8686","name":"Mark","lastName":"Woolhouse","documentHash":"b18f7a91-bf80-434a-9e50-b93aeabf0b33"},{"objectId":"63bbfa4840970754861e8685","name":"Marion","lastName":"Koopmans","documentHash":"ca0beb08-ec89-4c4b-9b18-f7634dd2e282"},{"objectId":"63bbfa4840970754861e8684","name":"D.

analysis of sewage from 101 countries reveals global landscape of antimicrobial resistance","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to global health. Understanding the emergence, evolution, and transmission of individual antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is essential to develop sustainable strategies combatting this threat. Here, we use metagenomic sequencing to analyse ARGs in 757 sewage samples from 243 cities in 101 countries, collected from 2016 to 2019. We find regional patterns in resistomes, and these differ between subsets corresponding to drug classes and are partly driven by taxonomic variation. The genetic environments of 49 common ARGs are highly diverse, with most common ARGs carried by multiple distinct genomic contexts globally and sometimes on plasmids. Analysis of flanking sequence revealed ARG-specific patterns of dispersal limitation and global transmission. Our data furthermore suggest certain geographies are more prone to transmission events and should receive additional attention."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy

The aim of the study was human health risk assessment related to the presence of certain POPs, namely polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in terrestrial animals' livers. HRGC-HRMS was used to determine analyte concentrations in 99 liver samples of chicken, pork, beef, and mutton livers obtained from Polish farms. The ovine livers were the most contaminated by ∑PCDD/F/dl-PCBs (0.06–2.21 pg WHO-TEQ g−1 wet weight), ∑ndl-PCBs (0.036–1.54 ng g−1 wet weight) and ∑PBDEs (0.21–2.27 ng g−1 wet weight). Samples were found of ovine and pork livers that exceeded the maximum concentration limits established for PCDD/Fs. The Kruskal–Wallis test showed that there were statistical differences between regions in the concentrations of the ∑PCDD/Fs and ∑PCDD/F-PCBs, but none in those of the ∑dl-PCBs, ∑ndl-PCBs or ∑PBDEs. According to Dunnett's test results, ovine liver samples from the Podlaskie province contained fewer ∑PCDD/F than those from the Dolnośląskie (p < 0.027) and Małopolskie (p < 0.0342) voivodeships. Taking into account PCDD/F contents and Tolerable Weekly Intake (2 pg WHO-TEQ/kg BW) (TWI2018), the lowest risk was associated with chicken liver consumption (TWI up to 11 % in the 95th percentile), pork (62 %) and bovine (92 %) livers should be eaten in limited amounts for risk avoidance, while mutton liver (400 %) should not be eaten at all. Additionally, there is no risk of ingestion of a harmful amount of PBDEs associated with consumption of the livers of terrestrial animals from Poland based on the margin of exposure values (>15)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947c878c28a0473be3c4","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e16"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"867","pagesFromTo":"161508","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e16","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","issn":"0048-9697","documentHash":"536a2e2c-aae7-4edb-84d0-5d817a2d0285"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c7ae474097076eb3750b47","year":"2023","volume":"867","documentHash":"7793097b-e3a4-4d0c-b315-38df370d0809"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Liver","PCDD/F","PCB","PBDE","Exposure","Risk assessment"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058442323"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63c7addb4097076eb37508dd","name":"Alberto","lastName":"Cepeda","documentHash":"f470cefd-6b2e-427c-b7e9-bdf114c9c8e6"},{"objectId":"63c7addb4097076eb37508dc","name":"Rosa Elvira","lastName":"Gavilán","documentHash":"89720b1a-6093-4e1c-bbbb-defedd463159"},{"objectId":"63c7addb4097076eb37508db","name":"Carolina","lastName":"Nebot","documentHash":"ef4ea25d-d981-4458-b6c8-7e1ea294d699"},{"objectId":"5e70947a878c28a0473be056","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Patyra","uuid":"70AEA1536F3D1DD275C8505B021D0A3CC7548B85668DF4614DD25CD31CEF0BFD91FA03E71F0B483A2FBF8AF3B27E24667A7617657EC1F5313A96730402DBF2D0","orcidId":"0000-0002-3827-2314","documentHash":"85c16763-62f2-4d5c-8a34-6ecfc4c5e227"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5caf","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kwiatek","uuid":"483AF17960E9A333131A70EFECF6469DB4B390ED1FC80958251A4DC48A21C1BB31E13F4FFF4619F4F3D2845908B5F84A67F567F444E8C826335B0675F5060620","documentHash":"2cd83ba7-a483-4b03-b3b0-14728060cac8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"JANUARY","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"63c7addb4097076eb37508d9","doi":"10.1002/jsfa.12435","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jsfa.12435","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Prevalence of veterinary antibiotics in natural and organic fertilizers from animal food production and assessment of their potential ecological risk","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Veterinary antibiotics are emerging contaminants and enter into soil  principally by agricultural application of organic fertilizers.

The parasite has various transmission routes, and the meat of infected animals appears to be a major source of human infections in Europe. We aimed to estimate T. gondii prevalence in a selection of animal host species. A systematic literature review resulting in 226 eligible publications was carried out, and serological data were analyzed using an age-dependent Bayesian hierarchical model to obtain estimates for the regional T. gondii seroprevalence in livestock, wildlife, and felids. Prevalence estimates varied between species, regions,indoor/outdoor rearing, and types of detection methods applied. The lowest estimated seroprevalence was observed for indoor-kept lagomorphs at 4.8% (95% CI: 1.8–7.5%) and the highest for outdoor-kept sheep at 63.3% (95% CI: 53.0–79.3%). Overall, T. gondii seroprevalence estimates were highest within Eastern Europe, whilst being lowest in Northern Europe. Prevalence data based on direct detection methods were scarce and were not modelled but rather directly summarized by species. The outcomes of the meta-analysis can be used to extrapolate data to areas with a lack of data and provide valuable inputs for future source attribution approaches aiming to estimate the relative contribution of different sources of T. gondii human infection."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"97","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63c7abd74097076eb374e786","63c7abd74097076eb374e787","63c7abd74097076eb374e788","63c7abd74097076eb374e789","63c7abd74097076eb374e78a","63c7abd74097076eb374e78b","63c7abd74097076eb374e78c","63c7abd74097076eb374e78d","63c7abd74097076eb374e78e","63c7abd74097076eb374e78f","63c7abd74097076eb374e790","63c7abd74097076eb374e791","63c7abd74097076eb374e792","63c7abd74097076eb374e793","63c7abd74097076eb374e794","63c7abd74097076eb374e795","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","63c7abd74097076eb374e796","63c7abd74097076eb374e797","63c7abd74097076eb374e798"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceac","mniswId":"15767","title":"Pathogens","issn":"2076-0817","eissn":"2076-0817","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0aee51de-2ae0-4570-a31e-61056cf6d598"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bd303e40970735969c88fa","year":"2023","volume":"12","number":"1","documentHash":"f95a788f-8018-4e46-bd19-fe3ae3991674"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["toxoplasmosis","pig","sheep","goat","cattle","cat","Bayesian model","systematic review","seroprevalence","meta-analysis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058446223"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61de4b387523403b69b1eda9","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Kłopot","uuid":"7C7F81163B8DD0A4F49B6C6A6CF28E152BDC5A19DD348F54A8A7BE0F387CD92654B269BCC65563291C17D3DB4F2B9CFA419DEF253DBC2A1DD54CCA224BE93BD7","documentHash":"4d33912d-db1a-4832-89c2-927f4e496c60"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e4e","name":"Sebatian","lastName":"Witek","uuid":"0B6F8A580BB13E559AA6DE3B1C2004F45A66999284F6F95C529C6F30D28B3B3F216971DE91F4D21E5B6FB026D6AD11DC1111DFB7EB39CC90F2DB0A219135CF45","documentHash":"cafc2977-a88b-44e0-bdb3-f3eb5ad37ab6"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d2e","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Posyniak","uuid":"92DC06402710A27C3F4BEAA2905BD38DBF391EC88AC5782A34AEF8D5CC50DC9053AFCA4589CCFF4A4027B9C1B373A29748E9892CD7D44F10230EA260A95904E2","documentHash":"bf315d6e-353b-447e-87f7-0b5a67482104"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d29","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Pękala-Safińska","uuid":"C20069D66531D7CBD28DB4AE6C92C6ADF940091E294B58C26A5C16C6FB3D9C209FE525D8B212160A92C54C26958413924CB703280A0167C5439AFEC9A001295C","orcidId":"0000-0002-5515-8329","documentHash":"22bf7090-4f23-4135-a753-8016e4d98946"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cb9","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Matraszek-Żuchowska","uuid":"C2E65ADD396603ED9BC5C69975005F65B32855FBAE9ADF6AAA6C6776C206E7907B075D7A18BD542FB1B09351647BF67CD2F5B6B9D045AA2F272E2527D051F047","documentHash":"f3266a17-e2e3-4b51-aafa-34adba97b04c"}],"objectId":"6384d986409707320873eaf2","doi":"10.3390/separations9100293","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/separations9100293","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Development of Analytical Procedure for the Determination of 17β-Testosterone, 11-Ketotestosterone and 17β-Estradiol in the Sea Trout (Salmo trutta L.)

The presence of endocrine disruptor compounds in aquatic ecosystems has raised concern about their effect on hormone levels in fish target organs. Since hormones are present in very low concentrations in biological material, their determination still remains a challenge. A new analytical procedure has been developed to determine 17β-testosterone, 11-ketotestosterone and 17β-estradiol in the sea trout female and male gonads by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system equipped with an ESI source operating in both positive and negative mode. Chromatographic separation of analytes was accomplished in Poroshell 120 EC-C18 (150 mm × 2.1 mm, 2.7 µm) column under isocratic elution conditions. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile, methanol and water (20:50:30/v/v/v) at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. Analytes were extracted from the gonad matrix with ethyl acetate, and co-extractives impurities were successfully removed by QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) method. The procedure was validated with good sensitivity, linearity, accuracy, and precision. Limits of quantifications were from 0.15 to 0.75 ng/g, linearity was obtained with correlation coefficient R > 0.99, accuracy was from 94.0 to 109.5%, precision expressed as RSD ranged from 1.7 to 27.2% (repeatability) and from 2.2 to 37.1% (reproducibility). Finally, the method was applied to determining 17β-testosterone, 11-ketotestosterone and 17β-estradiol in real samples of the female and male sea trout gonads, 8 and 22 samples, respectively."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61de4b387523403b69b1eda9","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e4e","5e709342878c28a0473a5d2e","5e709342878c28a0473a5cb9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d29"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"293","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cb9","61de4b387523403b69b1eda9","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e4e","5e709342878c28a0473a5d29","5e709342878c28a0473a5d2e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d2e6","mniswId":"18392","title":"Separations","eissn":"2297-8739","documentHash":"35448e59-b691-4270-a156-0b7359afe7c1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6384d986409707320873eaf3","year":"2022","volume":"9","number":"10","documentHash":"fe703c5a-f9e4-4f5a-8bfb-9e8b9fdf2692"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058460718"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0ddf","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kaupke","uuid":"BB4CD2E891EE29C149E16224967B6459994EDA1FD1864612676536B0873CAF6716213A6EA983883AB4AB95E3FDCD1257ABD4434268B52114615B9242AA80452C","orcidId":"0000-0003-2930-9346","documentHash":"aea3f641-2f16-497b-ad21-2822cc05a109"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d41","name":"Artur","lastName":"Rzeżutka","uuid":"96C85B61D3E6BA3657F0A0E04C8CE4A1016EFBE59FEB907FB5C3839E3A19929363BE5F9B8C71F56D60D507D45A0D3B09927E0D5EF05EB658908558DB427DC4C1","orcidId":"0000-0001-6301-1143","documentHash":"2a5cb6f9-9a99-43f2-80dc-4cb29ef3c1cf"}],"objectId":"63d0cc6040970729a6619972","publicUri":"https://annals-parasitology.eu/go.live.php/PL-H249/2022-vol-68-suppl-session-ii.html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Genetic diversity of Cryptosporidium parvum strains in cattle in Poland – a cross-sectional population study.","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cryptosporidium parvum (C. parvum) infections are reported in cattle worldwide. Ruminants are not only the reservoir of the parasite for other animal species, but they can also be a source of infection for humans. The aim of the study was an assessment of the prevalence and molecular identification of Cryptosporidium parvum subtypes circulating in the cattle population in Poland.  In total, 1601 faecal samples were collected from cattle at the age of 1 week to 4 months over a period of five years (2014-2018). The animals were kept on 267 farms across 16 Polish provinces. The cattle belonged to 14 breeds, among which the most numerous was Polish Black and White Holstein Friesian (HO), mixed exclusively meat breeds (MM), Simentaler (SM) and Limousine (LM) breeds. Detection of C. parvum strains in faecal samples was performed using the 18 small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) PCR-RFLP method, while the parasite subtypes were determined on the basis of microsatellite sequence analysis of the GP60 gene fragment. A chi-squared (χ2) test was employed to show the relationships between C. parvum subtypes and their prevalence in cattle of different breeds, animals age (age group) and their geographical distribution in Poland. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to assess frequency of infections in cattle caused by particular C. parvum subtypes. The overall prevalence of C. parvum in cattle from Poland was estimated at 6.2% (100/1601). The infected animals were housed in 44 (16.5%) out of 267 monitored farms. \nC. parvum subtypes were successfully identified for 82 out of 100 detected parasite strains, which belonged to the IIa and IId genetic families. In the genetic group IIa, the following subtypes were identified IIaA17G1R1 (n = 26), IIaA17G2R1 (n = 24),  IIaA15G2R1 (n = 10), IIaA16G1R1b (n = 9), IIaA22G1R1 (n = 4), IIaA14G2R1 (n = 2), IIaA10G1R1 (n = 2), IIaA21G1R1 (n = 1), IIaA18G3R1 (n = 1) and IIaA21R1 (n = 1). The IId genetic family was only represented by IIdA24G1 subtype (n = 2). In this study, five new C. parvum subtypes (A21R1, A18G3R1, A22G1R1, A21G1R1 and A14G2R1) were detected.

Recently, a novel hantavirus (Brno loanvirus, BRNV) was identified in common noctule bats (Nyctalus noctula) in the Czech Republic, but nothing is known about its\ngeographical range and prevalence. The objective of this study was to evaluate the distribution and host specificity of BRNV by testing bats from neighbouring countries Germany, Austria and Poland. One thousand forty-seven bats representing 21 species from Germany, 464 bats representing 18 species from Austria and 77 bats representing 12 species from Poland were screened by L segment broad-spectrum nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or by BRNVspecific real-time RT-PCR. Three common noctules from Germany, one common noctule from Austria and three common noctules from Poland were positive in the hantavirus RNA screening. Conventional RT-PCR and primer walking resulted in the amplification of partial L segment and (almost) complete S and M segment coding sequences for samples from Germany and partial L segment sequences for samples from Poland. Phylogenetic analysis of these nucleotide sequences showed highest similarity to BRNV from Czech Republic. The exclusive detection of BRNV in common noctules from different countries suggests high host specificity. The RNA detection rate in common noctules ranged between 1 of 207 (0.5%; Austria), 3 of 245 (1.2%; Germany) and 3 of 20 (15%; Poland). In conclusion, this study demonstrates a broader distribution of BRNV in common noctules in Central Europe, but at low to moderate prevalence. Additional studies are needed to prove the zoonotic potential of this hantavirus and evaluate its transmission within bat populations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cc4","5e709342878c28a0473a5d34","5e709342878c28a0473a5d46"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63d0cd5540970729a661a8b2","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc4","63d0cd5540970729a661a8b3","63d0cd5540970729a661a8b4","63d0cd5540970729a661a8b5","63d0cd5540970729a661a8b6","63d0cd5540970729a661a8b7","63d0cd5540970729a661a8b8","5e709342878c28a0473a5d46","63d0cd5540970729a661a8b9","63d0cd5540970729a661a8ba","63d0cd5540970729a661a8bb","5e709342878c28a0473a5d34","63d0cd5540970729a661a8bc","63d0cd5540970729a661a8bd","63d0cd5540970729a661a8be","63d0cd5540970729a661a8bf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a7e","mniswId":"20154","title":"VIRUS GENES","issn":"0920-8569","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"38a20561-26d1-4a64-a2d7-69ffb41d4120"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d0cd5540970729a661a8b1","year":"2022","documentHash":"fc3c7673-d74e-4caa-8be9-18cf5540b062"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hantavirus","bats","RT-qPCR","Europe","Host","Host specificity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058463846"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093ed878c28a0473b36c5","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Socha","uuid":"6036D7D79FB2FDA007337AD74DA8CE2A06BA94CA316C1481598BAB1EEA1C0EB837183E2A083D8667A9FABD63781EA3F34A131ABDDF2FAE34F4D7B3042BA7CD76","documentHash":"cf42920a-12a6-4167-a84a-a72b77b3acc1"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d34","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Rola","uuid":"CA7CCA550D77B38C39C512D0BF1E1DD989B16A76C798CB003E76583649A413F1CC14D38A1D3A86639806ABD695B555AEFBBA4519ACEEB3448008E1F7F45415DE","documentHash":"9968525a-6722-4aa3-9451-1d6ca31f42fa"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cb1","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Larska","uuid":"B141F329FCEAE537CBBD403DB20EF5682F61733751D3074FAE52498A02662E8A698C6E4BB506A212CBCAAD49E882CE3BC8B3B325375745B32F8A6A5A8D07E028","documentHash":"59dda705-be56-4ee7-9d4e-6b4b6bc19fd5"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b2e","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Bednarek","uuid":"AA380B7BF0343A0E6141C8BEB7A3A3EBA04C0325698ADAC0767395B7733F03E24AC85A07BDC4328B7A7E130BDBCB2936B49228B3631DD800F1FFE3014F1E0747","documentHash":"32d8ef0b-98a5-4824-a096-10d65df496a1"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"NOVEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"6391b91e40970764e07df7d4","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2022-0059","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2022-0059","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Occurrence of bovine coronavirus and other major respiratory viruses in cattle in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Bovine  coronavirus  (BCoV)  is  a  causative  agent  of  enteric  and  respiratory  diseases  in  cattle.  Despite  its importance for animal health, no data is available on its prevalence in Poland. The aim of the study was to determine the virus’ seroprevalence, identify risk factors of BCoV exposure in selected cattle farms and investigate the genetic variability of circulating strains. Material and Methods: Serum and nasal swab samples were collected from 296 individuals from 51 cattle herds. Serum samples  were  tested  with  ELISA  for  the  presence  of  BCoV-,  bovine  herpesvirus-1  (BoHV-1)- and bovine  viral  diarrhoea  virus (BVDV)-specific  antibodies.  The  presence  of  those  viruses  in  nasal  swabs  was  tested  by  real-time  PCR  assays.  Phylogenetic analysis was performed using fragments of the BCoV S gene. Results: Antibodies specific to BCoV were found in 215 (72.6%) animals.  Seropositivity  for  BCoV  was  more  frequent  (P>0.05)  in  calves  under  6  months  of  age, animals with  respiratory  signs coinfected with BoHV-1 and BVDV and increased with herd size. In the final model, age and herd size were established as risk factors for BCoV-seropositivity. Genetic material of BCoV was found in 31 (10.5%) animals.

However, little is known about pharmacologically active dyes (PADs) as contaminants of water bodies. PADs are used in medicine, but due to their colouring properties are also applied in the textile, cosmetic and food industries. Their large-scale production and widespread applications have caused these dyes permeate to the aquatic environment. The pharmacological activity and toxicological properties of some of these dyes, caused their occurrence in water should be monitored. Up to now, PADs such as crystal violet, malachite green, methylene blue, rhodamine B, have been determined in the water of Greater China and Iran. However, there is no data on whether PADs pose an environmental problem for water bodies in Poland. Thus, different water samples were collected and analysed by the UPLC-MS/MS method allowing the determination of 20 PADs. The tests showed that dyes such as crystal violet, methyl violet 2 B and rhodamine B were found in 2 out of 36 water reservoirs (0.0122–0.0594 μgL−1). The environmental risk assessment indicated that determined dyes for most model organisms did not pose a risk. Only the presence of methyl violet 2 B (0.0571 μgL−1) was related to a low risk for rohu carp, and crystal violet (0.0122–0.0209 μgL−1) showed a moderate risk for medaka fish. The occurrence of PADs was tested on a larger scale in the water samples collected from different water reservoirs in Poland. Based on obtained results, 96.3% of water samples collected from different water bodies (94.5%) were free from dyes. Thus, it could be stated that generally environmental water of Poland is contaminated with PADs at a low level. On the other hand, the presence of dyes in two samples indicates that PADs permeate the water environment, and their occurrence should be monitored."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cbe","5e7092cb878c28a04739cba8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e7091be878c28a0473873e6","uid":"bjr0Fzhi6lCIBPIlgtZV-yQ","uuid":"4611b28a-6260-47b7-9d4e-91a956560cf1","name":"Instytut Biologicznych Podstaw Produkcji Zwierzęcej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092cb878c28a04739cba8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"313","pagesFromTo":"137432","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092cb878c28a04739cba8","5e709342878c28a0473a5cbe"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775f8","mniswId":"3525","title":"Chemosphere","issn":"0045-6535","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"58ab338e-e160-4952-ac84-e8a482aef1f5"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058491199"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61de4b387523403b69b1edb6","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Makuch","uuid":"079E75E66A56EF9114ACB032FB5F47258B7425A6A31A8F4C8628B5CCDAB457B66749B6E7B13574FDECA1FE566A7A5F4F161939EB88A4AD43FE3DFB13F2C81E4D","documentHash":"71b2b08e-d6cb-4bdc-bd27-3c21d9827d63"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de1","name":"Beata","lastName":"Kozak","uuid":"CEE5882E6C193DBE0F98D5C2FC3B7DB9B66C86B0058B170085FD64BD99C3ED5B5029A560577F05D3FEBB319547808B0A8743E47866216A0C2B3BC88B2EB35FCF","documentHash":"32f7bb03-c091-4ee8-b85f-35e479c90af6"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0dd7","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Goldsztejn","uuid":"056600265DD18571E0E6CF0A6100C077294EF7F9327D440939DB6C34559F4AF1A2DB09FE73763A73D12C9A56726DC8D7A8AFCF3CB7977373686933BBF9388FC7","documentHash":"f3f5dd5e-f7a4-4d92-8da6-50a2ff936732"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be32e","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Grenda","uuid":"CF958B02676009543D65CA321E8D0993A72E1F37E14B29DFBCAB4D67FE565141335A5FC2B1963B1BBDF2129C473FCB8368739DC1491743E8490EC7173D11FBBB","orcidId":"0000-0003-4619-128X","documentHash":"1f087e56-ff66-4725-a794-0fab079f2636"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5caf","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kwiatek","uuid":"483AF17960E9A333131A70EFECF6469DB4B390ED1FC80958251A4DC48A21C1BB31E13F4FFF4619F4F3D2845908B5F84A67F567F444E8C826335B0675F5060620","documentHash":"2cd83ba7-a483-4b03-b3b0-14728060cac8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"63986696409707085969de33","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2022-0060","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2022-0060","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Potential risk of botulinum neurotoxin -producing clostridia occurrence in canned fish","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Heat  treatment  is indispensable in  fish  canning  to provide  an  acceptable  shelf  life. Its  optimisation  reduces the  risk  of  the  presence  of Clostridium  botulinum spores,  which  could  potentially  cause  botulism  cases.  This  study  evaluated canned   fish   samples   for   botulism   neurotoxin   (BoNT)-producing   clostridia   contamination   and   can   bulging   through microbiological   contaminant   growth.   A   new   analytical   approach   was   developed   for   detection   of   such   clostridia   and phenotypically  similar  species. Material  and  Methods: A  total  of  70  canned  fish  samples suspected  of  exhibiting  bulging features were analysed. Culture methods were used to detect clostridia. The isolates obtained were evaluated on the basis of the exhibited phenotypic characteristics. Also, PCRs were used for the detection of genes determining BoNT production (non-toxic non-haemagglutinin  (ntnh) genes) and  the  amplification  of  conservative  16S  rDNA  genes,  which  were  Sanger  sequenced.  The obtained  sequences  were  analysed  using  the  Basic  Local  Alignment  Search  Tool. Results: Clostridium genus  species  were isolated  from  17  (24%)  bulging  and  organoleptically changed  samples.  No ntnh genes  were  present  in  these  isolates;  however, sequencing confirmed the presence of C. sporogenes, a species with close affinity to C. botulinum. Conclusion: To  eliminate the threat  of  foodborne  botulism,  laboratory  diagnostic  techniques  must  detect  species  of  the Clostridium genus  and  elucidate  their ability  to  produce  BoNTs.  Although Clostridium  botulinum is  the  most  common  cause  of  botulism,  the  possibility  may  not  be ignored that non-pathogenic Clostridium species may acquire botulinum toxigenicity. The similarity between the isolated strains of C.  sporogenes and C.  botulinum should  be  incorporated  in  the  optimisation  of  heat  treatment  to  guarantee  a  sterilised, microbiologically safe product."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5caf","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de1","5e70947c878c28a0473be32e","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0dd7","61de4b387523403b69b1edb6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"0","issue":"0","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61de4b387523403b69b1edb6","5e70947c878c28a0473be32e","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0dd7","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de1","5e709342878c28a0473a5caf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebffdcead49b31ccece4fb3","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research","issn":"2450-8608","documentHash":"287fa6d2-77d3-4359-b58d-23d047d5d8d7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62ba9ebc409707490d794fe6","year":"2022","volume":"0","number":"0","documentHash":"79fdc775-77ac-41bd-bb8c-55a8262f7fa0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Clostridium sporogenes","Clostridium botulinum","canned fish","microbiological contamination"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058494535"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63ef4f294097075fda407446","name":"Arias","lastName":"Marisa","documentHash":"1d3f04b7-90d8-45cd-af43-e742bd029e28"},{"objectId":"63ef4f294097075fda407445","name":"Simona","lastName":"Pileviciene","documentHash":"90e55d10-3c49-4a6e-a107-c8eb4aa670c9"},{"objectId":"63ef4f294097075fda407444","name":"Petr","lastName":"Václavek","documentHash":"fd41faf6-0397-4220-9037-0ee0e3ab0cd7"},{"objectId":"63ef4f294097075fda407443","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Feliziani","documentHash":"5407aadc-7142-46d8-a5dc-931d3d755afa"},{"objectId":"63ef4f294097075fda407442","name":"Imbi","lastName":"Nurmoja","documentHash":"ad16145b-fe6a-4729-a095-f6d9b685e8c6"},{"objectId":"63ef4f294097075fda407441","name":"Eleni","lastName":"Chondrokouki","documentHash":"52a5de2e-7f79-4138-bbd0-a9935c557b03"},{"objectId":"63ef4f294097075fda407440","name":"Vesna","lastName":"Milicevik","documentHash":"e98bb651-e8d0-4c89-8806-19abdd3136cd"},{"objectId":"63ef4f294097075fda40743f","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Donescu","documentHash":"cb2e1f83-2c62-4f25-aa6f-5b22152be4b2"},{"objectId":"63ef4f294097075fda40743e","name":"Emiliya","lastName":"Ivanova","documentHash":"15600a54-3c7b-46a0-bcd6-4c789d777740"},{"objectId":"63ef4f294097075fda40743d","name":"Alicia","lastName":"Simon","documentHash":"ff4395c4-54e8-4ef6-a7ed-017e3a1093c4"},{"objectId":"63ef4f294097075fda40743c","name":"Covadonga","lastName":"Perez","documentHash":"afc55b77-6aec-405e-878b-1aaa88b7c5b8"},{"objectId":"63ef4f294097075fda40743b","name":"Raquel","lastName":"Nieto","documentHash":"3832d7e1-5d7b-485d-b881-17d71f7fc19f"},{"objectId":"63ef4f294097075fda40743a","name":"Encarnación","lastName":"Madueño","documentHash":"8e5419b7-664a-4ffc-8350-f54f2f813fe9"},{"objectId":"63ef4f294097075fda407439","name":"Laura","lastName":"Krivko","documentHash":"98e6faf2-1d04-4dfa-bf10-10e3b8c1a22e"},{"objectId":"63ef4f294097075fda407438","name":"Igor","lastName":"Djadjovski","documentHash":"34407236-fdca-4dd8-9d54-16648b3399f1"},{"objectId":"63ef4f294097075fda407437","name":"Alejandro","lastName":"Soler","documentHash":"b29e4450-3998-413e-a826-d5ec052f5486"},{"objectId":"63ef4f294097075fda407436","name":"Nadia","lastName":"Casado","documentHash":"c5d75a84-b580-483b-a304-380b18cdb0a3"},{"objectId":"63ef4f294097075fda407435","name":"Carmina","lastName":"Gallardo","documentHash":"524b13e6-e47f-4769-81bc-b60bb5d8d188"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a660f","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Frant","uuid":"2AD73901C2B1BDDF66264197B4E2A40BB43C9F170B0D3D9252C79378D973DED6BA0DD7DB0E3F16FB50489E4717CA62BAE671805ED94AD0C5F9B3478EE3C561FE","orcidId":"0000-0002-7169-3735","documentHash":"b81b59e2-56af-4ed2-bfbe-bdf26cc5f824"}],"objectId":"63ef4f294097075fda407433","doi":"10.3389/fvets.2023.1112850","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2023.1112850/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"A multi gene-approach genotyping method identifies 24 genetic clusters within the genotype II-European African swine fever viruses circulating from 2007 to 2022","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: African swine fever (ASF) is a contagious viral disease of pigs and wild boar that poses a major threat to the global swine industry. The genotype II African swine fever virus (ASFV) entered the European Union (EU) in 2014 and since then fourteen countries have been affected, Italy and North Macedonia being the last in 2022. While whole genome sequencing remains the gold standard for the identification of new genetic markers, sequencing of multiple loci with significant variations could be used as a rapid and cost-effective alternative to track outbreaks and study disease evolution in endemic areas.\nMaterials and methods: To further our understanding of the epidemiology and spread of ASFV in Europe, 382 isolates collected during 2007 to 2022 were sequenced. The study was initially performed by sequencing the central variable region (CVR), the intergenic region (IGR) between the I73R and I329L genes and the O174L and K145R genes. For further discrimination, two new PCRs were designed to amplify the IGR between the 9R and 10R genes of the multigene family 505 (MGF505) and the IGR between the I329L and I215L genes. The sequences obtained were compared with genotype II isolates from Europe and Asia.\nResults: The combination of the results obtained by sequencing these variable regions allowed to differentiate the European II-ASFV genotypes into 24 different groups. In addition, the SNP identified in the IGR I329L-I215L region, not previously described, grouped the viruses from North Macedonia that caused the 2022 outbreaks with viruses from Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia and Greece, differentiating from other genotype II isolates present in Europe and Asia. Furthermore, tandem repeat sequence (TRS) within the 9R-10R genes of the multigene family 505 (MGF505) revealed eight different variants circulating.\nDiscussion: These findings describe a new multi-gene approach sequencing method that can be used in routine genotyping to determine the origin of new introductions in ASF-free areas and track infection dynamics in endemic areas."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a660f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"1112850","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63ef4f294097075fda407435","63ef4f294097075fda407436","63ef4f294097075fda407437","63ef4f294097075fda407438","63ef4f294097075fda407439","63ef4f294097075fda40743a","63ef4f294097075fda40743b","63ef4f294097075fda40743c","63ef4f294097075fda40743d","63ef4f294097075fda40743e","63ef4f294097075fda40743f","63ef4f294097075fda407440","63ef4f294097075fda407441","63ef4f294097075fda407442","5e709347878c28a0473a660f","63ef4f294097075fda407443","63ef4f294097075fda407444","63ef4f294097075fda407445","63ef4f294097075fda407446"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb3","mniswId":"22511","title":"Frontiers in Veterinary Science","issn":"2297-1769","eissn":"2297-1769","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"7aca7674-d53a-406a-bc77-ca524899ec80"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ef4f294097075fda407434","year":"2023","volume":"10","documentHash":"6a6ac8c2-1110-4e8c-b867-2e26bb4e0532"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ASFV","genotyping","TRS","SNP","genetic groups"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058498490"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646f10824097076e9c3e3325","name":"Francesca","lastName":"Pedonese","documentHash":"87cda94a-2596-42bc-8840-9d9e3afb78cd"},{"objectId":"646f10824097076e9c3e3324","name":"Filippo","lastName":"Fratini","documentHash":"30d5373c-0147-47c1-ade6-f263099d5482"},{"objectId":"646f10824097076e9c3e3322","name":"Giuliano","lastName":"Garofolo","documentHash":"8d493bb3-6d07-4273-be3c-c2052afd1fd8"},{"objectId":"646f10824097076e9c3e3321","name":"Francesca","lastName":"Marotta","documentHash":"df692826-80db-4bdd-b74d-f0ea4b11c8e4"},{"objectId":"646f10824097076e9c3e3320","name":"Beatrice","lastName":"Torracca","documentHash":"f0bf1cc8-cb52-4ef0-9f63-4b67e5e3b9af"},{"objectId":"5fcb1fa4085dcb666aca2a6d","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Michalak","uuid":"90063D3C94A1393F1BAB368FF761C42AC4F376B6677EE0F53759ED399827EB1EBC026F2FD13BE28AEC2C01802D580E498EAEF8A08239A6E90921535125C99974","orcidId":"0000-0002-4249-9810","documentHash":"2e214177-8c9a-46fd-b0b1-b1ad4cb37fa0"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d66","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Wieczorek","uuid":"77FE94937137879573023F0D11FD72EFFDFDC4214863FDBF15FEEF0A6BDFD2ABA69978BCCFC9FF88D0F012F09560030758068F57DE1D27D7EB8B20C442DC9439","orcidId":"0000-0001-8268-3885","documentHash":"e54d106b-ea77-4715-815a-37b17126e9c0"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398363","name":"Michał","lastName":"Gondek","uuid":"3E679DAAFA8A3443F19D9A56A56F6A3E6F1F2D59A50F58A8C8FC3CAE9502966BF082F91011A1959CD0E67DDC9BF2BCA0A7A7E945A625A7947D4BD53314E07986","orcidId":"0000-0001-6613-1132","documentHash":"3ab57d41-9458-4c05-b24b-0627e8d13bf6"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390b84","name":"Monika","lastName":"Ziomek","uuid":"C9632519B7E752D8E5C90408CE6EE086E9F5778D192221CF2CC428B5D6A267E8C11DBEDA2FB355C660C1C80FD573B639FA222C5D71FE8873B0F073F4E0DDF5C3","orcidId":"0000-0002-1332-4026","documentHash":"ca230a00-c03a-4fb2-ac36-22d9c9ed988b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-10","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63ef518a4097075fda409fb4","doi":"10.3390/foods12040778","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/12/4/778","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Occurrence of campylobacter in faeces, livers and carcasses of wild boars hunted in Tuscany (Italy) and evaluation of MALDI-TOF MS for the identification of campylobacter species","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A total of 193 wild boars hunted in Tuscany, an Italian region with a high presence of wild ungulates, were examined to assess the occurrence of Campylobacter species in faeces, bile, liver and carcasses, with the aim of clarifying their contribution to human infection through the food chain.

The Campylobacter species genotypically identified were C. coli, C. lanienae, C. jejuni and C. hyointestinalis. The prevalent species transpired to be C. coli and C. lanienae, which were isolated from all the matrices; C. jejuni was present in faeces and liver, while C. hyointestinalis only in faeces. Identification was carried out by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) on 66 out of 100 isolates identified genotypically, and the technique yielded unsatisfactory results in the case of C. lanienae, which is responsible for sporadic human disease cases.

We tested a total of 126 poultry flocks, including geese (N = 20), ducks (N = 42), turkeys (N = 64) and 19 wild geese, including greater white-fronted geese (N = 9), greylag geese (N = 5) and Taiga bean geese (N = 5). Tracheal swabs were examined for RA using a PCR targeting a conserved region of the 16S rRNA gene. Selected PCR products were sequenced to perform the phylogenetic analysis. Among the commercial poultry, the highest RA prevalence was found in flocks of ducks (35.7%) and geese (30.0%), whereas the lowest one was found in turkeys (3.2%). Most tested wild geese (94.7%) were RA positive. The phylogenetic analysis showed relatively low genetic diversity of the sequences analyzed, which gathered in two clusters of the phylogenetic tree, and the minimum nucleotide identity was 98.6%.

The virus is prone to genetic changes through mutations and reassortment, which drive the emergence of new variants and lead to a change in the epidemiological situation in a field. Such a situation is currently being reported due to a large wave of IBDV A3B1 reassortant infections in northwestern Europe. On the other hand, in Poland,which is the largest producer of chicken meat in the EU, the IBDVs of genotypes A3B2 and A3B4 were circulating just before the emergence of A3B1 reassortants. The purpose of the presented study was to update the IBDV epidemiological situation. The performed molecular survey based on the sequence of both genome segments showed the presence of very virulent strains (A3B2)and reassortants of genotypes A3B4 and A3B1; moreover, two of these genotypes are newly introduced IBDV lineages. In addition, a number of amino acid substitutions were demonstrated, including within antigenic epitopes and virulence determinants. In conclusion, the results obtained indicated a dynamic epidemiological situation in Poland, which highlights the need for further monitoring studies in the region and verification of protection conferred by the vaccines used against infection with detected IBDV."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0def","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c3","5e709341878c28a0473a5b5a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"289","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947c878c28a0473be3c3","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0def","5e709341878c28a0473a5b5a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a80","mniswId":"20156","title":"Viruses","issn":"1999-4915","eissn":"1999-4915","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses","documentHash":"204f8987-0c7c-441b-9f4a-748747147d4e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ef4b884097075fda40467d","year":"2023","volume":"15","number":"2","documentHash":"bb7ec5e6-2f2d-4ff6-983c-1703dee4c918"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["infectious bursal disease virus","molecular survey","genetic evolution","reassortment"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058519583"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d66","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Wieczorek","uuid":"77FE94937137879573023F0D11FD72EFFDFDC4214863FDBF15FEEF0A6BDFD2ABA69978BCCFC9FF88D0F012F09560030758068F57DE1D27D7EB8B20C442DC9439","orcidId":"0000-0001-8268-3885","documentHash":"e54d106b-ea77-4715-815a-37b17126e9c0"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Osek","uuid":"09D7D5320F1FC606BCE9C2D945933A9AD76A02E8625F591A249FCC889F47698A9DDB27A314BD598D2BEBE05552FA565585514F11E04F6B15DA221089044711E2","orcidId":"0000-0003-2295-8837","documentHash":"6dc7582e-e613-4ee9-9ee7-81d949533982"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"63ad867a4097070d11bf423f","doi":"10.3390/pathogens11121491","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/11/12/1491/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Listeria monocytogenes—How This Pathogen Uses Its Virulence Mechanisms to Infect the Hosts","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Listeriosis is a serious food-borne illness, especially in susceptible populations, including\nchildren, pregnant women, and elderlies. The disease can occur in two forms: non-invasive febrile gastroenteritis and severe invasive listeriosis with septicemia, meningoencephalitis, perinatal infections, and abortion. Expression of each symptom depends on various bacterial virulence factors,immunological status of the infected person, and the number of ingested bacteria. Internalins, mainly InlA and InlB, invasins (invasin A, LAP), and other surface adhesion proteins (InlP1, InlP4) are responsible for epithelial cell binding, whereas internalin C (InlC) and actin assembly-inducing protein (ActA) are involved in cell-to-cell bacterial spread. L. monocytogenes is able to disseminate through the blood and invade diverse host organs. In persons with impaired immunity, the elderly, and pregnant women, the pathogen can also cross the blood–brain and placental barriers, which results in the invasion of the central nervous system and fetus infection, respectively. The aim of this comprehensive review is to summarize the current knowledge on the epidemiology of listeriosis and L. monocytogenes virulence mechanisms that are involved in host infection, with a special focus on their molecular and cellular aspects. We believe that all this information is crucial for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of L. monocytogenes infection."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d66","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"1491","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9","5e709342878c28a0473a5d66"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceac","mniswId":"15767","title":"Pathogens","issn":"2076-0817","eissn":"2076-0817","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0aee51de-2ae0-4570-a31e-61056cf6d598"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"637f5222409707772c2106ac","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"12","documentHash":"94e55155-bc80-4321-8749-3515f9d4c03f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["L. monocytogenes","listeriosis","virulence traits","host infection","molecular mechanisms"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058529735"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093de878c28a0473b23ae","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Kutyła","uuid":"FEAB5690018F793E8CF237DDE61E3B5FE5F6C0D2390454FC0205ED911E3E6610A7FA5FF1FF85822FBF5F085F7D3B90FCB3B7426755B47F595ADB07E2321C31FD","orcidId":"0000-0002-1171-897X","documentHash":"bbaea569-646e-4b17-91d3-d51fcfd183a3"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a660f","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Frant","uuid":"2AD73901C2B1BDDF66264197B4E2A40BB43C9F170B0D3D9252C79378D973DED6BA0DD7DB0E3F16FB50489E4717CA62BAE671805ED94AD0C5F9B3478EE3C561FE","orcidId":"0000-0002-7169-3735","documentHash":"b81b59e2-56af-4ed2-bfbe-bdf26cc5f824"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a658b","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Deryło","uuid":"D93206900A0BE0AAFFB82C1B63F5D5B5FBF814B698BC69DC5A4C32B71C5316A3D5CF7F857237B22D8EA2E4D3FC38D63859F7B8325FD82FDC9A5B12598BAF00FC","orcidId":"0000-0002-9807-212X","documentHash":"ca36ef54-69a6-4459-863b-26254db98f2e"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a04739ff65","name":"Roman","lastName":"Paduch","uuid":"F9972A22A8A2D8DED0A8E63EB51AD566FBFE04ECA1CC918EB3F89B1573DAEDBCCC03FD48FFFDE1AA8480B469CF9B41D5F879DC7B7E0A07575C24750C9B94B08E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9779-7252","documentHash":"b9cba0eb-5d37-4836-b507-5c73349c68ee"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a04739ff63","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Trytek","uuid":"983C9A7864211DC29E5759E944D34935AACA816C03F6DF04FDF108BD24C2E9FB3DFF70971273A59BE068665722B607848B1C87542967E0D23B8C9CBDAD98F91C","orcidId":"0000-0002-4656-7737","documentHash":"59926515-7bdf-4123-ab1e-e0aa53359849"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64221e164097075f21b59a8d","doi":"10.3390/molecules28072907","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/28/7/2907","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Cellular Localization of Selected Porphyrins and Their Effect on the In Vitro Motility of Human Colon Tumors and Normal Cells","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Standard therapies for colorectal cancer cannot eliminate or sufficiently reduce the metastasis process. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) may be an alternative to minimizing this problem. Here, we examined the cellular localization of selected porphyrins and determined whether free-base and manganese (III) metallated porphyrins may limit colon cancer cells’ (HT29) or normal colon epithelial cells’ (CCD 841 CoTr) motility in vitro. White light irradiation was used to initiate the photodynamic effect. Porphyrin uptake by the cells was determined by porphyrin fluorescence measurements through the use of confocal microscopy. Free-base porphyrin was found in cells, where it initially localized at the edge of the cytoplasm and later in the perinuclear area. The concentrations of porphyrins had no effect on cancer cell migration but had a significant effect on normal cell motility. Due to the low concentrations of porphyrins used, no changes in F-actin filaments of the cellular cytoskeleton were detected. Signal transmission via connexons between neighbouring cells was limited to a maximum of 40 µm for HT29 and 30 µm for CCD 841 CoTr cells. The tested porphyrins differed in their activity against the tumor and normal cells’ migration capacity. Depending on the porphyrin used and the type of cells, their migration changed in relation to the control sample. The use of white light may change the activity of the porphyrins relative to the migratory capacity of the cells. The aim of the present study was to analyse the intracellular localization of tested porphyrins and their influence on the mobility of cells after irradiation with harmless white light."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6c","uid":"bdnPLFswu7CLH3zqfWKU3YA","uuid":"ac18272d-83a2-4141-aa4e-01e904b4a061","name":"Wydział Biologii i Biotechnologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f5878c28a04739ff63","5e7093de878c28a0473b23ae","5e7092f5878c28a04739ff65"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a660f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"28","issue":"7","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f5878c28a04739ff63","5e709347878c28a0473a658b","5e7093de878c28a0473b23ae","5e7092f5878c28a04739ff65","5e709347878c28a0473a660f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","issn":"1420-3049","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"85ea3d3d-2670-4384-98ee-1b5b44edab21"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["porphyrin","human colon tumor and normal cell lines","PDT","cell migration","cellular localization"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058549465"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64351b614097074edd5d8b0a","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Radulski","documentHash":"507d1790-325b-4dfb-a2d5-b821cfb853bd"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c1","name":"Monika","lastName":"Krajewska-Wędzina","uuid":"48D96FF61147929F46D201644057AF91FD057455FC10757C30FB62096A475BDC285317D0DC9C8B59939D198E75553F0070726157DEA9152E0CC73FA3968F8714","orcidId":"0000-0002-5826-2068","documentHash":"59c09ee7-3423-47a7-a7e0-af93754cdebf"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a55","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Augustynowicz-Kopeć","uuid":"5D39A4E093F95952C32CFC093E74B37A20C8E88FA81DD9C5C9172D78AF7C28E097A2D8A806159D9D051FA21E7BE33A74D22910267E2AADE426BD4FCE975C1EF0","orcidId":"0000-0001-6162-8748","documentHash":"5714c8d6-ce35-4192-ab7e-1ca6b7c4eb02"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b592d","name":"Anna","lastName":"Zabost","uuid":"DA010F310E19DFDDD92265695FC0D8F7F5131D8390A577D2B885ADF716DBC437215D7D9832CDC6D3A07C3C6847AB6101EE8254699EAE4827BED377AE29119ABE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2781-9844","documentHash":"3e76dbd4-265f-4cda-8fee-174a4eae8180"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d60","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Weiner","uuid":"6F362BA6B8673122F182DA095CD12CFFBBB8ABC7719D8D0AE9DA7BD0C825DA9490A2EAD9D395668512F559153D99CA0AD2C5811E46D5E2A4AE5DB472119E75E7","orcidId":"0000-0001-9288-0823","documentHash":"48da675e-c292-4d71-b863-bfa49cd380c3"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cb3","name":"Marek","lastName":"Lipiec","uuid":"99D34DD10FC128F474E1D79FE96A6FF2D2E2C9B6C3F0F51FA3B74C896A3FF1FABE620E0B34B63F850E666345D0727684A9CBB59BA79D24BAB27AEE28E98771C7","documentHash":"b42fadfc-6682-4ad6-9f5e-1ab5a8ca8147"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-07","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64351b614097074edd5d8b08","doi":"10.3390/pathogens12040570","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/12/4/570","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Mycobacterial Infections in Invasive Turtle Species in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Over the last 30 years, the number of invasive turtle species living in the wild has significantly increased in Poland.

In order to confirm or rule out the presence of acid-fast mycobacteria in the population of invasive turtle species, samples from carapace, plastron, internal organs and mouth cavity swabs from 125 animals were tested. Twenty-eight mycobacterial strains were isolated in culture, which were classified as atypical following multiplex-PCR reactions. The GenoType Mycobacterium Common Mycobacteria (CM) test, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PRA)-hsp65 and DNA sequencing were used to identify the species of isolates. Of the 28 strains, 11 were identified as M. fortuitum, 10 as M. chelonae, 3 as M. avium ssp. avium, 2 as M. nonchromogenicum and 1 each of M. neoaurum and M. scrofulaceum.

We also used a systematic review to summarize the available literature data on Cd, Pb, and other studied elements in the liver of both eagle species. Analyses of trace elements in the liver samples of the Polish eagles revealed interspecific differences in Cd, Cu, and Mn and differences in Co, Mn, Tl, and Zn among study regions. All elements tested except Pb were below the suggested thresholds linked with adverse health effects in birds. The hepatic Pb found in almost half of all the tested individuals suggests environmental exposure to this toxic element. One of the tested white-tailed eagles had hepatic Pb above the threshold of sublethal poisoning. Although our results seem optimistic, as previous Polish studies showed a higher prevalence of birds with hepatic Pb exceeding the toxicity threshold, they indicate that exposure to this toxic metal could still pose an additional threat to the health of Polish eagles."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d4b","63bbf8c440970754861e6142","5e709341878c28a0473a5b68","5e70947e878c28a0473be61c","5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d47","63bbf8c440970754861e6143"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-16","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947e878c28a0473be61c","5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d47","63bbf8c440970754861e6141","63bbf8c440970754861e6142","5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d4b","63bbf8c440970754861e6143","5e709341878c28a0473a5b68"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b16","mniswId":"5845","title":"Environmental Science and Pollution Research","issn":"0944-1344","eissn":"1614-7499","documentHash":"a276ab08-d4e3-4e6f-8f21-94c32ed97f96"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62e7616140970778ffa5a808","year":"2022","documentHash":"e5e14e4a-da57-4239-bc0b-c53b04c53b57"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Biomonitoring","Eagles","Exposure","Metalloids","Trace metals","Raptors","Lead","Cadmium"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058576857"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63b4f2b975234021979cd4e4","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Bełcik","uuid":"77661344F288929533CF8A7024A5412F3C69BE81B07E6C3DDDFADECC0C99EAEFCB8C3D85174909E18CB495D581F97E71C6C20AA3A805B92F0FFDE5E6E231C6A8","documentHash":"40a2e3d1-fc18-4a0f-b2f8-f831313648e7"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d79","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Bilska-Zając","uuid":"CA37D40E9E6221954C0E1F92525EB13B265614DDB637B5261A39B130F380056543A7F0D2E0AE9B7220F35F148187F484510166AABC45E68EC5A47A105D08B099","documentHash":"fb1618f1-0e83-472f-b325-e0c87f8a8872"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Korpysa-Dzirba","uuid":"0F6E5299BA1DE2C04CCB23BB69EE8BB0AF924331950608E7B9E07C962AC58BA926288AB7400DBD5FDFA0B8F25E5B3E11F82C54FC732A0E0269E9C0A9EB906901","orcidId":"0000-0002-8266-581X","documentHash":"a20ea112-853c-4a02-89cc-69a1868143b6"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Sroka","uuid":"D54BE4B84093A5FF9739FB665CBF54EE2891B37B53478AF0F1029745E62033C7B88C51B2D726FDAE584BE9DC2EE3F8CEA3FA851EB5B8089D8737B1A062F9CDC5","orcidId":"0000-0002-7372-7636","documentHash":"f04c53ae-faa6-4609-a0d2-57b9784ca2da"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Karamon","uuid":"6FC652281DC3E7CEE5831D48F355BCC0E37B505605D00AA8D389A74796325ECB25D4E136854D3D774EDD0E3C95277099BB6981BCE201CE127F3B8AE5C7651C14","orcidId":"0000-0002-5830-167X","documentHash":"0d343e52-20ea-4cfe-a213-5c134e4fef07"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b50","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Cencek","uuid":"7D7F433A7A31D1A4D080277B2FE49ED9F5B45115086FAEDA03BCF07F6AB6D09B61EC0E8015CEEA44A992C6D7E5DD06BB406798BF1E7065879BA9ED1F3FC8E8D3","orcidId":"0000-0003-3649-7867","documentHash":"7aa79c92-3af1-40b7-85e2-872b041c4104"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"MARCH","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"6422ad034097072924c367b7","doi":"10.3390/foods12061320","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/12/6/1320/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Scheme of Effective Epidemiological Investigations in Trichinella Outbreaks on Pig Farms","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Trichinellosis is a parasitic, zoonotic disease caused by larvae of the genus Trichinella. Infection occurs via the consumption of raw or undercooked meat containing this parasite. Symptoms of the disease manifest as intestinal disorders, followed by facial swelling, fever, muscle pain and other symptoms, eventually leading to neurological and cardiac complications and even death. In Europe, trichinellosis is most often associated with the consumption of meat from wild boars, pigs and horses. In recent years, wild boars that are hunted illegally and not tested for Trichinella spp. have been the most common cause of trichinellosis in humans; however, there have also been cases where infected pigs have been the source of infection. When trichinellosis is suspected in humans, epidemiological measures are taken to identify the source. Similarly, an epidemiological investigation should be initiated whenever Trichinella spp. has been detected in pigs. However, commonly used actions do not provide sufficient data to determine the source of infection for pigs and to prevent further transmission. Therefore, in this article, we propose a scheme for effective epidemiological investigations into Trichinella outbreaks on pig farms that can help trace the transmission mechanisms of the parasite and that takes into account currently available testing tools. The proposed pathway can be easily adopted for epidemiological investigations in routine veterinary inspection work."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d79","5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","63b4f2b975234021979cd4e4","5e709341878c28a0473a5b50"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"1320","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d79","5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","63b4f2b975234021979cd4e4","5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","5e709341878c28a0473a5b50"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"Foods","issn":"2304-8158","eissn":"2304-8158","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"827d8888-1217-4c9f-a068-b8a2e5756417"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6422ad034097072924c367b8","year":"2023","volume":"12","number":"6","documentHash":"955b979d-c0c2-45e7-86b5-024dea853537"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Trichinella spp."]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589439"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"602f60e29543c7410626f3e0","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Czech","uuid":"9BCD43F80DD7D0B45C8D275A4F8AF0658BECE8DBADE95F35B5C38721A6F3845F90DFB442A98BD5917C33A68A42129A6EB5EF205C7BBB8AFD784C3FAB787FCE21","orcidId":"0000-0002-9908-3007","documentHash":"788b69f3-6902-4e28-82aa-65eb07bc7be7"},{"objectId":"5e709437878c28a0473b83ce","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Wasiak","uuid":"A60741B2F6C44684B8210C6BD88CE38D65085F1FEA69C024C4C683AD43FB6C5E3603FFD8A7EA6613888E258108EABBC0F2F5DA5B9D13E30D9BFCFA81627948F0","orcidId":"0000-0002-2279-5460","documentHash":"afe435e4-1c3d-46e2-8a2a-f6b817d9bd81"},{"objectId":"5e7093ed878c28a0473b36c5","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Socha","uuid":"6036D7D79FB2FDA007337AD74DA8CE2A06BA94CA316C1481598BAB1EEA1C0EB837183E2A083D8667A9FABD63781EA3F34A131ABDDF2FAE34F4D7B3042BA7CD76","documentHash":"cf42920a-12a6-4167-a84a-a72b77b3acc1"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d3c","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Rożek","uuid":"2BAB6A780316EFAAEC320E5E97DE5D890B7DFDE6551280034295D7F59E9A180EE8C421F5E30C72D662E7E7773800F0F26871C9E41F0D0A2C369158F5326F233A","documentHash":"3bf29025-fb55-4f72-8572-1e655c2f0494"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d34","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Rola","uuid":"CA7CCA550D77B38C39C512D0BF1E1DD989B16A76C798CB003E76583649A413F1CC14D38A1D3A86639806ABD695B555AEFBBA4519ACEEB3448008E1F7F45415DE","documentHash":"9968525a-6722-4aa3-9451-1d6ca31f42fa"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cb0","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kwaśnik","uuid":"12F878DB862CB0869DF014B7AE037949E75B74E1E3BE4FC86C0CC8755DD8D78316A5CF76B1CF4B25B21BC594B7B68DE6DECF5E6D42794B91BD2DB24E05FE03A5","documentHash":"102d4f74-bdfb-47d9-8ae0-f07304205fa1"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-03","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63c7a7ef4097076eb374a72f","doi":"10.3390/ijms24010867","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/1/867","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Protein-Coding Region Derived Small RNA in Exosomes from Influenza A Virus–Infected Cells","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Exosomes may function as multifactorial mediators of cell-to-cell communication, playing crucial roles in both physiological and pathological processes. Exosomes released from virus-infected cells may contain RNA and proteins facilitating infection spread. The purpose of our study was to analyze how the small RNA content of exosomes is affected by infection with the influenza A virus (IAV). Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation after hemadsorption of virions and their small RNA content was identified using high-throughput sequencing. As compared to mock-infected controls, 856 RNA transcripts were significantly differentially expressed in exosomes from IAV-infected cells, including fragments of 458 protein-coding (pcRNA), 336 small, 28 long intergenic non-coding RNA transcripts, and 33 pseudogene transcripts. Upregulated pcRNA species corresponded mainly to proteins associated with translation and antiviral response, and the most upregulated among them were RSAD2, CCDC141 and IFIT2. Downregulated pcRNA species corresponded to proteins associated with the cell cycle and DNA packaging. Analysis of differentially expressed pseudogenes showed that in most cases, an increase in the transcription level of pseudogenes was correlated with an increase in their parental genes. Although the role of exosome RNA in IAV infection remains undefined, the biological processes identified based on the corresponding proteins may indicate the roles of some of its parts in IAV replication."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602f60e29543c7410626f3e0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d3c","5e709342878c28a0473a5d34","5e709342878c28a0473a5cb0","5e7093ed878c28a0473b36c5","5e709437878c28a0473b83ce"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"1-19","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ed878c28a0473b36c5","602f60e29543c7410626f3e0","5e709437878c28a0473b83ce","5e709342878c28a0473a5d34","5e709342878c28a0473a5cb0","5e709342878c28a0473a5d3c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"850accc5-0c0e-4f6c-9a84-eaa108a84f20"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["influenza A virus","exosomes","pcRNA","RSAD2","CCDC141","IFIT2"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058595641"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d63","name":"Marek","lastName":"Pajurek","uuid":"358255257A75C74D59A14A68D4AD1D554284D6EA9DD40FBD386D3E65CF5750BD0AFFF658AA426C816DC388F1A156AECE3148D4AE805CC056A07EFA22690EE5D5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8222-7983","documentHash":"7f676a9f-a4bf-48d6-8a81-13e7fdd64d47"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0dfa","name":"Szczepan","lastName":"Mikołajczyk","uuid":"C57E964869276842E1B6331B9082F2B02A42D6FADD90FF381F756A49C8569C2E04C6F6ABF9E834E4B7AB5848A68D8684085BA83752893DAFEA5BB142A62126BA","orcidId":"0000-0003-0185-174X","documentHash":"40314827-db15-4c91-940f-4476439025a4"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c4","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Warenik-Bany","uuid":"4712B9142F37DE7444F67A0D87EE1C663B7551CC5403CE356609DD8451AC163AE66C02975F4E46C75BA54D138152C7CA025EC98E7A9BBC1C46CE7FDB9A2F3D49","orcidId":"0000-0002-3839-6464","documentHash":"a8205408-5907-4d58-85e1-a99171e81d41"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"APRIL","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"64412bfe409707555e829e2e","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2023-0020","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2023-0020","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls in bivalve molluscs.

The risk to consumers was calculated as a percentage of the tolerable weekly intake (TWI) (2 pg World Health Organization\ntoxic equivalent (WHO-TEQ) kg−1 body weight (b.w.)). Material and Methods: Altogether 32 samples were analysed using\nan isotope dilution technique with high resolution gas chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry. Results:\nLow levels of all analysed compounds were found. The range of PCDD/Fs was 0.08–0.37 pg WHO-TEQ g−1 of wet weight (w.w.)\nand 0.04–0.41 pg WHO-TEQ g−1 w.w. for DL-PCBs. The highest concentrations of all analysed compounds were found in Pacific\noysters, at 0.30 pg WHO-TEQ g−1 w.w. for the sum of PCDD/Fs and 0.19 pg WHO-TEQ g−1 for the sum of DL-PCBs. These\nconcentrations were 2–4 times higher than those detected in the other analysed mollusc species. Different species-dependent\ncongener profiles were observed for PCDD/F concentrations, while PCB congener concentration profiles were species independent.\nThe risk to consumers was assessed relating theoretical intakes of PCDD/Fs and DL-PCBs per 25, 50 and 100 g of consumption\nof molluscs per week to the TWI. Conclusion: Taking into account the low consumption of molluscs in Poland and low\nconcentrations of analysed compounds, neither adults nor children are likely to exceed the TWI by ingestion of food in this category."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0dfa","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c4","5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d63"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"67","issue":"0","pagesFromTo":"1-7","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0dfa","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c4","5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d63"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research (Poland)","issn":"2450-7393","eissn":"2450-8608","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"5a3ef30a-e992-42a0-a40a-ad7662219310"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dioxins","PCBs","bivalve molluscs","risk"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058599101"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6442837340970761c882a413","name":"Marta","lastName":"Małysiak","documentHash":"99df8b08-fa8d-41b8-963b-bab40ba5e68f"},{"objectId":"5e709486878c28a0473bef2a","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kiljanek","uuid":"7B8EE9A0E65E07520912836B1EE79CA197A21E4DC1CD1DF337A2F539C881566E8B7ED89405D31A6EE523CE4147368897A0A0017AD0DF9642E78CCFE22BEB224A","orcidId":"0000-0001-7222-0983","documentHash":"15e05adf-9642-4726-8587-72bd29897624"}],"objectId":"6442837340970761c882a412","doi":"10.3390/molecules27175741","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/17/5741/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Method of Glyphosate, AMPA, and Glufosinate Ammonium Determination in Beebread by Liquid Chromatography—Tandem Mass Spectrometry after Molecularly Imprinted Solid-Phase Extraction","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this study was to develop a method for the determination of glyphosate, its metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA), and glufosinate ammonium residues in beebread samples, which could then be used to assess bees’ exposure to their residues. The complexity of beebread’s matrix, combined with the specific properties of glyphosate itself, required careful selection and optimization of each analysis step. The use of molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MIP-SPE) by AFFINIMIP glyphosate as an initial clean-up step significantly eliminated matrix components and ensured an efficient derivatization step. Colorless beebread extracts were derivatized by the addition of 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (FMOC-Cl). After derivatization, in order to remove FMOC-OH and residual borate buffer, a solid-phase extraction (SPE) clean-up step using Oasis HLB was carried out. Instrumental analysis was performed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). The method was validated according to the SANTE/11312/2021 guideline at concentrations of 5, 10, and 100 µg/kg, and satisfactory recovery (trueness) values (76–111%) and precision (RSDr) ≤ 18% were obtained. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was 5 µg/kg for AMPA and glufosinate ammonium and 10 µg/kg for glyphosate. The method was positively verified by the international proficiency test. Analysis of beebread samples showed the method’s usefulness in practice. The developed method could be a reliable tool for the assessment of beebread’s contamination with residues of glyphosate, its metabolite AMPA, and glufosinate ammonium."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709486878c28a0473bef2a","6442837340970761c882a413"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"27","issue":"17","pagesFromTo":"5741","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6442837340970761c882a413","5e709486878c28a0473bef2a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":"10.3390/molecules","issn":"1420-3049","eissn":"1420-3049","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules","documentHash":"184d7608-03fd-4b64-ac86-b4321a9365f0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"630cbc614097075e8cd450eb","year":"2022","volume":"27","number":"17","documentHash":"87e37c3a-ce02-4078-82dd-bf04cf542096"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["glyphosate","beebread","bees","pesticide","residue","analysis","molecularly","imprinted","polymers,","derivatization","LC-MS/MS"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058599158"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61de4b387523403b69b1ed6b","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Samorek-Pieróg","uuid":"3783194BFCA06516ADD2AF810422352CDEE48638DA79F07D9B10911A37657F58DE0C609EFC747E042B7883145FBF805185921620D826DD200E7D3E0EF0569CEF","documentHash":"2810224a-efd7-412c-b30b-2231565a8e03"},{"objectId":"5e7094fa878c28a0473c84a2","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Dąbrowska","uuid":"0E7227B332348FF8DC5E82EC47B887E7A0601EBFAE082C826922C3C6276B8D52F21EED1FC75D476978D68FCE27E81696EAAB5EC923869D26BE23BD1D9887989E","documentHash":"e1835c75-f191-4377-b8ef-ca4c5a6988b5"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de0","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Kochanowski","uuid":"22232E0EEDA0B86B551A138FD411D8AD5D9D0AC9E4AE59C77A6370EA12B87E7E4672884EAE5A819DD42801D310BB1EC3B47A1E2C825D4712CEAE5DAFB07121E4","documentHash":"d7c306c3-b933-482a-ade4-610f87bbba34"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d79","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Bilska-Zając","uuid":"CA37D40E9E6221954C0E1F92525EB13B265614DDB637B5261A39B130F380056543A7F0D2E0AE9B7220F35F148187F484510166AABC45E68EC5A47A105D08B099","documentHash":"fb1618f1-0e83-472f-b325-e0c87f8a8872"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c5","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Zdybel","uuid":"E1894A82CA0C5116AD0F2449FF8A8079689129491CC8714CFB197BEE9F32491A94AED5B0B0D6DDEC7673645BA92040566572EF875D09BF31AC26B015A3BDEF1D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7297-2082","documentHash":"c7678981-6c62-4d87-8594-a1ec6cd118c0"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Sroka","uuid":"D54BE4B84093A5FF9739FB665CBF54EE2891B37B53478AF0F1029745E62033C7B88C51B2D726FDAE584BE9DC2EE3F8CEA3FA851EB5B8089D8737B1A062F9CDC5","orcidId":"0000-0002-7372-7636","documentHash":"f04c53ae-faa6-4609-a0d2-57b9784ca2da"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d3e","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Różycki","uuid":"EDB5A4A5E5695886180E1E731AFC64C841487D978E10D582350E1705DD7A068F0AEDC71760C9936BF219656EF91B9728C467322E45795FA2B16E89EE268A1FA8","orcidId":"0000-0002-8125-973X","documentHash":"c9364cd3-5397-46bc-bd82-22a204693887"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Karamon","uuid":"6FC652281DC3E7CEE5831D48F355BCC0E37B505605D00AA8D389A74796325ECB25D4E136854D3D774EDD0E3C95277099BB6981BCE201CE127F3B8AE5C7651C14","orcidId":"0000-0002-5830-167X","documentHash":"0d343e52-20ea-4cfe-a213-5c134e4fef07"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b50","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Cencek","uuid":"7D7F433A7A31D1A4D080277B2FE49ED9F5B45115086FAEDA03BCF07F6AB6D09B61EC0E8015CEEA44A992C6D7E5DD06BB406798BF1E7065879BA9ED1F3FC8E8D3","orcidId":"0000-0003-3649-7867","documentHash":"7aa79c92-3af1-40b7-85e2-872b041c4104"}],"objectId":"6442682240970761c8810a76","publicUri":"https://annals-parasitology.eu/go.live.php/PL-H250/2022-vol-68-suppl-session-iii.html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"First case of Echinococcus ortleppi (G5) in wolf (Canis lupus)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The purpose of the study was to confirm the\npresence of Echinococcus spp. tapeworms in\nwolves from south-eastern Poland The intestine was from a sixyear-old male wolf killed in a traffic accident.

It is believed that the infectious agent responsible for prion diseases is abnormally folded prion protein (PrPSc), which\nderives from a normal cellular protein (PrPC), which is a cell surface glycoprotein predominantly\nexpressed in neurons. There are three different types of BSE, the classical BSE (C-type) strain and two atypical strains (H-type and L-type). BSE is primarily a disease of cattle; however, sheep and goats also can be infected with BSE strains and develop a disease clinically and pathogenically indistinguishable from scrapie. Therefore, TSE cases in cattle and small ruminants require discriminatory testing to determine whether the TSE is BSE or scrapie and to discriminate classical BSE from the atypical H- or\nL-type strains. Many methods have been developed for the detection of BSE and have been reported\nin numerous studies. Detection of BSE is mainly based on the identification of characteristic lesions or detection of the PrPSc in the brain, often by use of their partial proteinase K resistance properties. The objective of this paper was to summarize the currently available methods, highlight their diagnostic performance, and emphasize the advantages and drawbacks of the application of individual tests."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"7135","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","eissn":"1422-0067","documentHash":"30236fd5-adc3-4b09-b2c8-6a106b437fa9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6436733f4097076e1e2d510b","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"24","number":"8","documentHash":"cdb92aa2-a592-4391-add6-b358f441136d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["BSE","bovine spongiform encephalopathy","diagnosis","PrP","prion"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058599366"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebedd26752340254fc424a4","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Opolska","uuid":"F2D203374927E61071F70F279457FCDEFEFE43BE99759D0541924DC75911D6F4794D79CB30CDB551FAF5825A4196644915458A253C5026E78037ED49D228FDE3","documentHash":"53883f6c-5a56-4112-822e-536e165a956c"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0def","name":"Anna","lastName":"Lisowska","uuid":"DACDB5B33E016683B6C3AE247380BF2E5EC908115FAF7C45643A476F1F28A8371F1D6B6411BC388B5BCEC61BDF90732F3C336AD8313EA5CCA4D909A17D46412C","documentHash":"92988d97-a378-4a23-94cb-76d9a9e67f4a"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d4e","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szczotka-Bochniarz","uuid":"5A50EFE8836EA63AA5BA231195E3DDEB25840BF56F1B77D19D94CD5E6748C7E4E32CFF39CFC6D8497A6D9A3C605C8A92492E03B7B9C14044428FA1775ABD8590","documentHash":"cc1ff5e7-22b6-4115-a0ab-d029278b2b6f"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b5a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Domańska-Blicharz","uuid":"44C5DFE3C33AA49F72079D496E2377ECFB06FF9CECAF80BDDBA1D06D13EA5BC0296FA0DF1BE18E01648F10BC82C3BF11F8D0520B236A22625EBD476B49E108A6","orcidId":"0000-0002-0642-3931","documentHash":"be2eaa91-303e-4813-a127-8bc4b12d6232"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"MARCH","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"642a891f409707382bf46642","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2023-0012","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2023-0012","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Bacterial and viral rodent-borne infections on poultry farms. An attempt at a systematic review","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Rodents are quite common at livestock production sites. Their adaptability, high reproductive capacity and omnivorousness make them apt to become a source of disease transmission to humans and animals. Rodents can serve as mechanical vectors or active shedders of many bacteria and viruses, and their transmission can occur through direct contact, or indirectly through contaminated food and water or by the arthropods which parasitise infected rodents. This review paper summarises how rodents spread infectious diseases in poultry production. Material and Methods: The aim of this review was to use PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) principles to meta-analyse the available data on this topic. Three databases – PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus – and grey literature were searched for papers published from inception to July 2022 using the established keywords. Results: An initial search identified 2,999 articles that met the criteria established by the keywords. This number remained after removing 597 articles that were repeated in some databases. The articles were searched for any mention of specific bacterial and viral pathogens. Conclusion: The importance of rodents in the spread of bacterial diseases in poultry has been established, and the vast majority of such diseases involved Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus (MRSA), Pasteurella, Erysipelothrix or Yersinia infections. Rodents also play a role in the transmission of viruses such as avian influenza virus, avian paramyxovirus 1, avian gammacoronavirus or infectious bursal disease virus, but knowledge of these pathogens is very limited and requires further research to expand it."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny -

The aim of our study was to analyse prevalence and identify risk factors for infections with viruses affecting reproduction (BVDV, BoHV-1, and BoHV-4), causing respiratory diseases (BRV3, BAdV-3, and BRSV), and emerging vector-borne viruses (BTV and SBV). Over 600 serum samples used in serology and 270 lung tissue samples, and 284 nasal swabs used in virological tests were collected from 24 free-living and captive European bison herds between 2016 and 2023. The seroprevalences varied between low (0.3–6.1% for BVDV, BoHV-1, and BoHV-4), medium (15.9% for BRSV and 22.1% for BTV) and high (43.3% for BRV3, 59.5% for BAdV-3, and 69.5% for SBV). Interspecies’ and intraspecies’ risk of endemic viral infections was observed to be density-dependent, while the effect of anthropogenic factors on the spread of infections in free-living European bison has not been demonstrated. BTV is no longer circulating, while SBV has become endemic. The higher exposure to viruses in the European bison eliminated on the basis of a veterinary decision indicates the importance of an expert supervision for disease control and prevention."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d34","5e709342878c28a0473a5ca8","5e709342878c28a0473a5cb1","5e7093ed878c28a0473b36c5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"1-19","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cb1","648eb89f40970775642e3a5e","5e7093ed878c28a0473b36c5","5e709342878c28a0473a5d34","5e709342878c28a0473a5ca8","5e70923d878c28a047392444","648eb89f40970775642e3a62"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547db25","mniswId":"22030","title":"Diversity","issn":"1424-2818","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"ac0281fb-f25f-4fc1-83ca-0104f49c12e2"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["European bison","surveillance","infection ecology"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058622272"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"645cbb70409707440b277742","name":"Bruno","lastName":"Neri","documentHash":"e172cbbd-8806-4d02-940d-3c9352b3bd42"},{"objectId":"645cbb70409707440b277741","name":"Luigi","lastName":"Giannetti","documentHash":"499f60e9-5b40-46eb-a974-85fbd30b776e"},{"objectId":"645cbb70409707440b277740","name":"Luiza","lastName":"Kijewska","documentHash":"6ea60d98-4f7b-4ce9-bc60-011d38475719"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cbe","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Mitrowska","uuid":"B090ED749C545D87B8A0B8B648E8FA9A01892BAE3AF52952AD437328F0BB023D9714983C2ADE83A89CF080951E828A57344E2E82AD9A348787CBE04F188FFA1B","orcidId":"0000-0003-2277-6902","documentHash":"6ca9e126-9d72-4177-a547-be8be375b051"}],"objectId":"645cbb70409707440b27773f","doi":"10.1080/19440049.2023.2195948","publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/19440049.2023.2195948","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"A simple and sensitive method for the determination of methylene blue and its analogues in fish muscle using UPLC-MS/MS","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A new, simple and sensitive method for determining and confirming methylene blue and its analogues such as azure A, azure B, azure C, thionine, and new methylene blue in fish muscles have been developed.

In this study, we present the LTR sequence of Polish SRLVs representing different subtypes, and analyzed their impact on SRLV promoter activity, as measured in transient transfection assays. Although certain nucleotide motifs (AML(vis), TATA box and the polyadenylation site (AATAAA)) were conserved across sequences, numerous mutations within the LTR sequences have been identified. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in both regulatory (AP-1, AP-4, Stat and Gas) and non-regulatory sequences, and subtype-specific genetic diversity in the LTR region of Polish SRLVs was observed. In vitro assays demonstrated subtype-specific functional differences between the LTR regions of distinct SRLV subtypes. Our results revealed that the promoter activity of Polish strains was lower (1.64–10.8-fold) than that noted for the K1514 reference strain; however, the differences in most cases were not statistically significant. The lowest promoter activity was observed for strains representing subtype A5 (mean 69.067) while the highest promoter activity was observed for strain K1514 representing subtype A1 (mean 373.48). The mean LTR activities of strains representing subtypes A12, A17, A23, A18 and A24 were 91.22, 137.21, 178.41, 187.05 and 236.836, respectively. The results of the inter-subtype difference analysis showed that the promoter activity of strains belonging to subtype A5 was significantly lower than that for subtype A12 strains (1.32-fold; p < 0.00). The promoter activities of the A5 strain were 1.98-fold and 2.58-fold less active than that of the A17 and A23 strains, and the promoter activities of A12 strains were 1.955 and 1.5 times lower than the promoter activity of A23 and A17 strains, respectively. Furthermore, the promoter activity of A17 strains was 1.3 lower than the promoter activity of A23 strains. Our findings suggest that subtype-specific genetic diversity, mainly in the transcription factor’s binding sites, has an impact on their transcriptional activity, producing a distinct activity pattern for the subtypes. This study provides new information that is important for better understanding the function of the SRLV LTR. However, further research including more strains and subtypes as well as other cell lines is needed to confirm these findings."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cad","5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"302","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9","5e709342878c28a0473a5cad"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a80","mniswId":"20156","title":"Viruses","issn":"1999-4915","eissn":"1999-4915","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses","documentHash":"204f8987-0c7c-441b-9f4a-748747147d4e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ef4b884097075fda40467d","year":"2023","volume":"15","number":"2","documentHash":"bb7ec5e6-2f2d-4ff6-983c-1703dee4c918"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["small ruminant lentiviruses","LTR","transcription factors","promoter activity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058657962"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e48","name":"Marta","lastName":"Skubida","uuid":"A2A69BE989F80F23F32F1DB1CB68CE647F38A2402005378958F5A41359FE7BBEC2AB7F944815C263E0B0F701EDE6B1470E30D2C52AD49E1425649716A89425B0","documentHash":"df08bfcc-d2a3-473b-b0e4-d2e106fddaaa"}],"objectId":"63ef50264097075fda40801e","publicUri":"https://miesiecznik-pszczelarstwo.pl/numer/luty-2023","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Wszystko o zgnilcu amerykańskim (4)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Jak pobrać, zabezpieczyć i wysłać próbki do badań?

This flexibility makes output-based standards useful in the context of zoonotic threat surveillance, particularly where animal pathogens act as risk indicators for human health or where multiple surveillance streams cover human, animal, and food safety sectors. Yet, these systems are also heavily reliant on the appropriate choice of surveillance options to fit the disease context and the constraints of the organization implementing the surveillance system. Here we describe a framework to assist with designing, implementing, and evaluating output-based surveillance systems showing the effectiveness of a diverse range of activities through a case study example.

In the first case, the patient suffered from a fever, spine pain, and muscle weakness and paresis of the lower left limb. The second patient suffered from fever, vertigo, headaches, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea. The results of IgM and IgG antibodies were positive in both cases.

Therefore, there is an obligation to monitor residues of hormones in animals and food of animal origin to ensure consumer safety. A hormone banned but used formerly for fattening cattle, stanozolol, and its metabolite 16β-OH-stanozolol are synthetic compounds that belong to a large group of steroid hormones. This study investigates residues of these compounds in animal urine. Material and Methods: From 2006–2022, 2,995 livestock urine samples were tested for stanozolol residues in Poland as part of the National Residue Monitoring Programme. A liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method to determine stanozolol and 16β-OH-stanozolol in animal urine was developed and validated according to the required criteria. Urine sample analysis was based on enzymatic hydrolysis of hormones potentially present in it to the free form, extraction of them from the sample with a mixture of n-hexane and butyl alcohol, purification of an extract on an NH2 amine column and finally, instrumental detection. Results: The apparent recovery and precision parameters of the developed method were in line with the established criteria, while its decision limits CCα and detection capabilities CCβ were lower than the recommended concentration for analytical purposes set at 2 μg L−1 (valid until December 15, 2022; currently set as 0.5 μg L−1). Conclusion: All examined samples were compliant with the evaluation criteria."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny -

Since the emergence of p72-genotype II African swine fever virus (ASFV) in Georgia in 2007, an ASF epidemic has been spreading across Europe and many countries in Asia. The epidemic first reached Ukraine in 2012. To better understand the dynamics of spread of ASF in Ukraine, we analyzed spatial and temporal outbreak data reported in Ukraine between 2012 and mid-2023. The highest numbers of outbreaks were reported in 2017 (N = 163) and 2018 (N = 145), with overall peak numbers of ASF outbreaks reported in August (domestic pigs) and January (wild boars). While cases were reported from most of Ukraine, we found a directional spread from the eastern and northern borders towards the western and southern regions of Ukraine. Many of the early outbreaks (before 2016) were adjacent to the border, which is again true for more recent outbreaks in wild boar, but not for recent outbreaks in domestic pigs. Outbreaks prior to 2016 also occurred predominantly in areas with a below average domestic pig density. This new analysis suggests that wild boars may have played an important role in the introduction and early spread of ASF in Ukraine. However, in later years, the dynamic suggests human activity as the predominant driver of spread and a separation of ASF epizootics between domestic pigs and in wild boars. The decline in outbreaks since 2019 suggests that the implemented mitigation strategies are effective, even though long-term control or eradication remain challenging and will require continued intensive surveillance of ASF outbreak patterns."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy

Years of Animal Tuberculosis Monitoring in Free-Living European Bison (Bison bonasus) in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the period 1996–2012, two outbreaks of animal tuberculosis were noted in the population of free-living European bison (Bison bonasus caucasicus) in the Bieszczady Mountains, Southern Poland. As the European bison is an endangered species and particularly susceptible to tuberculosis, not to mention a national icon, the decision was made to test all deceased bison for TB in Poland. The screened bison were obtained by elimination due to poor health or natural death. A total of 159 European bison have been examined over the last 10 years. The individuals came from four regions of Poland (Białowieża Forest, Bieszczady Mountains, Borecka Forest, Knyszyńska Forest), not only from the area where tuberculosis is still endemic. Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium avium spp. hominisuis were identified in two different herds. The isolation of M. bovis from European bison was the first case described in Poland. So far, the only causative agent of tuberculosis identified in European bison in Poland, both in the wild and in captive herds, was Mycobacterium caprae. The isolated M. bovis spoligotype has not previously been registered in international spoligotype databases so far. The obtained results highlight the need to monitor TB in European bison in Poland."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947c878c28a0473be3c1"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"1-9","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947c878c28a0473be3c1","5e7094dd878c28a0473c5996","648e14a240970775642851dc","5e70947f878c28a0473be87a","5e709307878c28a0473a17c9","648e14a240970775642851df","5e70923a878c28a0473920e4","5e70923d878c28a047392444","5e709225878c28a0473909a4","5ebee00b752340254fc4319c","648e14a240970775642851e3","5e709342878c28a0473a5d60","5e70923a878c28a0473920fd"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","eissn":"2076-2615","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"cf012089-3ed8-4dde-a05c-d5b280240cb4"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["European bison","Poland","Mycobacterium bovis","SB2806","MTBC","Mycobacterium avium spp. hominissuis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058714114"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e16","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Pietroń","uuid":"0016F003EB9DF9E53E38F4FFAB49313E177EE8E540A1A3EBAA39C79D938D762A9B16CD659F8BE4FB121D74B8431564E92EC3DD699DCD3128F5367F07B757F993","orcidId":"0000-0002-0745-1379","documentHash":"4fd5dafc-3d41-4530-b5e0-489f70096f82"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c4","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Warenik-Bany","uuid":"4712B9142F37DE7444F67A0D87EE1C663B7551CC5403CE356609DD8451AC163AE66C02975F4E46C75BA54D138152C7CA025EC98E7A9BBC1C46CE7FDB9A2F3D49","orcidId":"0000-0002-3839-6464","documentHash":"a8205408-5907-4d58-85e1-a99171e81d41"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cb5","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Małagocki","uuid":"6B978A800DD921D39A4432EDF440D6F16A103558D92E6C068F77A399F415903B3B4D96DAB16C6548151D59AAA9D47E16F932103BB98285BA99E9E5E072BB2F93","orcidId":"0000-0002-5534-9731","documentHash":"2b865c51-549f-4779-b3f7-83bd615b0b88"}],"objectId":"6493f929409707544f5d834a","doi":"10.1016/j.envres.2023.116257","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0013935123010617?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Feed as a source of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"One of the most important routes for human exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) is the ingestion of contaminated food. Food of animal origin safety is strongly related to feed quality. The aim of the study was the assessment of feeds and feed materials quality associated with ten PBDE congeners (BDE-28, 47, 49, 99, 100, 138, 153, 154, 183 and 209) contamination. The quality of 207 feed samples divided into eight categories (277/2012/EU) was checked using the gas chromatography–high resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS). At least one congener was identified in 73% of the samples. All investigated fish oil, animal fat, and feed for fish were contaminated, and 80% of plant-origin feed samples were free of PBDEs. The highest median content of ∑10PBDE was found in fish oils (2260 ng kg−1) followed by fishmeal (530 ng kg−1). The lowest median was found in mineral feed additives, plant materials excluding vegetable oil and compound feed. BDE-209 was the most frequently detected congener (56%). All congeners except BDE-138 and BDE-183 were detected in 100% of the fish oil samples. Except for BDE-209, the congener detection frequencies did not exceed 20% in compound feed, feed of plant origin, and vegetable oils. Excluding BDE-209, similar congener profiles were found for fish oils, fishmeal and feed for fish, with BDE-47 in the highest concentration, followed by BDE-49 and BDE-100. Another pattern appeared in animal fat, with a higher median concentration of BDE-99 than BDE-47. Time-trend analysis of PBDE concentrations in fishmeal (n = 75) showed a 63% decrease in ∑10PBDE (p = 0.077) and a 50% decrease in the ∑9PBDE (p = 0.008) between 2017 and 2021. It proves the international legislation implemented to reduce PBDE environmental levels has been effective."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy

Due to the prevalence and ease of acquisition and transfer of their genes, they are an excellent indicator of environmental contamination and the spread of antimicrobial resistance. The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of Enterococcus spp. in wild birds in Poland, determination of antimicrobial susceptibility and WGS analysis of Enterococcus (E.) faecium and E. faecalis. For this purpose, 138 samples from various species of free-living birds were tested, with 66.7% positive results. Fourteen species were detected, with E. faecalis being the most common, followed by E. casseliflavus and E. hirae. In antimicrobial susceptibility testing, 10.0% of E. faecalis and 50.0% of E. faecium showed resistance to one antimicrobial agent, in addition the MDR phenotype which was found in one E. faecium. The most common resistance phenotype included tetracycline and quinupristin/dalfopristin. The WGS analysis confirmed the significant advantage of the virulence gene diversity of E. faecalis strains over E. faecium. In addition, plasmid replicons were found in 42.0% of E. faecalis and 80.0% of E. faecium. The obtained results confirm free-living birds can be a reservoir of Enterococcus spp. with a considerable zoonotic potential."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709297878c28a047398949","5ebee49e752340254fc44641","5e7094e4878c28a0473c62ff","61de4b387523403b69b1ed7e","61de4b387523403b69b1ed4b","5e709342878c28a0473a5d6c","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5c","61de4b387523403b69b1ed92","61de4b387523403b69b1eda7","61de4b387523403b69b1ed85","63b4f2b975234021979cd504","5ebee286752340254fc43cdb","5ebeca82752340226956f836"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"1-15","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5ebee49e752340254fc44641","5e709342878c28a0473a5d6c","61de4b387523403b69b1eda7","5e7094e4878c28a0473c62ff","5ebeca82752340226956f836","5ebee286752340254fc43cdb","5e709297878c28a047398949","61de4b387523403b69b1ed85","61de4b387523403b69b1ed92","61de4b387523403b69b1ed7e","61de4b387523403b69b1ed4b","63b4f2b975234021979cd504","5e7092f7878c28a0473a0228","5e7092f7878c28a0473a0224","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceac","mniswId":"15767","title":"Pathogens","eissn":"2076-0817","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"e3cbc691-2d96-4c17-9b90-bb773e877487"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["wild birds","Enterococcus faecium","Enterococcus faecalis","antimicrobial resistance","WGS"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058743220"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d63","name":"Marek","lastName":"Pajurek","uuid":"358255257A75C74D59A14A68D4AD1D554284D6EA9DD40FBD386D3E65CF5750BD0AFFF658AA426C816DC388F1A156AECE3148D4AE805CC056A07EFA22690EE5D5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8222-7983","documentHash":"7f676a9f-a4bf-48d6-8a81-13e7fdd64d47"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0dfa","name":"Szczepan","lastName":"Mikołajczyk","uuid":"C57E964869276842E1B6331B9082F2B02A42D6FADD90FF381F756A49C8569C2E04C6F6ABF9E834E4B7AB5848A68D8684085BA83752893DAFEA5BB142A62126BA","orcidId":"0000-0003-0185-174X","documentHash":"40314827-db15-4c91-940f-4476439025a4"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c4","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Warenik-Bany","uuid":"4712B9142F37DE7444F67A0D87EE1C663B7551CC5403CE356609DD8451AC163AE66C02975F4E46C75BA54D138152C7CA025EC98E7A9BBC1C46CE7FDB9A2F3D49","orcidId":"0000-0002-3839-6464","documentHash":"a8205408-5907-4d58-85e1-a99171e81d41"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"APRIL","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"64410ec2409707555e804aee","doi":"10.1007/s11356-023-26626-w","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11356-023-26626-w.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Perfluoroalkyl substances in Baltic fish – the risk to consumers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) were investigated in five Baltic fish species (sprat, herring, salmon, trout, and cod).

They occur as contaminants in cereals, such as wheat, barley and maize. They are called “emerging mycotoxins”, because they have been reported in feed and food and their toxic effects are not fully known. Data on their levels in food (especially in milk) are limited. The study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of ENNs and BEA in milk. Material and Methods: A total of 103 bovine milk samples (76 of raw milk and 27 of UHT milk) were collected from different parts of Poland and analysed using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Results: Among the 76 raw milk samples, 31 (41%) and 15 (20%) samples were contaminated with ENN B and with BEA, respectively. No contamination with other enniatins was found. The highest concentration of BEA was found in raw milk and was 6.17 μg kg−1. Out of the 27 samples of UHT milk, 16 (59%) were contaminated with ENN B at concentrations ranging from 0.157 μg kg−1 to 0.587 μg kg−1 (limit of quantification (LOQ) 0.098 μg kg−1). Beauvericin was detected in 9 UHT milk samples (33%) at concentrations ranging from 0.101 μg kg−1 to 1.934 μg kg−1 (LOQ 0.095 μg kg−1). Conclusion: This study demonstrated constant but low milk contamination in Poland with ENN B and BEA. The analysis of milk samples revealed that the emerging mycotoxins ENN B and BEA were measured in trace amounts. It does not suggest any immediate risk to milk consumers; however, it is unknown whether long-term exposure to low levels of toxins may be harmful."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709341878c28a0473a5b68","5ebedbf2752340254fc41f7a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"67","issue":"0","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5ebedbf2752340254fc41f7a","6442317b40970761c87dd358","5e709341878c28a0473a5b68"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research (Poland)","issn":"2450-7393","eissn":"2450-8608","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"5a3ef30a-e992-42a0-a40a-ad7662219310"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058753592"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64463be94097070d1f51a8a8","name":"Kees","lastName":"De Roest","documentHash":"40747e0a-cfa7-4607-8f77-9b7a82a616b0"},{"objectId":"64463be94097070d1f51a8a7","name":"Maaike","lastName":"Wolthuis-Fillerup","documentHash":"ca9689ff-f0bb-4337-a0cf-bcd924e1e38f"},{"objectId":"64463be94097070d1f51a8a6","name":"Christine","lastName":"Fourichon","documentHash":"73619842-c032-422f-a6bd-dcff38483b57"},{"objectId":"64463be94097070d1f51a8a5","name":"Pierre","lastName":"Levallois","documentHash":"0480cca8-5ac4-4f22-a30f-7185f33df033"},{"objectId":"64463be94097070d1f51a8a4","name":"Paolo","lastName":"Ferrari","documentHash":"ae6a7bfe-75f6-482f-8f50-7d658b17a26d"},{"objectId":"64463be94097070d1f51a8a3","name":"George","lastName":"Kefalas","documentHash":"caa5eb07-0201-4ff3-8086-eca5cb8428d6"},{"objectId":"64463be94097070d1f51a8a2","name":"Maro","lastName":"Simitopoulou","documentHash":"2efb857e-9322-4de7-955f-0a4445d78012"},{"objectId":"64463be94097070d1f51a8a1","name":"Kyriacos","lastName":"Angastiniotis","documentHash":"9982ed45-e17a-4663-a158-1ad124d50334"},{"objectId":"5ebedb8e752340254fc41d98","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Nowacka-Kozak","uuid":"8CBB9BEA330461C21139B1A43143F2D65E7C0E274C8AC0428A2BB4F729EDE82FC702DE92C76DB7C8F5AEBD4110C2A07741FBA7869CA46F0536943AAD894F8676","documentHash":"4d754fa0-a479-45fc-b307-f63831d67b83"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c9","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Błądek","uuid":"AAF7A49616F1A7C768E9962103BBB91BF3FB4B166F2C00EA1435298EDE528828DA2888A4CF52294EC243EC01997079DA3AEBF012D6CDD25DD233D76DF685EC19","orcidId":"0000-0002-6716-8436","documentHash":"2d5b9300-bd3b-4027-959c-a970ab47601d"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be309","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Gbylik-Sikorska","uuid":"4B34FB60DD634752084136595964C4AF13C4EC0C7D6C58CC915FAE03E0779E7F921FC8FE7AB1DAFE0FF33F2061437939C911DB90BDBA01B0563DD13FA76CC8FC","orcidId":"0000-0002-7463-5792","documentHash":"ae91ee84-064a-41d5-8588-f2e11dfccc79"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b5c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Gajda","uuid":"737BA79C0CDDEA58062EFA3DAF7A11C5B7A456F7185DF5693B57EE4097ED5366D5B5D9FD97385488431E06665C388F3163A713C9B3DC06F30B91B586578814C9","documentHash":"c782825e-7075-4034-aef9-edf206624991"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"FEBRUARY","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"64463be94097070d1f51a8a0","doi":"10.3390/antibiotics12020326","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6382/12/2/326/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Analysis of Antimicrobials in Muscle and Drinking Water in Terms of Reducing the Need of Antimicrobial Use by Increasing the Health and Welfare of Pig and Broiler","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Antimicrobial residues may pose harmful effects on the health of consumers.

Among the most important AMR pathogens, Escherichia coli resistant to extended spectrum cephalosporins\n(ESC-EC) is a perfect example of the One Health problem due to its global distribution in animal,\nhuman, and environmental sources and its resistant phenotype, derived from the carriage of plasmid-\nborne extended-spectrum and AmpC β-lactamases, which limits the choice of effective antimicrobial\ntherapies. The epidemiology of ESC-EC infection is complex as a result of the multiple possible\nsources involved in its transmission, and its study would require databases ideally comprising\ninformation from animal (livestock, companion, wildlife), human, and environmental sources.

Infection of naïve mallards with HPAIV H5N8 resulted in ~60% mortality, neurological signs, abundant shedding, and transmission to contact ducks, who also became sick and died. High amounts of viral RNA were found in all collected organs, with the highest RNA load recorded in the brain. The IHC examinations performed on tissues collected at 4 and 14 days post-infection (dpi) revealed tropism to nervous tissue, myocardium, respiratory epithelium, and hepatic and pancreatic cells. The mallards pre-exposed to LPAIV H5N1 and challenged with HPAIV H5N8 were asymptomatic and showed a significant reduction of viral RNA shedding, yet still sufficient to cause infection (but no disease) in the contact ducks. The AIV antigen was not detected in organs at 4 and 14 dpi, and microscopic lesions were mild and scarce. Similarly, mallards previously inoculated with LPAIV H3N8 remained healthy after challenge with HPAIV H5N8, but viral RNA was detected in large quantities in swabs and organs, particularly in the early phase of infection. However, in contrast to mallards from group I, the IHC staining yielded negative results at the selected timepoints. The virus was transmitted to contact birds, which remained symptomless but demonstrated low levels of viral RNA shedding and mild- to moderate tissue damage despite negative IHC staining. The results indicate that naïve mallards are highly susceptible to HPAIV H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4b and that homo- and heterosubtypic immunity to LPAIV can mitigate the clinical outcomes of infection."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e54","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d88","5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d65","5e709342878c28a0473a5d58","5e709486878c28a0473bef46","5e70947a878c28a0473be059"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"217","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947a878c28a0473be059","5e709486878c28a0473bef46","5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d65","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d88","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e54","5e709342878c28a0473a5d58"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceac","mniswId":"15767","title":"Pathogens","issn":"2076-0817","eissn":"2076-0817","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0aee51de-2ae0-4570-a31e-61056cf6d598"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63e24e2e409707409b8202c1","year":"2023","volume":"12","number":"2","documentHash":"dac4c348-c827-4844-b6cd-0712ecd9a27c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["highly pathogenic avian influenza","immunity","low pathogenic avian influenza","mallards","susceptibility"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058756968"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094af878c28a0473c1b6b","name":"Anna","lastName":"Sawicka-Durkalec","uuid":"74F41A0F85AC155F46A6CCFB26EB711F025B465228066B5B84B02AC6321B340B5E150BCF2A66F7C1772D185C02BC942B7AE9B4870C2127F7D8BF9A52EE8941FA","documentHash":"bedf887e-9c8e-4e06-b951-662b20cf6e92"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de5","name":"Olimpia","lastName":"Kursa","uuid":"75402E2E14C8ED8034D357B13AFDE45E9969ED0E1013DCAC5AC579ED65B4C512BE817796CCDCBBC958F09F10CA0E27A409B73C9E9AF9FD4C4A298A3D7F324E63","orcidId":"0000-0002-0058-1568","documentHash":"6ee44e6d-ce9a-41d7-99e0-5633dff83f06"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d5a","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Tomczyk","uuid":"E3C5238621862F074D46922CB3B17195CE27A83F2C9C06B0BA49A69FEE2FB90EC33B4FDD96A897D15FCA91F90109B062B91A53DADD2FC97CF132051ED597C664","documentHash":"b7a3ee18-b481-4390-a3be-5aeac0b34bca"}],"objectId":"64462ce34097070d1f50c599","publicUri":"https://polskie-drobiarstwo.pl/archiwum/artykuly-czasopisma/680","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Sytuacja epidemiologiczna zakażeń Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale u drobiu w świetle wyników badań własnych","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Choroby układu oddechowego są jedną z ważniejszych przyczyn powodujących wysokie straty ekonomiczne w produkcji drobiarskiej.

In addition to sector-specific PTs/EQAs for detection, cross-sectoral panels would be useful for assessment of the capacity to detect and characterize foodborne pathogens in a One Health (OH) perspective and further improving food safety and interpretation of cross-sectoral surveillance data. The aims of the study were to assess the cross-sectoral capability of European public health, animal health and food safety laboratories to detect, characterize and notify findings of the foodborne pathogens Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp. and Yersinia enterocolitica, and to develop recommendations for future cross-sectoral PTs and EQAs within OH. The PT/EQA scheme developed within this study consisted of a test panel of five samples, designed to represent a theoretical outbreak scenario. A total of 15 laboratories from animal health, public health and food safety sectors were enrolled in eight countries: Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The laboratories analyzed the samples according to the methods used in the laboratory and reported the target organisms at species level, and if applicable, serovar for Salmonella and bioserotype for Yersinia. All 15 laboratories analyzed the samples for Salmonella, 13 for Campylobacter and 11 for Yersinia. Analytical errors were predominately false negative results. One sample (S. Stockholm and Y. enterocolitica O:3/BT4) with lower concentrations of target organisms was especially challenging, resulting in six out of seven false negative results. These findings were associated with laboratories using smaller sample sizes and not using enrichment methods. Detection of Salmonella was most commonly mandatory to notify within the three sectors in the eight countries participating in the pilot whereas findings of Campylobacter and Y. enterocolitica were notifiable from human samples, but less commonly from animal and food samples. The results of the pilot PT/EQA conducted in this study confirmed the possibility to apply a cross-sectoral approach for assessment of the joint OH capacity to detect and characterize foodborne pathogens."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebee49e752340254fc44641","5e709342878c28a0473a5d6c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6448cdc0409707285d473d99","6448cdc0409707285d473d9a","6448cdc0409707285d473d9b","6448cdc0409707285d473d9c","6448cdc0409707285d473d9d","6448cdc0409707285d473d9e","6448cdc0409707285d473d9f","6448cdc0409707285d473da0","6448cdc0409707285d473da1","6448cdc0409707285d473da2","6448cdc0409707285d473da3","6448cdc0409707285d473da4","6448cdc0409707285d473da5","5ebee49e752340254fc44641","6448cdc0409707285d473da6","6448cdc0409707285d473da7","6448cdc0409707285d473da8","6448cdc0409707285d473da9","6448cdc0409707285d473daa","6448cdc0409707285d473dab","6448cdc0409707285d473dac","6448cdc0409707285d473dad","6448cdc0409707285d473dae","6448cdc0409707285d473daf","6448cdc0409707285d473db0","6448cdc0409707285d473db1","6448cdc0409707285d473db3","5e709342878c28a0473a5d6c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c1b6","mniswId":"6866","title":"Frontiers in Public Health","issn":"2296-2565","eissn":"2296-2565","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"85d71790-6ae8-4a4c-b282-0621a24b8f7b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d8e12940970739948e428d","year":"2023","volume":"11","documentHash":"bfedfa78-ad2d-4e6b-be89-69c5b4b833cc"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["One Health surveillance","External Quality Assessment","proficiency tests","detection and characterization","foodborne pathogens"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058767460"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6461def4409707344358979c","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Chiesa","documentHash":"ea0e6806-2b07-4780-85f0-105b1958e96d"},{"objectId":"6461def4409707344358979b","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Różycki","documentHash":"b92dfa7c-d8a8-48e7-92c2-60cada1a0ab8"},{"objectId":"6461def4409707344358979a","name":"Silvia","lastName":"Braghin","documentHash":"fa9ab658-d805-45d5-b355-45f7a89e0043"},{"objectId":"6461def44097073443589799","name":"Lisa","lastName":"Fioriello","documentHash":"7682e9f7-6365-46c4-94ef-1749e95f4b16"},{"objectId":"6461def44097073443589798","name":"Enrique","lastName":"Giobbio","documentHash":"92ac24c9-41c2-4a81-a567-660947da9551"},{"objectId":"6461def44097073443589797","name":"Federica","lastName":"Bordese","documentHash":"f157704c-519f-4515-bcc7-ae2b3b6acc33"},{"objectId":"6461def44097073443589796","name":"Elena","lastName":"Colombino","documentHash":"c014db9c-4e17-42e6-84f6-ff511617340d"},{"objectId":"6461def44097073443589795","name":"Maria Teresa","lastName":"Capucchio","documentHash":"8e715f18-c57f-4df4-91d6-bf67e7bd1468"},{"objectId":"6461def44097073443589794","name":"Felice","lastName":"Panebianco","documentHash":"bcee38a7-f1c2-4dbd-b2ba-e89a745e15e3"},{"objectId":"6461def44097073443589793","name":"Linda","lastName":"Pasquariello","documentHash":"3d406475-85aa-4162-b6f9-e233b8b2f3c8"},{"objectId":"6461def44097073443589792","name":"Selene","lastName":"Rubiola","documentHash":"e43a44f1-28f0-4fd3-ac88-00c5c8d40a4b"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Korpysa-Dzirba","uuid":"0F6E5299BA1DE2C04CCB23BB69EE8BB0AF924331950608E7B9E07C962AC58BA926288AB7400DBD5FDFA0B8F25E5B3E11F82C54FC732A0E0269E9C0A9EB906901","orcidId":"0000-0002-8266-581X","documentHash":"a20ea112-853c-4a02-89cc-69a1868143b6"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"MAY","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"6461def44097073443589790","doi":"10.1007/s11259-023-10137-7","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11259-023-10137-7.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Macroscopic sarcocystosis in a pig carcass from an Italian abattoir","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Different food-safety institutions, including the European Food Safety Authority, encourage monitoring and characterising Sarcocystis spp. in animals and foodstuffs; among meat-producing animals, domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) can host two different Sarcocystis spp., that is Sarcocystis miescheriana and the zoonotic Sarcocystis suihominis. Herein, we report for the first time the presence of macrocysts of Sarcocystis miescheriana in a domestic pig resulting in carcass condemnation. In North-West Italy, in June 2022 the carcass of a clinically healthy sow was condemned due to the detection of multifocal macroscopic whitish fusiform lesions. Affected muscle samples were submitted to histological and molecular analyses targeting the mtDNA cox1 and 18S rRNA genes. At gross examination and histology, well demarcated, oval or elongated macrocysts up to 8 mm in length characterized by a calcified central core surrounded by fibrosis were detected. The molecular amplification and sequencing of the cox1 mtDNA and 18S rRNA genes revealed the presence of Sarcocystis miescheriana DNA in all sampled macrocysts. Our study provides the first molecularly confirmed case of Sarcocystis miescheriana infection in a domestic pig in Italy. The present report highlights the need to increase data related to the occurrence and the prevalence of Sarcocystis spp. in meat-producing animals, and in wild and domestic pigs in particular, taking into account the zoonotic potential of Sarcocystis suihominis and the possible financial losses related to carcass discard due to macroscopic Sarcocystis spp. cysts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940f878c28a0473b5984"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-7","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6461def44097073443589792","6461def44097073443589793","6461def44097073443589794","6461def44097073443589795","6461def44097073443589796","6461def44097073443589797","6461def44097073443589798","6461def44097073443589799","6461def4409707344358979a","5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","6461def4409707344358979b","6461def4409707344358979c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a6e","mniswId":"20109","title":"VETERINARY RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS","issn":"0165-7380","eissn":"0165-7380","documentHash":"ec576400-5f1f-4f09-ada2-d4a9e1571307"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6461def44097073443589791","year":"2023","documentHash":"73bff60b-225d-4282-a996-533aa275d2dd"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Sarcocystis miescheriana","domestic pig","macroscopic sarcocystosis","cox1 mtDNA gene","18S rRNA","carcass condemnation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058779714"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebeca82752340226956f836","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Bomba","uuid":"12FB755AC252B37BE5C97C4059AA660D336CCB85ECF820137EC4473FE0079489D8E6F29BF1D003D9BC41C079B8FF5D749252A0166BC51069308587C1C55C38AA","documentHash":"1561cffa-00af-4594-82a1-85d53b39ea14"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a65e9","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Dworaczek","uuid":"C2B1423C348F2729408FCBFB264D05AB93C4FC6AB0E36286D18624BF371CDFC10A5D4233A5465F88112CBD2D28B84A119F70584FC6DA68A35E5EB5BA7D7AAD42","orcidId":"0000-0002-2123-4901","documentHash":"53021384-b9d2-4603-861b-31319e50914f"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d29","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Pękala-Safińska","uuid":"C20069D66531D7CBD28DB4AE6C92C6ADF940091E294B58C26A5C16C6FB3D9C209FE525D8B212160A92C54C26958413924CB703280A0167C5439AFEC9A001295C","orcidId":"0000-0002-5515-8329","documentHash":"22bf7090-4f23-4135-a753-8016e4d98946"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a04739ff49","name":"Anna","lastName":"Turska-Szewczuk","uuid":"879E06FCCA30A22B4C677DCF97AFBEC515E8EB139368B512FE12406B629F4DFF8E9CE8AC2BE621AEE410074DA4BF25B03AD3D895EF916CE1B3C63F0967BD0654","orcidId":"0000-0002-2975-9593","documentHash":"86880de7-a65e-4dbe-94f9-b3c9397b772a"},{"objectId":"5e709297878c28a04739888c","name":"Maria","lastName":"Kurzylewska","uuid":"6574D47C19FC927C557DCFD1AACDD1B8E7AEAA1DB50F6D448FF6AC750B5FE0A2D0C80A76BD42D9025A951DBF024F5CFBC6AB81F3073AEEE9530E858FF5BC6592","orcidId":"0000-0002-7443-734X","documentHash":"f99a12b3-01c8-45d3-bfeb-95efa773d930"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6461e18e409707344358a742","doi":"10.1016/j.carres.2023.108809","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000862152300071X?via%3Dihub","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Structure and gene cluster annotation of the O-antigen of Aeromonas sobria strain K928 isolated from common carp and classified into the new Aeromonas PGO1 serogroup","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Aeromonas sobria strain K928 was isolated from a common carp during a Motile Aeromonas Infection/Motile Aeromonas Septicaemia disease outbreak on a Polish fish farm and classified into the new provisional PGO1 serogroup.

It has been observed in Poland since 2008. This serovar is considered the one with the highest rate of mcr prevalence. This report presents a sequence characteristic of the multidrug-resistant (MDR) monophasic S. Typhimurium isolated from a pig faecal sample with the confirmed presence of the mcr-1.1 gene. The genome was assembled into the complete chromosome and 4 plasmids: IncHI2 (232 119 bp), IncFIB/IncFIC (133 901 bp), ColRNAI (6659 bp), and Col8282 (4066bp). The strain identified as ST34 carried multiple antimicrobial resistance genes located both on chromosome (tet(B)) and plasmids: mcr-1.1 and blaTEM-1B on ST4-IncHI2, and mef(B), blaTEM-1B, aadA1, qacL, dfrA12, aadA2, cmlA1, sul3, tet(M) on IncFIB/FIC. The mcr-1.1 gene was previously identified in E. coli deriving mainly from poultry, but this is the first case of the occurrence of mcr-positive Salmonella in Poland. The obtained results of analysis of the genome content draw attention to the problem of multidrug-resistant pathogens, especially in the context of resistance to colistin which is a last-resort antimicrobial."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61de4b387523403b69b1eda7","5ebee49e752340254fc44641","5e70947a878c28a0473be051","5ebede04752340254fc42880","5e7094e4878c28a0473c62ff","5ebee286752340254fc43cdb","5e709342878c28a0473a5d6c","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5c","5ebede2d752340254fc42949"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"33","pagesFromTo":"218-220","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d6c","5e70947a878c28a0473be051","5e7094e4878c28a0473c62ff","5ebee49e752340254fc44641","6461daa94097073443583cef","5ebee286752340254fc43cdb","61de4b387523403b69b1eda7","5ebede04752340254fc42880","5ebede2d752340254fc42949","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547873b","mniswId":"11249","title":"Journal of Global Antimicrobial Resistance","issn":"2213-7165","eissn":"2213-7173","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"3178c758-2ed9-4fca-b025-0ae40fcfaaec"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6461daa94097073443583cee","year":"2023","volume":"33","documentHash":"8ecbb8ea-edc4-469a-a718-01dcbe8eb55b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mcr-1","colistin resistance","Salmonella","pig","IncHI2"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058780033"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"646b189a409707633df82c95","name":"Elke","lastName":"Burow","documentHash":"f78f37cf-2964-4533-bf98-8c499ec60429"},{"objectId":"646b189a409707633df82c94","name":"Richard Piers","lastName":"Smith","documentHash":"21f0da43-b2c5-4d5d-9351-ddfab7b531c5"},{"objectId":"646b189a409707633df82c93","name":"Tijs","lastName":"Tobias","documentHash":"1575b778-f0e7-4e68-8bfa-b189acac0cd9"},{"objectId":"646b189a409707633df82c92","name":"Marie","lastName":"Sjölund","documentHash":"010fa1f8-92c4-4629-9351-399a0b851f9e"},{"objectId":"646b189a409707633df82c91","name":"Christopher","lastName":"Prigge","documentHash":"151bf20c-6015-4fcf-aadf-695c744b2c83"},{"objectId":"646b189a409707633df82c90","name":"Elena Lucia","lastName":"Sassu","documentHash":"d5370bea-fd1e-4834-8b06-f240c4bd9b20"},{"objectId":"646b189a409707633df82c8f","name":"Veit","lastName":"Zoche-Golob","documentHash":"2ad38ed1-b25b-4e9c-a609-d8acb0912ec7"},{"objectId":"646b189a409707633df82c8e","name":"Erika","lastName":"Galipó","documentHash":"0854eb1e-8e2c-4138-9e25-ad8f99412f7d"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d41","name":"Artur","lastName":"Rzeżutka","uuid":"96C85B61D3E6BA3657F0A0E04C8CE4A1016EFBE59FEB907FB5C3839E3A19929363BE5F9B8C71F56D60D507D45A0D3B09927E0D5EF05EB658908558DB427DC4C1","orcidId":"0000-0001-6301-1143","documentHash":"2a5cb6f9-9a99-43f2-80dc-4cb29ef3c1cf"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"MARCH","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"646b189a409707633df82c8c","doi":"10.1186/s40813-023-00306-0","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s40813-023-00306-0.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Prioritization of pig farm biosecurity for control of Salmonella and hepatitis E virus infections: results of a European expert opinion elicitation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background In the literature, there is absent or weak evidence on the effectiveness of biosecurity measures to the control of Salmonella spp. and hepatitis E virus (HEV) on pig farms. Therefore, the present study aimed to collect, weigh, and compare opinions from experts on the relevance of several biosecurity measures. An online questionnaire\nwas submitted to selected experts, from multiple European countries, knowledgeable on either HEV or Salmonella spp., in either indoor or outdoor pig farming systems (settings). The experts ranked the relevance of eight biosecurity categories with regards to effectiveness in reducing the two pathogens separately, by assigning a score from a total of 80, and within each biosecurity category they scored the relevance of specific biosecurity measures (scale 1–5). Agreement among experts was analysed across pathogens and across settings.\n\nResults After filtering for completeness and expertise, 46 responses were analysed, with 52% of the experts identified as researchers/scientists, whereas the remaining 48% consisted of non-researchers, veterinary practitioners and advisors, governmental staff, and consultant/industrial experts. The experts self-declared their level of knowledge but neither\nMultidimensional Scaling nor k-means cluster analyses produced evidence of an association between expertise and the biosecurity answers, and so all experts’ responses were analysed together without weighting or adaptation. Overall, the top-ranked biosecurity categories were pig mixing; cleaning and disinfection; feed, water and bedding; and purchase of pigs or semen, while the lowest ranked categories were transport, equipment, animals (other than pigs and including wildlife) and humans. Cleaning and disinfection was ranked highest for both pathogens in the indoor setting, whereas pig mixing was highest for outdoor settings. Several (94/222, 42.3%) measures across all four settings were considered highly relevant. Measures with high disagreement between the respondents were uncommon (21/222, 9.6%), but more frequent for HEV compared to Salmonella spp.\nConclusions The implementation of measures from multiple biosecurity categories was considered important to control Salmonella spp. and HEV on farms, and pig mixing activities, as well as cleaning and disinfection practices, were perceived as consistently more important than others. Similarities and differences in the prioritised biosecurity measures were identified between indoor and outdoor systems and pathogens. The study identified the need for further research especially for control of HEV and for biosecurity in outdoor farming."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d41"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"1-13","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["646b189a409707633df82c8e","646b189a409707633df82c8f","646b189a409707633df82c90","646b189a409707633df82c91","646b189a409707633df82c92","646b189a409707633df82c93","5e709342878c28a0473a5d41","646b189a409707633df82c94","646b189a409707633df82c95"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547cf64","mniswId":"16389","title":"Porcine Health Management","issn":"2055-5660","eissn":"2055-5660","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"9555b120-941d-4686-b8f4-75335bdca5bc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"646b189a409707633df82c8d","year":"2023","volume":"9","number":"1","documentHash":"57c6b836-c937-4387-8197-97e71d94fbae"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Salmonella","HEV","Biosecurity measure","pig farming","Expert opinion elicitation (EOE)","Foodborne diseases"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058785617"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64d49490409707756bdbe488","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Zbytniewski","documentHash":"3f017b7f-9e85-472b-9168-8830ea04490e"},{"objectId":"64d49490409707756bdbe487","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kolano","documentHash":"c7023c76-c004-4754-8b74-b945cfd70bea"},{"objectId":"64d49490409707756bdbe486","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Panasiuk","documentHash":"ee5c6686-3ebc-404d-8b04-8bc6a96a7a1f"},{"objectId":"5ebedbf2752340254fc41f7a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Pietruszka","uuid":"85A6F5AE644E8C724095D4D71E9BF74BB2952E2C88AC4E78684EDECB0424BF872773BEBEE710C76F7B7CBFA3BD1E71006A68D1D8DEA3A749789AF958E1F8EE3F","documentHash":"9772a87b-cdb9-4429-af2d-14548c2c0abe"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b68","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Jedziniak","uuid":"DCD8C61F090FCDB42589ECD4D30BC4F07DF1A48D10CB58D28E1887BBF8E5C91C1A764BCE5DD19D7C91FF78DF169D6B1526C1FC81E50250D50A1EF803542B7CE7","documentHash":"d2888220-8bd1-4995-b8e9-9c4b4e30d1a4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"JULY","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"64d49490409707756bdbe485","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2023-0045","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2023-0045","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Inter-laboratory validation of liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry multi-mycotoxin determination in animal feed – method transfer from the reference laboratory to regional laboratories","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: The results are presented of the inter-laboratory validation of a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method for the determination of eight mycotoxins (aflatoxin B1, deoxynivalenol, fumonisin B1, fumonisin B2, ochratoxin A, toxin T-2, toxin HT-2 and zearalenone) in animal feeds.

From a radiotoxicological point of view, the most important radionuclide is caesium-137. Formed mainly during nuclear explosions, caesium-137 can persist in the soil for many years, from where it constantly enters the food chain. One of the elements of ensuring food safety is the monitoring of its radioactive contamination, mainly with radioactive caesium isotopes. The aim of the study was to determine the content of caesium-137 in food of animal origin. Material and Methods: \nA total of 1,416 muscle samples from cattle, sheep, pigs, game and fish, as well as chicken eggs and dairy products were examined using gamma-ray spectrometry. Results: Caesium-137 activities ranged from below the minimum detectable activity concentration (MDC) to over 4,000 Bq/kg wet weight (w.w.). Most often, the values did not exceed the MDC or were in a range below 100 Bq/kg. The exception was the muscle tissue of game animals, especially wild boar, where a significant activity of caesium-137 was recorded, the highest of which was 4,136.8 ± 238 Bq/kg w.w. Committed effective doses determined for each matrix ranged from 0.01 to 0.83 µSv/kg, with the highest value determined for wild boar. Conclusion: The calculated exposure doses with values well below the accepted low radiation dose (100 mSv) did not indicate any significant amounts of ionising radiation from the food consumed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947c878c28a0473be3c4","5e709498878c28a0473c01d0","60a5da029543c758682b63bb","60a62c149543c758682b642b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"67","issue":"0","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709498878c28a0473c01d0","60a5da029543c758682b63bb","60a62c149543c758682b642b","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research","issn":"2450-7393","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c3fc9638-cd0e-40bb-89b9-22dee2de8b67"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"642acafd409707382bf97ef6","year":"2023","volume":"67","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"29908884-2343-4e2d-8022-a54395c4255b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["137Cs","contamination","animal food","Chernobyl","effective equivalent dose"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058798313"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64d320a24097076e9ebb494b","name":"Fabio","lastName":"Casali","documentHash":"60375846-8bda-497e-b104-8fc6becdaf3f"},{"objectId":"64d320a24097076e9ebb494a","name":"Elizabeth","lastName":"Sharp","documentHash":"5de6517d-8bce-4a60-b9cb-34eece8d7de5"},{"objectId":"64d320a24097076e9ebb4949","name":"Anna","lastName":"Giela","documentHash":"6b611b05-1784-4c1d-995d-55c1d17f3230"},{"objectId":"64d320a24097076e9ebb4948","name":"Steve","lastName":"Campbell","documentHash":"28e3d8a4-80e9-48c0-800d-6a0dc4d7a000"},{"objectId":"5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d4b","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Sell","uuid":"5F73466B7BB04C5735CAE49188E4299A99AF8D9D1E567271A117DB240FE53D1CFB5BF09438A3C1447B3D309DB699B643C3DAD529F62CF8A85D679DE268F76C45","documentHash":"0c09a0c0-54a2-475d-90cf-0541ad600f61"},{"objectId":"5e709413878c28a0473b5d4d","name":"Marta","lastName":"Giergiel","uuid":"7ECB6BDCA1968B7E46027861FB370414D21F6FBACA8994EAE2BC9D24F817AC76564C6B75D61ED66F74A7C50C79E75B7929484BD587C4A37D5104AC653EC6809A","documentHash":"c6d3e0b5-224c-42f4-9a07-b75e9a9e408f"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d59","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Śniegocki","uuid":"DB665422E26B81056458B8092E19440B3E95FAF57D925ECDD96FFE05BB70CDD12EECDC321E4DF3001020CF07EE2E390E7E8CD01C36C7D3C8D23EF3B6280C5442","documentHash":"59f5f7f7-f483-4993-8c96-f3d0ac07462f"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b68","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Jedziniak","uuid":"DCD8C61F090FCDB42589ECD4D30BC4F07DF1A48D10CB58D28E1887BBF8E5C91C1A764BCE5DD19D7C91FF78DF169D6B1526C1FC81E50250D50A1EF803542B7CE7","documentHash":"d2888220-8bd1-4995-b8e9-9c4b4e30d1a4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"MARCH","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"64d320a24097076e9ebb4946","doi":"10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.114651","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0147651323001550?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Residues of an anthelmintic veterinary drug (closantel) detected in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) in Scotland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The contamination of the environment by some veterinary medicines and their impact on wild animals is of\nincreasing concern.

However, misuse and abuse of these drugs can lead to residues in the edible tissues of animals. Due to thetoxicity of aminoglycosides and the exposure of consumers to the emergence of drug resistance, new methods are being sought to determine aminoglycosides in food. The method presented in thismanuscript describes the determination of twelve aminoglycosides (streptomycin, dihydrostrepto-mycin, spectinomycin, neomycin, gentamicin, hygromycin, paromomycin, kanamycin, tobramycin, amikacin, apramycin, and sisomycin) in thirteen matrices (muscle, kidney, liver, fat, sausages, shrimps, fish honey, milk, eggs, whey powder, sour cream, and curd). Aminoglycosides were isolated from samples with extraction buffer (10 mM NH4OOCH3, 0.4 mM Na2EDTA, 1% NaCl, 2% TCA). For the clean-up purpose, HLB cartridges were used. Analysis was performed using ultra-high-performanceliquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) with a Poroshellanalytical column and a mobile phase of acetonitrile and heptafluorobutyric acid. The method was validated according to Commission Regulation (EU) 2021/808 requirements. Good performance characteristics were obtained for recovery, linearity, precision, specificity, and decision limits (CCα). This simple and high-sensitivity method can determine multi-aminoglycosides in various food samples for confirmatory analysis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebedb8e752340254fc41d98","5e709341878c28a0473a5b5c","5e70947c878c28a0473be309"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"28","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"4595","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5ebedb8e752340254fc41d98","5e709341878c28a0473a5b5c","5e70947c878c28a0473be309"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":"10.3390/molecules","issn":"1420-3049","eissn":"1420-3049","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules","documentHash":"184d7608-03fd-4b64-ac86-b4321a9365f0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"649194a74097074e1449f916","year":"2023","volume":"28","number":"12","documentHash":"7a451515-075d-4a2f-ac63-4e171f39ab85"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["aminoglycoside antibiotics","residues","food","analysis","UHPLC-MS/MS"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058814419"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70947a878c28a0473be056","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Patyra","uuid":"70AEA1536F3D1DD275C8505B021D0A3CC7548B85668DF4614DD25CD31CEF0BFD91FA03E71F0B483A2FBF8AF3B27E24667A7617657EC1F5313A96730402DBF2D0","orcidId":"0000-0002-3827-2314","documentHash":"85c16763-62f2-4d5c-8a34-6ecfc4c5e227"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5caf","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kwiatek","uuid":"483AF17960E9A333131A70EFECF6469DB4B390ED1FC80958251A4DC48A21C1BB31E13F4FFF4619F4F3D2845908B5F84A67F567F444E8C826335B0675F5060620","documentHash":"2cd83ba7-a483-4b03-b3b0-14728060cac8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"JUNE","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"64958b3b4097075a05d10367","doi":"10.3390/pathogens12060854","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/12/6/854/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Insect Meals and Insect Antimicrobial Peptides as an Alternative for Antibiotics and Growth Promoters in Livestock Production","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The extensive use of antibiotics in animal production has led to the development of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms and the search for alternative antimicrobial agents in animal production. One such compound may be antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which are characterized by, among others, a wide range of biocidal activity. According to scientific data, insects produce the largest number of antimicrobial peptides, and the changing EU legislation has allowed processed animal protein derived from insects to be used in feed for farm animals, which, in addition to a protein supplement, may prove to be an alternative to antibiotics and antibiotic growth promoters due to their documented beneficial impact on livestock health. In animals that were fed feeds with the addition of insect meals, changes in their intestinal microbiota, strengthened immunity, and increased antibacterial activity were confirmed to be positive effects obtained thanks to the insect diet. This paper reviews the literature on sources of antibacterial peptides and the mechanism of action of these compounds, with particular emphasis on insect antibacterial peptides and their potential impact on animal health, and legal regulations related to the use of insect meals in animal nutrition."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5caf","5e70947a878c28a0473be056"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"854","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947a878c28a0473be056","5e709342878c28a0473a5caf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceac","mniswId":"15767","title":"Pathogens","issn":"2076-0817","eissn":"2076-0817","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0aee51de-2ae0-4570-a31e-61056cf6d598"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"648865384097072fd7705660","year":"2023","volume":"12","number":"6","documentHash":"23cc8835-67b6-4ebc-b736-39fd72627a0c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)","insects","glycine-rich peptides","defensins","moricins","cecropins","proline-rich peptides","mode of action","livestock health","Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/893"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058814807"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64c3f617409707243384a099","name":"Reichert","lastName":"Michał","documentHash":"e92fbdc1-8182-4731-ac16-e34595a1f864"},{"objectId":"64c3f617409707243384a096","name":"Pękala‐Safińska","lastName":"Agnieszka","documentHash":"0c18d820-b0c5-4b6f-a750-6c402fcf8d83"},{"objectId":"64c3f617409707243384a093","name":"Podolska","lastName":"Magdalena","documentHash":"296d9992-dd76-457e-9169-acff0b4b46c6"},{"objectId":"64c3f617409707243384a092","name":"Nadolna‐Ałtyn","lastName":"Katarzyna","documentHash":"c8f9a1ba-3644-4d98-bc71-f27f954b68f5"},{"objectId":"64c3f617409707243384a091","name":"Tłuścik","lastName":"Katarzyna","documentHash":"aecff8c1-ca4a-49f2-bb34-6b9713d49a3c"},{"objectId":"5ebeca82752340226956f836","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Bomba","uuid":"12FB755AC252B37BE5C97C4059AA660D336CCB85ECF820137EC4473FE0079489D8E6F29BF1D003D9BC41C079B8FF5D749252A0166BC51069308587C1C55C38AA","documentHash":"1561cffa-00af-4594-82a1-85d53b39ea14"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c2","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Paździor","uuid":"DADC54691FBE81C5F946DC42E8DD071BBE303B4EA3CF351BEABE42720C6C569D8FAF65923AD06BC559A1F5C4916DA622EC519E78D01A0741DD099503CBCC8526","documentHash":"d47b0aad-82be-4128-85e9-0c345d4d4dcb"},{"objectId":"5e70945c878c28a0473bb4cd","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Nadolna-Ałtyn","uuid":"99FF302E9700DB06F7ED2E84957341E145AA70D0BFB7BB5806042F6A7C8711D3541E04365AE4FC207C15F96ABBCD4ED7E1F7A601FAB958200C00D91C3EDDD2DC","orcidId":"0000-0001-5507-2595","documentHash":"fcccbf03-3d41-4239-8b9d-fafacb0be634"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d5c","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Wasyl","uuid":"C5ED1757437A5677E196DA08E4AA40E3BCE245B9A5E1C3A37991653501DAC643CEDB4A1A1EEAA522F34E2F1C4B7C40B294F5E325464AC798E4B89C8E5CB9808B","orcidId":"0000-0002-1068-8414","documentHash":"b1e4ce6d-47cc-4c73-aefe-79b312bb2775"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d33","name":"Michał","lastName":"Reichert","uuid":"4394EEC51A6B6D1F4DFCB1A7C07A5F8A251A042E9BCA371EAAA432AFE6A8EE1872E16213AA074CCC239D3E7A1034FC416FD93B99D94E0730A905E1D770B3DC27","documentHash":"9da7cc50-be87-4406-af94-e5a72d0e6a2e"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d29","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Pękala-Safińska","uuid":"C20069D66531D7CBD28DB4AE6C92C6ADF940091E294B58C26A5C16C6FB3D9C209FE525D8B212160A92C54C26958413924CB703280A0167C5439AFEC9A001295C","orcidId":"0000-0002-5515-8329","documentHash":"22bf7090-4f23-4135-a753-8016e4d98946"},{"objectId":"5e709337878c28a0473a51d2","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Podolska","uuid":"59F45A0F8B64A4E144A9D252F310676EB27C9DFAECD829E51428D855A853FE5B7CC3970FADD06D4567A963D0AF19527C61ABEF562B422752405F971D03DBEF31","orcidId":"0000-0002-3303-3787","documentHash":"1307c1d4-63fd-4063-b6e5-40fb2e31a6b1"}],"objectId":"64c3f617409707243384a08d","doi":"10.1111/jfd.13834","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jfd.13834","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Phylogenetic analysis of Shewanella spp. isolated from fish","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Different species of Shewanella spp. widely inhabit freshwater and marine environments. Some of them are opportunistic fish pathogens. The application of high-throughput sequencing enabled the characterization and taxonomic reclassification of many Shewanella spp. species. Still, some strains collected from fish need to be better recognized. The aim of the present study was to classify and determine the phylogenetic relationships of Shewanella spp. collected from fish. The complete genomes of 94 strains of Shewanella spp. from different fish species were sequenced using Illumina platform (MiSeq). The 16S rRNA gene, genomic features and whole-genome relationships of those bacteria were comprehensively analysed in comparison to reference strains. Whole-genome analysis showed that the tested Shewanella spp. strains were clustered into six groups similar to reference strains of S. xiamenensis, S. oneidensis, S. glacialipiscicola, S. hafniensis, S. baltica and S. oncorhynchi. Our study indicates that the whole-genome sequence analysis enabled taxonomic classification and assessment of the diversity of the Shewanella spp. strains, as opposed to recently the gold standard method of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The high genetic diversity and low similarity to the reference genome of S. oneidensis indicate that the group of strains may be a subspecies or even new species. Furthermore, we showed that the most frequent Shewanella spp. species occurring in freshwater fish in our study is the recently described species S. oncorhynchi."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defc","uid":"b6NUXJH6kJYzzJvxqM0-8WA","uuid":"91d4e88b-bf82-4151-99d4-8e91de5ac284","name":"Morski Instytut Rybacki - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["64c3f617409707243384a093","64c3f617409707243384a092"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defc","parentUuid":"91d4e88b-bf82-4151-99d4-8e91de5ac284","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defc","rootUuid":"91d4e88b-bf82-4151-99d4-8e91de5ac284","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d33","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c2","5ebeca82752340226956f836","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"46","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"1163-1171","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64c3f617409707243384a091","64c3f617409707243384a092","64c3f617409707243384a093","64c3f617409707243384a096","5e70945c878c28a0473bb4cd","5e709337878c28a0473a51d2","64c3f617409707243384a099","5e709342878c28a0473a5d29","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c2","5ebeca82752340226956f836","5e709342878c28a0473a5d33","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454786e1","mniswId":"11122","title":"Journal of Fish Diseases","issn":"0140-7775","eissn":"1365-2761","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"ba4f07de-1dc5-4b31-af97-c440126543a0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64c3f617409707243384a08e","year":"2023","doi":"","documentHash":"af5480fa-5763-44b6-ad00-3fa840a48174"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fish","Shewanella","whole genome"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058817966"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094fa878c28a0473c84a2","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Dąbrowska","uuid":"0E7227B332348FF8DC5E82EC47B887E7A0601EBFAE082C826922C3C6276B8D52F21EED1FC75D476978D68FCE27E81696EAAB5EC923869D26BE23BD1D9887989E","documentHash":"e1835c75-f191-4377-b8ef-ca4c5a6988b5"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Sroka","uuid":"D54BE4B84093A5FF9739FB665CBF54EE2891B37B53478AF0F1029745E62033C7B88C51B2D726FDAE584BE9DC2EE3F8CEA3FA851EB5B8089D8737B1A062F9CDC5","orcidId":"0000-0002-7372-7636","documentHash":"f04c53ae-faa6-4609-a0d2-57b9784ca2da"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b50","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Cencek","uuid":"7D7F433A7A31D1A4D080277B2FE49ED9F5B45115086FAEDA03BCF07F6AB6D09B61EC0E8015CEEA44A992C6D7E5DD06BB406798BF1E7065879BA9ED1F3FC8E8D3","orcidId":"0000-0003-3649-7867","documentHash":"7aa79c92-3af1-40b7-85e2-872b041c4104"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"AUGUST","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"64f59e1f40970725b30d1c0c","doi":"10.3390/ijms241612867","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/16/12867/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Investigating Cryptosporidium spp. Using Genomic, Proteomic and Transcriptomic Techniques: Current Progress and Future Directions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cryptosporidiosis is a widespread disease caused by the parasitic protozoan\nCryptosporidium spp., which infects various vertebrate species, including humans.

It can have many different infectious and noninfectious causes. The aim of this study was identification of the main viral causes of abortion in mares in Poland based on tissue samples from 180 aborted foetuses submitted for testing between 1999 and 2022. Material and Methods: Tissues of aborted foetuses collected from different horse studs throughout Poland were tested for the presence of equine herpesvirus types 1 and 4 (EHV-1/-4) and if negative, for equine arteritis virus (EAV). The examination was performed using a PCR/reverse transcriptase PCR (1999–2012) and a quantitative PCR (2013–2022). Results: The cause of abortion was determined to be EHV-1 in 49.4% of cases (n = 89), whereas no EHV-4- or EAV-positive cases were found. The proportion of abortions due to EHV-1 differed between regions, with the highest percentage in the Lubelskie and Wielkopolskie provinces. Conclusion: The results of the study indicate that EHV-1 is the most important viral infectious agent causing abortions in mares in Poland."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d34","5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d5a","5e7093ed878c28a0473b36c5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"67","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"155-160","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d5a","5e7093ed878c28a0473b36c5","5e709342878c28a0473a5d34"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research (Poland)","issn":"2450-7393","eissn":"2450-8608","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"5a3ef30a-e992-42a0-a40a-ad7662219310"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["abortion","EHV-1/-4","EAV","PCR","quantitative PCR"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058826019"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"656f268440970749a877bbfe","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Pac-Sosińska","documentHash":"1c105b15-26c6-475c-b0b2-78be34db6464"},{"objectId":"656f268440970749a877bbfd","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Łabuć","documentHash":"7e631d71-3407-4437-9bb0-9bc9e142c827"},{"objectId":"63b4f2b975234021979cd4e4","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Bełcik","uuid":"77661344F288929533CF8A7024A5412F3C69BE81B07E6C3DDDFADECC0C99EAEFCB8C3D85174909E18CB495D581F97E71C6C20AA3A805B92F0FFDE5E6E231C6A8","documentHash":"40a2e3d1-fc18-4a0f-b2f8-f831313648e7"},{"objectId":"61de4b387523403b69b1ed6b","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Samorek-Pieróg","uuid":"3783194BFCA06516ADD2AF810422352CDEE48638DA79F07D9B10911A37657F58DE0C609EFC747E042B7883145FBF805185921620D826DD200E7D3E0EF0569CEF","documentHash":"2810224a-efd7-412c-b30b-2231565a8e03"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d79","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Bilska-Zając","uuid":"CA37D40E9E6221954C0E1F92525EB13B265614DDB637B5261A39B130F380056543A7F0D2E0AE9B7220F35F148187F484510166AABC45E68EC5A47A105D08B099","documentHash":"fb1618f1-0e83-472f-b325-e0c87f8a8872"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Korpysa-Dzirba","uuid":"0F6E5299BA1DE2C04CCB23BB69EE8BB0AF924331950608E7B9E07C962AC58BA926288AB7400DBD5FDFA0B8F25E5B3E11F82C54FC732A0E0269E9C0A9EB906901","orcidId":"0000-0002-8266-581X","documentHash":"a20ea112-853c-4a02-89cc-69a1868143b6"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6619","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Pieróg","uuid":"E2F195DB4CDF3B3441BF4AF7080921C78E790CEFA2EAABD6D6E123F221885E9E139D2EF3642F6A6D2E2785C6D92822B2DC57E95FD554CAF068DAB68E51894725","orcidId":"0000-0001-8772-3225","documentHash":"605d7056-9d28-4499-8912-1b6c39447a0c"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Karamon","uuid":"6FC652281DC3E7CEE5831D48F355BCC0E37B505605D00AA8D389A74796325ECB25D4E136854D3D774EDD0E3C95277099BB6981BCE201CE127F3B8AE5C7651C14","orcidId":"0000-0002-5830-167X","documentHash":"0d343e52-20ea-4cfe-a213-5c134e4fef07"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b50","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Cencek","uuid":"7D7F433A7A31D1A4D080277B2FE49ED9F5B45115086FAEDA03BCF07F6AB6D09B61EC0E8015CEEA44A992C6D7E5DD06BB406798BF1E7065879BA9ED1F3FC8E8D3","orcidId":"0000-0003-3649-7867","documentHash":"7aa79c92-3af1-40b7-85e2-872b041c4104"}],"objectId":"64d329034097076e9ebb7a07","doi":"10.1186/s13071-023-05830-0","publicUri":"https://parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13071-023-05830-0","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Occurrence of Eucoleus aerophilus in wild and domestic animals: a systematic review and meta‑analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background\r\nEucoleus aerophilus (syn. Capillaria aerophila) is a nematode with a worldwide geographical distribution. It causes a disease called lung capillariosis by affecting the respiratory tract of wild and domestic animals, and has also occasionally been described in humans. Despite steady increases in knowledge of the morphology of this neglected parasite, many aspects are still poorly understood. Epidemiological data regarding, for example, geographic distribution, range of hosts, clinical relevance and the actual zoonotic potential of this nematode are scarce and incomplete.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nThis article is a systematic review based on the screening of three databases (PubMed, Web of Science and Science Direct) to identify eligible studies published from 1973 to the end of 2022.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nFrom a total of 606 studies describing the occurrence of E. aerophilus, 141 articles from 38 countries worldwide were included in this meta-analysis, all of which presented results obtained mainly with flotation and necropsy. Due to the occurrence of E. aerophilus in many different species and different matrices (lungs and faeces), we decided to conduct the meta-analysis separately for each species with a given matrix. This systematic review confirmed the status of the Red fox as the main reservoir and main transmitter of E. aerophilus (average prevalence of 43% in faeces and 49% in lungs) and provided evidence of a higher prevalence of E. aerophilus in wild animals in comparison to domestic animals, such as dogs (3% in faeces) and cats (2% in faeces and 8% in lungs). Previous studies have investigated many host-related factors (age, sex, environmental/living conditions) in relation to the prevalence of E. aerophilus, but they show wide variations and no simple relationship has been demonstrates. Furthermore, mixed infections with other pulmonary nematodes, such as Crenosoma vulpis and/or Angiostrongylus vasorum, are reported very frequently, which greatly complicates the diagnosis.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nThis systematic review focused on identifying data gaps and promoting future research directions in this area. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that evaluates and summarizes existing knowledge on the occurrence and prevalence of E. aerophilus in wild and domestic animals originating from different geographical locations worldwide."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d79","61de4b387523403b69b1ed6b","5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","5e709341878c28a0473a5b50","63b4f2b975234021979cd4e4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","issue":"16","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61de4b387523403b69b1ed6b","5e709341878c28a0473a5b50","656f268440970749a877bbfd","656f268440970749a877bbfe","5e709347878c28a0473a6619","5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","63b4f2b975234021979cd4e4","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d79","5e709341878c28a0473a5b69"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547919f","mniswId":"15736","title":"Parasites and Vectors","issn":"1756-3305","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"161e133c-a1b7-4671-a6f0-24506c5eadd2"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Eucoleus aerophilus","Capillaria aerophila","Prevalence","Systematic review","Meta‑analysis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058857773"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64d2247c40970767b8541673","name":"Christiane","lastName":"Schnee","documentHash":"9782ce65-3fc0-4048-a6a6-1e161d60ba20"},{"objectId":"64d2247c40970767b8541672","name":"Sabine","lastName":"Scharf","documentHash":"712fae06-0a8f-4773-96f5-3baf312c7139"},{"objectId":"5f8667f1085dcb410a25edeb","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Zaręba-Marchewka","uuid":"E9268C5333F0CBAE54AD7EA9B5CED9C69030D1CDC64F53761DD613459042120BD6E51EF8B9A3BA336DD6CC4A37C971328861C88710E5C38812BDDC990509D461","orcidId":"0000-0003-0657-4171","documentHash":"7c0d8f04-6ae3-4172-8fc6-76b605a7821e"},{"objectId":"5ebeca82752340226956f836","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Bomba","uuid":"12FB755AC252B37BE5C97C4059AA660D336CCB85ECF820137EC4473FE0079489D8E6F29BF1D003D9BC41C079B8FF5D749252A0166BC51069308587C1C55C38AA","documentHash":"1561cffa-00af-4594-82a1-85d53b39ea14"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d56","name":"Monika","lastName":"Szymańska - Czerwińska","uuid":"E07CADA3BDAD828B11D62CEBC4FE77CCF81E33CFCE3A9704EF50F3519D3C3BCC13BA152ACABB83FC29A7C80274C453312953EC94D4928898C8078EA038CDC1CD","orcidId":"0000-0001-8974-0870","documentHash":"3114978b-eee1-4e88-802f-7d034c581f01"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc0","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Niemczuk","uuid":"82AA2E7CCF0C6F87FC9C29C9C294AC35E29D444F944ED9F1FA82BB7FF88B5C2DF9A8411764C95A57F695D0609991E5125471404AD969DADA833F258105E54B44","orcidId":"0000-0003-1611-9770","documentHash":"a1f14ea1-835c-4507-ba6c-be8782ab8fbd"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"JULY","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"64d2247c40970767b8541671","doi":"10.3390/pathogens12070891","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/12/7/891/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Whole Genome Sequencing and Comparative Genomic Analysis of Chlamydia gallinacea Field Strains Isolated from Poultry in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Chlamydia gallinacea is an intracellular bacterium belonging to the Chlamydiaceae family. Poultry is considered to be the major reservoir of this agent, which has worldwide distribution and a particularly consistent worldwide occurrence in chicken flocks. The bacterium has been linked to respiratory disease in humans but without definitive confirmation; nevertheless, while it has not been proved to be the cause of human respiratory disease, a recent report from Italy verified its bird-to-human transmission. This aspect being significant for public health, more research is needed to gain insight into the infection biology of C. gallinacea. In this study, the genomes of eleven novel C. gallinacea field strains from different regions of Poland were analyzed comparatively. It was confirmed that C. gallinacea strains are closely related, with at least 99.46% sequence identity. They possess a conservative genome structure involving the plasticity zone with a complete cytotoxin, the type three secretion system, inclusion membrane proteins, polymorphic membrane proteins, hctA and hctB histone-like proteins, and the chlamydial protease-like activating factor exoenzyme, as well as plasmids. Genetic diversity seems to be restricted.

High concentration of invasive forms of parasites in the soil may pose a threat to human and animal health. Therefore, it is necessary to control the hygienic condition of fertilizers and fertilized soils with particular emphasis on parasites. The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of methods commonly used for parasitological examination of soil with own methods which were used to develop the standards.\nMaterial and methods: The study was carried out using samples of sandy soil (SS), horticultural mix soil (HS) and peat-based substrate (PS). Each sample was spiked with 100 dyed Ascaris suum eggs and examined with the use of 6 methods: Vasilkova, Dada, Quinn, and 3 methods according to the Polish Standards (PN-19000, PN- 19005, PN-19006). For each variant, 8 repetitions were made.\n\nResults: The largest number of A. suum eggs were found with PN-19006 (mean number of detected eggs was 21.25, 46.50, 23.00 for HS, SS, PS, respectively. Slightly lower results were obtained using PN-19005 - the mean number eggs was 21.25, 36.00, 16.75, respectively. On the other hand, the mean number of A. suum eggs found with the Dada method was about 2-3 times lower than with the PN-19006 - 15.75, 22.50, 6.50 for HS, SS, PS soil, respectively. Other methods were much less effective.\nConclusions: PN-19006 method turned out to be the most effective in detecting A. suum eggs. This method can be used for parasitological examination of soils and can be the basis for developing a system of methods dedicated to testing different types of soils for the presence of nematode eggs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","uid":"boRt8XbJIJxFX3j3lPkVVng","uuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","name":"Instytut Uprawy Nawożenia i Gleboznawstwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929f878c28a04739963c","5e70929c878c28a0473992a0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","parentUuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","rootUuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d79","5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c5","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","5e709341878c28a0473a5b50"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee5","uid":"bhxR2mGn694vtlivBJujwBw","uuid":"17d23c12-1f2d-4a37-aae2-bb95ac9ee3dd","name":"Instytut Medycyny Wsi im.

Material and Methods: Altogether, 73 milk samples from cows (n = 38), goats (n = 20) and sheep (n = 15) were collected from various regions of Poland. Concentrations of analytes were determined using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results: The lower-bound sum of four PFAS (Σ4 PFASs) concentrations (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorononanoic acid and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid) were highest in sheep’s (0.0055 μg/kg), lower in goat’s (0.0046 μg/kg), and lowest in cow’s milk (0.0008 μg/kg). Goat’s and sheep’s milk was statistically significantly more contaminated than cow’s milk. None of the samples exceeded the indicative values set by Commission Recommendation (EU) 2022/1431, and even the maximum detected concentrations were an order of magnitude lower. The most frequently detected was linear PFOS, which was found in 33%, 76% and 93% of cow’s, goat’s and sheep’s milk samples, respectively. Based on mean upper-bound Σ4 PFAS concentrations and average milk consumption, the estimated intake of Σ4 PFASs ranged from 0.153 to 0.266 ng/kg body weight (b.w.) for children and from 0.050 to 0.88 ng/kg b.w. for adults, which indicates that exposure is very low and is merely <7% of the tolerable weekly intake (TWI) for children and <2% of the TWI for adults.

Molecular clones obtained from the HT BFVbta Riems cell-free variant (HT BFVbta Riems) have been thoroughly characterized in MDBK cell cultures However, during recent years, it has become increasingly clear that the source of the host cells used for virus growth and functional studies of virus replication and virus–cell interactions plays a paramount role. Established cell lines, mostly derived from tumors, but occasionally experimentally immortalized and transformed, frequently display aberrant features relating, for example. to growth, metabolism, and genetics. Even state-of-the-art organoid cultures of primary cells cannot replicate the conditions in an authentic host, especially those concerning cell diversity and the role of innate and adaptive immunity. Therefore, to determine the overall replication characteristics of the cloned wt and HT BFVbta Riems variant, we conducted a small-scale animal pilot study. The replication of the original wt BFVbta Riems isolate, as well as that of its HT variant, were analyzed. Both BFVbta variants established infection in calves, with proviruses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and induced Gag-specific antibodies. In addition, a related pattern in the host innate immune reaction was detected in the peripheral blood leukocytes of the BFV-infected calves. Surprisingly, an analysis of the Gag sequence two weeks post-inoculation revealed that the HT BFVbta variant showed a very high level of genetic reversion to the wild type (parental BFVbta genotype)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d4b","5e709342878c28a0473a5cad","5e709342878c28a0473a5cb7","5e709342878c28a0473a5ca8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"1772","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cb7","5e709342878c28a0473a5ca8","5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d4b","65166f664097072090cb572a","65166f664097072090cb572b","5e709342878c28a0473a5cad"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a80","mniswId":"20156","title":"Viruses","issn":"1999-4915","eissn":"1999-4915","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses","documentHash":"204f8987-0c7c-441b-9f4a-748747147d4e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65166f664097072090cb5729","year":"2023","volume":"15","number":"8","documentHash":"04b73477-7e49-4a32-88f0-1e2524e3222b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058921991"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"651683384097072090cbfd70","name":"Dieter","lastName":"Steinhagen","documentHash":"0e18b70e-4a17-4f13-94ab-4ec5e232211a"},{"objectId":"651683384097072090cbfd6f","name":"Angela","lastName":"Sünder","documentHash":"62ccb505-d364-42d6-bf12-e41049e94b9b"},{"objectId":"651683384097072090cbfd6e","name":"Carsten","lastName":"Dietz","documentHash":"f577fc99-48bc-4a6e-aa1d-837f412ce216"},{"objectId":"651683384097072090cbfd6d","name":"Jens","lastName":"Tetens","documentHash":"51182ce3-139b-4a91-be97-c5b476b27ef3"},{"objectId":"651683384097072090cbfd6c","name":"Stephan","lastName":"Wessels","documentHash":"c8c4feb6-2e93-4fd4-9036-707f121287f4"},{"objectId":"651683384097072090cbfd6b","name":"Jakob","lastName":"Gährken","documentHash":"ddf37038-0052-42fb-8f83-644b4a05c419"},{"objectId":"651683384097072090cbfd6a","name":"Anne‐Carina","lastName":"Miebach","documentHash":"5f9f8134-08e1-4143-9c55-93bd327ec7e5"},{"objectId":"651683384097072090cbfd69","name":"Mikolaj","lastName":"Adamek","documentHash":"3b870f96-3148-425e-9bfd-ba96b2e92296"},{"objectId":"651683384097072090cbfd68","name":"Julia","lastName":"Bauer","documentHash":"464f2750-c873-4582-bedf-6bbc3e16a4ed"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d4b","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Stachnik","uuid":"01B92F6462C1CB6830BCB9AE30B518B22497247AD0188A7424A9508891DD84867A71E306C24B41DB034501F5C3A35D0F8B7E7CC10B88CB8E34D79381F3268D7F","documentHash":"b4ccb599-a345-4669-860e-a8167f697e56"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d33","name":"Michał","lastName":"Reichert","uuid":"4394EEC51A6B6D1F4DFCB1A7C07A5F8A251A042E9BCA371EAAA432AFE6A8EE1872E16213AA074CCC239D3E7A1034FC416FD93B99D94E0730A905E1D770B3DC27","documentHash":"9da7cc50-be87-4406-af94-e5a72d0e6a2e"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cb8","name":"Marek","lastName":"Matras","uuid":"BD636054DB3493DDDD636EE795A4D1FCC2041405B9AF2405C3FE9431A89A92D290CE0D238A2D2DD339CB2B3801C95E04C33FBEDDC59FCCBEF0DEF833339E0E06","documentHash":"491b124c-bebf-4e8e-bedc-7e237fcef1bb"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":1,"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"AUGUST","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"651683384097072090cbfd67","doi":"10.1111/jfd.13846","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jfd.13846","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"In vitro modelling of the influence of alternative feeds (<i>Hermetia illucens</i>, <i>Arthrospira platensis</i>) on the resistance of different rainbow trout populations (<i>Oncorhynchus mykiss</i>) against the viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus and <i>Yersinia ruckeri</i>","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Replacing fishmeal, a finite resource with high market demand, in the diet of car-nivorous rainbow trout with proteins from alternative sources may be a challenge for these fish.

The analysis of the occurrence of antimicrobial compounds in soil samples is of a great importance to determine potential impacts on human and animal health and the environment. In this study, an affordable, rugged and simple analytical method has been developed for the determination of twenty-nine antimicrobial compounds from five different classes (tetracyclines, fluoro(quinolones), macrolides, sulfonamides and diaminopirimidines). Liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) with extract filtration combined with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was the best strategy for the simultaneous determination of all analytes. The developed method was validated according to the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/808. The limit of detections (LODs) ranged from 0.5 to 2.0 µg/kg, while the limit of quantitation (LOQ) was established at 1.0 to 20.0 µg/kg. The developed method was successfully applied for the determination of antimicrobial residues in one hundred and eighteen soil samples obtained from four European countries (Austria, Czech Republic, Estonia and Portugal). Doxycycline in the concentration levels of 9.07 µg/kg–20.6 µg/kg was detected in eight of the analysed samples. Samples were collected from areas where natural fertilizers (swine or cow manure) were applied. Our method can be efficiently used to monitor anti-microbial compounds in soil samples."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709341878c28a0473a5b5c","5e70947c878c28a0473be309"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"28","issue":"18","pagesFromTo":"6496","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947c878c28a0473be309","5e709341878c28a0473a5b5c","6520082b409707465747dde2","6520082b409707465747dde3","6520082b409707465747dde4","6520082b409707465747dde5","6520082b409707465747dde6","6520082b409707465747dde7","6520082b409707465747dde8","6520082b409707465747dde9","6520082b409707465747ddea"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":"10.3390/molecules","issn":"1420-3049","eissn":"1420-3049","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules","documentHash":"184d7608-03fd-4b64-ac86-b4321a9365f0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"650199ed4097072b3198c9a5","year":"2023","volume":"28","number":"18","documentHash":"a6ff7cd2-83b9-4543-8f08-ecae29175726"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["antimicrobial agents","UHPLC-MS/MS","soil","environment"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058932331"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65200ad64097074657480c7a","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Miłek-Krupa","documentHash":"283b7fac-88b5-47d8-916a-24034f451074"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c3","name":"Anna","lastName":"Pikuła","uuid":"A283B6B2F9E05F2D0E1FAEE12806ECE15D9CABC0E6866E08C1F96C30B82D46ACBF225A28ACC0ACEC7D764DBABA3C442150A97FD6381E3F12E114994BBE205BFB","documentHash":"7e3962ab-978c-4183-9b98-9dd234001dd8"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b5a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Domańska-Blicharz","uuid":"44C5DFE3C33AA49F72079D496E2377ECFB06FF9CECAF80BDDBA1D06D13EA5BC0296FA0DF1BE18E01648F10BC82C3BF11F8D0520B236A22625EBD476B49E108A6","orcidId":"0000-0002-0642-3931","documentHash":"be2eaa91-303e-4813-a127-8bc4b12d6232"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":1,"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"SEPTEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"65200ad64097074657480c79","doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-42241-8","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-42241-8.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Gulls as a host for both gamma and deltacoronaviruses","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The coronaviruses (CoV) are ubiquitous pathogens found in wide variety of hosts that constantly\npose a threat to human and animal health as a result of their enormous capacity to generate genetic changes. Constant monitoring of virus reservoirs can constitute an early-warning tool and control the spread and evolution of the virus. Coronaviruses are common in wild birds, globally, and birds of the Charadriiformes in particular have been demonstrated to be carriers of delta- (dCoV) and gammacoronaviruses (gCoV). In this paper, we present the genetic characterisation of five CoV strains from black-headed (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) and common (Larus canus) gulls. Whole genome sequence analysis showed high similarity of detected dCoV in gulls to previously identified strains from falcon, houbara, pigeon and gulls from Asia (UAE, China). However, phylogenetic analysis revealed bifurcation within a common branch. Furthermore, the accumulation of numerous amino acid changes within the S-protein was demonstrated, indicating further evolution of dCoV within a single gull host. In turn, phylogenetic analysis for the most of the structural and non-structural genes of\nidentified gCoV confirmed that the strain belongs to the duck coronavirus 2714 (DuCoV2714) species\nwithin Igacovirus subgenera, while for the spike protein it forms a separate branch not closely related to any gCoV species known to date. The current study provides new and significant insights into the evolution and diversification of circulating coronaviruses in members of Laridae family."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947c878c28a0473be3c3","5e709341878c28a0473a5b5a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709341878c28a0473a5b5a","65200ad64097074657480c7a","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":"","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"c081063e-cfb2-4a54-ba01-2dc365eba2cf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c9446b4097074220cc9a4d","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"1","documentHash":"c67bc404-c55a-4843-9947-5a16b4a7fe91"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["gull","coronavirus","Poland"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058932606"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d66","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Wieczorek","uuid":"77FE94937137879573023F0D11FD72EFFDFDC4214863FDBF15FEEF0A6BDFD2ABA69978BCCFC9FF88D0F012F09560030758068F57DE1D27D7EB8B20C442DC9439","orcidId":"0000-0001-8268-3885","documentHash":"e54d106b-ea77-4715-815a-37b17126e9c0"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Osek","uuid":"09D7D5320F1FC606BCE9C2D945933A9AD76A02E8625F591A249FCC889F47698A9DDB27A314BD598D2BEBE05552FA565585514F11E04F6B15DA221089044711E2","orcidId":"0000-0003-2295-8837","documentHash":"6dc7582e-e613-4ee9-9ee7-81d949533982"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"SEPTEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"65200c4d40970746574818a6","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2023-0047","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2023-0047","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Porcine carcasses as an underestimated source of antimicrobial resistant <i>Campylobacter coli</i>","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Campylobacteriosis is the most common human foodborne bacterial infection worldwide and is caused by \nbacteria of the Camplylobacter genus.

In the years following the discovery of the virus in Japan,KSD cases have been noted in the UK in koi and common carp. Conducting research in order to expand knowledge of theprocesses of distribution of CEV in infected fish organs will be helpful for eradication and diagnostic purposes. Material andMethods: Carp edema virus–affected fish with clinical signs of KSD were experimentally cohabited with common carp fry (30fish). Three fish were euthanised by bath in a 0.5 g L−1 tricaine solution at one week intervals (7, 14, 21 and 28 days postcohabitation). Tissue samples from the brain, gills, spleen, kidney, intestines and skin were collected, and the total DNA wasextracted and tested by real-time PCR. Results: By the seventh day post infection, CEV DNA was most often found in the skin,gills and brain and less frequently in the kidney and intestines. In many of the common carp fry, CEV DNA could typically befound in several organs of each individual fish, although it was only found in one sample of spleen tissue. Conclusion: In thisexperimental study the pathogenesis of the CEV infection process was shown, the high infectivity of CEV was confirmed and thebest organs were determined for sampling in CEV-infection experimentation.

Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most frequent tick-borne disease with 17,338 cases reported in Poland in 2022. Since research on a LB vaccine is still ongoing, the promotion of individual behaviours and limiting of tick exposure is one of the most effective ways to prevent LB. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the LB prevention programme by assessing the knowledge, practice behaviours, seroprevalence of LB and satisfaction among\nthe population of the Lublin Province in eastern Poland.\nMaterials and method. The prevention programme was carried out among 2,920 participants who were asked about their exposure to ticks, history of LB and prevention behaviours. Awareness of knowledge was evaluated before and after training. Seroprevalence of LB was rated by ELISA and immunoblot assays.\nResults. Over 73% of participants reported tick bites in their lifetime, without significant differences between rural and urban area inhabitants. More than 80% of individuals declared that they use protective measures (PPM), such as proper clothes and body checking; repellents were the least frequently used by participants. The diagnosis of LB but not tick bites in a lifetime influenced the more frequent use of PPM. Increase in knowledge was observed in 86% of participants\nafter education, and the highest knowledge was noted among respondents with higher education. The seroprevalence of anti-B. burgdorferi antibodies was 37% and was higher among men than women (40% vs. 36%).\nConclusions.

In the present study, we evaluated the activity of honeybee workers visiting runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus L.) local cultivar ‘Piękny Jaś’. The runner beans are widely cultivated in south-eastern Poland, and are an important forage plant for honeybees in agroecosystems. We aimed at a comprehensive monitoring of the health of colonies and symptoms in A. mellifera in response to acute exposure to pesticides. The most numerous visits of A. mellifera were observed at the highest flower opening of the runner bean. A very weak positive correlation was observed between the number of honeybees on P. coccineus, the number of visited flowers, the time spent per flower and air temperature. The visitation rates of honeybees were more frequent at mid-day and decreased after 15:00. Signs of poisoning were detected in two out of seven apiaries monitored for acute pesticide exposure symptoms on runner bean plantations. The analysis of dead honeybee samples revealed the acute exposure of honeybees to the imidacloprid (neonicotinoid) and chlorpyrifos (organophosphorus) insecticides, which are highly toxic and banned in the European Union. Hazard quotient (HQ) screening showed an elevated burden of imidacloprid and chlorpyrifos corresponding to 7.1% and 10% of the LDD50, respectively, most likely indicating bee poisoning due to chronic exposure to these substances with contaminated food. Noteworthy was the presence of three fungicides that could pose a risk of poisoning in honeybees."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","uid":"bt6mbuLY9Vpc_KWGkV1Lk4w","uuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Lublinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709225878c28a0473909e9","5e709224878c28a047390906","5e709225878c28a047390a58","5e709224878c28a04739090a","5e709224878c28a047390943","5e709224878c28a047390953"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709486878c28a0473bef2a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"2138","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709224878c28a047390953","6553356340970749a8e79383","5e709224878c28a047390943","5e709224878c28a047390906","5e709224878c28a04739090a","5e709486878c28a0473bef2a","5e709225878c28a047390a58","5e709225878c28a0473909e9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d1","mniswId":"675","title":"Agriculture (Switzerland)","eissn":"2077-0472","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"fb8db9b6-d4d7-498a-b26c-2119c1ad43da"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059011617"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9","name":"Monika","lastName":"Olech","uuid":"9B0A0406A7EDD36FA4801C73080BC03B173E473705A47493F0C38433544479A4BC660CBD60F16ACD61F83868583404238E4E4A1F03B9A0CA29DCC3BD5AAC93DD","orcidId":"0000-0002-8356-5423","documentHash":"0959a77d-a9cb-4a8e-bec6-b983807c59b8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"NOVEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"6560958b4097073c0697ff20","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2023-0064","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2023-0064","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The genetic variability of small-ruminant lentiviruses and its impact on tropism, the development of diagnostic tests and vaccines and the effectiveness of control programmes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Maedi-visna virus and caprine arthritis encephalitis virus are two closely related lentiviruses which causemultisystemic, progressive and persistent infection in goats and sheep. Because these viruses frequently cross the species barrier,they are considered to be one genetic group called small-ruminant lentiviruses (SRLV). They have in vivo tropism mainly formonocytes and macrophages and organ tropism with unknown mechanisms. Typical clinical signs are pneumonia in sheep,arthritis in goats, and mastitis in both species. Infection with SRLV cannot currently be treated or prevented, and controlprogrammes are the only approaches to avoiding its spread. These programmes rely mainly on annual serological testing andelimination of positive animals. However, the high genetic and antigenic variability of SRLV complicate their early anddefinitive diagnosis. The objective of this review is to summarise the current knowledge of SRLV genetic variation and itsimplications for tropism, the development of diagnostic tests and vaccines and the effectiveness of control and eradicationprogrammes. Material and Methods: Subject literature was selected from the PubMed and the Google Scholar databases.Results: The high genetic diversity of SRLV affects the performance of diagnostic tools and therefore control programmes. Forthe early and definitive diagnosis of SRLV infection, a combination of serological and molecular tests is suggested. Testing byPCR can also be considered for sub-yearling animals. There are still significant gaps in our knowledge of the epidemiology,immunology and biology of SRLV and their impact on animal production and welfare. Conclusion: This information may aidselection of the most effective SRLV spread reduction measures."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"0","issue":"67","pagesFromTo":"1-24","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research","issn":"2450-7393","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c3fc9638-cd0e-40bb-89b9-22dee2de8b67"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["SRLV","control","diagnosis","pathogenesis","variability"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059018082"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"608a55de9543c73526c48c68","name":"Beata","lastName":"Lachtara","uuid":"282991714039C961E3319F2426A2863D93470CCBE543F8EC7CE3808AE7F95DEC9E25A5232A45D0AAB8B01CF326F9497B266A34643AE9A696A6239B39FF83989E","documentHash":"a6cf7b97-c844-48db-a522-0850505ee499"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d66","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Wieczorek","uuid":"77FE94937137879573023F0D11FD72EFFDFDC4214863FDBF15FEEF0A6BDFD2ABA69978BCCFC9FF88D0F012F09560030758068F57DE1D27D7EB8B20C442DC9439","orcidId":"0000-0001-8268-3885","documentHash":"e54d106b-ea77-4715-815a-37b17126e9c0"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Osek","uuid":"09D7D5320F1FC606BCE9C2D945933A9AD76A02E8625F591A249FCC889F47698A9DDB27A314BD598D2BEBE05552FA565585514F11E04F6B15DA221089044711E2","orcidId":"0000-0003-2295-8837","documentHash":"6dc7582e-e613-4ee9-9ee7-81d949533982"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"SEPTEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"6523a5f440970754ccb8f878","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2023-0050","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2023-0050","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Antimicrobial resistance of <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> serogroups IIa and IVb from food and food-production environments in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Listeria monocytogenes is an important foodborne pathogen responsible for human listeriosis, which isa disease with high hospitalisation and mortality rates. The bacteria are usually susceptible to most antibacterial substances, butresistance to some of them has been recently observed. The present study introduces the evidence on the emergence of antibioticresistance among L. monocytogenes strains isolated from food and food-production environments in Poland. Material andMethods: A total of 283 L. monocytogenes isolates classified into serogroups IIa and IVb which had been recovered from foodand food production environments were tested with 17 antimicrobials. These included those that are recommended for treatmentof severe listeriosis cases in humans. A multiplex PCR was used to identify serogroups, and a microbroth dilution method wasapplied for the determination of antibiotic resistance among the isolates tested. Results: Only 34 (12.0%) strains were susceptibleto all the antimicrobials used in the study. The remaining 249 (88.0%) strains displayed different instances of resistance to theantimicrobials tested, from insusceptibility to one (112 strains; 39.6%) to resistance to four antibacterial substances (6 strains;2.1%).

Despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the imposition of restrictions that\nit necessitated, the incidence of TBE is rising in more than half of the European countries analyzed in\nrecent studies. The virus is transmitted between ticks, animals, and humans. It seems that ticks and\nsmall mammals play a role in maintaining TBEV in nature. The disease can also affect dogs, horses,\ncattle, and small ruminants. Humans are incidental hosts, infected through the bite of an infected\ntick or by the alimentary route, through the consumption of unpasteurized milk or milk products\nfrom TBEV-infected animals. TBEV infections in humans may be asymptomatic, but the symptoms\ncan range from mild flu-like to severe neurological. In Europe, cases of TBE are reported every year.\nWhile there is currently no effective treatment for TBE, immunization and protection against tick\nbites are critical in preventing this disease."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny -

Council Regulations (EC) No. 853/2004, 854/2004 and 882/2004 of the European Parliament established hygiene rules the production of food of animal origin, together with requirements for official controls. This leads to detailed requirements for Trichinella control set out in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/1375 of 10 August 2015. These regulations require the laboratory to participate in proficiency testing (PT) to confirm their competence and improve the quality of testing, and require the PT Organizer to use methods for the preparation and preservation of parasite larvae in order to evaluate and improve detection. Traditional methods of preparing such larvae expose them to rapid degradation, making it necessary to simultaneously isolate the larvae and place them in meatballs to ensure quality.\n\nMaterial and methods:\nWe developed a technique for preserving of Trichinella spp. for quality control such as PT sample preparation. The procedure protects larvae against toxic oxygen activity and bacterial destruction via a gelatin barrier. To estimate the viability of larvae preserved by this method, gelatin capsules with 10 larvae of T. spiralis in each were stored (4–8 °C) during 45 days of an experiment. Samples were tested at 2 day intervals (3 samples each day of testing).\n\nResults:\nIn total, 75 samples were tested. Larvae remained alive up to 3 weeks. The number of living larvae diminished after 27 days through day 43, after which no living larvae were observed.\n\nConclusions:\nThe gelatin medium procedure facilitated easy, high-throughput sample preparation and supported 100% recovery for 3 weeks. The method allows fast, efficient and accurate PT sample preparation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d79","61de4b387523403b69b1ed6b","5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c5","5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","5e709341878c28a0473a5b50","63b4f2b975234021979cd4e4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee5","uid":"bhxR2mGn694vtlivBJujwBw","uuid":"17d23c12-1f2d-4a37-aae2-bb95ac9ee3dd","name":"Instytut Medycyny Wsi im.

Mimo iż należą do bakterii jelitowych, doskonale odnajdują się w różnych środowiskach poza organizmem żywiciela. Zakażenia Salmonella wśród ludzi przenoszone są głównie przez żywność, zarówno pochodzenia zwierzęcego, jak i roślinnego. Często stanowią poważny problem dla społeczeństwa pod względem zdrowotnym oraz gospodarczym. Bakterie te są czynnikiem etiologicznym chorób zwierząt hodowlanych oraz wolno żyjących, będących również najczęstszym źródłem zanieczyszczającym środowisko. Istotnym i często bagatelizowanym rezerwuarem tych bakterii są również gady oraz płazy. Patogen w środowisku produkcji pasz i żywności, mimo niekorzystnych warunków, może przetrwać przez lata, głównie dzięki zdolności do tworzenia biofilmu. Salmonella jest w stanie kolonizować rośliny epifitycznie oraz endofitycznie. Po przedostaniu się przez tkanki zewnętrzne może zostać przeniesiona wewnętrznym systemem transportowym do różnych organów, w tym do owoców i nasion. Zdolność do kolonizacji zależna jest od serowaru Salmonella oraz gatunku atakowanej rośliny. Przeżywalność oraz namnażanie pałeczek w glebie zależy od wielu, wzajemnie oddziałujących czynników takich jak: typ gleby, wilgotność, pH, temperatura czy flora autochtoniczna. Użyźnianie gleby nawozami naturalnymi znacznie  zwiększa częstość występowania i przeżywalność patogenu. Również w środowisku wodnym Salmonella jest w stanie przetrwać kilka miesięcy od bezpośredniego zanieczyszczenia odchodami ludzi i zwierząt lub pośrednio – z niewystarczająco oczyszczonymi osadami ściekowymi czy spływami z gruntów rolnych. Głównymi czynnikami warunkującymi przeżycie Salmonella są temperatura, światło słoneczne oraz obecność mikroflory towarzyszącej. Zanieczyszczona woda wykorzystywana w procesach przetwórstwa może być również pośrednią przyczyną transmisji patogenów jelitowych na żywność."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Salmonella is one of the most common causes of foodborne diseases. As for the intestinal bacterium, it perfectly finds itself in various environments outside the host's organism. Salmonella infections in humans are mainly transmitted through food of animal and plant origin and pose a serious problem for the community in terms of health and economy. Salmonella is the etiological factor of diseases in farm and free-living animals, which are also the most common source of environmental contamination. Reptiles and amphibians represent an important and often underestimated reservoir of these bacteria. The pathogen in the feed and food processing environment can survive for years despite unfavorable conditions, mainly due to the ability for biofilm formation. Salmonella can colonize plants epiphytically and endophytically. After getting through external tissues can be transferred through the internal transport system to various organs, including fruit and seeds. The colonization depends on the bacteria serovar and the species of the plant being infected. The survival and the ability to proliferation of Salmonella in the soil depend on many interacting factors, such as soil type, humidity, pH, temperature, and indigenous flora. Enriching the soil with natural fertilizers enhances the occurrence and significantly reduces the rate of decline of the pathogen. Also in the aquatic environment Salmonella can survive for months from directly contamination of human or animal faeces, or indirectly – with insufficiently treated sewage sludge or runoff from agricultural land.

Material and Methods: Twenty samples of E. multilocularis larval forms were obtained from pigs’ livers in four provinces of Poland. Genetic analyses were conducted on sequences of two mitochondrial genes: cox1 and nad2. Results: Seven haplotypes were found for the cox1 gene (OQ874673–OQ874679) and four haplotypes for nad2 (OQ884981–OQ884984). They corresponded to the haplotypes described earlier in foxes in Poland (some of them differing only in one nucleotide). The analysis showed the presence of the Asian-like haplotype in both the cox1 and nad2 genes. The remaining haplotypes were grouped in the European clade. The geographical distribution of haplotypes identified in the pig samples was noticed to bear a similarity to the distribution of haplotypes previously isolated from foxes in the same regions. Conclusion: The characteristic geographical distribution of E. multilocularis haplotypes in Central Europe (including the presence of the Asian-like haplotype) previously described in the population of definitive hosts (foxes) has now been confirmed by the analysis of samples from non-specific intermediate hosts (pigs)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut

Treatment","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Gliomas are the most malignant tumors of the central nervous system. One of the factors in their high drug resistance is avoiding programmed death (PCD) induction. This is related to the overexpression of intracellular survival pathways: PI3K-Akt/PKB-mTOR and Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK. Apoptosis and autophagy are co-existing processes due to the interactions between Bcl-2 and beclin-1 proteins. Their complex may be a molecular “toggle-switch” between PCD types. The aim of this research was to investigate the role of Bcl-2:beclin-1 complex in glioma cell elimination through the combined action of LY294002 and sorafenib. Methods: Drug cytotoxicity was estimated with an MTT test. The type of cell death was evaluated using variant microscopy techniques (fluorochrome staining, immunocytochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy), as well as the Bcl-2:beclin-1 complex formation and protein localization. Molecular analysis of PCD indicators was conducted through immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and ELISA testing. SiRNA was used to block Bcl-2 and beclin-1 expression. Results: The results showed the inhibitors used in simultaneous application resulted in Bcl-2:beclin-1 complex formation and apoptosis becoming dominant.

Unfortunately, since 2020, the EU territory has faced two major rabies re-emergence events of rabies lyssavirus\nin non-flying animals. The first sylvatic rabies outbreak, already described, occurred in 2021 and 2022 in Poland in the\nMazowieckie voivodeship, involving the Central Europe variant, while the second one affecting Romania, Hungaria, and Slovakia,\nincreased considerably at the end of 2022 and involved the North East Europe variant only. Thus, Hungary and Slovakia that did\nnot record a single case since 5–7 years, respectively, faced new rabies outbreaks in 2022. This article, therefore, presents these two\nepidemiological events and discusses the importance and challenges of maintaining ORV programmes and immune belts in the\nlong term, particularly in a complicated context of a pandemic affecting organisation of human societies and of geopolitical\nconflicts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cc4","5e709342878c28a0473a5d46"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"2023","pagesFromTo":"1-9","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["656097824097073c06981948","5e709342878c28a0473a5d46","656097824097073c06981949","656097824097073c0698194a","656097824097073c0698194b","656097824097073c0698194c","656097824097073c0698194d","656097824097073c0698194e","656097824097073c0698194f","656097824097073c06981950","656097824097073c06981951","656097824097073c06981952","656097824097073c06981953","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479992","mniswId":"19667","title":"Transboundary and Emerging Diseases","issn":"1865-1674","eissn":"1865-1682","documentHash":"63ba7bfa-763a-432b-b1ee-7e10df3e4d8f"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"656097824097073c06981947","year":"2023","volume":"2023","documentHash":"73c9f6ba-5a28-44d6-8d0a-c7f2fd139c42"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Rabies"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059042274"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"656077624097073c0695b0f0","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Podgórski","documentHash":"44c5735f-129c-4044-b890-b4157213377a"},{"objectId":"656077624097073c0695b0ef","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Plis","documentHash":"fb021228-e925-461d-9cdc-3359168b1302"},{"objectId":"656077624097073c0695b0ee","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Borowik","documentHash":"da9df722-b8d2-4509-ae8e-5025bd3eb2ec"},{"objectId":"656077624097073c0695b0ed","name":"Kim M.","lastName":"Pepin","documentHash":"7cf44674-f309-4955-b1fe-1d7990267fd6"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a660f","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Frant","uuid":"2AD73901C2B1BDDF66264197B4E2A40BB43C9F170B0D3D9252C79378D973DED6BA0DD7DB0E3F16FB50489E4717CA62BAE671805ED94AD0C5F9B3478EE3C561FE","orcidId":"0000-0002-7169-3735","documentHash":"b81b59e2-56af-4ed2-bfbe-bdf26cc5f824"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"NOVEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"656077624097073c0695b0ec","doi":"10.3389/fvets.2023.1295127","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2023.1295127/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Risk of African swine fever virus transmission among wild boar and domestic pigs in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: African swine fever (ASF) is a notifiable disease of swine that impacts global pork trade and food security. In several countries across the globe, the disease persists in wild boar (WB) populations sympatric to domestic pig (DP) operations, with continued detections in both sectors. While there is evidence of spillover and spillback between the sectors, the frequency of occurrence and relative importance of different risk factors for transmission at the wildlife-livestock interface remain unclear.\n\nMethods: To address this gap, we leveraged ASF surveillance data from WB and DP across Eastern Poland from 2014–2019 in an analysis that quantified the relative importance of different risk factors for explaining variation in each of the ASF surveillance data from WB and DP.\n\nResults: ASF prevalence exhibited different seasonal trends across the sectors: apparent prevalence was much higher in summer (84% of detections) in DP, but more consistent throughout the year in WB (highest in winter with 45%, lowest in summer at 15%). Only 21.8% of DP-positive surveillance data included surveillance in WB nearby (within 5 km of the grid cell within the last 4 weeks), while 41.9% of WB-positive surveillance samples included any DP surveillance samples nearby. Thus, the surveillance design afforded twice as much opportunity to find DP-positive samples in the recent vicinity of WB-positive samples compared to the opposite, yet the rate of positive WB samples in the recent vicinity of a positive DP sample was 48 times as likely than the rate of positive DP samples in the recent vicinity of a positive WB sample. Our machine learning analyses found that positive samples in WB were predicted by WB-related risk factors, but not to DP-related risk factors. In contrast, WB risk factors were important for predicting detections in DP on a few spatial and temporal scales of data aggregation.\n\nDiscussion: Our results highlight that spillover from WB to DP might be more frequent than the reverse, but that the structure of current surveillance systems challenge quantification of spillover frequency and risk factors. Our results emphasize the importance of, and provide guidance for, improving cross-sector surveillance designs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a660f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"1295127","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["656077624097073c0695b0ed","656077624097073c0695b0ee","5e709347878c28a0473a660f","656077624097073c0695b0ef","656077624097073c0695b0f0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb3","mniswId":"22511","title":"Frontiers in Veterinary Science","issn":"2297-1769","eissn":"2297-1769","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"7aca7674-d53a-406a-bc77-ca524899ec80"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ef4f294097075fda407434","year":"2023","volume":"10","documentHash":"6a6ac8c2-1110-4e8c-b867-2e26bb4e0532"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["African swine fever","wild boar","domestic pigs","surveillance","wildlife-livestock"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059042404"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61d6623975234056c07ce9ce","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Malczak","uuid":"11349A05FDE248FDBE24AA830022E8592BAE4C0C986702A08FBBE5DAC1545062A384B86B22E7540938763D9A86627A19DE9B8676A9EC6AA361F3102852A235DD","documentHash":"20f2be09-8b39-40e4-a427-ef09af2dfe51"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b5c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Gajda","uuid":"737BA79C0CDDEA58062EFA3DAF7A11C5B7A456F7185DF5693B57EE4097ED5366D5B5D9FD97385488431E06665C388F3163A713C9B3DC06F30B91B586578814C9","documentHash":"c782825e-7075-4034-aef9-edf206624991"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"SEPTEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"65607f5e4097073c0696c3b6","doi":"10.1016/j.jpha.2023.09.014","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2095177923002526?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Interactions of naturally occurring compounds with antimicrobials","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Antibiotics are among the most often used medications in human healthcare and agriculture. Overusing these substances can lead to complications such as increasing antibiotic resistance in bacteria or a toxic effect when administering large amounts. To solve these problems, new solutions in antibacterial therapy are needed. The use of natural products in medicine has been known for centuries. Some of them have antibacterial activity, hence the idea to combine their activity with commercial antibiotics to reduce the latter's use. This review presents collected information on natural compounds (terpenes, alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, sulfoxides, and mycotoxins), of which various drug interactions have been observed. Many of the indicated compounds show synergistic or additive interactions with antibiotics, which suggests their potential for use in antibacterial therapy, reducing the toxicity of the antibiotics used and the risk of further development of bacterial resistance. Unfortunately, there are also compounds which interact antagonistically, potentially hindering the therapy of bacterial infection. Depending on its mechanism of action, each compound can behave differently in combination with different antibiotics and when acting against various bacterial strains."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61d6623975234056c07ce9ce","5e709341878c28a0473a5b5c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-49","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61d6623975234056c07ce9ce","5e709341878c28a0473a5b5c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c9d0","mniswId":"12249","title":"Journal of Pharmaceutical Analysis","issn":"2095-1779","documentHash":"a14c8435-a594-4933-9d77-a3f9669971bb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65607f5e4097073c0696c3b7","year":"2023","documentHash":"25d12850-ac1c-4616-aa9e-068860a539d3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Interactions","antimicrobials","natural compounds","antibiotics"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059042496"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b5b","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Dudek","uuid":"1C236F39CBEBF0222678F951AF88B126D140208B5163B55E8C071114CA662533C5091A9A508F004E10111CC585F5B5B8960B4FE4DD6655438133A4486E6B6E7B","orcidId":"0000-0002-3271-3748","documentHash":"82e1f788-1bf1-4bd4-a410-133526ffd169"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b2e","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Bednarek","uuid":"AA380B7BF0343A0E6141C8BEB7A3A3EBA04C0325698ADAC0767395B7733F03E24AC85A07BDC4328B7A7E130BDBCB2936B49228B3631DD800F1FFE3014F1E0747","documentHash":"32d8ef0b-98a5-4824-a096-10d65df496a1"}],"objectId":"65609bb84097073c0698b334","publicUri":"https://vetkompleksowo.pl/vet-w-terenie/bydlo/immunoprofilaktyka-chorob-zakaznych-ukladu-oddechowego-cielat/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Immunoprofilaktyka chorób zakaźnych układu oddechowego cieląt","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Immunoprofilaktyka chorób zakaźnych układu oddechowego cieląt jest \nw głównej mierze oparta na stosowaniu produktów leczniczych weterynaryjnych przeznaczonych do czynnego uodparniania zwierząt przeciwko drobnoustrojom chorobotwórczym.

Mimo iż należą do bakterii jelitowych, doskonale odnajdują się w różnych środowiskach poza organizmem żywiciela. Zakażenia Salmonella wśród ludzi przenoszone są głównie przez żywność, zarówno pochodzenia zwierzęcego, jak i roślinnego. Często stanowią poważny problem dla społeczeństwa pod względem zdrowotnym oraz gospodarczym. Bakterie te są czynnikiem etiologicznym chorób zwierząt hodowlanych oraz wolno żyjących, będących również najczęstszym źródłem zanieczyszczającym środowisko. Istotnym i często bagatelizowanym rezerwuarem tych bakterii są również gady oraz płazy. Patogen w środowisku produkcji pasz i żywności, mimo niekorzystnych warunków, może przetrwać przez lata, głównie dzięki zdolności do tworzenia biofilmu. Salmonella jest w stanie kolonizować rośliny epifitycznie oraz endofitycznie. Po przedostaniu się przez tkanki zewnętrzne może zostać przeniesiona wewnętrznym systemem transportowym do różnych organów, w tym do owoców i nasion. Zdolność do kolonizacji zależna jest od serowaru Salmonella oraz gatunku atakowanej rośliny. Przeżywalność oraz namnażanie pałeczek w glebie zależy od wielu, wzajemnie oddziałujących czynników takich jak: typ gleby, wilgotność, pH, temperatura czy flora autochtoniczna. Użyźnianie gleby nawozami naturalnymi znacznie  zwiększa częstość występowania i przeżywalność patogenu. Również w środowisku wodnym Salmonella jest w stanie przetrwać kilka miesięcy od bezpośredniego zanieczyszczenia odchodami ludzi i zwierząt lub pośrednio – z niewystarczająco oczyszczonymi osadami ściekowymi czy spływami z gruntów rolnych. Głównymi czynnikami warunkującymi przeżycie Salmonella są temperatura, światło słoneczne oraz obecność mikroflory towarzyszącej. Zanieczyszczona woda wykorzystywana w procesach przetwórstwa może być również pośrednią przyczyną transmisji patogenów jelitowych na żywność."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Salmonella is one of the most common causes of foodborne diseases. As for the intestinal bacterium, it perfectly finds itself in various environments outside the host's organism. Salmonella infections in humans are mainly transmitted through food of animal and plant origin and pose a serious problem for the community in terms of health and economy. Salmonella is the etiological factor of diseases in farm and free-living animals, which are also the most common source of environmental contamination. Reptiles and amphibians represent an important and often underestimated reservoir of these bacteria. The pathogen in the feed and food processing environment can survive for years despite unfavorable conditions, mainly due to the ability for biofilm formation. Salmonella can colonize plants epiphytically and endophytically. After getting through external tissues can be transferred through the internal transport system to various organs, including fruit and seeds. The colonization depends on the bacteria serovar and the species of the plant being infected. The survival and the ability to proliferation of Salmonella in the soil depend on many interacting factors, such as soil type, humidity, pH, temperature, and indigenous flora. Enriching the soil with natural fertilizers enhances the occurrence and significantly reduces the rate of decline of the pathogen. Also in the aquatic environment Salmonella can survive for months from directly contamination of human or animal faeces, or indirectly – with insufficiently treated sewage sludge or runoff from agricultural land. The main determinants of Salmonella survival are temperature, sunlight and the presence of accompanying microflora.

The investigation evaluated the risk of indirect transmissionof the disease and indicated points that may facilitate cleaning and disinfection processes. Material and Methods: Six domesticpigs were infected oronasally with the highly pathogenic Georgia 2007 strain. Environmental samples from the floors, walls, rubberfloor mats, feeders, drinkers, high-efficiency particulate-absorbing filter covers and doors were collected 7 days post infection(dpi), 7 days later and 24 h after disinfection of the facility. The samples were investigated by real-time PCR and in vitro assays tofind genetic traces of ASFV and infectious virus. Results: Typical clinical outcomes for ASF (i.e. fever, apathy, recumbency andbloody diarrhoea) were observed, and all animals died or required euthanasia before or at 9 dpi. No infectious virus was found inenvironmental samples at the sampling time points. Genetic traces of ASFV were found in all locations except the doors. The initialvirus load was calculated using real-time PCR threshold cycle values and was the highest at the drain. A statistically significantdecrease of virus load over time was found on non-porous surfaces mechanically cleaned by water (the floor and drain).Conclusion: The gathered data confirmed different routes of virus excretion (oral and nasal, faeces and urine, and aerosol) andshowed virus locations and different initial concentrations in the animal facility. Maintaining the facility with mechanical cleaningand using personal protection (gloves) and hand disinfection may efficiently minimise the risk of further virus spread. Togetherwith the results of previously published studies, the present investigations’ failure to isolate infectious virus may suggest that ifstable environmental conditions are assured, the time needed before the introduction of new herds into previously ASF-affectedfarm facilities could be shortened and in this way the economic losses caused by the disease outbreak mitigated."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d6f","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4e","5ebee176752340254fc4382c","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de0","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e49"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"0","issue":"67","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6569aca24097077c04766e72","6569aca24097077c04766e73","6569aca24097077c04766e74","6569aca24097077c04766e75","5e709342878c28a0473a5d6f","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de0","5ebee176752340254fc4382c","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4e","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e49"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research","issn":"2450-7393","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c3fc9638-cd0e-40bb-89b9-22dee2de8b67"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["African swine fever","pigsty","indirect transmission","persistence","risk"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059055861"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0ddf","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kaupke","uuid":"BB4CD2E891EE29C149E16224967B6459994EDA1FD1864612676536B0873CAF6716213A6EA983883AB4AB95E3FDCD1257ABD4434268B52114615B9242AA80452C","orcidId":"0000-0003-2930-9346","documentHash":"aea3f641-2f16-497b-ad21-2822cc05a109"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d41","name":"Artur","lastName":"Rzeżutka","uuid":"96C85B61D3E6BA3657F0A0E04C8CE4A1016EFBE59FEB907FB5C3839E3A19929363BE5F9B8C71F56D60D507D45A0D3B09927E0D5EF05EB658908558DB427DC4C1","orcidId":"0000-0001-6301-1143","documentHash":"2a5cb6f9-9a99-43f2-80dc-4cb29ef3c1cf"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"NOVEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"656db87840970718551e101b","doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-47810-5","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-47810-5.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Cryptosporidium infections in asymptomatic calves up to 4 months in Poland: a cross-sectional population study","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cattle cryptosporidiosis is noted worldwide with varied frequency of infection prevalence depending on geographical, environmental and husbandry factors. In this study, the prevalence of Cryptosporidium infections in cattle was determined on the basis of molecular results obtained by testing 1601 faecal samples collected from calves up to 4 months of age housed in all Polish provinces from 2014 to 2018. Detection and identification of Cryptosporidium species was performed at the 18 small subunit ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) locus by conducting PCR–RFLP analysis of the amplified DNA fragments. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium infections in the cattle population was 45.3% (CI 95%: 42.8–47.7; 725/1601). The infected animals were housed on 233/267 (87.3%) of monitored farms with regional prevalence ranging from 27.8 to 62%. The restriction pattern of 18S rRNA amplicons for positive samples was characteristic of C. parvum, C. bovis, C. ryanae, C. andersoni, and unexpectedly also of C. baileyi and C. suis. Infections of C. bovis and C. ryanae prevailed in the studied cattle population relegating C. parvum to third in prevalence. Likewise, mixed infections caused by C. bovis and C. ryanae as well as C. parvum and C. bovis were observed. A relationship between the infecting parasite species and animal breed was found. For instance, C. parvum prevailed in Black and White lowland breed, C. ryanae in Limousine cattle and C. andersoni in dairy animals of mixed dairy breeds. Furthermore, differences in prevalence of particular parasite species between cattle breeds were also shown."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0ddf","5e709342878c28a0473a5d41"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"1-12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d41","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0ddf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":"","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"c081063e-cfb2-4a54-ba01-2dc365eba2cf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c9446b4097074220cc9a4d","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"1","documentHash":"c67bc404-c55a-4843-9947-5a16b4a7fe91"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cryptosporidium","molecular detection","cattle","prevalence","species distribution"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059062493"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"656dba1c40970718551e2f64","name":"Maj","lastName":"Rundlöf","documentHash":"c4efdba3-f3e6-4a96-908c-a93bd076f40b"},{"objectId":"656dba1c40970718551e2f63","name":"Jane C.","lastName":"Stout","documentHash":"c1d0cca2-6b1b-4ddd-8c48-5df85e58c1cf"},{"objectId":"656dba1c40970718551e2f62","name":"Mark J.

Field studies demonstrated that agricultural use of neonicotinoid insecticides can negatively affect wild bee species1,2, leading to restrictions on these compounds3. However, besides neonicotinoids, field-based evidence of the effects of landscape pesticide exposure on wild bees is lacking. Bees encounter many pesticides in agricultural landscapes4,5,6,7,8,9 and the effects of this landscape exposure on colony growth and development of any bee species remains unknown. Here we show that the many pesticides found in bumble bee-collected pollen are associated with reduced colony performance during crop bloom, especially in simplified landscapes with intensive agricultural practices. Our results from 316 Bombus terrestris colonies at 106 agricultural sites across eight European countries confirm that the regulatory system fails to sufficiently prevent pesticide-related impacts on non-target organisms, even for a eusocial pollinator species in which colony size may buffer against such impacts10,11. These findings support the need for postapproval monitoring of both pesticide exposure and effects to confirm that the regulatory process is sufficiently protective in limiting the collateral environmental damage of agricultural pesticide use."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709486878c28a0473bef2a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["656dba1c40970718551e2f48","656dba1c40970718551e2f49","5e709486878c28a0473bef2a","656dba1c40970718551e2f4a","656dba1c40970718551e2f4b","656dba1c40970718551e2f4c","656dba1c40970718551e2f4d","656dba1c40970718551e2f4e","656dba1c40970718551e2f4f","656dba1c40970718551e2f50","656dba1c40970718551e2f51","656dba1c40970718551e2f52","656dba1c40970718551e2f53","656dba1c40970718551e2f54","656dba1c40970718551e2f55","656dba1c40970718551e2f56","656dba1c40970718551e2f57","656dba1c40970718551e2f58","656dba1c40970718551e2f59","656dba1c40970718551e2f5a","656dba1c40970718551e2f5b","656dba1c40970718551e2f5c","656dba1c40970718551e2f5d","656dba1c40970718551e2f5e","656dba1c40970718551e2f5f","656dba1c40970718551e2f60","656dba1c40970718551e2f61","656dba1c40970718551e2f62","656dba1c40970718551e2f63","656dba1c40970718551e2f64"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f77","mniswId":"14803","title":"Nature","issn":"0028-0836","eissn":"1476-4687","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"85aad413-46c9-4444-9418-c386c87f77a6"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Environmental impact","Agroecology","Conservation biology","Sustainability","Environmental monitoring"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059068223"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60838d019543c73526c48be4","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Piekarska","uuid":"B8353A57E6299AFFC996BC70FC8602BAD6EA4BDB9BDEAFE03D1C5352BA23A25FD13A96362EF57A6F07BEE66CD7CFD928336B159AF94757CD25E8B15E3D52FE5F","documentHash":"7041e770-7569-4df6-9af4-a536fe6fb728"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc2","name":"Jowita","lastName":"Niczyporuk","uuid":"521A2CD27A6C13DBEA5F489A8B137DCF73274C7B82AFB6C47400C8D36DF4DD03F9F21771D8DF7D702977129F5DDA28AB1A1D48BE68F3AF8007BBA4E10B5B83EF","orcidId":"0000-0003-3714-0552","documentHash":"734a1820-86f7-4af0-9ef1-22c5d3045238"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5ca4","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Kozdruń","uuid":"92417BFED8719CCDFD4C817BFF825E8DF8211DEB1B193FBEB8B9342F72B6CFB5A5668B33A83590A195BB8C4302D6703499EF982E33705E65072F2A5B25651ADB","orcidId":"0000-0003-2747-3804","documentHash":"e55d11c0-58ff-486f-aa9c-0edbe60eab6b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"NOVEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"656094254097073c0697e9bc","publicUri":"https://www.vetpol.org.pl/dmdocuments/ZW-11-2023-04.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Wirusy onkogenne drobiu.

MS are highly contagious bacteria that can cause significant losses in commercial poultry populations when its prevalence is not limited. MS infections can cause losses associated with a range of clinical symptoms related to the respiratory, mobility and reproductive systems. Lesions related to the reproductive system and changes in the eggshell result in losses associated with infection or embryo death or complete destruction of the eggs. The authors propose using spectral measurements backed up by an AI data processing algorithm to classify eggs’ origin: from healthy hens or MS-infected ones. The newest obtained classification factors are F-scores for white eggshells of 99% and scores for brown eggshells of 99%—all data used for classification were obtained using a portable multispectral fibre-optics reflectometer. The proposed method may be used directly on the farm by staff members with limited qualifications, as well as by veterinary doctors, assistants, or customs officers. Moreover, this method is scalable to mass production of eggs. Standard methods such as serological tests require either specialized staff or laboratory equipment. Implementation of a non-destructive optical measurement method, which is easily adapted for use on a production line, is economically reasonable."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1d5","uid":"bJAF3J7gD1iEjREYkfNvHfQ","uuid":"9ab5d088-ab1d-4ba8-8cf3-3b1ed670a267","name":"Wydział Nowych Technologii i Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a5878c28a047399ca5","5e7092a5878c28a047399cb5","5e70930d878c28a0473a1fca"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dffb","uid":"bsoW7mLeVuU9ZqxbO25dnDw","uuid":"96780aa4-1a88-407d-a185-0f02961ef93c","name":"Wydział Mechatroniki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f1878c28a0473b3c3a","5e70930d878c28a0473a1fca"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","parentUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","rootUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"22","pagesFromTo":"12360-1 - 12360-9","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70930d878c28a0473a1fca","5e7093f1878c28a0473b3c3a","5e7092a5878c28a047399cb5","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de5","5e7092a5878c28a047399ca5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences","eissn":"2076-3417","documentHash":"976d1e86-5dd0-4e19-9276-7114f4dea573"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"654ce04040970749a85b5abf","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"13","number":"22","documentHash":"11d5e12b-a596-468d-b604-47c895a2bbde"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Mycoplasma synoviae","pathogen detection","optical measurements","spectral measurements","optical spectroscopy","machine learning","artificial intelligence AI","origin classification","food safety","food monitoring"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059122047"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cbf","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Niedbalski","uuid":"90830D13758A9776FFC495F0A331CC8D6D909FF91158E7D5A98151A0B9F1A06032234B29FA3BBEDB1DD674D0B9C5E2DA6A64DA6FE777229B6A03EB0936A2E8A7","documentHash":"cb59e9a7-36ba-417a-87d3-5219b470c1ad"}],"objectId":"6565e54c4097075e9e5362f8","publicUri":"http://www.medycynawet.edu.pl/images/stories/pdf/pdf2022/032022/2022036619.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Bluetongue virus in Europe: The current epidemiological situation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article reviews the history of BT occurrence in Europe and its present status. It describes the distribution of BT in Europe before 1998, the emergence of BTV in southern and eastern Europe in 1998-2006 and the epidemiology of BT in north-western Europe after 2006. Up to 1998, sporadic cases of BT were noted in Cyprus, on the Iberian Peninsula and on several Greek islands. However, since 1998, probably due to climatic changes,\nBTV has spread northwards into the Mediterranean Basin, where five BTV serotypes (1, 2, 4, 9 and 16) have been identified. In August 2006, BTV passed for the first time latitude 50°N, and BT outbreaks caused by BTV serotype 8 occurred in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France and Luxembourg. Mass vaccination campaigns implemented in Europe in the spring of 2008 quickly limited the spread of disease caused by BTV-8, and it was eradicated by 2011. However, after a 3-year break, in September 2015, BTV-8 re-emerged in Europe, in central France, and subsequently spread throughout the entire country. In the following years,\nBTV-8 outbreaks were found in Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and Spain. In addition to BTV-8 outbreaks, BTV serotypes 1, 2, 4, 9 and 16 have recently circulated in Europe. As revealed by phylogeographic inference, the recent spread of BTV in Europe is a consequence of climatic, landscape and vertebrate host factors"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cbf"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"78","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"109-114","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cbf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478e2c","mniswId":"14214","title":"Medycyna Weterynaryjna-Veterinary Medicine-Science and Practice","issn":"0025-8628","eissn":"0025-8628","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"5f7ed625-bfbb-4d31-8464-ad34e7a26384"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"625e85952467f03847f27150","year":"2022","volume":"78","number":"3","documentHash":"16c41f92-a997-4609-82c1-c07124678332"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bluetongue","epidemiology","Europe"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059125079"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d63","name":"Marek","lastName":"Pajurek","uuid":"358255257A75C74D59A14A68D4AD1D554284D6EA9DD40FBD386D3E65CF5750BD0AFFF658AA426C816DC388F1A156AECE3148D4AE805CC056A07EFA22690EE5D5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8222-7983","documentHash":"7f676a9f-a4bf-48d6-8a81-13e7fdd64d47"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0dfa","name":"Szczepan","lastName":"Mikołajczyk","uuid":"C57E964869276842E1B6331B9082F2B02A42D6FADD90FF381F756A49C8569C2E04C6F6ABF9E834E4B7AB5848A68D8684085BA83752893DAFEA5BB142A62126BA","orcidId":"0000-0003-0185-174X","documentHash":"40314827-db15-4c91-940f-4476439025a4"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c4","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Warenik-Bany","uuid":"4712B9142F37DE7444F67A0D87EE1C663B7551CC5403CE356609DD8451AC163AE66C02975F4E46C75BA54D138152C7CA025EC98E7A9BBC1C46CE7FDB9A2F3D49","orcidId":"0000-0002-3839-6464","documentHash":"a8205408-5907-4d58-85e1-a99171e81d41"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"OCTOBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"65644c72409707538501c227","publicUri":"https://wydawnictwo.pttz.org/magazine-archive-categories/2023-30-2-135/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"DIOKSYNY, FURANY I PCB W IMPORTOWANYCH RYBACH MORSKICH – NARAŻENIE KONSUMENTÓW","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Wprowadzenie.

Systemic toxoplasmosis with tissue-spread parasites occurring in intermediate hosts may also occur in immunocompromised cats (e.g., infected with FLV or FIV). To the best of our knowledge, no reports have been published on the detection and genotyping of T. gondii DNA in cats with extraintestinal toxoplasmosis in Poland. The article describes the case of the sudden death of 3 out of 4 cats in a cattery, and the detection and molecular characterization of T. gondii DNA detected in the tissues of one of the dead cats.\nMaterials and method. Samples of brain, lungs, heart, and liver of the cat that died suddenly were examined for the presence of T. gondii DNA (B1 gene) by nested PCR and real-time PCR. DNA positive samples were also genotyped at 12\ngenetic markers using multiplex multilocus nested PCR‑RFLP (Mn‑PCR‑RFLP) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST).\nResults. A total of 9 out of the 20 DNA samples were successfully amplified with nested and/or Real-time PCR. DNA from 3 out of 5 types of tested samples were genotyped (brain, heart and muscle). Mn‑PCR‑RFLP and MLST results revealed type II (and II/III at SAG1) alleles at almost all loci, except a clonal type I allele at the APICO locus. This profile corresponds to the ToxoDB#3 genotype, commonly identified amongst cats in Central Europe.\nConclusions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study describing the genetic characteristics of T. gondii population determined in a cat in Poland.

Currently thanks to higher vigilance and screening for its presence the virus was\nconfirmed to be widespread on the European continent and affects both ornamental koi, farmed and feral\ncommon carp. Phylogenetic research of CEV is however in its infancy. Until recently due to the lack of available\nsequence information, the phylogenetic analysis was limited to a p4a gene. Based on this gene two main clades\nwere established. The genogroup I clade is of European origin and can be found in farmed or feral common carp\nin Europe. However, the eastern border of the geographic range of CEV from genogroup I is not yet established,\ntherefore we decided to obtain samples from clinically affected carp from Ukraine. Furthermore, we used se-\nquences of the DNA binding viral core protein 8 (VP8) and of the uracil DNA glycosylase (UDGS) to confirm the\nexistence of the genogroups I and II. The results indicate that CEV is highly prevalent in Ukraine. Phylogenetic\nanalysis using the p4a gene showed that common carps in Ukraine are infected with CEV genogroup I. The two\nadditional genes used for the phylogenetic analysis supported the phylogenetic findings. This confirms that\ncommon carps in continental Europe are hosts for CEV from the genogroup I and the geographic range for this\nvirus is reaching to the most eastern parts of Ukraine."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cb8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"101500","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6580322a4097073e4d203591","6580322a4097073e4d203592","6580322a4097073e4d203593","5e709342878c28a0473a5cb8","6580322a4097073e4d203594","6580322a4097073e4d203595"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d7a6","mniswId":"20992","title":"Aquaculture Reports","issn":"2352-5134","eissn":"2352-5134","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"99140b83-1678-4900-8f41-d6ce7d6e3541"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6580322a4097073e4d203590","year":"2023","volume":"29","documentHash":"0364e86e-8e34-44ad-9421-50ac40815658"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Carp edema virus","CEV","Phylogeny"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059147328"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c6","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Szacawa","uuid":"DD43CD53336D1E5297A82642902BD389F928A8486E324B79CBA86546EB4532E8DB8BFFC5C8D38396248D3DC10B3EF1780F09FA0DEC786C12A0A0BDA76B446C17","orcidId":"0000-0003-1815-5724","documentHash":"ff75ac41-419e-43d3-8b98-82ee0c2db7c8"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b5b","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Dudek","uuid":"1C236F39CBEBF0222678F951AF88B126D140208B5163B55E8C071114CA662533C5091A9A508F004E10111CC585F5B5B8960B4FE4DD6655438133A4486E6B6E7B","orcidId":"0000-0002-3271-3748","documentHash":"82e1f788-1bf1-4bd4-a410-133526ffd169"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b2e","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Bednarek","uuid":"AA380B7BF0343A0E6141C8BEB7A3A3EBA04C0325698ADAC0767395B7733F03E24AC85A07BDC4328B7A7E130BDBCB2936B49228B3631DD800F1FFE3014F1E0747","documentHash":"32d8ef0b-98a5-4824-a096-10d65df496a1"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"658051bf4097073e4d231518","doi":"10.1111/jvim.16939","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jvim.16939","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The effect of pegbovigrastim administration on the nonspecific immunity of calves","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background\nPrevention of diseases in the early rearing of calves is important, particularly because disease occurrence most often requires antimicrobial administration but reduction of their use in animals is a priority.

Pigs are the main reservoir of the HEV-3 genotype, which is the most common in Europe, and can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of raw and undercooked pork products. Extensive sequencing revealed the existence of several HEV-3 subtypes in both humans and pigs, confirming a broad heterogeneity of the virus, with some subtypes, such as 3e, 3f, and 3c, which are predominant in Europe. In this study, 291 HEV sequences were obtained from pig feces sampled in more than 74 farms located in Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Poland, the United Kingdom, as well as an unknown number of farms in Netherlands. Of the 99 nonidentical sequences (99/291), 90 were assigned to seven established HEV-3 subtypes: 3a, 3c, 3e, 3f, 3g (here named 3g-like), 3i, and 3l (named 3l-like), already described in Europe, while nine sequences of HEV-3 could not be assigned to any existing subtype (here named 3). The 3e subtype was the most common, detected in six out of eight countries, followed by 3f and 3c, which were also present in several countries; 3g-like, 3i, and 3l-like subtypes showed only a limited circulation. The distribution of frequently (3e, 3f, and 3c) and rarely (3g-like, 3i, and 3l-like) detected HEV-3 subtypes in pigs was correlated with their detection rates in human patients in Europe. The results from this study confirm the wide circulation of several HEV-3 strains in European pigs and confirm that sequencing is needed to monitor the different strains and to identify possible zoonotic transmission paths."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d6f","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c0","5e709342878c28a0473a5d41"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"2023","pagesFromTo":"1-12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["658176cc409707482c2464f4","658176cc409707482c2464f5","658176cc409707482c2464f6","658176cc409707482c2464f7","658176cc409707482c2464f8","658176cc409707482c2464f9","658176cc409707482c2464fa","658176cc409707482c2464fb","658176cc409707482c2464fc","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c0","658176cc409707482c2464fd","658176cc409707482c2464fe","658176cc409707482c2464ff","658176cc409707482c246500","658176cc409707482c246501","658176cc409707482c246502","658176cc409707482c246503","5e709342878c28a0473a5d6f","5e709342878c28a0473a5d41","658176cc409707482c246504"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479992","mniswId":"19667","title":"Transboundary and Emerging Diseases","issn":"1865-1674","eissn":"1865-1682","documentHash":"8778fe00-ca19-4fea-a053-47fb15881aad"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"656097824097073c06981947","year":"2023","volume":"2023","documentHash":"73c9f6ba-5a28-44d6-8d0a-c7f2fd139c42"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hepatitis E virus","Hepatitis E","HEV","swine","pigs","HEV-3","subtype","Europe","zoonosis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059149844"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63b4f2b975234021979cd519","name":"Monika","lastName":"Mazur-Frejowska","uuid":"92DFF35D6D499F0AD7119A8B577317550C1DB55E0E2BC71F41B83DD92B53229A56A035E988D2202A164AA9FFBC1DD15F7D4D687D325341789D34F8339C315290","documentHash":"ecf49a29-3232-45f2-b01a-7f37ce7877d2"},{"objectId":"61de4b397523403b69b1ee0a","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Skowronek","uuid":"70FB1F38EAA3E8CE71B21F2E5B60A7DADDF1AFCC921981B6C395B34393275F3AE80A9FFFB54E9B927E2FF42DC16049085BC20D051144805D53C822CAC629405A","documentHash":"a9624f53-15e1-4f96-8521-79190cfbeaa7"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d5e","name":"Anna","lastName":"Weiner","uuid":"7789555BBA9DB739605939BB33256AADCF32D893D4207E7F1E4EAC19DCC0A74702BFE02483B336F40285EDD45023DA544A94F56E59A8FA4ED756ACCA2A48994C","documentHash":"bb4bc142-2a13-4e55-a12f-f114f5966a63"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5caf","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kwiatek","uuid":"483AF17960E9A333131A70EFECF6469DB4B390ED1FC80958251A4DC48A21C1BB31E13F4FFF4619F4F3D2845908B5F84A67F567F444E8C826335B0675F5060620","documentHash":"2cd83ba7-a483-4b03-b3b0-14728060cac8"}],"objectId":"65817380409707482c241913","publicUri":"https://www.portalhodowcy.pl/czasopisma/hodowca-drobiu/hodowca-drobiu-archiwum/503-hodowca-drobiu-9-2023/6205-hodowca-drobiu-9-2023","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Możliwość wykorzystania owadów jako źródło białka w paszach – praktyka czy tylko teoria?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W dostępnej literaturze można znaleźć informacje odnośnie wykorzystania owadów w żywieniu zwierząt gospodarskich.

IDV possesses unique\nproperties that distinguish it from other influenza viruses, primarily attributed to the hemagglutinin-\nesterase fusion (HEF) surface glycoprotein, which determines the virus’ tropism and wide host\nrange. Cattle are postulated to be the reservoir of IDV, and the virus is identified as one of the\ncausative agents of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) syndrome. Animals associated with humans\nand susceptible to IDV infection include camels, pigs, small ruminants, and horses. Notably, high\nseroprevalence towards IDV, apart from cattle, is also observed in camels, potentially constituting\na reservoir of the virus.

Although molecular characterization of SRLV field isolates has been performed in many countries, there is currently no information on SRLV genotypes circulating in sheep and goats in Romania. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to conduct a molecular and phylogenetic analysis of SRLVs from Romania and determine the degree of genetic relatedness of the obtained sequences to other known SRLV reference strains. A total of 81 sheep lung tissue samples and 41 sheep lung lymph node samples were tested using nested real-time PCR, and samples positive for real-time PCR were used to amplify an 800 bp gag-pol fragment and an over-lapping 625 bp fragment of the gag gene. Pairwise DNA distance and phylogenetic analysis showed that the Romanian SRLV strains were closely related to the A2 and A3 strains based on gag-pol se-quences and to the A3 and A17 subtypes based on gag sequences. No recombination events were found. Our results revealed that the Romanian sequences have similar epitope patterns to other existing subtypes, although E/K and R/K mutations in epitope 3 were found only in the Romanian sequences, which may have potential value in serological diagnosis. This study is the first report on the genetic characterization of SRLV strains circulating in Romania and provides new information on SRLV heterogeneity. Further detailed studies should be conducted to better understand the di-vergence of SRLV Romanian strains."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"23","pagesFromTo":"3718","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9","656dbbd340970718551e42e4","656dbbd340970718551e42e5","656dbbd340970718551e42e6","656dbbd340970718551e42e7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","issn":"2076-2615","eissn":"2076-2615","documentHash":"3a493594-5fb6-4f5f-9a88-e87d49e3df95"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"656dbbd340970718551e42e3","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"23","documentHash":"1fa45761-a061-4848-bfb0-8508006511ae"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["SRLV","Maedi-visna virus","MVV","phylogenetic analysis","nested real-time PCR"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059153605"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e58","name":"Dagmara","lastName":"Zdańska","uuid":"F8B429029FB6EA052EDE15067A2C92244EB24AEE5AAC2FA68EBBAEBFB26D49877DAD25DA6DE3A85D18340FDD82AC459414BDC2C5CCA11C90EE821B5C73F5462B","orcidId":"0000-0002-0565-3428","documentHash":"b9b71227-3059-46d1-b976-d51dae01c10a"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b2f","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Bober","uuid":"3607CD03839DDCA3696963C8330F3DF64BCF0EACB336F6D9D00A2F5E2D24690C4B370DF26E0812A331E16CC610952B427E5D30B3B0B31823DB9919969A29DB3D","orcidId":"0000-0001-6664-099X","documentHash":"0a109a04-4cc9-40ab-9e2e-0a4aca88ef51"}],"objectId":"6580494e4097073e4d223693","publicUri":"https://miesiecznik-pszczelarstwo.pl/numer/listopad-2023","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Czy choroba woreczkowa to problem marginalny?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W krajowych pasiekach wirus choroby woreczkowej czerwiu jest powszechny.

In comparison to ME49 (a type II reference strain), highly polymorphic regions (HPRs) were identifed, showing a considerable number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). After confrmation by Sanger sequencing, 18 HPRs were used to design a primer panel for multiplex PCR to establish a multilocus Ion AmpliSeq typing method. Toxoplasma gondii\nisolates and T. gondii present in clinical samples were typed with the new method. The sensitivity of the method was tested\nwith serially diluted reference DNA samples.\nResults Among type II specimens, the method could diferentiate the same number of haplotypes as the reference standard, microsatellite (MS) typing. Passages of the same isolates and specimens originating from abortion outbreaks were identifed\nas identical. In addition, seven diferent genotypes, two atypical and two recombinant specimens were clearly distinguished\nfrom each other by the method. Furthermore, almost all SNPs detected by the Ion AmpliSeq method corresponded to those expected based on WGS. By testing serially diluted DNA samples, the method exhibited a similar analytical sensitivity as\nMS typing.\nConclusion The new method can distinguish diferent T. gondii genotypes and detect intra-genotype variability among European type II T. gondii strains. Furthermore, with WGS data additional target regions can be added to the method to\npotentially increase typing resolution."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","63b4f2b975234021979cd4f5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-17","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65819985409707482c2889cf","65819985409707482c2889d0","65819985409707482c2889d1","65819985409707482c2889d2","65819985409707482c2889d3","65819985409707482c2889d4","65819985409707482c2889d5","65819985409707482c2889d6","65819985409707482c2889d7","65819985409707482c2889d8","65819985409707482c2889d9","65819985409707482c2889da","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","63b4f2b975234021979cd4f5","65819985409707482c2889db","65819985409707482c2889dc","65819985409707482c2889dd","65819985409707482c2889de","65819985409707482c2889df","65819985409707482c2889e0","65819985409707482c2889e1","65819985409707482c2889e2","65819985409707482c2889e3","65819985409707482c2889e4","65819985409707482c2889e5","65819985409707482c2889e6","65819985409707482c2889e7","65819985409707482c2889e8","65819985409707482c2889e9","65819985409707482c2889ea","65819985409707482c2889eb","65819985409707482c2889ec","65819985409707482c2889ed","65819985409707482c2889ee","65819985409707482c2889ef"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b95","mniswId":"6144","title":"EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES","issn":"0934-9723","eissn":"1435-4373","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"3b367446-0c55-478e-894f-8f05ec8de1bf"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Typing","Discriminatory power","Intra-genotype variability","Highly polymorphic regions","Multilocus sequence typing","Toxoplasmosis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059153845"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63b4f2b975234021979cd519","name":"Monika","lastName":"Mazur-Frejowska","uuid":"92DFF35D6D499F0AD7119A8B577317550C1DB55E0E2BC71F41B83DD92B53229A56A035E988D2202A164AA9FFBC1DD15F7D4D687D325341789D34F8339C315290","documentHash":"ecf49a29-3232-45f2-b01a-7f37ce7877d2"},{"objectId":"61de4b397523403b69b1ee0a","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Skowronek","uuid":"70FB1F38EAA3E8CE71B21F2E5B60A7DADDF1AFCC921981B6C395B34393275F3AE80A9FFFB54E9B927E2FF42DC16049085BC20D051144805D53C822CAC629405A","documentHash":"a9624f53-15e1-4f96-8521-79190cfbeaa7"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d5e","name":"Anna","lastName":"Weiner","uuid":"7789555BBA9DB739605939BB33256AADCF32D893D4207E7F1E4EAC19DCC0A74702BFE02483B336F40285EDD45023DA544A94F56E59A8FA4ED756ACCA2A48994C","documentHash":"bb4bc142-2a13-4e55-a12f-f114f5966a63"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5caf","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kwiatek","uuid":"483AF17960E9A333131A70EFECF6469DB4B390ED1FC80958251A4DC48A21C1BB31E13F4FFF4619F4F3D2845908B5F84A67F567F444E8C826335B0675F5060620","documentHash":"2cd83ba7-a483-4b03-b3b0-14728060cac8"}],"objectId":"6581715b409707482c23b5f0","publicUri":"https://polskie-drobiarstwo.pl/archiwum/artykuly-czasopisma/694","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Przetworzone białka zwierzęce w żywieniu zwierząt gospodarskich - aspekty prawne stosowania i kontroli laboratoryjnej w paszach","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Odnotowane w ostatnim okresie sytuacje kryzysowe w sektorze drobiarskim związane z obecnością niedozwolonych przetworzonych białek zwierzęcych (PAP) w mieszankach paszowych wskazują na potrzebę upowszechniania zasad stosowania i kontroli PAP w żywieniu zwierząt gospodarskich.

The aim of this paper was to present the role of wildlife in the epidemiology of both diseases. There are more than 100 species of wild, feral, laboratory, or domesticated animals that have been infected naturally or experimentally with FMD or PPR viruses. Experimental infections of several African wild ruminants can result in clinical FMD. African buffalo represents the best known FMD wild host reservoir in Sub-Saharan Africa. North American mule deer were found susceptible to FMDV infection with significant mortality. Other wild ruminants such as impala can also contribute to FMDV maintenance. In Europe several deer species and the Eurasian wild boar are susceptible to FMDV. PPRV has been reported to have infected some wildlife, such as African buffalo, saiga antelope, dorcas gazelles, gemsbok, Nubian ibex and some other ungulate species. The role of wildlife in FMD and PPR epidemiology may concern wildlife as indicators, victims, bridge hosts or maintenance hosts for both diseases. In addition, they are occasionally victims of disease outbreaks, and they are often relevant for disease management as either bridge or maintenance hosts. Wildlife deserves to become a key component of future integrated surveillance and disease control strategies in an ever-changing world. However, it must be stated that efforts to control FMD and PPR in wildlife may not be successful when the diseases are endemic in livestock and may cause more harm to wildlife, human livelihoods, and domestic animals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cbf","5e709341878c28a0473a5b6a","5e709341878c28a0473a5b61"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"79","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"111-116","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cbf","5e709341878c28a0473a5b61","5e709341878c28a0473a5b6a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478e2c","mniswId":"14214","title":"Medycyna Weterynaryjna","issn":"0025-8628","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"7e1ddf8d-ae73-466a-a954-ccae7c1919cf"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["foot-and-mouth disease","peste des petits ruminants","wildlife","epidemiology","control"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059166690"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cbf","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Niedbalski","uuid":"90830D13758A9776FFC495F0A331CC8D6D909FF91158E7D5A98151A0B9F1A06032234B29FA3BBEDB1DD674D0B9C5E2DA6A64DA6FE777229B6A03EB0936A2E8A7","documentHash":"cb59e9a7-36ba-417a-87d3-5219b470c1ad"}],"objectId":"6582f75c40970751d8f42c77","publicUri":"http://www.medycynawet.edu.pl/archives/423/6747-summary-med-weter-79-02-6747-2024","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Progress in vaccines against peste des petits ruminants virus","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is a highly contagious and economically important viral disease of both domestic (goats and sheep) and wild small ruminants. Due to the devastating effect of this disease on livestock and livelihoods, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) endorsed the Global Strategy for the Control and Eradication of PPR (PPR GCES) and launched the PPR Global Eradication Programme (PPR GEP) to eradicate PPRV by 2030. In order to achieve this goal, a potent, safe and efficacious live-attenuated PPR vaccine with long-lasting immunity is available for immunoprophylaxis. However, the live-attenuated PPR vaccines are thermolabile and require maintenance of an effective cold chain to deliver to the field. In addition, infected animals cannot be differentiated from vaccinated ones (DIVA). To overcome these limitations, some new generation PPR vaccines have been developed: poxvirus vaccine, positive and negative marker vaccine through reverse genetic approach, chimeric vaccine, anti-idiotypic vaccine, subunit vaccine, virus-like particles vaccine, edible vaccine and combined vaccines. Novel recombinant PPR DIVA vaccines were evaluated in goats for safety and efficacy, and all vaccinated animals were clinically protected against an intranasal PPRV challenge. Furthermore, newly developed ELISAs were capable of differentiating between infected and vaccinated animals. Therefore, these DIVA vaccines and the associated tests can facilitate the serological monitoring process and speed up global PPR eradication through vaccination."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny -

Mimo iż należą do bakterii jelitowych, doskonale odnajdują się w różnych środowiskach poza organizmem żywiciela. Zakażenia Salmonella wśród ludzi przenoszone są głównie przez żywność, zarówno pochodzenia zwierzęcego, jak i roślinnego. Często stanowią poważny problem dla społeczeństwa pod względem zdrowotnym oraz gospodarczym. Bakterie te są czynnikiem etiologicznym chorób zwierząt hodowlanych oraz wolno żyjących, będących również najczęstszym źródłem zanieczyszczającym środowisko. Istotnym i często bagatelizowanym rezerwuarem tych bakterii są również gady oraz płazy. Patogen w środowisku produkcji pasz i żywności, mimo niekorzystnych warunków, może przetrwać przez lata, głównie dzięki zdolności do tworzenia biofilmu. Salmonella jest w stanie kolonizować rośliny epifitycznie oraz endofitycznie. Po przedostaniu się przez tkanki zewnętrzne może zostać przeniesiona wewnętrznym systemem transportowym do różnych organów, w tym do owoców i nasion. Zdolność do kolonizacji zależna jest od serowaru Salmonella oraz gatunku atakowanej rośliny. Przeżywalność oraz namnażanie pałeczek w glebie zależy od wielu, wzajemnie oddziałujących czynników takich jak: typ gleby, wilgotność, pH, temperatura czy flora autochtoniczna. Użyźnianie gleby nawozami naturalnymi znacznie  zwiększa częstość występowania i przeżywalność patogenu. Również w środowisku wodnym Salmonella jest w stanie przetrwać kilka miesięcy od bezpośredniego zanieczyszczenia odchodami ludzi i zwierząt lub pośrednio – z niewystarczająco oczyszczonymi osadami ściekowymi czy spływami z gruntów rolnych. Głównymi czynnikami warunkującymi przeżycie Salmonella są temperatura, światło słoneczne oraz obecność mikroflory towarzyszącej. Zanieczyszczona woda wykorzystywana w procesach przetwórstwa może być również pośrednią przyczyną transmisji patogenów jelitowych na żywność."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Salmonella is one of the most common causes of foodborne diseases. As for the intestinal bacterium, it perfectly finds itself in various environments outside the host's organism. Salmonella infections in humans are mainly transmitted through food of animal and plant origin and pose a serious problem for the community in terms of health and economy. Salmonella is the etiological factor of diseases in farm and free-living animals, which are also the most common source of environmental contamination. Reptiles and amphibians represent an important and often underestimated reservoir of these bacteria. The pathogen in the feed and food processing environment can survive for years despite unfavorable conditions, mainly due to the ability for biofilm formation. Salmonella can colonize plants epiphytically and endophytically. After getting through external tissues can be transferred through the internal transport system to various organs, including fruit and seeds. The colonization depends on the bacteria serovar and the species of the plant being infected. The survival and the ability to proliferation of Salmonella in the soil depend on many interacting factors, such as soil type, humidity, pH, temperature, and indigenous flora. Enriching the soil with natural fertilizers enhances the occurrence and significantly reduces the rate of decline of the pathogen. Also in the aquatic environment Salmonella can survive for months from directly contamination of human or animal faeces, or indirectly – with insufficiently treated sewage sludge or runoff from agricultural land. The main determinants of Salmonella survival are temperature, sunlight and the presence of accompanying microflora. Contaminated water used in processing can also be an indirect cause of transmission of intestinal pathogens to food."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61de4b387523403b69b1ed92","5e709297878c28a047398949","61de4b387523403b69b1eda7","63b4f2b975234021979cd504","61de4b387523403b69b1ed85","5ebee49e752340254fc44641","5e7094e4878c28a0473c62ff","5ebee286752340254fc43cdb","61de4b387523403b69b1ed7e","61de4b387523403b69b1ed4b","5e709342878c28a0473a5d6c","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"79","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"261-267","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5ebee49e752340254fc44641","5e709342878c28a0473a5d6c","5e7094e4878c28a0473c62ff","5ebee286752340254fc43cdb","61de4b387523403b69b1eda7","61de4b387523403b69b1ed4b","61de4b387523403b69b1ed7e","61de4b387523403b69b1ed85","61de4b387523403b69b1ed92","5e709297878c28a047398949","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5c","63b4f2b975234021979cd504"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478e2c","mniswId":"14214","title":"Medycyna Weterynaryjna","issn":"0025-8628","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"7e1ddf8d-ae73-466a-a954-ccae7c1919cf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65646ef3409707538504b821","year":"2023","volume":"79","number":"6","documentHash":"de01118e-0983-439a-bddf-ebf84113ff2b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Salmonella","środowisko","przeżywalność"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059167455"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d66","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Wieczorek","uuid":"77FE94937137879573023F0D11FD72EFFDFDC4214863FDBF15FEEF0A6BDFD2ABA69978BCCFC9FF88D0F012F09560030758068F57DE1D27D7EB8B20C442DC9439","orcidId":"0000-0001-8268-3885","documentHash":"e54d106b-ea77-4715-815a-37b17126e9c0"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Osek","uuid":"09D7D5320F1FC606BCE9C2D945933A9AD76A02E8625F591A249FCC889F47698A9DDB27A314BD598D2BEBE05552FA565585514F11E04F6B15DA221089044711E2","orcidId":"0000-0003-2295-8837","documentHash":"6dc7582e-e613-4ee9-9ee7-81d949533982"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"658bc50d4097070a21ea2302","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2023-0068","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2023-0068","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Why does <i>Listeria monocytogenes</i> survive in food and food-production environments?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Listeria monocytogenes is one of the most dangerous food-borne pathogens and is responsible for human listeriosis, a severe \ndisease with a high mortality rate, especially among the elderly, pregnant women and newborns.

Despite representing a small part of EU production, freshwater fisheries hold considerable significance for lake-dwelling populations and tourists seeking traditional dishes. This increased fish consumption has brought to light potential health risks associated with fish-borne zoonotic helminths (FBZHs), now acknowledged as global food-borne parasites. Fish-borne zoonotic helminths belong to various taxonomic groups, including nematodes (Anisakidae), trematodes (Opisthorchiidae and Heterophyidae), and cestodes (Diphyllobothriidae). More than 50 species of FBZH are known to cause human infections, derived from eating raw or undercooked aquatic foods containing viable parasites. Despite increased attention, FBZHs remain relatively neglected compared to other food-borne pathogens due to factors like chronic disease progression and under-diagnosis. This systematic review concentrates on the prevalence of six freshwater FBZHs (Clinostomum complanatum, Contracaecum rudolphii, Dibothriocephalus latus, Eustrongylides excisus, Opisthorchis felineus, and Pseudamphistomum truncatum) in Italy and neighbouring countries. The study explores the expansion of these parasites, analysing their biological and epidemiological aspects, and the factors that influence their proliferation, such as the increased cormorant population and the lake eutrophication phenomena. In summary, this research highlights the necessity for further research, the development of spatial databases, and the establishment of a unified European policy to effectively manage these multifaceted health concerns. It strongly advocates adopting a One-Health approach to address the growing incidence of parasitic zoonoses within the context of food safety in EU countries."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d79"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"3793","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["658d5241409707137609a67c","658d5241409707137609a67d","658d5241409707137609a67e","658d5241409707137609a67f","658d5241409707137609a680","658d5241409707137609a681","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d79","658d5241409707137609a682","658d5241409707137609a683","658d5241409707137609a684","658d5241409707137609a685"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","issn":"2076-2615","eissn":"2076-2615","documentHash":"3a493594-5fb6-4f5f-9a88-e87d49e3df95"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6572e28c4097074b3777f27b","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"24","doi":"","documentHash":"88812ae5-b122-4d46-9659-7b5e49ae32b2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fish borne zoonotic helminths","Contracaecum rudolphii"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059193771"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"658d5a9640970713760ad6a1","name":"Jan","lastName":"Jadczyszyn","documentHash":"30d87045-32f5-48ed-abac-4024c034bdab"},{"objectId":"658d5a9640970713760ad69f","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Skowron","documentHash":"fc4b8eae-f401-4f59-9d85-02a4c43d3cdb"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c5","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Zdybel","uuid":"E1894A82CA0C5116AD0F2449FF8A8079689129491CC8714CFB197BEE9F32491A94AED5B0B0D6DDEC7673645BA92040566572EF875D09BF31AC26B015A3BDEF1D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7297-2082","documentHash":"c7678981-6c62-4d87-8594-a1ec6cd118c0"},{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b42bf","name":"Angelina","lastName":"Wójcik-Fatla","uuid":"91FB79281E9E1E1E8D4CF9D15DF58423B26E03556A22DB938A8FDA5164F3F3C2C537CA0A1C9790C699CDA4EBBC2AE56609356E44B4913521DD9041120C2496A0","orcidId":"0000-0001-5260-4867","documentHash":"6355b5d9-7b65-41b4-ae96-d1d3fd7d25e8"},{"objectId":"5e7093d6878c28a0473b1a03","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"F180997601AF8A9B787D2CFA13E54A13AE75C13695A3224BF2FAA94EC3302CA92248293AA16925F0A4C183BBB0FEDC22AA2BE28EAB9ED7EF178DA7E8016B1515","orcidId":"0000-0002-4061-9890","documentHash":"4a8454f0-7e66-480e-bbca-5928d45836ed"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Sroka","uuid":"D54BE4B84093A5FF9739FB665CBF54EE2891B37B53478AF0F1029745E62033C7B88C51B2D726FDAE584BE9DC2EE3F8CEA3FA851EB5B8089D8737B1A062F9CDC5","orcidId":"0000-0002-7372-7636","documentHash":"f04c53ae-faa6-4609-a0d2-57b9784ca2da"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Karamon","uuid":"6FC652281DC3E7CEE5831D48F355BCC0E37B505605D00AA8D389A74796325ECB25D4E136854D3D774EDD0E3C95277099BB6981BCE201CE127F3B8AE5C7651C14","orcidId":"0000-0002-5830-167X","documentHash":"0d343e52-20ea-4cfe-a213-5c134e4fef07"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b50","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Cencek","uuid":"7D7F433A7A31D1A4D080277B2FE49ED9F5B45115086FAEDA03BCF07F6AB6D09B61EC0E8015CEEA44A992C6D7E5DD06BB406798BF1E7065879BA9ED1F3FC8E8D3","orcidId":"0000-0003-3649-7867","documentHash":"7aa79c92-3af1-40b7-85e2-872b041c4104"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"658d5a9640970713760ad69c","doi":"10.26444/aaem/176816","publicUri":"https://www.aaem.pl/pdf-176816-98037","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Parasitological contamination of arable soil in selected regions of Poland – preliminary study","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction and objective:\nThe hygienic status of arable soils in most developed countries has been unknown. In the presented study, a preliminary investigation was undertaken to determine the contamination with eggs of parasitic nematodes in the soil of arable fields in Poland. The aim of the study was to determine whether such contamination is common enough to constitute a significant problem and what factors may influence it.\n\nMaterial and methods:\nThe study was conducted in 5 Polish provinces from autumn 2021 to spring 2022. The provinces differed significantly in terms of the area of agricultural land, agricultural suitability, type of soil, scale of cattle and pig breeding, production of manure and slurry, and the use of manures and organic fertilizers for fertilization. A total of 133 soil samples were collected. Parasitological examination of soil samples was carried out using the PN-Z-19006 method [1], with confirmed high sensitivity.\n\nResults:\nParasite eggs were found in a total of 67 samples, of which 56 samples contained eggs of roundworms of the genus Ascaris (an average of 3.29 eggs/100 g of soil), 23 contained eggs of whipworms (an average of 1.22 eggs/100 g), and 3 contained eggs of Toxocara (1 egg/100 g).\n\nConclusions:\nDifferences in the percentage of positive samples were found depending on the period in which the samples were taken. The percentage of positive samples collected in autumn (53.57%) was higher than the percentage of positive samples collected in spring (48.05%).

Na zakażenie LSDV wrażliwe jest głównie bydło domowe. Bydło wysokowydajnych, europejskich ras mlecznych jest bardziej wrażliwe niż bydło zebu. Zachorowalność zwykle waha się między 5-45%, chociaż notowano przypadki choroby, w których współczynnik ten dochodził nawet do 100%. Śmiertelność zazwyczaj nie przekracza 10%.

The expression of viral structural proteins: surface glycoprotein (gp51) and three core proteins - p15 (matrix), p24 (capsid), and p12 (nucleocapsid) induce a strong humoral and cellular immune response at first step of infection. CD4+ T-cell activation is generally induced by bovine leukocyte antigen (BoLA) region– positive antigen-presenting cells (APC) after processing of an exogenous viral antigen. Limited data are available on the BLV epitopes from the core proteins recognized by CD4+ T-cells. Thus, immunoinformatic analysis of Gag sequences obtained from 125 BLV isolates from Poland, Canada, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Moldova and United States was performed to identify the presence of BoLA-DRB3 restricted CD4+ T-cell epitopes. The 379 15-mer overlapping peptides spanning the entire Gag sequence were run in BoLA-DRB3 allele-binding regions using a BoLA-DRB- peptide binding affinity prediction algorithm. The analysis identified 22 CD4+ T-cell peptide epitopes of variable length ranging from 17 to 22 amino acids. The predicted epitopes interacted with 73 different BoLA-DRB3 alleles found in BLV-infected cattle. Importantly, two epitopes were found to be linked with high proviral load in PBMC. A majority of dominant and subdominant epitopes showed high conservation across different viral strains, and therefore could be attractive targets for vaccine development."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cad","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e1b","5e709342878c28a0473a5d36"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e1b","65819abb409707482c28c5e1","65819abb409707482c28c5e2","65819abb409707482c28c5e3","65819abb409707482c28c5e4","65819abb409707482c28c5e5","5e709342878c28a0473a5d36","65819abb409707482c28c5e6","65819abb409707482c28c5e7","65819abb409707482c28c5e8","5e709342878c28a0473a5cad"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":"","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"c081063e-cfb2-4a54-ba01-2dc365eba2cf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c9446b4097074220cc9a4d","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"1","documentHash":"c67bc404-c55a-4843-9947-5a16b4a7fe91"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["BoLA-DR-restricted CD4+ T cell epitopes","bovine leukemia virus","gag gene"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059217373"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c6","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Szacawa","uuid":"DD43CD53336D1E5297A82642902BD389F928A8486E324B79CBA86546EB4532E8DB8BFFC5C8D38396248D3DC10B3EF1780F09FA0DEC786C12A0A0BDA76B446C17","orcidId":"0000-0003-1815-5724","documentHash":"ff75ac41-419e-43d3-8b98-82ee0c2db7c8"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b5b","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Dudek","uuid":"1C236F39CBEBF0222678F951AF88B126D140208B5163B55E8C071114CA662533C5091A9A508F004E10111CC585F5B5B8960B4FE4DD6655438133A4486E6B6E7B","orcidId":"0000-0002-3271-3748","documentHash":"82e1f788-1bf1-4bd4-a410-133526ffd169"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b2e","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Bednarek","uuid":"AA380B7BF0343A0E6141C8BEB7A3A3EBA04C0325698ADAC0767395B7733F03E24AC85A07BDC4328B7A7E130BDBCB2936B49228B3631DD800F1FFE3014F1E0747","documentHash":"32d8ef0b-98a5-4824-a096-10d65df496a1"}],"objectId":"65828b1840970751d8eb92d5","publicUri":"https://www.lecznica-online.pl/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/monografia_Pulawy_Bednarek_2023.pdf","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"Zastosowanie pegbowigrastymu do stymulacji układu odpornościowego u bydła","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947c878c28a0473be3c6","5e709341878c28a0473a5b2e","5e709341878c28a0473a5b5b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","pagesFromTo":"72-75","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709341878c28a0473a5b5b","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c6","5e709341878c28a0473a5b2e"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"658020904097073e4d1f05e9","title":"Lecznica Duzych Zwierząt.

Mimo iż należą do bakterii jelitowych, doskonale odnajdują się w różnych środowiskach poza organizmem żywiciela. Zakażenia Salmonella wśród ludzi przenoszone są głównie przez żywność, zarówno pochodzenia zwierzęcego, jak i roślinnego. Często stanowią poważny problem dla społeczeństwa pod względem zdrowotnym oraz gospodarczym. Bakterie te są czynnikiem etiologicznym chorób zwierząt hodowlanych oraz wolno żyjących, będących również najczęstszym źródłem zanieczyszczającym środowisko. Istotnym i często bagatelizowanym rezerwuarem tych bakterii są również gady oraz płazy. Patogen w środowisku produkcji pasz i żywności, mimo niekorzystnych warunków, może przetrwać przez lata, głównie dzięki zdolności do tworzenia biofilmu. Salmonella jest w stanie kolonizować rośliny epifitycznie oraz endofitycznie. Po przedostaniu się przez tkanki zewnętrzne może zostać przeniesiona wewnętrznym systemem transportowym do różnych organów, w tym do owoców i nasion. Zdolność do kolonizacji zależna jest od serowaru Salmonella oraz gatunku atakowanej rośliny. Przeżywalność oraz namnażanie pałeczek w glebie zależy od wielu, wzajemnie oddziałujących czynników takich jak: typ gleby, wilgotność, pH, temperatura czy flora autochtoniczna. Użyźnianie gleby nawozami naturalnymi znacznie  zwiększa częstość występowania i przeżywalność patogenu. Również w środowisku wodnym Salmonella jest w stanie przetrwać kilka miesięcy od bezpośredniego zanieczyszczenia odchodami ludzi i zwierząt lub pośrednio – z niewystarczająco oczyszczonymi osadami ściekowymi czy spływami z gruntów rolnych. Głównymi czynnikami warunkującymi przeżycie Salmonella są temperatura, światło słoneczne oraz obecność mikroflory towarzyszącej. Zanieczyszczona woda wykorzystywana w procesach przetwórstwa może być również pośrednią przyczyną transmisji patogenów jelitowych na żywność."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Salmonella is one of the most common causes of foodborne diseases. As for the intestinal bacterium, it perfectly finds itself in various environments outside the host's organism. Salmonella infections in humans are mainly transmitted through food of animal and plant origin and pose a serious problem for the community in terms of health and economy. Salmonella is the etiological factor of diseases in farm and free-living animals, which are also the most common source of environmental contamination. Reptiles and amphibians represent an important and often underestimated reservoir of these bacteria. The pathogen in the feed and food processing environment can survive for years despite unfavorable conditions, mainly due to the ability for biofilm formation. Salmonella can colonize plants epiphytically and endophytically. After getting through external tissues can be transferred through the internal transport system to various organs, including fruit and seeds. The colonization depends on the bacteria serovar and the species of the plant being infected. The survival and the ability to proliferation of Salmonella in the soil depend on many interacting factors, such as soil type, humidity, pH, temperature, and indigenous flora. Enriching the soil with natural fertilizers enhances the occurrence and significantly reduces the rate of decline of the pathogen. Also in the aquatic environment Salmonella can survive for months from directly contamination of human or animal faeces, or indirectly – with insufficiently treated sewage sludge or runoff from agricultural land. The main determinants of Salmonella survival are temperature, sunlight and the presence of accompanying microflora. Contaminated water used in processing can also be an indirect cause of transmission of intestinal pathogens to food."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61de4b387523403b69b1ed92","5e709297878c28a047398949","61de4b387523403b69b1eda7","63b4f2b975234021979cd504","61de4b387523403b69b1ed85","5ebee49e752340254fc44641","5e7094e4878c28a0473c62ff","5ebee286752340254fc43cdb","61de4b387523403b69b1ed7e","61de4b387523403b69b1ed4b","5e709342878c28a0473a5d6c","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"79","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"261-267","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5ebee49e752340254fc44641","5e709342878c28a0473a5d6c","5e7094e4878c28a0473c62ff","5ebee286752340254fc43cdb","61de4b387523403b69b1eda7","61de4b387523403b69b1ed4b","61de4b387523403b69b1ed7e","61de4b387523403b69b1ed85","61de4b387523403b69b1ed92","5e709297878c28a047398949","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5c","63b4f2b975234021979cd504"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478e2c","mniswId":"14214","title":"Medycyna Weterynaryjna-Veterinary Medicine-Science and Practice","issn":"0025-8628","eissn":"0025-8628","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"5f7ed625-bfbb-4d31-8464-ad34e7a26384"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65646ef3409707538504b821","year":"2023","volume":"79","number":"6","documentHash":"de01118e-0983-439a-bddf-ebf84113ff2b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Salmonella","środowisko","przeżywalność"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059224152"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d5f","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"0CF56F05BC1444EC145C3F9F0244C34241EA3CE9FB305488E439778D5EDD3A940A6ECE07460B993634F9796A71C9C4319F62AE41108C670F05C6624E05EEA4EC","orcidId":"0000-0001-5960-8254","documentHash":"d89286dd-bb34-4422-b2fa-1ad1323c6916"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5caf","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kwiatek","uuid":"483AF17960E9A333131A70EFECF6469DB4B390ED1FC80958251A4DC48A21C1BB31E13F4FFF4619F4F3D2845908B5F84A67F567F444E8C826335B0675F5060620","documentHash":"2cd83ba7-a483-4b03-b3b0-14728060cac8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"65853fca409707636b3be285","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2023-0070","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2023-0070","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Development, in-house validation and application of a method using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) for the quantification of 12 ergot alkaloids in compound feeds","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Ergot alkaloids (EAs) are toxic substances naturally produced by Claviceps fungi. These fungi infest a widerange of cereals and grasses. When domestic animals are exposed to EAs through contaminated feeds, it is detrimental to them andleads to significant economic losses. For that reason, it is important to monitor feed for the presence of EAs, especially with methodsenabling their determination in processed materials. Material and Methods: Ergot alkaloids were extracted with acetonitrile, anddispersive solid phase extraction (d-SPE) was used for clean-up of the extracts. After evaporation, the extracts were reconstitutedin ammonium carbonate and acetonitrile and subjected to instrumental analysis using high-performance liquid chromatographywith fluorescence detection. The developed method was validated in terms of linearity, selectivity, repeatability, reproducibility,robustness, matrix effect, limits of quantification and detection and uncertainty. The EA content of 40 compound feeds wasdetermined. Results: All the assessed validation parameters fulfilled the requirements of Regulation (EU) 2021/808. At least oneof the monitored alkaloids was determined in 40% of the samples. The EAs with the highest incidence rate were ergocryptine,ergometrinine and ergocornine. The total concentrations of EAs ranged from under the limit of quantification to 62.3 μg kg−1.Conclusion: The results demonstrated that the developed method was suitable for simultaneously determining twelve EAs incompound feed and could be used for routine analysis"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d5f","5e709342878c28a0473a5caf"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"67","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"603-610","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d5f","5e709342878c28a0473a5caf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research","issn":"2450-7393","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c3fc9638-cd0e-40bb-89b9-22dee2de8b67"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ergot alkaloids","compound feed","HPLC-FLD","d-SPE"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059224441"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebee0f9752340254fc435e9","name":"Nina","lastName":"Kozieł","uuid":"44C6F6EC005952ED2D15F6C7BD9CAA5E7C26C565695DC237261CEF9983F690CDC96ADEAC428B25BC05036BF828FAE1B6C1FC31AF855EBAFC1784ACD0FBA7925E","documentHash":"6352479c-a2ef-48f6-941b-f57676b4591e"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be87a","name":"Blanka","lastName":"Orłowska","uuid":"611F08B84589B99368A3A9FFF46E87EC3DB64A8E39C44A7D885305577D29E1680C59647824724EE8668AA0A0BB07901566FD2E97B4F7CCEB8234D1BD387A441F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6599-3582","documentHash":"7bf0b459-a078-469d-ac63-9723dfe2bc50"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c1","name":"Monika","lastName":"Krajewska-Wędzina","uuid":"48D96FF61147929F46D201644057AF91FD057455FC10757C30FB62096A475BDC285317D0DC9C8B59939D198E75553F0070726157DEA9152E0CC73FA3968F8714","orcidId":"0000-0002-5826-2068","documentHash":"59c09ee7-3423-47a7-a7e0-af93754cdebf"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d60","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Weiner","uuid":"6F362BA6B8673122F182DA095CD12CFFBBB8ABC7719D8D0AE9DA7BD0C825DA9490A2EAD9D395668512F559153D99CA0AD2C5811E46D5E2A4AE5DB472119E75E7","orcidId":"0000-0001-9288-0823","documentHash":"48da675e-c292-4d71-b863-bfa49cd380c3"},{"objectId":"5e709307878c28a0473a17c9","name":"Anna","lastName":"Didkowska","uuid":"BE8F102ADE1EFA47BABDF55BC7FF50F60E5C59EB95C830D467B9C1A934480B6672DD771CCA5FA838BE8151A1B7D24BF822A4503B1D5C693F1347F34ED3E27464","orcidId":"0000-0003-1073-174X","documentHash":"125d3e2f-5a57-44dc-8518-2977d53526b5"},{"objectId":"5e70923a878c28a0473920fd","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Anusz","uuid":"C2290DBF040655729BB9E82B4AC0CFB47A8594E727421542EEA851E6036C6EAA68166496E51F380C690DB781F854939E1AA8F2DDD7319CAEFCE97D5F01A8C4C3","orcidId":"0000-0002-8116-8491","documentHash":"06bf0f26-e53b-48d2-8622-98609890f265"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"OTHER","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2023-12-30","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"659d068340970776646b02f6","publicUri":"https://www.vetpol.org.pl/dmdocuments/ZW-01-2024-06.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Występowanie zakażeń Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex u zwierząt.

Their prevalence and molecular epidemiology were investigated in 184 turkey flocks in Poland. Tracheal samples were selected from 144 broiler flocks and 40 turkey breeder flocks collected in 2015–2023. The prevalence of MG was determined by real-time PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene and PCR targeting the mgc2 gene, and MS was determined by a 16–23S rRNA real-time PCR and a vlhA gene PCR. Further identification and molecular characterization were carried out using\nPCR and sequencing. M. gallisepticum and M. synoviae were found in 8.33% and 9.72% of turkey\nbroiler flocks respectively. The phylogenetic analysis of MG isolates in most cases showed high\nsimilarity to the ts-11-like strains. MS isolates showed high similarity to strains isolated from flocks of laying hens causing EAA. Additional tests detected Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale, Gallibacterium anatis, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus and Riemerella anatipestifer. These secondary pathogens could have significantly heightened the pathogenicity of the mycoplasma infections studied"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de5","5e7094af878c28a0473c1b6b","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"78","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de5","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5a","65a79d164097071e0b873810","65a79d164097071e0b873811","5e7094af878c28a0473c1b6b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceac","mniswId":"15767","title":"Pathogens","issn":"2076-0817","eissn":"2076-0817","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0aee51de-2ae0-4570-a31e-61056cf6d598"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65a79d164097071e0b87380f","year":"2024","volume":"13","number":"1","documentHash":"85245046-d84f-41b5-b865-541491f4b7a6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Mycoplasma synoviae","Mycoplasma gallisepticum","turkeys"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059255341"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e16","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Pietroń","uuid":"0016F003EB9DF9E53E38F4FFAB49313E177EE8E540A1A3EBAA39C79D938D762A9B16CD659F8BE4FB121D74B8431564E92EC3DD699DCD3128F5367F07B757F993","orcidId":"0000-0002-0745-1379","documentHash":"4fd5dafc-3d41-4530-b5e0-489f70096f82"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c4","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Warenik-Bany","uuid":"4712B9142F37DE7444F67A0D87EE1C663B7551CC5403CE356609DD8451AC163AE66C02975F4E46C75BA54D138152C7CA025EC98E7A9BBC1C46CE7FDB9A2F3D49","orcidId":"0000-0002-3839-6464","documentHash":"a8205408-5907-4d58-85e1-a99171e81d41"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"JANUARY","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"65a79b494097071e0b872a06","publicUri":"https://www.vetpol.org.pl/dmdocuments/ZW-01-2024-10.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Polibromowane difenyloetery w polskiej żywności pochodzenia zwierzęcego","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are synthetic chemicals used for many\nyears as flame retardants in plastic.

An industry-led stewardship scheme introduced new rules on use and sale of products across the UK in 2016, with the aim of reducing this risk. To determine if the scheme had achieved this, exposure to second generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs) was measured in foxes. Liver samples from 406 foxes collected between 2011 and 2022 were analysed and the percentage presence and concentrations of SGARs, where present, from pre-stewardship and post-stewardship samples were compared. There was no statistically significant change in the percentage of foxes exposed to bromadiolone, difenacoum or summed SGAR residues after the introduction of stewardship. The percentage of foxes exposed to brodifacoum increased significantly post-stewardship, from 18% to 43%. There were no significant changes of either summed or individual SGAR concentrations post-stewardship.\n\nThese findings suggest that the industry-led stewardship scheme has not yet had the intended

Knowledge of genetic\nrelationships among E. multilocularis isolates at a European scale is key to understanding the\ndispersal characteristics of E. multilocularis. Hence, the present study aimed to describe the genetic\ndiversity of E. multilocularis isolates obtained from different host species in 19 European countries.\nBased on the analysis of complete nucleotide sequences of the cob, atp6, nad2, nad1 and cox1\nmitochondrial genes (4,968 bp), 43 haplotypes were inferred. Four haplotypes represented 62.56%\nof the examined isolates (142/227), and one of these four haplotypes was found in each country\ninvestigated, except Svalbard, Norway. While the haplotypes from Svalbard were markedly\ndifferent from all the others, mainland Europe appeared to be dominated by two main clusters,\nrepresented by most western, central and eastern European countries, and the Baltic countries and\nnortheastern Poland, respectively. Moreover, one Asian-like haplotype was identified in Latvia\nand northeastern Poland. To better elucidate the presence of Asian genetic variants of E.\nmultilocularis in Europe, and to obtain a more comprehensive Europe-wide coverage, further\nstudies, including samples from endemic regions not investigated in the present study, especially\nsome eastern European countries, are needed. Further, the present work proposes historical causes\nthat may have contributed to shaping the current genetic variability of E. multilocularis in Europe"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709341878c28a0473a5b69"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-37","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65d7570d40970704cae3fae0","65d7570d40970704cae3fae1","65d7570d40970704cae3fae2","65d7570d40970704cae3fae3","65d7570d40970704cae3fae4","65d7570d40970704cae3fae5","65d7570d40970704cae3fae6","65d7570d40970704cae3fae7","65d7570d40970704cae3fae8","65d7570d40970704cae3fae9","65d7570d40970704cae3faea","65d7570d40970704cae3faeb","65d7570d40970704cae3faec","65d7570d40970704cae3faed","65d7570d40970704cae3faee","65d7570d40970704cae3faef","65d7570d40970704cae3faf0","65d7570d40970704cae3faf1","65d7570d40970704cae3faf2","5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","65d7570d40970704cae3faf3","65d7570d40970704cae3faf4","65d7570d40970704cae3faf5","65d7570d40970704cae3faf6","65d7570d40970704cae3faf7","65d7570d40970704cae3faf8","65d7570d40970704cae3faf9","65d7570d40970704cae3fafa","65d7570d40970704cae3fafb","65d7570d40970704cae3fafc","65d7570d40970704cae3fafd","65d7570d40970704cae3fafe","65d7570d40970704cae3faff","65d7570d40970704cae3fb00","65d7570d40970704cae3fb01","65d7570d40970704cae3fb02","65d7570d40970704cae3fb03","65d7570d40970704cae3fb04","65d7570d40970704cae3fb05","65d7570d40970704cae3fb06","65d7570d40970704cae3fb07"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478155","mniswId":"8560","title":"International Journal for Parasitology","issn":"0020-7519","eissn":"1879-0135","documentHash":"ca2312e0-87e4-44d4-a316-4210c32c3ddf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65d7570d40970704cae3fadf","year":"2024","documentHash":"a1fb260d-fa17-49d2-a3ca-3befb91d1a56"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Echinococcus","Echinococcus multilocularis","Alveolar echinococcosis","Mitochondrial genes","Population structure"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059395372"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65d75e3a40970704cae4f597","name":"Agata","lastName":"Sieczkowska","documentHash":"65ebc84f-d00e-4f88-8f73-2cf1351819a9"},{"objectId":"5e7094af878c28a0473c1b6b","name":"Anna","lastName":"Sawicka-Durkalec","uuid":"74F41A0F85AC155F46A6CCFB26EB711F025B465228066B5B84B02AC6321B340B5E150BCF2A66F7C1772D185C02BC942B7AE9B4870C2127F7D8BF9A52EE8941FA","documentHash":"bedf887e-9c8e-4e06-b951-662b20cf6e92"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de5","name":"Olimpia","lastName":"Kursa","uuid":"75402E2E14C8ED8034D357B13AFDE45E9969ED0E1013DCAC5AC579ED65B4C512BE817796CCDCBBC958F09F10CA0E27A409B73C9E9AF9FD4C4A298A3D7F324E63","orcidId":"0000-0002-0058-1568","documentHash":"6ee44e6d-ce9a-41d7-99e0-5633dff83f06"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d5a","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Tomczyk","uuid":"E3C5238621862F074D46922CB3B17195CE27A83F2C9C06B0BA49A69FEE2FB90EC33B4FDD96A897D15FCA91F90109B062B91A53DADD2FC97CF132051ED597C664","documentHash":"b7a3ee18-b481-4390-a3be-5aeac0b34bca"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"FEBRUARY","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"65d75e3a40970704cae4f596","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2024-0007","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2024-0007","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Antibiotic resistance of <i>Gallibacterium anatis</i> biovar <i>haemolytica</i> isolates from chickens","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Gallibacterium anatis is an opportunistic bacteria inducing a range of clinical signs in poultry. Gallibacterium anatis strains show multidrug resistance to antibacterial substances. The purpose of this study was to examine the susceptibility of G. anatis biovar haemolytica isolates collected from the respiratory, reproduction and gastrointestinal tracts of chickens to different antibiotics from various classes.\nMaterial and Methods\n\nGallibacterium anatis biovar haemolytica was identified in tracheal swab and gastrointestinal and reproductive tract tissue samples from Polish layer and broiler chicken flocks. Twenty six isolates with β-haemolysis capability, each from a different flock, obtained from the respiratory (n = 8), reproductive (n = 10) and gastrointestinal (n = 8) tracts were selected and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation–time-of-flight mass spectrometry after culturing. A PCR method targeting the 16S genes was used for verification of isolates. The isolates’ susceptibility to 20 antimicrobials was evaluated using the disc diffusion method for 8 drugs and the dilution method for the other 12. In addition, they were tested for the presence of the GtxA, gyrB and flfA virulence genes and blaROB, aphA, tetB and tetH antibiotic resistance genes by PCR.\nResults\n\nThe most prevalent antibiotic resistance was to tilmicosin, tylosin and quinupristin/dalfopristin (all 100%), erythromycin (96.2%), tetracycline (96.2%), linezolid (92.3%) and teicoplanin (92.3%). Universal susceptibility was to only one antibiotic, chloramphenicol. Statistically significant differences were found between the resistance of gastrointestinal tract strains and that of strains from other tracts to daptomycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and colistin. The GtxA and gyrB genes were detected in 100% of isolates and flfA in 19.2%. The isolates most frequently contained tetB and less frequently tetH and aphA, and did not contain blaROB.\nConclusion\n\nMost G. anatis biovar haemolytica isolates were resistant to many classes of antibiotics. Therefore, it is necessary and important to be vigilant for the occurrence of these bacteria and thorough in their diagnosis"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de5","5e7094af878c28a0473c1b6b","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"0","issue":"0","pagesFromTo":"1-8","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de5","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5a","65d75e3a40970704cae4f597","5e7094af878c28a0473c1b6b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research","issn":"2450-7393","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c3fc9638-cd0e-40bb-89b9-22dee2de8b67"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Gallibacterium anatis","chickens","antibiotic"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059395772"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65df47c24097070d576025c2","name":"RÓŻYCKI","lastName":"M.","documentHash":"faf348e8-8aa9-43b9-ac6e-f49a82e73925"},{"objectId":"63b4f2b975234021979cd51c","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Gontarczyk","uuid":"2C3AE1F235432A71443EE6AA5D097C25FE96933127CF1FD36683681208644AE6C964C82A347C72A59D3EA64617C9FA92B31147A7B3BF8A06A2CA7C217BB909D3","documentHash":"f8d9c0f6-25a2-432d-a5bf-63ebda73b94a"},{"objectId":"63b4f2b975234021979cd518","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Antolak","uuid":"8EB9CD7360ACB6366C76439BB77D01D8A3B34C268E8D1026C8F818516E6F08BACD54076B7D592DAFB082152CFFDEB1D7294E13E87E162A199E0F2DB64666E2A1","documentHash":"88ba2d26-5667-4119-8e94-03d1c8c87401"},{"objectId":"63b4f2b975234021979cd4e4","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Bełcik","uuid":"77661344F288929533CF8A7024A5412F3C69BE81B07E6C3DDDFADECC0C99EAEFCB8C3D85174909E18CB495D581F97E71C6C20AA3A805B92F0FFDE5E6E231C6A8","documentHash":"40a2e3d1-fc18-4a0f-b2f8-f831313648e7"},{"objectId":"61de4b387523403b69b1ed6b","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Samorek-Pieróg","uuid":"3783194BFCA06516ADD2AF810422352CDEE48638DA79F07D9B10911A37657F58DE0C609EFC747E042B7883145FBF805185921620D826DD200E7D3E0EF0569CEF","documentHash":"2810224a-efd7-412c-b30b-2231565a8e03"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d79","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Bilska-Zając","uuid":"CA37D40E9E6221954C0E1F92525EB13B265614DDB637B5261A39B130F380056543A7F0D2E0AE9B7220F35F148187F484510166AABC45E68EC5A47A105D08B099","documentHash":"fb1618f1-0e83-472f-b325-e0c87f8a8872"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Korpysa-Dzirba","uuid":"0F6E5299BA1DE2C04CCB23BB69EE8BB0AF924331950608E7B9E07C962AC58BA926288AB7400DBD5FDFA0B8F25E5B3E11F82C54FC732A0E0269E9C0A9EB906901","orcidId":"0000-0002-8266-581X","documentHash":"a20ea112-853c-4a02-89cc-69a1868143b6"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Sroka","uuid":"D54BE4B84093A5FF9739FB665CBF54EE2891B37B53478AF0F1029745E62033C7B88C51B2D726FDAE584BE9DC2EE3F8CEA3FA851EB5B8089D8737B1A062F9CDC5","orcidId":"0000-0002-7372-7636","documentHash":"f04c53ae-faa6-4609-a0d2-57b9784ca2da"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Karamon","uuid":"6FC652281DC3E7CEE5831D48F355BCC0E37B505605D00AA8D389A74796325ECB25D4E136854D3D774EDD0E3C95277099BB6981BCE201CE127F3B8AE5C7651C14","orcidId":"0000-0002-5830-167X","documentHash":"0d343e52-20ea-4cfe-a213-5c134e4fef07"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b50","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Cencek","uuid":"7D7F433A7A31D1A4D080277B2FE49ED9F5B45115086FAEDA03BCF07F6AB6D09B61EC0E8015CEEA44A992C6D7E5DD06BB406798BF1E7065879BA9ED1F3FC8E8D3","orcidId":"0000-0003-3649-7867","documentHash":"7aa79c92-3af1-40b7-85e2-872b041c4104"}],"objectId":"65df47c24097070d576025c0","doi":"10.21521/mw.6838","publicUri":"http://www.medycynawet.edu.pl/images/stories/pdf/pdf2024/012024/2024016838.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Sarcocystis spp. – an underestimated parasite with zoonotic potential associated with food of animal origin","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The protozoa of the genus Sarcocystis are worldwide distributed parasites affecting a wide range of animals.

Human sarcocystosis is generally asymptomatic but in some cases can induce the\nsyptoms of intestinal illness. People can also become accidental intermediate hosts after ingesting sporocysts from feces-contaminated food or water leading to muscular sarcocystosis. The cysts of Sarcocystis spp. (sarcocysts),\nwhich with some exceptions, are not visible and therefore they are rarely detected during routine veterinary meat inspection consisting of visual assessment of muscle tissue and digestion (in case of examination of pig and wild boar meat). The presence of visible cysts of Sarcocystis spp. can lead to meat condemnation and it generates economic losses for farmers.

Approximately 95% of the 523 samples of various feed materials tested over seven years (2013–2018 and 2022) met the requirements of European Union feed law (Commission Regulation 277/2012/EU).\nThe highest average PCDD/PCDF/dl-PCB concentrations were found in fish oils and meal and were respectively 1.17 ± 0.78 and 5.51 ± 4.51 ng WHO-TEQ/kg of feed at 12% moisture. Median and background level concentrations of PCDD/PCDFs, dl-PCBs, PCDD/PCDF/dl-PCBs, and ndl-PCBs were significantly lower than their average concentrations for each individual feed material category. The WHO-TEQ profiles enabled the identification of three different characteristic profiles in feed materials."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0dfa","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c4","5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d63"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"916","pagesFromTo":"170227","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d63","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c4","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0dfa"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","issn":"0048-9697","documentHash":"536a2e2c-aae7-4edb-84d0-5d817a2d0285"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65d7273f40970704cad66f5c","year":"2024","volume":"916","documentHash":"348f0110-214f-4c2d-8802-320ccfe4d111"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dioxins","PCBs","feeds","background levels","congener patterns"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059425283"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d34","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Rola","uuid":"CA7CCA550D77B38C39C512D0BF1E1DD989B16A76C798CB003E76583649A413F1CC14D38A1D3A86639806ABD695B555AEFBBA4519ACEEB3448008E1F7F45415DE","documentHash":"9968525a-6722-4aa3-9451-1d6ca31f42fa"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d2c","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Polak","uuid":"79F989B03215F0BBDD2A933F0766B7402721633203694174A1C23F008A5E67775A43CC41B98341FE592662BBE54BA2EEE9192D7EDDDA9726E08BAD8CBBA17027","orcidId":"0000-0002-0909-9751","documentHash":"0cbe74b7-222d-47f2-adb8-b935ccee920f"}],"objectId":"65d754e640970704cae3c492","publicUri":"https://www.lecznica-online.pl/2023/12/choroba-guzowatej-skory-bydla-cz-ii-zapobieganie-i-zwalczanie/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Choroba guzowatej skóry bydła (cz.

The identical (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis) restriction pattern (pulsotype) of seven A. paragallinarum isolates indicated that infectious coryza in broilers was caused by the same clone. In cases 2 and 3, sudden increased deaths in Ross 308 broiler breeders (especially males) with lesions in the endocardium (valvular or mural endocarditis) were shown to be caused by A. endocarditis. Among nine antibiotics tested, florfenicol was the only antibiotic to which all A. paragallinarum and O. rhinotracheale isolates were susceptible. Out of the eight antibiotics tested, 11 A. endocarditis isolates from both clinical cases of infective endocarditis were susceptible to penicillin, amoxicillin, doxycycline and florfenicol. The A. endocarditis isolates tested in both clinical cases had different PFGE patterns (pulsotypes), but identical within a case. The causes of infectious coryza and infective endocarditis in the cases presented have not been determined.

The proper determination of these substances in food of animal origin is essential for consumer safety. Material and Methods: A 1 g portion of pig or cow urine or homogenised kidney was mixed with acetonitrile, sodium chloride was added, and the solution was further mixed and then centrifuged. The supernatant was transferred to a new centrifuge tube with primary and secondary amine, octadecylsilane and ZrO2, and mixed rapidly. The filtered solution was evaporated under a nitrogen stream. The residue was dissolved in 200 μL of acetonitrile, centrifuged with filters and then transferred to vials. Samples were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Results: The decision limit for confirmation was calculated at 2.5 μg kg−1 for all sedatives with relative standard deviation repeatability and reproducibility below 20%. Conclusion: The validation results showed that this method meets the pertinent EU criteria for such methods and is suitable for sedative analysis in urine and kidney matrices."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["65c6edb940e3ff0466a3d9b1","5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d4b","5e709342878c28a0473a5d59","65c6edb940e3ff0466a3d9b6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"68","issue":"0","pagesFromTo":"1-9","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d59","65c6edb940e3ff0466a3d9b6","5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d4b","65c6edb940e3ff0466a3d9b1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research","issn":"2450-7393","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c3fc9638-cd0e-40bb-89b9-22dee2de8b67"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sedatives","tranquillisers","QuEChERS","liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry","Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/808."]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059441248"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"608a55de9543c73526c48c68","name":"Beata","lastName":"Lachtara","uuid":"282991714039C961E3319F2426A2863D93470CCBE543F8EC7CE3808AE7F95DEC9E25A5232A45D0AAB8B01CF326F9497B266A34643AE9A696A6239B39FF83989E","documentHash":"a6cf7b97-c844-48db-a522-0850505ee499"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d66","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Wieczorek","uuid":"77FE94937137879573023F0D11FD72EFFDFDC4214863FDBF15FEEF0A6BDFD2ABA69978BCCFC9FF88D0F012F09560030758068F57DE1D27D7EB8B20C442DC9439","orcidId":"0000-0001-8268-3885","documentHash":"e54d106b-ea77-4715-815a-37b17126e9c0"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Osek","uuid":"09D7D5320F1FC606BCE9C2D945933A9AD76A02E8625F591A249FCC889F47698A9DDB27A314BD598D2BEBE05552FA565585514F11E04F6B15DA221089044711E2","orcidId":"0000-0003-2295-8837","documentHash":"6dc7582e-e613-4ee9-9ee7-81d949533982"}],"objectId":"65d75c7540970704cae4d1e9","doi":"10.21521/mw.6857","publicUri":"http://www.medycynawet.edu.pl/images/stories/pdf/pdf2024/00-artwait/2024036857.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Distribution of Listeria monocytogenes serogroups in food of animal origin produced in Poland during 2013–2022","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Listeria monocytogenes is an important food-borne pathogen that causes severe disease in humans. Many different foods products may be vehicles of these pathogenic strains. The aims of this study were to identified serogroups L. monocytogenes isolates by using PCR and analyze the distribution of serogroups in different food products of animal origin. L. monocytogenes isolates from ready-to-eat (RTE) meat products (n = 1,571), non-meat RTE food (n = 237), and non-RTE products (n = 189) were collected during years 2013-2020. A total of 899 (45.0%) isolates, irrespective of the origin, were classified to serogroup IIa. The remaining 1,098 strains belonged either to serogroups IVb (478; 23.9%), IIc (347; 17.4%) or IIb (273; 13.7%), respectively. In the predominant group products, i.e. RTE food of meat origin, serogroup IIa (702; 44.7%) was the most common followed by IVb (334; 21.3%), IIc (300; 19.1%), and IIb (235; 14.9%), respectively. The statistical differences were observed between the prevalence of L. monocytogenes serogroup IIb in sausages and cold cuts (P < 0.0001), cold cuts and delicatessen food (P < 0.001), as well as strains of serogroup IVb from sausages and cold cuts (P < 0.001). The prevalence of serogroup IIa was statistically higher among strains of milk and milk products origin than RTE fish and fish products (P < 0.05). The differences (P < 0.0001) were also observed \nin the distribution of L. monocytogenes of serogroup IIa from mixed food and milk as well as fish products. Additionally, the occurrence of serogroup IVb in mixed food differed compared to other food categories, i.e. milk and fish products (P < 0.0001). The obtained results confirmed the presence of L. monocytogenes serogroups IIa and IVb in food of animal origin, including RTE products, that are responsible for listeriosis in humans and suggested that these food products may pose a potential health problem, particularly to sensitive groups of people."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d66","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9","608a55de9543c73526c48c68"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"80","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"116-122","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d66","608a55de9543c73526c48c68","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478e2c","mniswId":"14214","title":"Medycyna Weterynaryjna","issn":"0025-8628","eissn":"0025-8628","documentHash":"632cff17-9361-4fc0-bf7c-794adb62e80a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65d75c7540970704cae4d1ea","year":"2024","volume":"80","number":"3","documentHash":"56ecdafa-684e-4404-b105-20989879c96f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["L. monocytogenes","molecular serogroups","ready-to eat (RTE) food","non-RTE food"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059441524"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65df405a4097070d575eef0e","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Michalski","documentHash":"d4bf3aab-0330-4042-a8f7-11f109a8e607"},{"objectId":"65df405a4097070d575eef0d","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Barabasz","documentHash":"80abbe3b-beda-469c-b57b-0efc0da6cbcd"},{"objectId":"5e7094af878c28a0473c1b6b","name":"Anna","lastName":"Sawicka-Durkalec","uuid":"74F41A0F85AC155F46A6CCFB26EB711F025B465228066B5B84B02AC6321B340B5E150BCF2A66F7C1772D185C02BC942B7AE9B4870C2127F7D8BF9A52EE8941FA","documentHash":"bedf887e-9c8e-4e06-b951-662b20cf6e92"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d88","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Bocian","uuid":"4239FC4F1A6A56B4C449D55C845F70D206FD0316490BE74E000F9F96750190FD162A48D60125604A3F67FE1FC3BA677DB5B766BCA6E3D70F855ED39F57117E92","orcidId":"0000-0002-8204-5856","documentHash":"c3f73129-bb4a-4ed7-aaf9-f0ea97957b91"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d5a","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Tomczyk","uuid":"E3C5238621862F074D46922CB3B17195CE27A83F2C9C06B0BA49A69FEE2FB90EC33B4FDD96A897D15FCA91F90109B062B91A53DADD2FC97CF132051ED597C664","documentHash":"b7a3ee18-b481-4390-a3be-5aeac0b34bca"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc2","name":"Jowita","lastName":"Niczyporuk","uuid":"521A2CD27A6C13DBEA5F489A8B137DCF73274C7B82AFB6C47400C8D36DF4DD03F9F21771D8DF7D702977129F5DDA28AB1A1D48BE68F3AF8007BBA4E10B5B83EF","orcidId":"0000-0003-3714-0552","documentHash":"734a1820-86f7-4af0-9ef1-22c5d3045238"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5ca4","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Kozdruń","uuid":"92417BFED8719CCDFD4C817BFF825E8DF8211DEB1B193FBEB8B9342F72B6CFB5A5668B33A83590A195BB8C4302D6703499EF982E33705E65072F2A5B25651ADB","orcidId":"0000-0003-2747-3804","documentHash":"e55d11c0-58ff-486f-aa9c-0edbe60eab6b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"FEBRUARY","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"65df405a4097070d575eef0c","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2024-0009","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2024-0009","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Probiotic supplementation as an alternative to antibiotics in broiler chickens","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: The broiler chicken digestive tract microbiome maintains the bird’s immunity. Its composition has been shown \nto be important not only for the immune system but also for the gastrointestinal function and productivity of broiler chickens. \nIf the microbiome is populated by supplementation with Lactobacillus, Pediococcus and Saccharomyces spp. – microorganisms \nwith probiotic properties and alternatives to antibiotics – the immune system is stimulated. The use of probiotic supplements in the \nbroiler production cycle can boost bird immunity and prevent adenovirus infection. The resilience of broiler chickens in different \nfeeding schemes including supplementation with these microorganisms was assessed. Material and Methods: Four groups of \nRoss 308 chickens vaccinated on the standard scheme were investigated over 42 days. Group P received probiotics, prebiotics and \nvitamins; group AO received antibiotics; group P&AO received probiotics, prebiotics, vitamins and antibiotics; and the control \ngroup C received none of these. The birds’ immunocompetence against common viral poultry pathogens and their immune response \nto an experimental challenge with a field strain of infectious bronchitis was evaluated by ELISA and production parameters were \nrecorded. Results: Mortality was only observed in the control group and was 10%. All birds from the P, P&AO and AO groups \nresponded to the challenge as would be expected of appropriately immunised chickens.

Material and Methods: Eighteen medicated feed samples were analysed for active substances. The analytical protocol used\na mixture of acetonitrile and 0.05 M phosphoric buffer, pH 4.5 for the extraction of seven antibacterial substances. After extraction,\nthe samples were diluted in Milli-Q water and analysed by liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. The developed procedure was subjected to validation in terms of linearity, selectivity, limits of quantification and determination, repeatability, reproducibility and uncertainty. Results: The validation of the method was carried out in accordance with the criteria set out in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/808 and ICH guidelines. This method provided average recoveries of 90.8 to 104.5% with coefficients of variation for repeatability and reproducibility in the ranges of 3.2–6.9% and 5.2–8.3%, respectively for all analysed antibacterial substances. The limit of detection and limit of quantification for all seven analytes ranged from 5.4 mg/kg to 48.3 mg/kg and from 10.4 mg/kg to 119.3 mg/kg, respectively. The uncertainty of the method depending on the compound varied from 14.0% to 24.0%. The validated method was successfully applied to the 18 medicated feeds. Conclusion: The developed method can be successfully used to routinely control the content and homogeneity of seven antibacterial substances in medicated feed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5caf","5e70947a878c28a0473be056"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"68","issue":"0","pagesFromTo":"1-8","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947a878c28a0473be056","5e709342878c28a0473a5caf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research","issn":"2450-7393","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c3fc9638-cd0e-40bb-89b9-22dee2de8b67"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sulfonamides","trimethoprim","tylosin","amoxicilin","medicated feed","liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS)"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059501222"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65fd6e7f4097076653d5c455","name":"Katharina D.

Additionally, the assessment of infants’ intake of analysed elements was evaluated. In total, 18 elements were determined in 30 HM samples of exclusively breastfeeding mothers during 4-6 weeks postpartum. For the elements analysis we used inductively coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometry. Most of the elements (n=11, 61%) were detected in all HM samples. The lowest detection level was for vanadium (n=3, 10%). The highest concertation was reported for copper (323.7 ± 98.0 μg/L). In all HM samples tin concentration was higher (5.67 ± 2.39) than the usual range reported by the World Health Organization (~1.0μg/L). HM cadmium content was positively associated with maternal salty snacks intake (r=0.502, p=0.005), arsenic with whole-grain products intake (r=0.37, p=0.043) and mercury concentration with fruits and seeds/nuts consumption (r=0.424, p=0.042 and r=0.378, p=0.039, respectively). Higher HM lead concentration was predicted by maternal age (95% CI [0.94-0.97]), intake of fish (95% CI [1.01-1.03]) and vegetables (95% CI [1.02-1.06]).

Regardless of the purpose of using antibiotics in livestock, they may be present in animal tissues and organs as well as in body fluids and excretions (feces and urine). Farm animal excrement in unprocessed form(natural fertilizers) or processed form (organic fertilizers) is applied to agricultural fields because it improves soil fertility. Antibiotics present in fertilizers may therefore contaminate the soil, surface, groundwater, and plants, which may pose a threat to the environment, animals, and humans. There-\nfore, it is important to develop analytical methods that will allow for the control of the presence of antibacterial substances in natural and organic fertilizers. Therefore, in this study, an LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the determination of 21 antibacterial substances in natural and organic liquid fertilizers. The developed method was used to analyze 62 samples of natural and organic liquid fertilizers, showing that over 24% of the tested samples were contaminated with antibiotics, mainly from the group of tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones. Studies of post-fermentation sludge from biogas plants have shown that the processes of anaerobic methane fermentation, pH, and temperature changes taking place in bioreactors do not lead to the complete degradation of antibiotics present in the material used for biogas production. For this reason, monitoring studies of natural and organic fertilizers should be undertaken to limit the introduction of antibiotics into the natural environment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5caf","5e70947a878c28a0473be056","61d510b87523401fc110f98b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"1644","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947a878c28a0473be056","61d510b87523401fc110f98b","5e709342878c28a0473a5caf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":"10.3390/molecules","issn":"1420-3049","eissn":"1420-3049","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules","documentHash":"184d7608-03fd-4b64-ac86-b4321a9365f0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65fd83ba4097076653d735d9","year":"2024","volume":"29","number":"7","documentHash":"070e7650-5c0b-4392-8863-6ad24257bb3c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["natural liquid fertilizers","organic liquid fertilizers","slurry","post-fermentation sludge","LC-MS/MS","antibiotics","method validation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059547400"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"663b41e24097070c4ce2e57c","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Pérez-Núñez","documentHash":"04648607-3bbd-4ea0-9a8d-8c7b75dbe256"},{"objectId":"663b41e24097070c4ce2e57b","name":"Yolanda","lastName":"Revilla","documentHash":"c929f598-8444-4c88-8762-3100ba8aee5f"},{"objectId":"663b41e24097070c4ce2e57a","name":"Dongseob","lastName":"Tark","documentHash":"85c990f9-a2d7-49e9-b585-47bbb586b585"},{"objectId":"663b41e24097070c4ce2e579","name":"Lihong","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"d9902cea-789c-4742-a12e-b3df9b7bf1ad"},{"objectId":"663b41e24097070c4ce2e578","name":"Krzesimir","lastName":"Szymankiewicz","documentHash":"9ef9309a-5685-475d-99a2-acfc2b7378db"},{"objectId":"663b41e24097070c4ce2e577","name":"Dae-Min","lastName":"Kim","documentHash":"a51adc65-7539-4d0b-98dc-52aed7e13005"},{"objectId":"663b41e24097070c4ce2e576","name":"Gonzalo","lastName":"Vigara-Astillero","documentHash":"5c3eb4f0-2271-40ba-b71a-444ada1f7957"},{"objectId":"663b41e24097070c4ce2e575","name":"Raquel","lastName":"García-Belmonte","documentHash":"6884cb2c-945a-4678-939b-f03781d16afa"},{"objectId":"663b41e24097070c4ce2e574","name":"Sun-Young","lastName":"Sunwoo","documentHash":"72db000b-e25c-4433-b02f-a623e9406ed3"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e49","name":"Marek","lastName":"Walczak","uuid":"21A80CCFF451C47DAACD79135936ED58DB4B863C7DAFCB2294E5CD3BFF3A4714E6C3DA150586FE86A64E197F08E90074F2171195EC1B4617D33D96798A46B57E","documentHash":"988887b4-5991-42b1-86b7-dcc413c5c96e"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de0","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Kochanowski","uuid":"22232E0EEDA0B86B551A138FD411D8AD5D9D0AC9E4AE59C77A6370EA12B87E7E4672884EAE5A819DD42801D310BB1EC3B47A1E2C825D4712CEAE5DAFB07121E4","documentHash":"d7c306c3-b933-482a-ade4-610f87bbba34"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d2b","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Podgórska","uuid":"E3FB69D94109DE92198EBFBF30082B9458237A6355B9B21E100A6D5262E9777DA40BE545D81C14FC07F65384997084D970796E443AA1A69EAC58466E8C2C753D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7608-6926","documentHash":"c4be02d5-d46e-4de6-bfe4-e316c6deb58d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"APRIL","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"663b41e24097070c4ce2e572","doi":"10.3390/vaccines12040407","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/12/4/407/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Deletion of MGF505-2R Gene Activates the cGAS-STING Pathway Leading to Attenuation and Protection against Virulent African Swine Fever Virus","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"African swine fever virus (ASFV) is the etiological agent causing African swine fever (ASF), affecting domestic pigs and wild boar, which is currently the biggest animal epidemic in the world and a major threat to the swine sector. At present, some safety concerns about using LAVs against ASFV still exist despite a commercial vaccine licensed in Vietnam. Therefore, the efforts to identify virulence factors and their mechanisms, as well as to generate new vaccine prototypes, are of major interest. In this work, we have identified the MGF505-2R gene product as an inhibitor of the cGAS/STING pathway, specifically through its interaction with STING protein, controlling IFN-β production. In addition, immunization of a recombinant virus lacking this gene, Arm/07-ΔMGF505-2R, resulted in complete attenuation, demonstrating its involvement in ASFV virulence. Finally, immunization with Arm/07-ΔMGF505-2R induced the generation of antibodies and proved to be partially protective against virulent ASFV strains. These results identify MGF505-2R, as well as its mechanism of action, as a gene contributing to understanding the molecular mechanisms of ASFV virulence, which will be of great value in the design of future vaccine prototypes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny -

an open web-based bioinformatics suite for viral metagenomic detection and routine genomic surveillance","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background\nImplementation of clinical metagenomics and pathogen genomic surveillance can be particularly challenging due to the lack of bioinformatics tools and/or expertise. In order to face this challenge, we have previously developed INSaFLU, a free web-based bioinformatics platform for virus next-generation sequencing data analysis. Here, we considerably expanded its genomic surveillance component and developed a new module (TELEVIR) for metagenomic virus identification.\nResults\nThe routine genomic surveillance component was strengthened with new workflows and functionalities, including: i) a reference-based genome assembly pipeline for Oxford Nanopore technologies (ONT) data; ii) automated SARS-CoV-2 lineage classification; iii) Nextclade analysis; iv) Nextstrain phylogeographic and temporal analysis (SARS-CoV-2, seasonal and avian influenza, mpox, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV A/B), as well as a “generic” build for other viruses); and, v)  algn2pheno for screening mutations of interest. Both INSaFLU pipelines for reference-based consensus generation (Illumina and ONT) were benchmarked against commonly used command line bioinformatics workflows for SARS-CoV-2, and an INSaFLU snakemake version was released. In parallel, a new module (TELEVIR) for virus detection was developed, after extensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art metagenomics software and following up-to-date recommendations and practices in the field. TELEVIR allows running complex workflows, covering several combinations of steps (e.g., with/without Viral enrichment/Host depletion), classification software (e.g., Kaiju, Kraken2, Centrifuge, FastViromeExplorer) and databases (RefSeq viral genome, Virosaurus, etc), while culminating in user- and diagnosis-oriented reports. Finally, to potentiate real-time virus detection during ONT runs, we developed findONTime, a tool aimed at reducing costs and the time between sample reception and diagnosis. \nConclusion\nThe accessibility, versatility and functionality of INSaFLU-TELEVIR is expected to supply public health laboratories and researchers with a user-oriented bioinformatics framework that promotes a strengthened and timely viral metagenomic detection and routine genomics surveillance. INSaFLU-TELEVIR is compatible with Illumina, Ion Torrent and ONT data and is freely available at https://insaflu.insa.pt/ (online tool) and https://github.com/INSaFLU (code)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d41"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"1-21","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["665d64344097073627d4fc87","665d64344097073627d4fc88","665d64344097073627d4fc89","665d64344097073627d4fc8a","665d64344097073627d4fc8b","665d64344097073627d4fc8c","665d64344097073627d4fc8d","665d64344097073627d4fc8e","665d64344097073627d4fc8f","665d64344097073627d4fc90","665d64344097073627d4fc91","665d64344097073627d4fc92","665d64344097073627d4fc93","665d64344097073627d4fc94","665d64344097073627d4fc95","665d64344097073627d4fc96","665d64344097073627d4fc97","665d64344097073627d4fc98","5e709342878c28a0473a5d41","665d64344097073627d4fc99","665d64344097073627d4fc9a","665d64344097073627d4fc9b","665d64344097073627d4fc9c","665d64344097073627d4fc9d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477de1","mniswId":"7046","title":"Genome Medicine","issn":"1756-994X","eissn":"1756-994X","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"ef2f5342-0fcc-44f7-a456-a98976f462f2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"665d64344097073627d4fc86","year":"2024","volume":"16","number":"1","documentHash":"0a664d80-cd21-46f4-8699-294bb54061b5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["metagenomic detection","virus","genomic surveillance"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059607724"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6661724c409707458fb1673a","name":"Juergen A.","lastName":"Richt","documentHash":"5899864a-f21b-41ba-bc6b-6523821b0298"},{"objectId":"6661724c409707458fb16739","name":"William C.","lastName":"Wilson","documentHash":"fe9e828b-e34e-493f-8ac1-7284459f8905"},{"objectId":"6661724c409707458fb16738","name":"Natasha N.","lastName":"Gaudreault","documentHash":"1d24db11-d272-44d9-90e8-4bde847a364c"},{"objectId":"6661724c409707458fb16737","name":"Klaus","lastName":"Osterrieder","documentHash":"1535cbc9-8829-4894-a8db-0493c2c6c1a3"},{"objectId":"6661724c409707458fb16736","name":"Bonto","lastName":"Faburay","documentHash":"e3223221-7de2-4e4a-9a11-795addf64143"},{"objectId":"6661724c409707458fb16735","name":"Sun-Young","lastName":"Sunwoo","documentHash":"42cd9b2f-04cd-475a-b0a1-8d4b68094ee2"},{"objectId":"6661724c409707458fb16734","name":"Igor","lastName":"Morozov","documentHash":"8c6d2a50-d2e9-49cc-b909-1f79eded61a2"},{"objectId":"6661724c409707458fb16733","name":"Michelle D.","lastName":"Zajac","documentHash":"1820f3c9-6baa-4d99-bb92-87e81f7ab12d"},{"objectId":"6661724c409707458fb16732","name":"Vinay","lastName":"Shivanna","documentHash":"7b01939f-cb86-44c5-a37b-636a0c46a108"},{"objectId":"6661724c409707458fb16731","name":"David A.","lastName":"Meekins","documentHash":"47601543-eb49-481a-8bb8-33efea47a2e7"},{"objectId":"6661724c409707458fb16730","name":"Jessie D.","lastName":"Trujillo","documentHash":"20309533-b0d5-4fbb-bf54-f5987e0717c8"},{"objectId":"6661724c409707458fb1672f","name":"In Joong","lastName":"Kim","documentHash":"ce0c3a1e-6514-4760-ba1a-cf78ba0e401b"},{"objectId":"6661724c409707458fb1672e","name":"Sabarish V.","lastName":"Indran","documentHash":"930fa6c3-f4b4-40b6-b214-6bf8e05ccfc3"},{"objectId":"6661724c409707458fb1672d","name":"Velmurugan","lastName":"Balaraman","documentHash":"5e886089-29ea-4b77-b331-62c3edf334e0"},{"objectId":"5e709487878c28a0473befdb","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Urbaniak","uuid":"C7CA2E7BF247682041217049992F06D0D65328A1354FAC4A459547A19DF3B956632E760BCF7B670567E238BB78E95739E0AD2DD07D8BEA3185E797FE58B5A61D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7965-9216","documentHash":"5e30369a-a594-4592-93a4-3562d7cbdb46"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"MAY","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"6661724c409707458fb1672c","doi":"10.3390/v16060880","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/16/6/880/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Rift Valley Fever Phlebovirus Reassortment Study in Sheep","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Rift Valley fever (RVF) in ungulates and humans is caused by a mosquito-borne RVF\nphlebovirus (RVFV). Live attenuated vaccines are used in livestock (sheep and cattle) to control RVF\nin endemic regions during outbreaks. The ability of two or more different RVFV strains to reassort\nwhen co-infecting a host cell is a significant veterinary and public health concern due to the potential\nemergence of newly reassorted viruses, since reassortment of RVFVs has been documented in nature\nand in experimental infection studies. Due to the very limited information regarding the frequency\nand dynamics of RVFV reassortment, we evaluated the efficiency of RVFV reassortment in sheep,\na natural host for this zoonotic pathogen. Co-infection experiments were performed, first in vitro\nin sheep-derived cells, and subsequently in vivo in sheep. Two RVFV co-infection groups were\nevaluated: group I consisted of co-infection with two wild-type (WT) RVFV strains, Kenya 128B-15\n(Ken06) and Saudi Arabia SA01-1322 (SA01), while group II consisted of co-infection with the live\nattenuated virus (LAV) vaccine strain MP-12 and a WT strain, Ken06. In the in vitro experiments,\nthe virus supernatants were collected 24 h post-infection. In the in vivo experiments, clinical signs\nwere monitored, and blood and tissues were collected at various time points up to nine days post-\nchallenge for analyses. Cell culture supernatants and samples from sheep were processed, and\nplaque-isolated viruses were genotyped to determine reassortment frequency. Our results show\nthat RVFV reassortment is more efficient in co-infected sheep-derived cells compared to co-infected\nsheep. In vitro, the reassortment frequencies reached 37.9% for the group I co-infected cells and\n25.4% for the group II co-infected cells. In contrast, we detected just 1.7% reassortant viruses from\ngroup I sheep co-infected with the two WT strains, while no reassortants were detected from group II\nsheep co-infected with the WT and LAV strains. The results indicate that RVFV reassortment occurs\nat a lower frequency in vivo in sheep when compared to in vitro conditions in sheep-derived cells.\nFurther studies are needed to better understand the implications of RVFV reassortment in relation to\nvirulence and transmission dynamics in the host and the vector. The knowledge learned from these\nstudies on reassortment is important for understanding the dynamics of RVFV evolution."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709487878c28a0473befdb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"880","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6661724c409707458fb1672d","6661724c409707458fb1672e","6661724c409707458fb1672f","6661724c409707458fb16730","6661724c409707458fb16731","6661724c409707458fb16732","6661724c409707458fb16733","5e709487878c28a0473befdb","6661724c409707458fb16734","6661724c409707458fb16735","6661724c409707458fb16736","6661724c409707458fb16737","6661724c409707458fb16738","6661724c409707458fb16739","6661724c409707458fb1673a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a80","mniswId":"20156","title":"Viruses","issn":"1999-4915","eissn":"1999-4915","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses","documentHash":"204f8987-0c7c-441b-9f4a-748747147d4e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"665eb5124097073a823c8b51","year":"2024","volume":"16","number":"6","documentHash":"52515432-9f33-4d4f-93fe-1ed49d71f3af"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Rift Valley fever phlebovirus","bunyavirus","sheep","reassortment"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059611644"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c2","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Paździor","uuid":"DADC54691FBE81C5F946DC42E8DD071BBE303B4EA3CF351BEABE42720C6C569D8FAF65923AD06BC559A1F5C4916DA622EC519E78D01A0741DD099503CBCC8526","documentHash":"d47b0aad-82be-4128-85e9-0c345d4d4dcb"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9","name":"Monika","lastName":"Olech","uuid":"9B0A0406A7EDD36FA4801C73080BC03B173E473705A47493F0C38433544479A4BC660CBD60F16ACD61F83868583404238E4E4A1F03B9A0CA29DCC3BD5AAC93DD","orcidId":"0000-0002-8356-5423","documentHash":"0959a77d-a9cb-4a8e-bec6-b983807c59b8"}],"objectId":"665eec044097073a82403371","doi":"10.21521/mw.6889","publicUri":"http://www.medycynawet.edu.pl/images/stories/pdf/pdf2024/062024/2024066889.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Detection of bacterial fish pathogens by MALDI-TOF MS- state of the art","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A key element in the diagnosis of bacterial infections in fish is the rapid identification of the etiological\nagent of the disease and drug resistance testing.

The risk of these infections in immunocompromised poultry flocks with developed clinical symptoms was analysed through virus detection in broiler chicks and correlation of cases with the birds’ immune strength.\n\nMaterial and Methods\nSamples were analysed from four broiler farms with chicks from the same hatchery in Silesia, Poland where feeding regimes were different. A normal diet was provided to birds on the control farm; a normal diet and probiotic, prebiotic, vitamin and microelement supplementation was supplied on another farm; a normal diet and antibiotics on the third; and a normal diet and both forms of supplementation were given on the fourth farm. Amplification of the virus DNA in a PCR with hexon gene L1 loop hypervariable region 1–4 primers determined the molecular characteristics of isolates of adenovirus strains obtained from necropsy tissue samples. The amplicon sequences were analysed, the pair-wise distances were determined, the maximum likelihood estimate for the gamma parameter for site rates was produced, Tajima’s D neutrality test was run and the relative synonymous codon usage and transition/transversion bias were calculated.\n\nResults\nTwo species and two serotypes of fowl adenovirus – MW353018-FAdV-1/A-L-liver and MW353019-FAdV-5/B-I-intestine – were isolated in three-week-old broiler chicks on the control farm.\n\nConclusion\nSupplementation of broiler chicken flocks with probiotics, prebiotics, vitamins and microelements may have a significant beneficial effect on immunity and can prevent virus infection.

the genetic basis of azithromycin resistance in Escherichia coli and Salmonella collected within the EU harmonized antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance programme in 2014–18 and the Danish AMR surveillance programme in 2016–19.\n\nMethods\nWGS data of 1007 E. coli [165 azithromycin resistant (MIC > 16 mg/L)] and 269 Salmonella [29 azithromycin resistant (MIC > 16 mg/L)] were screened for acquired macrolide resistance genes and mutations in rplDV, 23S rRNA and acrB genes using ResFinder v4.0, AMRFinder Plus and custom scripts. Genotype–phenotype concordance was determined for all isolates. Transferability of mef(C)-mph(G)-carrying plasmids was assessed by conjugation experiments.\n\nResults\nmph(A), mph(B), mef(B), erm(B) and mef(C)-mph(G) were detected in E. coli and Salmonella, whereas erm(C), erm(42), ere(A) and mph(E)-msr(E) were detected in E. coli only. The presence of macrolide resistance genes, alone or in combination, was concordant with the azithromycin-resistant phenotype in 69% of isolates. Distinct mph(A) operon structures were observed in azithromycin-susceptible (n = 50) and -resistant (n = 136) isolates. mef(C)-mph(G) were detected in porcine and bovine E. coli and in porcine Salmonella enterica serovar Derby and Salmonella enterica 1,4, [5],12:i:-, flanked downstream by ISCR2 or TnAs1 and associated with IncIγ and IncFII plasmids.\n\nConclusions\nDiverse azithromycin resistance genes were detected in E. coli and Salmonella from food-producing animals and meat in Europe. Azithromycin resistance genes mef(C)-mph(G) and erm(42) appear to be emerging primarily in porcine E. coli isolates. The identification of distinct mph(A) operon structures in susceptible and resistant isolates increases the predictive power of WGS-based methods for in silico detection of azithromycin resistance in Enterobacterales."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy

but severe disease that affects more than 18,000 people\nworldwide per year. The complete sequencing of the mitochondrial genome of Echinococcus multilocularis has made it possible to study the genetic diversity of the parasite and its spatial\nand temporal evolution. We amplified the whole mitochondrial genome by PCR, using one\nuniplex and two multiplex reactions to cover the 13,738 bp of the mitogenome, and then\nsequenced the amplicons with Illumina technology. In total, 113 samples from Europe, Asia, ,\nthe Arctic and North America were analyzed. Three major haplogroups were found: HG1,\nwhich clustered samples from Alaska (including Saint-Lawrence Island), Yakutia (Russia) and\nSvalbard; HG2, with samples from Asia, North America and Europe; and HG3, subdivided into\nthree micro-haplogroups.

Several reports also suggest that SRLVs can infect wild ruminants. The presence of specific antibodies against SRLVs has been identified in wild ruminants from Poland, but no studies have been conducted to detect proviral DNA of SRLVs in these animals. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine samples from Polish wild ruminants to determine whether\nthese animals can serve as reservoirs of SRLVs under natural conditions. A total of 314 samples were tested from red deer (n = 255), roe deer (n = 52) and fallow deer (n = 7) using nested real-time PCR. DNA from positive real-time PCR samples was subsequently used to amplify a CA fragment (625 bp) of the gag gene, a 1.2 kb fragment of the\npol gene and an LTR-gag fragment. Three samples (0.95%) were positive according to nested real-time PCR using primers and probe specific for CAEV (SRLV group B). All the samples were negative for the primers and probe specific for MVV (SRLV A group). Only SRLV LTR-gag sequences were obtained from two red deer. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these sequences were more closely related to CAEV than to MVV. Our results revealed\nthat deer can carry SRLV proviral sequences and therefore may play a role in the epidemiology of SRLVs. To our knowledge, this is the first study describing SRLV sequences from red deer."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"20","issue":"195","pagesFromTo":"1-8","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9","665ee2204097073a823f531f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454773ef","mniswId":"2654","title":"BMC Veterinary Research","doi":"","issn":"1746-6148","eissn":"1746-6148","websiteLink":"https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/","documentHash":"66e6c314-66d5-4224-b244-59b8e2232101"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eb1dd7409707216edec964","year":"2024","volume":"20","number":"1","documentHash":"592e060b-24f2-4e25-a25f-44003a56a270"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["SRLV","CAEV","Red deer","Wild ruminants","Cross-species transmission","Phylogenetic analysis","Nested PCR"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059632060"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6673f2c54097075086a64d7b","name":"Philippe","lastName":"Marchand","documentHash":"3fd00ab8-0dc4-41c0-ad2a-f738d56fd4f6"},{"objectId":"5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d63","name":"Marek","lastName":"Pajurek","uuid":"358255257A75C74D59A14A68D4AD1D554284D6EA9DD40FBD386D3E65CF5750BD0AFFF658AA426C816DC388F1A156AECE3148D4AE805CC056A07EFA22690EE5D5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8222-7983","documentHash":"7f676a9f-a4bf-48d6-8a81-13e7fdd64d47"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0dfa","name":"Szczepan","lastName":"Mikołajczyk","uuid":"C57E964869276842E1B6331B9082F2B02A42D6FADD90FF381F756A49C8569C2E04C6F6ABF9E834E4B7AB5848A68D8684085BA83752893DAFEA5BB142A62126BA","orcidId":"0000-0003-0185-174X","documentHash":"40314827-db15-4c91-940f-4476439025a4"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c4","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Warenik-Bany","uuid":"4712B9142F37DE7444F67A0D87EE1C663B7551CC5403CE356609DD8451AC163AE66C02975F4E46C75BA54D138152C7CA025EC98E7A9BBC1C46CE7FDB9A2F3D49","orcidId":"0000-0002-3839-6464","documentHash":"a8205408-5907-4d58-85e1-a99171e81d41"}],"objectId":"6673f2c54097075086a64d79","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.174071","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0048969724042190?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Perfluoroalkyl substances in the meat of Polish farm animals and game – Occurrence, profiles and dietary intake","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Meat from farm animals (pigs, cattle and poultry) and game (wild boar and deer) was analysed in terms of thirteen perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs).

Mean LB∑4 PFAS concentrations led to intakes between 0.000 and 1.75 ng/kg body weight (BW) for children and 0.000 and 0.91 ng/kg BW for adults. The potential risk to consumers was assessed in relation to the tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 4.4 ng/kg BW established by the European Food Safety Authority in 2020. Exposure associated with the consumption of poultry, pork, beef and venison was negligible, being only <1% of the TWI for children and adults; higher exposure was found to associate with the consumption of wild boar, being 63% and 21% of the TWI for children and adults, respectively.\nThe findings of this research suggest that the intake of PFASs through the consumption of meat from Polish livestock and deer is unlikely to be a health concern.

Since sulphonamides are used illegally in apiculture to treat foulbrood, their residues can be found in honey and other apiculture products, including beeswax. The study aimed to assess the contamination of honey from beeswax containing residues of 10 sulphonamides (sulphadimethoxine (SDM), sulphadoxine (SDX), sulphamonomethoxine (SMM), sulphamethoxazole (SMX), sulphameter (SMT), sulphamethazine (SMZ), sulphamerazine (SMR), sulphadiazine (SDA), sulphathiazole (STZ) and sulphacetamide (SCA)). Material and Methods: Wax-based foundations fortified with 10 sulphonamides at 10,000 μg/kg were evaluated for sulphonamide concentrations and then placed in a beehive so that honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) could build honeycombs with them. Frames of capped honey were taken out of the hives one month later and honey was sampled from them. The honeycombs were subsequently incubated in a laboratory at 35°C for five months, and honey was sampled monthly. The honey sulphonamide concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry and compared to the wax-based foundation concentrations. Results: \nThe maximum transfers to honey of the initial amount of SDM, SDX, SMM, SMX, SMT, SMZ, SMR, SDA, STZ and SCA in the wax-based foundations were 42.6, 34.3, 31.7, 30.1, 29.5, 25.2, 18.7, 16.1, 9.5 and 8.6%, respectively. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that every tested sulphonamide could migrate from beeswax in antimicrobial-tainted honeycombs to honey, SDM having the highest migration potential and SCA the lowest."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cbe"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"68","issue":"0","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cbe","6671795f4097074551635d61"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research","issn":"2450-7393","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c3fc9638-cd0e-40bb-89b9-22dee2de8b67"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sulphonamides","beeswax","honey","transfer","LC-MS/MS"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059635306"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6671832040970745516435e1","name":"Sabine","lastName":"Zange","documentHash":"bfa874ba-5169-46fd-9a12-6103451854ed"},{"objectId":"6671832040970745516435e0","name":"Domenico","lastName":"Galante","documentHash":"ae260f54-9ab7-4634-8a36-226e63248941"},{"objectId":"6671832040970745516435df","name":"Gunnar","lastName":"Kahlmeter","documentHash":"9482aa6f-4e52-4d65-85da-64fd16cc5cf8"},{"objectId":"6671832040970745516435de","name":"Roland","lastName":"Grunow","documentHash":"bd768958-24eb-4f7f-bdca-90d76512b946"},{"objectId":"6671832040970745516435dd","name":"Tiziano","lastName":"Fancello","documentHash":"52e3d65d-f7be-4f83-9ce3-03f2ee62c5e8"},{"objectId":"6671832040970745516435dc","name":"Marcella","lastName":"Mori","documentHash":"8df5f537-d19d-4afc-a363-5c1bf1b0f775"},{"objectId":"6671832040970745516435db","name":"Mandy","lastName":"Elschner","documentHash":"a225916c-0336-4724-9182-e02cf7502a8f"},{"objectId":"6671832040970745516435da","name":"Falk","lastName":"Melzer","documentHash":"ca4f4a89-4920-41a7-8dfc-19527ec5342d"},{"objectId":"6671832040970745516435d9","name":"Daniela","lastName":"Jacob","documentHash":"e8311662-4112-435e-a0e1-f4a05fcdd840"},{"objectId":"6671832040970745516435d8","name":"Erika","lastName":"Matuschek","documentHash":"958000df-a3cf-496f-a3eb-4b2d4cb01d61"},{"objectId":"6671832040970745516435d7","name":"Gregor","lastName":"Grass","documentHash":"4a2a0439-8fa1-4e5b-bb5a-590db7884559"},{"objectId":"6671832040970745516435d6","name":"Viviana","lastName":"Manzulli","documentHash":"9b9599ee-e21b-4c4c-a71c-fb359dc4daa8"},{"objectId":"6671832040970745516435d5","name":"Flavia","lastName":"Dematheis","documentHash":"cfcf6e1f-eea7-403f-8490-d54ad6ec5460"},{"objectId":"5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d64","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Budniak","uuid":"105D5DE6DCDA90ECCE3BFA62FDC2D9BE9C2FB2A66A743ADEC9067ED71E6203D3FE356B96E29F53191CBBBF06D6BB8BC7242C31BF06E9050354DE619C68510621","orcidId":"0000-0002-2950-6078","documentHash":"7c45cc6e-fc28-4e15-a362-0678af1f5606"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b6b","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kędrak-Jabłońska","uuid":"302AF4144AC3D3FCEC6971E6F60042D0467E8099A38DE30E096D0A32E01E3AB96993F323EFB021582F3060CE2674FE5D09B6D17A6E745B847B5A7BDD4579D151","documentHash":"b45a71f5-5f02-4f59-aded-20b858a2ecc9"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"JUNE","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"6671832040970745516435d4","doi":"10.1016/j.cmi.2024.05.019","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1198743X24002568?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"European multi-center study to establish MIC and zone diameter epidemiological cut-off (ECOFF) values for Bacillus anthracis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objectives\n\nBacillus anthracis clinical breakpoints, representing a systematic approach to guide clinicians in selecting the most appropriate antimicrobial treatments, are not part of the guidance from the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). This is because defined distributions of MIC values and of epidemiological cut-off values (ECOFFs) have been lacking. In this study, a Europe-wide network of laboratories in collaboration with EUCAST, aimed at establishing standardized antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) methods, wild-type (WT) MIC distributions and ECOFFs for ten therapeutically relevant antimicrobials.\nMethods\n\nAbout 335 B. anthracis isolates were tested by broth microdilution (BMD) and disc diffusion (DD) methodologies. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and inhibition zone diameters were curated according to EUCAST SOP 10.2 and the results were submitted to EUCAST for ECOFFs and clinical breakpoint determination.\nResults\n\nBMD and DD data distributions revealed putative WT distributions for the tested agents. For each antimicrobial agent, ECOFFs were defined. Three highly resistant strains with MIC values of 32 mg/L benzylpenicillin were found. MIC values slightly above the defined ECOFFs were observed in a few isolates, indicating the presence of resistance mechanisms to doxycycline, tetracycline and amoxicillin.\nConclusions\n\nB. anthracis AST results were used by EUCAST to determine ECOFFs for ten antimicrobial agents. The MIC distributions were used in the process of determining clinical breakpoints. The ECOFFs can be used for the sensitive detection of isolates with resistance mechanisms, and for monitoring resistance development. Genetic changes causing phenotypic shifts in isolates displaying slightly elevated MICs remain to be investigated."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d64","5e709341878c28a0473a5b6b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"1-23","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6671832040970745516435d5","6671832040970745516435d6","6671832040970745516435d7","6671832040970745516435d8","6671832040970745516435d9","6671832040970745516435da","6671832040970745516435db","5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d64","6671832040970745516435dc","6671832040970745516435dd","6671832040970745516435de","6671832040970745516435df","6671832040970745516435e0","6671832040970745516435e1","5e709341878c28a0473a5b6b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454776ba","mniswId":"3866","title":"Clinical Microbiology and Infection","issn":"1198-743X","eissn":"1469-0691","documentHash":"76d5499a-b87a-4686-882c-ae14cb31b4bb"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["antimicrobial susceptibility testing","Bacillus anthracis","clinical breakpoints","ECOFF","wild-type MIC distributions"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059648143"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65c6edb940e3ff0466a3d9a4","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Szymanek-Bany","uuid":"BA214AC2422B806E864563B1E651EE1816C1F3BA15F6DA07F1E9B97D91A0429D30831C804117F47587418B8FEC552EE407E82FCA4056770483210E5EAD830683","documentHash":"88f5b984-4790-48b8-8b46-fa6f2ac0292d"},{"objectId":"5ebedb8e752340254fc41d98","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Nowacka-Kozak","uuid":"8CBB9BEA330461C21139B1A43143F2D65E7C0E274C8AC0428A2BB4F729EDE82FC702DE92C76DB7C8F5AEBD4110C2A07741FBA7869CA46F0536943AAD894F8676","documentHash":"4d754fa0-a479-45fc-b307-f63831d67b83"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be309","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Gbylik-Sikorska","uuid":"4B34FB60DD634752084136595964C4AF13C4EC0C7D6C58CC915FAE03E0779E7F921FC8FE7AB1DAFE0FF33F2061437939C911DB90BDBA01B0563DD13FA76CC8FC","orcidId":"0000-0002-7463-5792","documentHash":"ae91ee84-064a-41d5-8588-f2e11dfccc79"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b5c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Gajda","uuid":"737BA79C0CDDEA58062EFA3DAF7A11C5B7A456F7185DF5693B57EE4097ED5366D5B5D9FD97385488431E06665C388F3163A713C9B3DC06F30B91B586578814C9","documentHash":"c782825e-7075-4034-aef9-edf206624991"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"MAY","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"6683bb11fdbe831996b802f0","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2024-0030","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2024-0030","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Investigation of doxycycline residues in bones after oral administration to broiler chickens","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Chicken bones, a by-product of the poultry industry, can directly or indirectly enter the food chain.

Material and Methods: Chickens’ eggs (n = 25) and the livers of cows (n = 10), chickens (n = 7) and horses (n = 3) were\ncollected from various regions of Poland. Samples were analysed using the isotope dilution technique with liquid chromatography\ncoupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results: The mean lower bound (LB) sum of four PFAS (∑4 PFAS)\nconcentrations (perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and\nperfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS)) were the highest in cows’ livers (0.52 μg/kg) and much lower in chickens’ (0.17 μg/kg)\nand horses’ livers (0.13 μg/kg) and chickens’ eggs (0.096 μg/kg). The ratio of ∑4 PFASs to the limits set by Commission Regulation\n(EU) 2023/915 was <7% for liver and <6% for eggs. Linear PFOS was the compound with the highest detection frequency (8% in\neggs and 48% in all livers). In cows’ livers it was detected in 80% of samples. The estimated exposure to LB ∑4 PFASs\nvia consumption of liver tissue from farm animals (assuming 50 g and 100 g portions) was <52% of the tolerable weekly intake\n(TWI) for children and <17% of the TWI for adults. Dietary intake via the average portion of three eggs led to low exposure of\n<15% for children and <5% for adults. Conclusion: Neither eggs nor the livers of chickens or horses as analysed in this study are\nsignificant sources of PFASs, while cows’ livers might contribute significantly to a child’s overall dietary intake.

This cluster is also found in other members of the Clostridium genus, such as C. baratii, C. butyricum, and C. sporogenes. The occurrence of a botulinum-like cluster has also been recorded in strains of other genera, i.e., Enterococcus faecium, as well as in a Gram-negative species isolated from freshwater sediments; however, the biological activity of bont-related genes has not been noted. It can be said that the mentioned species have a dual nature. Another species with a dual nature is C. butyricum. This bacterium is a common human and animal gut commensal bacterium and is also frequently found in the environment. Although non-toxigenic strains are currently used as probiotics in Asia, other strains have been implicated in pathological conditions, such as botulism in infants or necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm neonates. Additionally, C. baratii strains are rare opportunistic pathogens associated with botulism intoxication. They have been isolated from food and soil and can be carried asymptomatically or cause botulism outbreaks in animals and humans. In addition to the mentioned clostridia, the other microorganisms considered as non-toxigenic have also been suspected of carrying botulinum cluster Gram-negative bacteria, such as Chryseobacterium piperi isolated from freshwater sediments; however, the biological activity of bont-related genes has not been noted. Additionally, Enterococcus faecium strains have been discovered carrying BoNT-related clusters (BoNT/En). Literature data regarding the heterogeneity of BoNT-producing strains indicate the requirement to reclassify C. botulinum species and other microorganisms able to produce BoNTs or possess botulinum-like gene clusters. This article aims to show the dual nature of Clostridium strains not belonging to the C. botulinum species that are sporadically able to carry bont clusters, which are usually considered saprophytic and even probiotic, and bont-like clusters in microorganisms from other genera. The aim was also to consider the genetic mechanisms of botulinum cluster expression in strains that are considered opportunistic and the microbiological safety aspects associated with their occurrence in the environment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","uid":"bt6mbuLY9Vpc_KWGkV1Lk4w","uuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Lublinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70925f878c28a0473948e6","5e709405878c28a0473b505b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947c878c28a0473be32e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"780","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70925f878c28a0473948e6","5e709405878c28a0473b505b","5e70947c878c28a0473be32e","66e1596ffdbe832737743fa3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceac","mniswId":"15767","title":"Pathogens","eissn":"2076-0817","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"e3cbc691-2d96-4c17-9b90-bb773e877487"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Clostridium","BoNT","C. botulinum","C. sporogenes","C. butyricum","C. baratii"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059811836"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67124977fdbe836b555fab0a","name":"Adrianna","lastName":"Żybura","documentHash":"2838349d-9988-4aeb-8f5c-f82aa764a29f"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b68","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Jedziniak","uuid":"DCD8C61F090FCDB42589ECD4D30BC4F07DF1A48D10CB58D28E1887BBF8E5C91C1A764BCE5DD19D7C91FF78DF169D6B1526C1FC81E50250D50A1EF803542B7CE7","documentHash":"d2888220-8bd1-4995-b8e9-9c4b4e30d1a4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"MAY","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"67124977fdbe836b555fab09","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2024-0023","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2024-0023","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The efficiency of mycotoxin binding by sorbents in the <i>in vitro</i> model using a naturally contaminated animal feed","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: The productivity of domestic animals and the safety of food products derived from them are jeopardised by\nmycotoxins in animal feed. To control them, feed additives are used, which limit the absorption of mycotoxins in the gastrointestinal\ntract of animals by binding to them. The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a new in vitro model in experiments on the\nbinding of mycotoxins from buffers and contaminated feed and to confirm the effect of a single sorbent or mixture in binding them.\nMaterial and Methods: Nine mineral sorbents were tested for their efficiency binding eight mycotoxins. Two in vitro experiments\nwere conducted to indicate the mycotoxin-binding capacity of sorbents, each specifying a buffer with one of two different pH levels\nreflecting gastrointestinal conditions (pH 3.5 and 7.0). The first investigated the sorbent with only the buffer and mycotoxin\nstandards, while the second did so with the sorbent, buffer and feed naturally contaminated with mycotoxins (deoxynivalenol,\nzearalenone, and ochratoxin A). Results: The sorption was significantly lower in the trial with feed. In the first experiment\nat gastric pH (pH 3.5), activated charcoal bound deoxynivalenol and sepiolite bound zearalenone at 70% and 96%, respectively,\nwhereas in the second experiment with feed, the binding was only 3% and 6%. Conclusion: The study underlines the challenge of\nfinding a feed additive that would work comprehensively, binding all mycotoxins regulated by law."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709341878c28a0473a5b68"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"68","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"233-240","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67124977fdbe836b555fab0a","5e709341878c28a0473a5b68"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research (Poland)","issn":"2450-7393","eissn":"2450-8608","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"5a3ef30a-e992-42a0-a40a-ad7662219310"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mycotoxin","mineral sorbents","mycotoxin binders","feed additives"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059831309"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebee286752340254fc43cdb","name":"Anna","lastName":"Lalak","uuid":"0F0E0A073E080F42474EEAD1E0536C80F7D0E964E36397A33C3A2D8AFB15920D6A559FD9EE66E270645F447AC06EEFCD95C377DAF4C31BCCC4E213EAD022AFC3","documentHash":"2c88e924-b150-4dcc-8689-37bb421c9a8f"},{"objectId":"5e7094e4878c28a0473c62ff","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Skarżyńska","uuid":"BF5F909D80BD570BA26874B18FC1AD54F20352CF1777FA6BCD1870923EE3F3CEF3D0A8BBC56D5065BE239B8AB64379EB520DD667F718A45F88585A0CB7586307","orcidId":"0000-0001-5666-9510","documentHash":"8e423ef0-fc2d-4451-a85e-d3a8480205bc"},{"objectId":"5e70947a878c28a0473be051","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Iwan","uuid":"33EBD3E683475BFA864644AB9D31D706674486A2817D557E595A515BEAD9160F88B67D72626B71F074CBD2524453831E8C210694767640EA1A8E5B72C6A576C6","documentHash":"8cf90178-0faf-4b6b-9b7c-f55797fd2f37"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d6c","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Zając","uuid":"E22B9BA408D67CDB5671F2643034D9593874BD17FE9AC02B2A30001B9B2E4C5298AFCBD87CADFBAB0D79212EB9863263B32F089E9920CBBDC0FFD3ECDCCBC65E","orcidId":"0000-0002-8155-7614","documentHash":"833e52a9-4909-4cd8-935b-275195f84609"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d5c","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Wasyl","uuid":"C5ED1757437A5677E196DA08E4AA40E3BCE245B9A5E1C3A37991653501DAC643CEDB4A1A1EEAA522F34E2F1C4B7C40B294F5E325464AC798E4B89C8E5CB9808B","orcidId":"0000-0002-1068-8414","documentHash":"b1e4ce6d-47cc-4c73-aefe-79b312bb2775"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-08-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"671789ddfdbe83553de9da4a","doi":"10.3390/pathogens13090723","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/13/9/723/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Detection of Salmonella Mbandaka Carrying the blaCTX-M-8 Gene Located on IncI1 Plasmid Isolated from a Broiler Flock Environment","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Salmonella Mbandaka is one of the most globally widespread serovars, occurring in many sources and included among twenty serovars that contribute to human salmonellosis in Europe. In Poland, it has been noted in non-human sources since 1996, being found firstly in feeds and later in waterfowl and chicken. Over the years, it gained epidemiological importance, being isolated from a wide range of animal species, including livestock. Generally, it is characterized by sensitivity to most antimicrobials and the ability to form biofilms. The occurrence of cephalosporin-resistant Salmonella in non-human sources is an extremely rare phenomenon in Poland. In this report, we characterized the full genome of the ESBL-producing S. Mbandaka strain isolated from a broiler farm environment (boot swab sample) in Poland in 2022. The isolate was serotyped as S. Mbandaka according to the White–Kaufmann–Le Minor scheme. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing performed with the microbroth dilution method showed its resistance to ampicillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and nalidixic acid. The whole-genome sequence was reconstructed using short and long reads and assembled into the complete chromosome and three plasmids: IncI1 pST113 (89,439 bp), Col(pHAD28) (2699 bp), and Col440 (2495 bp). The strain belonged to sequence type ST413. Plasmid analysis showed blaCTX-M-8 mobilization on IncI1(alpha) surrounded with insertion sequences. The analyzed genome content draws attention to the possibility of the horizontal spread of the resistance genes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of blaCTX-M-8-positive Salmonella in Poland."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947a878c28a0473be051","5e7094e4878c28a0473c62ff","5ebee286752340254fc43cdb","5e709342878c28a0473a5d6c","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"723","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d6c","5e7094e4878c28a0473c62ff","5ebee286752340254fc43cdb","5e70947a878c28a0473be051","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceac","mniswId":"15767","title":"Pathogens","issn":"2076-0817","eissn":"2076-0817","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0aee51de-2ae0-4570-a31e-61056cf6d598"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66d58589fdbe8351d9238c12","year":"2024","volume":"13","number":"9","documentHash":"e7530d44-01d4-4811-ad27-adf41b518e52"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Salmonella","ESBL","WGS","antimicrobial resistance","poultry"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059844370"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67124d70fdbe836b556005e8","name":"Marian","lastName":"Taulescu","documentHash":"98606d28-632b-4961-9c5b-767aac8ebdf9"},{"objectId":"67124d70fdbe836b556005e7","name":"Cornel","lastName":"Cătoi","documentHash":"787fedce-a5fc-45e1-bc08-9d00fb49d1b6"},{"objectId":"67124d70fdbe836b556005e6","name":"Dumitru","lastName":"Gordon","documentHash":"f2b81f60-6c64-4aad-b9e1-87fbf9516276"},{"objectId":"67124d70fdbe836b556005e5","name":"Andrada","lastName":"Negoescu","documentHash":"1390a329-86a6-467c-85bf-ba02e8d77f82"},{"objectId":"67124d70fdbe836b556005e4","name":"Corina","lastName":"Toma","documentHash":"dbcd1541-e8be-4728-be7c-2c8d44eb018c"},{"objectId":"67124d70fdbe836b556005e3","name":"Dragoș","lastName":"Hodor","documentHash":"acf15099-d60c-4a4c-b893-63d4f4a8b22a"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9","name":"Monika","lastName":"Olech","uuid":"9B0A0406A7EDD36FA4801C73080BC03B173E473705A47493F0C38433544479A4BC660CBD60F16ACD61F83868583404238E4E4A1F03B9A0CA29DCC3BD5AAC93DD","orcidId":"0000-0002-8356-5423","documentHash":"0959a77d-a9cb-4a8e-bec6-b983807c59b8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"SEPTEMBER","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"67124d70fdbe836b556005e1","doi":"10.3389/fvets.2024.1457971","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2024.1457971/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Retroviral coinfection (Jaagsiekte and Maedi-Visna viruses) in sheep with pulmonary tumors in Transylvania (Romania): retrospective study on 82 cases","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma (OPA) is an important viral-induced neoplasia\nin sheep caused by exogenous Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (exJSRV).

Sequence analysis of the highly polymorphic gp60 gene enabled the classification of C. parvum isolates into multiple groups (e.g., IIa, IIc, Id) and a large number of subtypes. In Europe, subtype IIaA15G2R1 is largely predominant and has been associated with many water- and food-borne outbreaks. In this study, we generated new whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from 123 human- and ruminant-derived isolates collected in 13 European countries and included other available WGS data from Europe, Egypt, China, and the United States (n = 72) in the largest comparative genomics study to date. We applied rigorous filters to exclude mixed infections and analyzed a data set from 141 isolates from the zoonotic groups IIa (n = 119) and IId (n = 22). Based on 28,047 high-quality, biallelic genomic SNPs, we identified three distinct and strongly supported populations: Isolates from China (IId) and Egypt (IIa and IId) formed population 1; a minority of European isolates (IIa and IId) formed population 2; and the majority of European (IIa, including all IIaA15G2R1 isolates) and all isolates from the United States (IIa) clustered in population 3. Based on analyses of the population structure, population genetics, and recombination, we show that population 3 has recently emerged and expanded throughout Europe to then, possibly from the United Kingdom, reach the United States, where it also expanded. The reason(s) for the successful spread of population 3 remain elusive, although genes under selective pressure uniquely in this population were identified."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"34","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"877-887","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6712453afdbe836b555f4bc9","6712453afdbe836b555f4bca","6712453afdbe836b555f4bcb","6712453afdbe836b555f4bcc","6712453afdbe836b555f4bcd","6712453afdbe836b555f4bce","6712453afdbe836b555f4bcf","6712453afdbe836b555f4bd0","6712453afdbe836b555f4bd1","6712453afdbe836b555f4bd2","6712453afdbe836b555f4bd3","6712453afdbe836b555f4bd4","6712453afdbe836b555f4bd5","6712453afdbe836b555f4bd6","6712453afdbe836b555f4bd7","6712453afdbe836b555f4bd8","6712453afdbe836b555f4bd9","6712453afdbe836b555f4bda","6712453afdbe836b555f4bdb","6712453afdbe836b555f4bdc","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","6712453afdbe836b555f4bdd","6712453afdbe836b555f4bde","6712453afdbe836b555f4bdf","6712453afdbe836b555f4be0","6712453afdbe836b555f4be1","6712453afdbe836b555f4be2","6712453afdbe836b555f4be3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477de2","mniswId":"7047","title":"Genome Research","issn":"1088-9051","eissn":"1549-5469","documentHash":"e13d39e6-ffd6-47d5-9e62-1d7c819c019d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6712453afdbe836b555f4bc8","year":"2024","volume":"34","number":"6","documentHash":"84552d82-ff63-4900-aabd-347f9396ed50"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cryptosporidium parvum","whole genome","population structure","evolution","combination"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059860854"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67178b63fdbe83553de9f309","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Pomorska-Mól","documentHash":"87d8de88-dfd4-45b4-9a5a-c3f2a1d08dc2"},{"objectId":"67178b63fdbe83553de9f308","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Gogulski","documentHash":"2aaffb20-b31d-40bf-ba86-4c1b3bef51d2"},{"objectId":"67178b63fdbe83553de9f307","name":"Jakub J.","lastName":"Ruszkowski","documentHash":"ce82ada1-d3e5-4b91-9ca8-9880217dd0b7"},{"objectId":"5ebedd26752340254fc424a4","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Opolska","uuid":"F2D203374927E61071F70F279457FCDEFEFE43BE99759D0541924DC75911D6F4794D79CB30CDB551FAF5825A4196644915458A253C5026E78037ED49D228FDE3","documentHash":"53883f6c-5a56-4112-822e-536e165a956c"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0def","name":"Anna","lastName":"Lisowska","uuid":"DACDB5B33E016683B6C3AE247380BF2E5EC908115FAF7C45643A476F1F28A8371F1D6B6411BC388B5BCEC61BDF90732F3C336AD8313EA5CCA4D909A17D46412C","documentHash":"92988d97-a378-4a23-94cb-76d9a9e67f4a"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b5a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Domańska-Blicharz","uuid":"44C5DFE3C33AA49F72079D496E2377ECFB06FF9CECAF80BDDBA1D06D13EA5BC0296FA0DF1BE18E01648F10BC82C3BF11F8D0520B236A22625EBD476B49E108A6","orcidId":"0000-0002-0642-3931","documentHash":"be2eaa91-303e-4813-a127-8bc4b12d6232"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-21","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67178b63fdbe83553de9f306","doi":"10.1186/s12917-024-04277-4","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12917-024-04277-4.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Whole genome characteristics of hedgehog coronaviruses from Poland and analysis of the evolution of the Spike protein for its interspecies transmission potential","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background The hedgehogs have been recently identified as possible reservoir of Middle East respiratory syndrome\ncoronavirus like (MERS-CoV-like). These viruses were classified as a distinct Betacoronavirus erinacei (BCoV-Eri) species\nwithin the MerBCoV-Eriirus subgenus. As coronaviruses are known for their ability to jump between different hosts,\nincluding humans, this can pose a particular threat to people in direct contact with hedgehogs, such as those\nworking at animal asylums. Our previous studies have shown the presence of BCoV-Eri strains in animals collected\nin the wildlife rehabilitation centre. This study aimed to investigate the presence of CoV in subsequent hedgehogs\ncollected from the urban area of Poland and their molecular characteristics.\nResults Monitoring for the presence of coronavirus infection in hedgehogs revealed five positive individuals. The\npresence of BCoV-Eri was found in a total of 20% of animals tested. Our analyses revealed no correlation between\nCoVs positivity and animal health conditions but a higher probability of such infection in juveniles and females.\nThe whole genome of two Polish Hedgehog coronavirus 1 strains were sequenced and compared with available\ncounterparts from European and Asian countries. Phylogenetic analysis showed that both CoV strains formed\ncommon cluster with other similar MerBCoV-Eriirus, but they were also found to be genetically variable and most\nchanges in the S protein were identified. Our analysis revealed that some S protein sites of the Hedgehog coronavirus 1\nstrains evolved under positive selection pressure and of five such sites, three are in the S1 region while the other two\nin the S2 region of the Spike.\nConclusions BCoV-Eri is to some extent prevalent in wildlife asylums in Poland. Given that the S protein of BCoVs-\nEri is highly variable and that some sites of this protein evolve under positive selection pressure, these strains could\npotentially acquire a favourable feature for cross-species transmission. Consequently, the threat to humans working\nin such asylums is particularly high. Adequate biosecurity safeguards, but also human awareness of such risks, are\ntherefore essential."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny -

To date, this parasite has been detected in 38 countries,\nconfirming its worldwide distribution. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of E.\naerophilus in red fox populations from Central Europe and to describe the sequence variations in the\npartial cox1 gene of this parasite recovered from stool samples. An investigation was carried out\nusing 342 samples of red foxes faeces investigated via seminested PCR and coproscopy. PCR results\nconfirmed the presence of E. aerophilus DNA in 230 samples and E. boehmi DNA in 14 samples.\nMolecular analysis of the retrieved sequences revealed 22 haplotypes of E. aerophilus, EaPL1–EaPL22,\nand 4 haplotypes of E. boehmi, EbPL1–EbPL4. Coproscopic examination revealed that eggs of the\nCapillariidae family were most prevalent in all regions, with a mean prevalence of 73%. Furthermore,\nthe following eggs were detected: Taeniidae (21.3%), Toxocara spp. (26.3%), Toxascaris leonina (5.3%),\nTrichuris vulpis (1.5%), trematodes (23.4%), hookworms (2.3%) and Mesocestoides spp. (1.8%).

The oviducts were taken from three hens from each of 10 flocks\nmanifesting clinical signs related to laying. Twenty-two isolates of G. anatis biovar haemolytica collected from the three parts of the reproductive system were identified using MALDI-TOF and molecular methods. The biovar’s resistance to 19 antimicrobial substances was assessed using the disk diffusion (n = 8) and broth microdilution (n = 11) methods. The presence of virulence (gtxA, gyrB, and flfA) and antibiotic resistance (blaROB, aphA, tetB, and tetH) genes was examined using PCR. All the isolates were resistant to four or more classes of antibiotics and were considered multidrug-resistant.\nAll such isolates were resistant to tilmicosin, tylosin, and enrofloxacin, 88.2% were to tetracycline, and 82.4% to vancomycin. The gtxA, gyrB, tetB, and tetH genes were demonstrated. Considering the present prevalence of multidrug resistance among G. anatis biovar haemolytica isolates from laying hen reproductive tracts, surveillance in reproductive flocks is warranted."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"989","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceac","mniswId":"15767","title":"Pathogens","issn":"2076-0817","eissn":"2076-0817","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0aee51de-2ae0-4570-a31e-61056cf6d598"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67330be1fdbe8343db18f54a","year":"2024","volume":"13","number":"11","documentHash":"a1d76460-f2f4-472b-99f7-95301a422b55"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Gallibacterium anatis","oviduct"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059898436"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"673469a2fdbe8361a576e82b","name":"Krzesimir","lastName":"Szymankiewicz","documentHash":"5f966502-9d67-48c3-a217-b926c6526d9d"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e49","name":"Marek","lastName":"Walczak","uuid":"21A80CCFF451C47DAACD79135936ED58DB4B863C7DAFCB2294E5CD3BFF3A4714E6C3DA150586FE86A64E197F08E90074F2171195EC1B4617D33D96798A46B57E","documentHash":"988887b4-5991-42b1-86b7-dcc413c5c96e"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d2b","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Podgórska","uuid":"E3FB69D94109DE92198EBFBF30082B9458237A6355B9B21E100A6D5262E9777DA40BE545D81C14FC07F65384997084D970796E443AA1A69EAC58466E8C2C753D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7608-6926","documentHash":"c4be02d5-d46e-4de6-bfe4-e316c6deb58d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"OCTOBER","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"673469a2fdbe8361a576e82a","doi":"10.3390/ijms252111674","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/21/11674/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Evaluation of β-Actin and Mitochondrial DNA Levels in Determining the Age of Suidae Remains","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"African Swine Fever (ASF) is an infectious disease affecting pigs and wild boars, causing\nsignificant economic losses.

Feed pollution by brominated flame retardants (BFRs) leads to the exposure of animals and consumers of food of animal origin to these substances. The study aimed to assess the concentration of ten PBDE (BDE-28, 47, 49, 99, 100, 138, 153, 154, 183, and 209) congeners and eight nBFRs (TBX, PBT, HBB, PBEB, EH-TBB, BTBPE, BEH-TBPH, and DBDPE) in 59 feed and feed materials from six different feed categories (277/2012/EU). The quantification of analytes was based on isotopic dilution and gas chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS). All 59 feed samples were contaminated with at least one of the analytes. PBDEs and nBFRs were found in 78% and 91% of the samples, respectively. BFR content ranged from 0.18 to 5.87 μg·kg-1 in feed with a 12% moisture content, and the most contaminated category was vegetable oils, followed by fishmeal, feeds for fish, animal fats, and compound feeds for pigs. The least contaminated samples turned out to be compound feeds for chickens. This study confirms the general trend of decreasing PBDE concentrations in fishmeal. In the investigated samples, BDE-47 and BDE-209 contributed the most to the ∑PBDE content. DBDPE, HBB, and PBT contributed the most to the investigated ∑nBFRs. The widespread occurrence of nBFRs in feed seems disturbing because these compounds have replaced PBDEs.

The impact of the presented data is especially significant concerning Poland’s role as one of the leading food producers in the EU. This work aimed to characterize the genomic contents of cephalosporin-resistant Escherichia coli (n = 36) isolated from retail meat to expand the official AMR monitoring reported by EFSA. The ESBL mechanism was predominant (via blaCTX-M-1 and blaSHV-12), with the AmpC-type represented by the blaCMY-2 variant. The strains harbored multiple resistance genes, mainly conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, tetracyclines. In some isolates, virulence factors—including intimin (eae) and its receptor (tir) were detected, indicating significant pathogenic potential. Resistance genes showed a link with IncI1 and IncB/O/K/Z plasmids. Cephalosporinases were particularly linked to ISEc9/ISEc1 (blaCTX-M-1 and blaCMY-2). The association of virulence with mobile elements was less common—mostly with IncF plasmids. The analysis of E. coli isolated from retail meat indicates accumulation of ARGs and their association with various mobile genetic elements, thus increasing the potential for the transmission of resistance across the food chain."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny -

Here, we evaluate the physiological effects of Pb exposure in goats maintained under extensive farming conditions in a non-remediated mining area. We monitored blood, fecal, and milk Pb levels in two groups of goats, pregnant (n = 17) and lactating (n = 24), kept in different enclosures with high soil Pb concentrations (geometric means of 270 and 143 μg/g, respectively) in Sierra Madrona mining district (Spain). We also studied the influence of Pb exposure on the ability to mount a cellular immune response, and on oxidative stress and biochemical biomarkers measured in blood. Blood Pb concentration was higher in pregnant than in lactating goats, but this difference was not observed in fecal Pb concentration. Pb levels in feces and milk concentrations were correlated with those measured in blood, with 11% of milk samples showing Pb concentrations above the maximum level (ML) for Pb in raw milk established by the EU (0.02 μg/g wet weight). Animals with increased blood Pb levels showed reduced concentrations of retinol in plasma, but these Pb levels did not affect the cellular immune response. The stimulation of the cellular immune response in lactating goats was associated with an increase in blood Pb and calcium levels. The reproductive status and age of goats significantly affected several oxidative stress, antioxidants and plasma biochemistry variables. Goats grazing on soils contaminated by past Pb mining activities may be susceptible to detrimental health effects mediated by retinol deficiency. In view of the detected transfer of Pb through milk, special attention should be paid to the food safety of derived products (i.e. cheese)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947e878c28a0473be61c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"363","pagesFromTo":"125240","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6734889ffdbe8361a5797545","6734889ffdbe8361a5797546","6734889ffdbe8361a5797547","6734889ffdbe8361a5797548","5e70947e878c28a0473be61c","6734889ffdbe8361a5797549","6734889ffdbe8361a579754a","6734889ffdbe8361a579754b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b0e","mniswId":"5835","title":"ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION","issn":"0269-7491","eissn":"1873-6424","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"feb1bcde-6ec7-4b98-9624-ea2e81646922"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"671f764bfdbe83222c578ac8","year":"2024","volume":"363","documentHash":"7a31d45a-c678-42ef-8e3c-f501185a4a88"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Metals","Pb","oxidative stress"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059909598"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"673f2ad0fdbe834f4e12bd32","name":"Marta","lastName":"Antas","documentHash":"55e03177-052e-4419-8a50-93503c7a3b37"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9","name":"Monika","lastName":"Olech","uuid":"9B0A0406A7EDD36FA4801C73080BC03B173E473705A47493F0C38433544479A4BC660CBD60F16ACD61F83868583404238E4E4A1F03B9A0CA29DCC3BD5AAC93DD","orcidId":"0000-0002-8356-5423","documentHash":"0959a77d-a9cb-4a8e-bec6-b983807c59b8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-11-18","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"673f2ad0fdbe834f4e12bd31","doi":"10.1186/s12917-024-04364-6","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12917-024-04364-6.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"First report of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) in pigs from Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) are swine coronaviruses belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae.

In this study, 828 serum samples were tested by TGEV/PRCV immunoassay to estimate TGEV and PRCV seroprevalence, while 277 nasal swabs and 221 stool samples were tested by real-time PCR to detect viral RNA. Our results revealed that 2.2% (95% CI 1.2, 3.2) of serum samples were positive for anti-TGEV antibodies, while 12.2% (95% CI 9.8, 14.4) of samples were positive for anti-PRCV antibodies. 2.5% (95% CI 1.5, 2.6) and 5.2% (95% CI 3.7, 6.7) of serum samples were inconclusive for TGEV and PRCV, respectively. RNA of TGEV was not detected in any of the tested samples, while PRCV RNA was detected in 6.22% of samples. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis revealed that all Polish PRCV strains were closely related to European and Korean PRCV strains than to American strains. Some of the Polish PRCV strains have a 672 nt deletion at the same position at the 5’ end of the S gene as other European and Korean PRCV strains, suggesting that they originated from the same precursor. Other Polish PRCV strains had a 690 nt deletion that differed in size and location from any of the known PRCV strains. This may suggest that these Polish PRCVs may have originated from different ancestor. Furthermore, the Polish PRCV strains showed some unique changes in their sequences, which may reflect their evolution. This study is the first report on the prevalence of TGEV/PRCV in pigs from Poland. In addition, this is the first report on the genetic characterization of Polish PRCV strains, which provide new information on PRCV heterogeneity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"20","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["673f2ad0fdbe834f4e12bd32","5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454773ef","mniswId":"2654","title":"BMC Veterinary Research","issn":"1746-6148","eissn":"1746-6148","documentHash":"683390a3-50fd-4f46-8874-f21aaa628b82"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eb1dd7409707216edec964","year":"2024","volume":"20","number":"1","documentHash":"592e060b-24f2-4e25-a25f-44003a56a270"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["TGEV","PRCV","coronaviruses","pig","real-time RT-PCR","sequencing"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059924179"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"673f3282fdbe834f4e13165f","name":"Luc","lastName":"Willems","documentHash":"37ed55fb-70be-48d4-8c71-b1753a67b523"},{"objectId":"673f3282fdbe834f4e13165e","name":"Majeed","lastName":"Jamakhani","documentHash":"58a3d520-7722-4778-8bd1-0dd726eed40d"},{"objectId":"673f3282fdbe834f4e13165d","name":"Lea","lastName":"Vilanova Mañá","documentHash":"9a2aab51-d332-4986-ada1-409534d405ea"},{"objectId":"673f3282fdbe834f4e13165c","name":"Xavier","lastName":"Saintmard","documentHash":"9c817d01-b59e-4666-a090-de1bd64f5b3b"},{"objectId":"673f3282fdbe834f4e13165b","name":"Lorian","lastName":"Gouverneur","documentHash":"60e345fc-eb2d-4f5e-9cd0-8850cf14062e"},{"objectId":"673f3282fdbe834f4e13165a","name":"Jean-Rock","lastName":"Jacques","documentHash":"f7907401-8804-4e1b-bf28-3caf7312faa0"},{"objectId":"673f3282fdbe834f4e131659","name":"Thomas","lastName":"Jouant","documentHash":"4acd07bc-a9e9-4b88-927c-54b4c10ccb41"},{"objectId":"673f3282fdbe834f4e131658","name":"Thomas","lastName":"Joris","documentHash":"b9dcd2ca-6e94-41ca-b5f6-80522b7fd98a"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d33","name":"Michał","lastName":"Reichert","uuid":"4394EEC51A6B6D1F4DFCB1A7C07A5F8A251A042E9BCA371EAAA432AFE6A8EE1872E16213AA074CCC239D3E7A1034FC416FD93B99D94E0730A905E1D770B3DC27","documentHash":"9da7cc50-be87-4406-af94-e5a72d0e6a2e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-11-07","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"673f3282fdbe834f4e131656","doi":"10.1371/journal.ppat.1012659","publicUri":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1012659","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Reduction of antisense transcription affects bovine leukemia virus replication and oncogenesis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In sheep infected with bovine leukemia virus (BLV), transcription of structural, enzymatic, and accessory genes is silenced. However, the BLV provirus transcribes a series of non-coding RNAs that remain undetected by the host immune response. Specifically, three RNAs (AS1-L, AS1-S, and AS2) are consistently expressed from the antisense strand, originating from transcriptional initiation at the 3’-Long Terminal Repeat (LTR). To investigate the role of these non-coding RNAs in viral replication and pathogenesis, a reverse genetics approach was devised, capitalizing on a mechanistic disparity in transcription initiation between the 5’ and 3’ promoters. A two-nucleotide mutation (GG>TA) in the TFIIB-recognition element (BRE) impaired antisense transcription originating from the 3’-LTR. In the context of the provirus, this 2bp mutation significantly diminished the expression of antisense RNAs, while not notably affecting sense transcription. When inoculated to sheep, the mutated provirus was infectious but exhibited reduced replication levels, shedding light on the role of antisense transcription in vivo. In comparison to lymphoid organs in sheep infected with a wild-type (WT) provirus, the mutant demonstrated alterations in both the spatial distribution and rates of cell proliferation in the lymph nodes and the spleen. Analysis through RNA sequencing and RT-qPCR unveiled an upregulation of the Hmcn1/hemicentin-1 gene in B-lymphocytes from sheep infected with the mutated provirus. Further examination via confocal microscopy and immunohistochemistry revealed an increase in the amount of hemicentin-1 protein encoded by Hmcn1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and lymphoid organs of sheep infected with the mutant. RNA interference targeting Hmcn1 expression impacted the migration of ovine kidney (OVK) cells in vitro. In contrast to the WT, the mutated provirus showed reduced oncogenicity when inoculated into sheep. Collectively, this study underscores the essential role of antisense transcription in BLV replication and pathogenicity. These findings may offer valuable insights into understanding the relevance of antisense transcription in the context of human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d33"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"20","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"e1012659","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["673f3282fdbe834f4e131658","673f3282fdbe834f4e131659","673f3282fdbe834f4e13165a","673f3282fdbe834f4e13165b","673f3282fdbe834f4e13165c","673f3282fdbe834f4e13165d","673f3282fdbe834f4e13165e","5e709342878c28a0473a5d33","673f3282fdbe834f4e13165f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792ea","mniswId":"16244","title":"PLoS pathogens","issn":"1553-7366","eissn":"1553-7374","websiteLink":"http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/","documentHash":"cf61c93d-dd64-4c38-9bc3-1bf43ae32bfe"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"673f3282fdbe834f4e131657","year":"2024","volume":"20","number":"11","documentHash":"e36a0fdc-ceda-4d5f-86dc-24c8f6c3c272"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bovine leukemia virus","antisense transcription","replication","oncogenesis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059926896"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d4d","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Stypuła-Trębas","uuid":"A4C00B08AAFF113F9382E6F1759F14020B4CCA7AE30FB660C21B2148E5F3DFDB921233CF246AD5B1793DB9CB511697C8D8E92061019EEFDC031FCFCA4861EDF9","documentHash":"b51c668d-5d65-4c6f-8b81-a19798ca7b19"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b68","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Jedziniak","uuid":"DCD8C61F090FCDB42589ECD4D30BC4F07DF1A48D10CB58D28E1887BBF8E5C91C1A764BCE5DD19D7C91FF78DF169D6B1526C1FC81E50250D50A1EF803542B7CE7","documentHash":"d2888220-8bd1-4995-b8e9-9c4b4e30d1a4"}],"objectId":"673f33a7fdbe834f4e132023","doi":"10.1016/j.toxlet.2024.07.796","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0378427424018757?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"P21-74 Assessment of the (anti)androgenic potential of three organophosphate esters using the recombinant yeast androgen bioassay","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Organophosphate esters (OPEs) are synthetic phosphoric acid derivatives widely used as flame retardants, plasticizers, and lubricants.

The presence of OPEs has been detected in various environmental matrices and biota. Also, the estimated daily intake of the sum of the eight most common OPEs is high, especially in toddlers (1.547 μg/kg b.w./day). Earlier toxicological studies have demonstrated that OPEs can cause various adverse toxic effects, including neurotoxicity, genotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. The risk associated with exposure to OPEs is intensified by the fact that these substances accumulate in adipose tissue, which hinders their rapid metabolism. Recent toxicity tests indicate potential reproductive and developmental toxicity and hormonal activity in humans and animals.

A high protein content, including exogenous amino acids and fat, is a characteristic of all developmental stages of insects. The nutrients found in processed insect protein are influenced by their stage of development, production conditions, and the feed and material used to grow them. The use of insect PAP in the pet food industry is also supported by the evolutionary adaptation of their wild ancestors to collect insects in the natural environment. In diets for pets containing feed material obtained from insects, full-fat or defatted PAP from black fly and mealworm larvae and house cricket imago were most often used. Beside that pasteurised or blanched larvae homogenates can be used as meat substitutes in dry and wet pet food."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63b4f2b975234021979cd519","61de4b397523403b69b1ee0a","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5e","5e709342878c28a0473a5caf"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"28-33","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d5e","61de4b397523403b69b1ee0a","63b4f2b975234021979cd519","5e709342878c28a0473a5caf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b01ba82467f00d53eb1aae","title":"Życie Weterynaryjne","issn":"2299-5641","websiteLink":"https://portal.issn.org/resource/ISSN/2299-5641","documentHash":"58b94e55-3216-4da3-8275-1d2fec0c7469"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67487373fdbe8326827ad7b5","year":"2024","number":"10","documentHash":"6c8e6eb0-a9ea-4367-af4c-b43335748f41"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["owady","odżywianie","PAP"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059965606"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65d7500140970704cae2c39d","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Kuczera","documentHash":"733c3c77-5883-41a3-a52c-12ed98adf308"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a660f","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Frant","uuid":"2AD73901C2B1BDDF66264197B4E2A40BB43C9F170B0D3D9252C79378D973DED6BA0DD7DB0E3F16FB50489E4717CA62BAE671805ED94AD0C5F9B3478EE3C561FE","orcidId":"0000-0002-7169-3735","documentHash":"b81b59e2-56af-4ed2-bfbe-bdf26cc5f824"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d5b","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Trębas","uuid":"885CCAC8AC667AF8F582B5915360E1D4F4E7323F2726CB9E438E293E06CD7E4408BBD732C34ED6B8FC5794227C0F8D2EEFD9D896825809D9265D1CF510497CF8","documentHash":"715908ba-b083-4b9d-8237-8eb5a6670919"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d46","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Smreczak","uuid":"F8B30A918C22AAD1AA7AE9C5D3FFDA47CF609511E7B465B3BCBAF192AC2D6E73CBFF8ADD21B9DEBE21AC0F4F803AD82290024E1D251CA1FB5298A962E7B5045D","documentHash":"0eb77885-82a5-455a-bf63-fa54b05c12cc"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d34","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Rola","uuid":"CA7CCA550D77B38C39C512D0BF1E1DD989B16A76C798CB003E76583649A413F1CC14D38A1D3A86639806ABD695B555AEFBBA4519ACEEB3448008E1F7F45415DE","documentHash":"9968525a-6722-4aa3-9451-1d6ca31f42fa"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Orłowska","uuid":"31BF3815E53225FB0CCBD915D008C5800C01531C4DF23A9161299EACAECAACC43C5DEA5344E221B38BC386F46E015ADAD2196E2D56A8455B3D8E58853C8AB669","documentHash":"55bf4618-fd65-42f2-b46f-274ea3353e1c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"JANUARY","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"65d7500140970704cae2c39c","doi":"10.3390/v16010080","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/16/1/80/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Prevalence of Astroviruses in Different Animal Species in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Astroviruses (AstVs) are small RNA viruses characterized by a high mutation rate, the ability to recombine, and interspecies transmission, which allows them to infect a multitude of hosts including humans, companion animals, and farmed animals as well as wildlife. AstVs are stable in the environment, and their transmission is usually through the fecal–oral route or via contaminated water and food. Although direct zoonotic transmission was not confirmed, interspecies transmission events have occurred or have been indicated to occur in the past between wild and domestic animals and humans. They cause large economic losses, mainly in the poultry sector, due to gastroenteritis and mortality. In young children, they are the second most common cause of diarrhea. This study involved 166 intestine samples and pools of spleen, lymph node, and kidney samples collected from 352 wild animals, 52 pigs, and 31 companion animals. Astroviruses were detected in the intestine samples and were separately detected in pools of tissue samples prepared for individual animals using a heminested RT-PCR protocol. Amplicons were subjected to Sanger sequencing, and a phylogenetic analysis of 320 nt RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) fragments referring to known nt sequences of astroviruses was performed. Astroviral RNA was detected in the intestine samples and/or tissue pools of red foxes (nine positive intestines and six positive tissue pools), rats (two positive intestines and three positive tissue pools), a cat (one AstV detected in an intestine sample), pigs (eight positive tissue pools), and wild boars (two positive pools of spleens, kidneys, and lymph nodes). No astroviral RNA was detected in wild mustelids, dogs, or other small wild animals including rodents. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that the astroviruses detected during this study were mostly host-specific, such as porcine, canine, and rat astroviruses that were highly homologous to the sequences of reference strains. In one of two wild boars, an AstV distinct to porcine species was found with the highest nt identity to Avastroviruses, i.e., turkey astroviruses, which suggests potential cross-species transmission of the virus, as previously described. Here, we present the first detection of astroviruses in the population of wild animals, companion animals, and pigs in Poland, confirming that astroviruses are frequent pathogens circulating in animals in the field. Our study also suggests potential cross-species transmission of Avaastrovirus to wild boars; however, further molecular characterization is needed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cc4","5e709342878c28a0473a5d34","5e709342878c28a0473a5d46","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5b","5e709347878c28a0473a660f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"80","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65d7500140970704cae2c39d","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc4","5e709342878c28a0473a5d46","5e709347878c28a0473a660f","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5b","5e709342878c28a0473a5d34"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a80","mniswId":"20156","title":"Viruses","issn":"1999-4915","eissn":"1999-4915","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses","documentHash":"204f8987-0c7c-441b-9f4a-748747147d4e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65a77aca4097071e0b852901","year":"2024","volume":"16","number":"1","documentHash":"08b1f6fa-f27f-4a3f-8ae3-6ecf74fdadf2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["astroviruses","wildlife","companion animals","pigs","prevalence","phylogenetic relationships"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060197797"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709486878c28a0473bef2a","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kiljanek","uuid":"7B8EE9A0E65E07520912836B1EE79CA197A21E4DC1CD1DF337A2F539C881566E8B7ED89405D31A6EE523CE4147368897A0A0017AD0DF9642E78CCFE22BEB224A","orcidId":"0000-0001-7222-0983","documentHash":"15e05adf-9642-4726-8587-72bd29897624"}],"objectId":"65d85d3a4097071e545e90d1","doi":"10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.140748","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0045653523030187?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Application of 3D-printed pollen traps as a useful tool for exposure and risk assessment of pesticide residues on bumblebees","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The study was designed to test the feasibility of using 3D-printed pollen traps for long-term monitoring of Bombus terrestris colonies' exposure to pesticide residues in pollen loads collected by them, along with an assessment of the resulting risks to the bumblebee's adults, larvae, and queens. Bumblebee colonies were placed in the vicinity of flowering orchards, winter oilseed rape, allotments, or home gardens for 6 weeks of the experiment. Pollen traps printed in 3D technology were installed in the hive inlets. The weight of bumblebee pollen loads obtained using pollen traps was in the range of 0.036–5.83 g. Pollen load samples were analyzed for residues of up to 261 pesticides and their metabolites by liquid and gas chromatography techniques coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS). Residues of 18 fungicides, 12 herbicides, 6 insecticides, and an acaricide were detected. Herbicide – pendimethalin, fungicide – thiophanate-methyl, and insecticide – chlorpyrifos-ethyl were the most commonly detected pesticides. Chlorpyrifos and thiacloprid residues were detected in pollen load samples in the next year after their ban from use as plant protection products in the European Union. The risk of acute or chronic effects was assessed as negligible or low, although the chronic risk of bumblebee queens to insecticide chlorpyrifos and the acute risk of larvae exposed to acaricide fenpyroximate could be interpreted as moderate. The risk of sublethal effects related to chronic exposure of adult bumblebees and queens to pollen loads contaminated by chlorpyrifos-ethyl and cypermethrin cannot be excluded. The risk of chronic toxicity or sublethal effects may be particularly relevant for bumblebee queens, especially during their foraging in the initial period of establishing a new colony."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709486878c28a0473bef2a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"348","pagesFromTo":"140748","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709486878c28a0473bef2a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775f8","mniswId":"3525","title":"CHEMOSPHERE","issn":"0045-6535","documentHash":"ca7a4227-9b2a-46cb-a2a2-53056fa5e040"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65d483e54097074f2860d72f","year":"2024","volume":"348","documentHash":"98e3ca31-52a1-411a-8058-8d9d81ee2950"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Pesticide residues","Pollen","Bumblebees","Bees","Risk assessment","Pesticide exposure"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060197810"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709437878c28a0473b83ce","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Wasiak","uuid":"A60741B2F6C44684B8210C6BD88CE38D65085F1FEA69C024C4C683AD43FB6C5E3603FFD8A7EA6613888E258108EABBC0F2F5DA5B9D13E30D9BFCFA81627948F0","orcidId":"0000-0002-2279-5460","documentHash":"afe435e4-1c3d-46e2-8a2a-f6b817d9bd81"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d4f","name":"Maria","lastName":"Szczotka","uuid":"ADF16A0DC33C7E23F46E1C620BBE349C2AB6A18A9C9909107A228536F5F1742277D154D2DCD82C6537D2A8632E5C4391955675EADA516AAA2CDFD89BA5D564C5","documentHash":"ebfccb1f-95d9-4d87-86f7-3bbcd1ac8dd1"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cad","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Kuźmak","uuid":"DCBC0C5773B0C346D5DBB40E3262D8E29184B62793C0D18E82B24E595E4F33FDCB74C41AEC4D6B60F253051482EC522138B936B5ED82B4345F33391A0BD19DAB","documentHash":"b123658e-4d9a-4155-9ddf-df23aa13556a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":1,"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"MAY","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"67124081fdbe836b555ec6ec","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2024-0031","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2024-0031","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Extracellular vesicles in cattle infected with bovine leukaemia virus: isolation and molecular analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Exosomes are nanosized lipid bilayer membranous microvesicles, extracellularly released from a variety of mammalian cells. They mediate intercellular signalling by transporting several types of RNA, lipids and proteins and participate in the intercellular exchange of DNA, RNA, micro RNA, proteins and other components. These microvesicles are present in all body fluids in physiological and pathological conditions and reflect the state of the host organism. The aim of the study was the isolation and molecular determination of exosomes in blood and supernatant fluids of bovine dendritic cell cultures infected with bovine leukaemia virus (BLV). Material and Methods: Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation from the blood sera, plasma and supernatant of bovine BLV-infected and uninfected control dendritic cell cultures and their presence was confirmed with scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy. Western blot analysis of the structural BLV glycoprotein 51 (Env) and protein 24 (Gag) and of the tetraspanin exosomal markers CD9, CD63 and flotillin-1 was undertaken in BLV+ and control BLV− cattle. Results: In exosomes of leukaemic cattle both BLV proteins and exosomal markers were detected. In healthy control animals only exosomal markers were determined.

Based on\nclassification established in the early 1990s, four variants of the rabies virus have been distinguished in Europe. Rabies broke out\nin January 2021 in the Mazowieckie voivodeship in central north-eastern Poland. The virus spread rapidly, reaching\nthe Świętokrzyskie voivodeship in the central southern part and the Lubelskie voivodeship in the eastern part in the next months.\nNine rabies cases were reported in the Podkarpackie voivodeship in south-eastern Poland between 2021 and 2023, mainly in red\nfoxes but also in dogs and wildcat. The aim of the study was the identification of RABV variants in wildlife and domestic animals\nin Poland between 2021 and 2023. Material and Methods: The study involved 157 animal brains tested positive for rabies using\na fluorescent antibody test. From 10% w/v brain homogenates, RNA was isolated and full-length RABV genomes were high-\nthroughput sequenced with an RABV-enriched approach. Complete genomes of RABV isolates were phylogenetically analysed\nand the variants were estimated. Results: Molecular and phylogenetic studies revealed 147 (93.6%) of the RABV strains out of\n157 which had rapidly spread in the wildlife of the Mazowieckie, Świętokrzyskie and Lubelskie voivodeships to be Central\nEuropean strains. Nine RABVs (5.7%) detected in foxes, a wildcat and a dog in the Podkarpackie voivodeship were identified\nas North-Eastern European. A vaccine-induced rabies case was detected in a red fox in the Lubelskie voivodeship in May 2023.\nConclusion: Central European and North-Eastern European RABVs were circulating in Poland between 2021 and 2023."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cc4","5e709342878c28a0473a5d46"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"68","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"175-180","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["671242e5fdbe836b555f151a","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc4","5e709342878c28a0473a5d46"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research","issn":"2450-7393","eissn":"2450-7393","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"33675167-d910-4a5c-a5d1-cd68fbd86b10"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["rabies","North-Eastern European RABV","central European RABV","vaccine-induced"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198190"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65d75f8240970704cae507c6","name":"Maxim","lastName":"Petropavlovskiy","documentHash":"70be8819-0229-47c8-9cd4-4d257a5ed217"},{"objectId":"65d75f8240970704cae507c5","name":"Irina","lastName":"Donnik","documentHash":"7bd63f18-1d1a-4b35-ba1a-f89c119fa168"},{"objectId":"65d75f8240970704cae507c4","name":"Federico G.","lastName":"Hoffmann","documentHash":"de65dd8c-ac6d-4ab4-9f66-16ea22d7bb5b"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e1b","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Pluta","uuid":"91975BFAA2B6AEF2FF5BB4DEA817EBA26623D681235A7191700469223EF5B63B27AFA98CDCCC89D48001C5D5EBD9300C9381AA573EDC8D9F32289CCCAB02BCD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-6860-4474","documentHash":"80412959-96c7-497b-934f-aa97eacc6599"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d36","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Rola-Łuszczak","uuid":"EEB52DFEBBC4DD2F08F3D378F3270B2F075B37ACEE7131C551552A6E6DF0DBEBB71870E64B035B60AF49A8A2DB582875540F757D9068F8C17BD08F4089965F5D","orcidId":"0000-0003-3209-3427","documentHash":"185700e3-69a6-4527-9d1c-e6158a50f4a5"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cad","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Kuźmak","uuid":"DCBC0C5773B0C346D5DBB40E3262D8E29184B62793C0D18E82B24E595E4F33FDCB74C41AEC4D6B60F253051482EC522138B936B5ED82B4345F33391A0BD19DAB","documentHash":"b123658e-4d9a-4155-9ddf-df23aa13556a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"FEBRUARY","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"65d75f8240970704cae507c2","doi":"10.3390/pathogens13020178","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/13/2/178/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Genetic Variability of Bovine Leukemia Virus: Evidence of Dual Infection, Recombination and Quasi-Species","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Abstract\nWe have characterized the intrahost genetic variation in the bovine leukemia virus (BLV) by examining 16 BLV isolates originating from the Western Siberia–Tyumen and South Ural–Chelyabinsk regions of Russia.

Regardless of the fact that the overwhelming majority of previous research works dealing with gastric ulceration in pigs focused on the role of the nutritional determinants, including chemical composition of feeds, cereal type, finely ground pelleted diets, and feed additives, conclusions presented therein remain highly ambiguous. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the disease on production performance, and investigate the influence of selected non-dietary risk factors on the prevalence of gastric alterations in finishing pigs reared under conditions of 11 modern farms located in Poland.\r\nResults\r\nA total number of 26,043 finishing pigs was examined. 15,228 (58.47%) had gastric ulcers. Intact stomachs were detected in 6176 animals (23.71%). Parakeratosis and erosion were observed in 2551 (9.80%) and 2088 (8.02%), respectively. Among eight continuous variables two were found to be significantly associated with prevalence of the gastric ulcer: the growing number of animals in the herd, which was negatively correlated (P = 0.002; ρ = -0.37), and the growing average entry weight of animals transported to the finisher farm (P = 0.047; ρ = 0.24), which increased the risk of gastric ulcers prevalence. Among 12 nominal variables, problems with the quality of farm management (P = 0.041), and usage of straw as a bedding material (P = 0.002) were identified as determinants significantly associated with occurrence of the analysed health problem.\r\nConclusions\r\nAmong 20 non-nutritional variables analysed in our study only few factors were found to be associated with the prevalence of the disease. The impact of broadly understood management issues on gastric health in finishing pigs deserves further research."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cb1"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"1-9","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6681afc9fdbe83464abe2c2e","5e709307878c28a0473a17a4","5e709342878c28a0473a5cb1","5e709341878c28a0473a5b65","5e70934f878c28a0473a6e5e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547cf64","mniswId":"16389","title":"Porcine Health Management","issn":"2055-5660","eissn":"2055-5660","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"9555b120-941d-4686-b8f4-75335bdca5bc"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Pigs","Finishers","Gastric ulcers","Risk factors","Production parameters","Farm management"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198504"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d4f","name":"Maria","lastName":"Szczotka","uuid":"ADF16A0DC33C7E23F46E1C620BBE349C2AB6A18A9C9909107A228536F5F1742277D154D2DCD82C6537D2A8632E5C4391955675EADA516AAA2CDFD89BA5D564C5","documentHash":"ebfccb1f-95d9-4d87-86f7-3bbcd1ac8dd1"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cad","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Kuźmak","uuid":"DCBC0C5773B0C346D5DBB40E3262D8E29184B62793C0D18E82B24E595E4F33FDCB74C41AEC4D6B60F253051482EC522138B936B5ED82B4345F33391A0BD19DAB","documentHash":"b123658e-4d9a-4155-9ddf-df23aa13556a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":2,"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"MARCH","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"665ef2304097073a8240b6c5","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2024-0012","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2024-0012","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Cytokine secretion in stem cells of cattle infected with bovine leukaemia virus","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) is a Deltaretrovirus responsible for enzootic bovine leukosis, the most common neoplastic disease of cattle. It deregulates the immune system, favouring secondary infections and changes in the blood and lymphatic tissues. Blood homeostasis depends on functional haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Bone marrow is populated by these cells, which express CD34+ and CD35+ surface antigens and produce and release cytokines involved in the maintenance of haematopoiesis. The aim of the study was determination of the profile of cytokine production by CD34+ stem cells of cattle naturally infected with BLV. Material and Methods: The HSCs were generated from the blood and lymphoid organs of cows infected with BLV and healthy control cows with immunomagnetic separation and anti-CD34+ monoclonal antibodies. Isolated CD34+ cells were cultivated for two weeks with interleukin (IL)-4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were determined in culture fluid by flow cytometry. Results: The expression of IL-6, IL-12p70 and TNF-α in blood HSCs was higher in BLV+ cows than in the control animals. In bone marrow HSCs of infected cows, IL-12, TNF-α and IFN-γ were more concentrated, but in these cows’ spleen HSCs only expression of IL-10 was elevated. In HSCs isolated from the lymph nodes of leukaemic cows, only TNF-α secretion was lower than in control cows, the other cytokines being more potently secreted. Conclusion: Infection with BLV caused statistically significant differences in cytokine expression by HSC CD34+ cells.\nKeywords: bovine leukaemia virus (BLV), stem cells CD34+, cytokines, flow cytometry."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cad","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"68","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"19-33","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d4f","5e709342878c28a0473a5cad"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebffdcead49b31ccece4fb3","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research","issn":"2450-8608","documentHash":"287fa6d2-77d3-4359-b58d-23d047d5d8d7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66179b27409707791fcbd7da","year":"2024","volume":"68","number":"1","documentHash":"695a3039-005c-4a80-8a7f-9d491b7d2271"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bovine luukaemia","cytokines","flow cytometry"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198525"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6661772d409707458fb21ea5","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Pomorska-Mól","documentHash":"a4025aca-8ee4-4ab3-a7a3-aa8ae7750cd6"},{"objectId":"6661772d409707458fb21ea4","name":"Michał K.","lastName":"Krzysiak","documentHash":"13712243-cd60-4664-b6c5-f1dbe98db594"},{"objectId":"6661772d409707458fb21ea3","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Tomana","documentHash":"7e4e5514-b2c0-4134-9dee-81f9b2a7d556"},{"objectId":"5e7093ed878c28a0473b36c5","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Socha","uuid":"6036D7D79FB2FDA007337AD74DA8CE2A06BA94CA316C1481598BAB1EEA1C0EB837183E2A083D8667A9FABD63781EA3F34A131ABDDF2FAE34F4D7B3042BA7CD76","documentHash":"cf42920a-12a6-4167-a84a-a72b77b3acc1"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cb1","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Larska","uuid":"B141F329FCEAE537CBBD403DB20EF5682F61733751D3074FAE52498A02662E8A698C6E4BB506A212CBCAAD49E882CE3BC8B3B325375745B32F8A6A5A8D07E028","documentHash":"59dda705-be56-4ee7-9d4e-6b4b6bc19fd5"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"JUNE","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"6661772d409707458fb21ea2","doi":"10.1038/s41598-024-63717-1","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-63717-1.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Prevalence of coronaviruses in European bison (Bison bonasus) in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Coronaviruses have been confirmed to infect a variety of species, but only one case of associated winter dysentery of European bison has been described. The study aimed to analyze the prevalence, and define the impact on the species conservation, the source of coronavirus infection, and the role of the European bison in the transmission of the pathogen in Poland. Molecular and serological screening was performed on 409 European bison from 6 free-ranging and 14 captive herds over the period of 6 years (2017–2023). Presence of coronavirus was confirmed in one nasal swab by pancoronavirus RT-PCR and in 3 nasal swab samples by bovine coronavirus (BCoV) specific real time RT-PCR. The detected virus showed high (> 98%) homology in both RdRp and Spike genes to BCoV strains characterised recently in Polish cattle and strains isolated from wild cervids in Italy. Antibodies specific to BCoV were found in 6.4% of tested samples, all originating from free-ranging animals. Seroprevalence was higher in adult animals over 5 years of age (p = 0.0015) and in females (p = 0.09). Our results suggest that European bison play only a limited role as reservoirs of bovine-like coronaviruses.

To control them, feed additives are used, which limit the absorption of mycotoxins in the gastrointestinal\ntract of animals by binding to them. The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a new in vitro model in experiments on the\nbinding of mycotoxins from buffers and contaminated feed and to confirm the effect of a single sorbent or mixture in binding them.\nMaterial and Methods: Nine mineral sorbents were tested for their efficiency binding eight mycotoxins. Two in vitro experiments\nwere conducted to indicate the mycotoxin-binding capacity of sorbents, each specifying a buffer with one of two different pH levels\nreflecting gastrointestinal conditions (pH 3.5 and 7.0). The first investigated the sorbent with only the buffer and mycotoxin\nstandards, while the second did so with the sorbent, buffer and feed naturally contaminated with mycotoxins (deoxynivalenol,\nzearalenone, and ochratoxin A). Results: The sorption was significantly lower in the trial with feed. In the first experiment\nat gastric pH (pH 3.5), activated charcoal bound deoxynivalenol and sepiolite bound zearalenone at 70% and 96%, respectively,\nwhereas in the second experiment with feed, the binding was only 3% and 6%. Conclusion: The study underlines the challenge of\nfinding a feed additive that would work comprehensively, binding all mycotoxins regulated by law."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d34","5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d5a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"1 - 13","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d5a","5e709342878c28a0473a5d34"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a80","mniswId":"20156","title":"Viruses","issn":"1999-4915","eissn":"1999-4915","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses","documentHash":"204f8987-0c7c-441b-9f4a-748747147d4e"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["equine rhinitis viruses","ERAV","ERBV","horses","sequence analysis","haplotype network"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060264919"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61de4b387523403b69b1ede5","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Kozak","uuid":"6C6339291E2BECD20F431B01A11391B60AD18EB7FECAAD063113E658D35369673736F3CBFE7932F696194858EF3025C0EE1F928DDCD08430A56CF9CDD8DC95F2","documentHash":"ef6ed37e-eaeb-49c6-868b-85594ebef247"},{"objectId":"60c3345c9543c723365440d4","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Dziadek","uuid":"45A7FB5A1FD2C927BD37AF9634B24CF95C6C5A402E27C7492A21AEFB7FD8FAE656D7B87C54B97098F162EFA9324EAABBDFE8EFD47CC0AB7435FDB60B944D1845","documentHash":"866d0380-8a74-4b4e-8596-7df5ba9b4d33"},{"objectId":"608a91789543c73526c48c75","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Styś-Fijoł","uuid":"18953671ADAF7EFBEFDD8CC6D7C0ADF412475CD61FBF7A3AEA3F313BD45A5DC3299CE20DAECC4C6A3A20A49CA92ABE51904672A45817502AD0CDBE61FCF6E600","documentHash":"751feae2-867c-4ecc-9595-719b2a8f22f2"},{"objectId":"5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d65","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Świętoń","uuid":"B1451330EBBF3BBF864C6C29ECAB990B8FD8C6E55EB7CC80EED09C3919984400B4DFBF6AA1E5E9E1649048ECC8A1F8E50BEF61772AC319511EF184E34E6AE896","orcidId":"0000-0002-1571-3279","documentHash":"86144e2c-49d5-48c0-85fe-730dbc29a78d"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e54","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Wyrostek","uuid":"FC1F09260F07424DA4AC78D7A4F89433CF76A1110DC789EEA15E08F3EA26403BE4781835ABBB6B989637CC38D3073CD4C0E3DFDD544E10C8477AFFBE83ED3068","documentHash":"f225105a-d3b2-4acf-9e0b-5fa35e3883e2"},{"objectId":"5e70947a878c28a0473be059","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Tarasiuk","uuid":"5294C817CF66234F410C3490D55F53308E7039E81C0AB7B8A2DF44056395AF538BC80403AACB252521179D161FC47BE78551952AFC111FC603D852E2CE0A57B6","documentHash":"adabe201-805f-4f3c-bc1b-6370b267c950"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d58","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Śmietanka","uuid":"0C6A332B0C5346DE004374A65243BBDAE82F9030869912A6C9AA7EDF21BAE52DC03930A036188BF9DADB88EF3FB6A05E4846CBA6C8F206183182FE03FD7CD9C1","documentHash":"68761bee-b0dd-4744-a52b-e925fd08efa9"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"APRIL","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"663b46094097070c4ce371b2","doi":"10.1155/2024/6661672","publicUri":"http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/tbed/2024/6661672.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Phylogenetic and Molecular Characteristics of Wild Bird-Origin Avian Influenza Viruses Circulating in Poland in 2018−2022: Reassortment, Multiple Introductions, and Wild Bird–Poultry Epidemiological Links","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Since 2020, a significant increase in the severity of H5Nx highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) epidemics in poultry and wild birds has been observed in Poland. To further investigate the genetic diversity of HPAI H5Nx viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b, HPAIV-positive samples collected from dead wild birds in 2020–2022 were phylogenetically characterized. In addition, zoonotic potential and possible reassortment between HPAIVs and LPAIVs circulating in the wild avifauna in Poland have been examined. The genome-wide phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of three different avian influenza virus (AIV) subtypes (H5N8, H5N5, and H5N1) during the HPAI 2020/2021 season, while in the next HPAI 2021/2022 epidemic only one H5N1 subtype encompassing seven various genotypes (G1–G7) was confirmed. No reassortment events between LPAIVs (detected in the framework of active surveillance) and HPAIVs circulating in Poland have been captured, but instead, epidemiological links between wild birds and poultry due to bidirectional, i.e., wild bird-to-poultry and poultry-to-wild bird HPAIV transmission were evident. Furthermore, at least five independent H5N8 HPAIV introductions into the Baltic Sea region related to unprecedented mass mortality among swans in February–March 2021 in Poland, as well as a general tendency of current H5Nx viruses to accumulate specific mutations associated with the ability to break the interspecies barrier were identified. These results highlight the importance of continuous active and passive surveillance for AI to allow a rapid response to emerging viruses."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut

virus (BLV) is the etiological agent of enzootic bovine leukosis and causes a persistent infection that can leave cattle with no symptoms. Many countries have been able to successfully eradicate BLV through improved detection and management methods. However, with the increasing novel molecular detection methods there have been few efforts to standardize these results at global scale. This study aimed to determine the interlaboratory accuracy and agreement of 11 molecular tests in detecting BLV. Each qPCR/ddPCR method varied by target gene, primer design, DNA input and chemistries. DNA samples were extracted from blood of BLV-seropositive cattle and lyophilized to grant a better preservation during shipping to all participants around the globe. Twenty nine out of 44 samples were correctly identified by the 11 labs and all methods exhibited a diagnostic sensitivity between 74 and 100%. Agreement amongst different assays was linked to BLV copy numbers present in samples and the characteristics of each assay (i.e., BLV target sequence). Finally, the mean correlation value for all assays was within the range of strong correlation. This study highlights the importance of continuous need for standardization and harmonization amongst assays and the different participants. The results underscore the need of an international calibrator to estimate the efficiency (standard curve) of the different assays and improve quantitation accuracy. Additionally, this will inform future participants about the variability associated with emerging chemistries, methods, and technologies used to study BLV. Altogether, by improving tests performance worldwide it will positively aid in the eradication efforts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut

2016, A(H5Nx) high pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus of clade 2.3.4.4b has become one of the most serious global threats not only to wild and domestic birds, but also to public health. In recent years, important changes in the ecology, epidemiology, and evolution of this virus have been reported, with an unprecedented global diffusion and variety of affected birds and mammalian species. After the two consecutive and devastating epidemic waves in Europe in 2020–2021 and 2021–2022, with the second one recognized as one of the largest epidemics recorded so far, this clade has begun to circulate endemically in European wild bird populations. This study used the complete genomes of 1,956 European HPAI A(H5Nx) viruses to investigate the virus evolution during this varying epidemiological outline. We investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of A(H5Nx) virus diffusion to/from and within Europe during the 2020–2021 and 2021–2022 epidemic waves, providing evidence of ongoing changes in transmission dynamics and disease epidemiology. We demonstrated the high genetic diversity of the circulating viruses, which have undergone frequent reassortment events, providing for the first time a complete overview and a proposed nomenclature of the multiple genotypes circulating in Europe in 2020–2022. We described the emergence of a new genotype with gull adapted genes, which offered the virus the opportunity to occupy new ecological niches, driving the disease endemicity in the European wild bird population. The high propensity of the virus for reassortment, its jumps to a progressively wider number of host species, including mammals, and the rapid acquisition of adaptive mutations make the trend of virus evolution and spread difficult to predict in this unfailing evolving scenario."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy

use in agriculture as rich sources of nutrients for plants. The aim of this study was to determine the microbiological contamination of sewage sludge and digestate to assess their safe use as fertilizers in Poland. The assessment of microbial soil, sewage sludge and digestate contamination was based on the total number of mesophilic bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae family. The presence of Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. was identified via culture and the presence of Enterobacteriaceae species was determined via biochemical and molecular methods. In laboratory conditions, the survival of E. coli in soil fertilized with sewage sludge or digestate inoculated with a reference strain was determined. The average concentration of Enterobacteriaceae in soil, sewage sludge and digestate samples was 1.1 × 104 CFU/g, 9.4 × 105 CFU/g and 5.6 × 106 CFU/g, respectively. Escherichia coli was detected in all sample types. From the soil samples, Serratia, Enterobacter, Pantoea, Citrobacter and Pseudomonas genera were identified the most frequently, while in sewage sludge and digestate, E. coli was predominant. Based on the results of our laboratory experiment, it can be concluded that after three weeks, fertilization with organic waste in acceptable doses does not significantly increase soil contamination with Enterobacteriaceae."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","uid":"boRt8XbJIJxFX3j3lPkVVng","uuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","name":"Instytut Uprawy Nawożenia i Gleboznawstwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709225878c28a0473909e7","5e70929f878c28a04739963c","5e70929c878c28a0473992a0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","parentUuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","rootUuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee5","uid":"bhxR2mGn694vtlivBJujwBw","uuid":"17d23c12-1f2d-4a37-aae2-bb95ac9ee3dd","name":"Instytut Medycyny Wsi im.

It seems that molecular mechanisms underlying many neurodegenerative disorders may have common features. In a short amount of time, proteomics underwent unprecedented development from its early stages of collecting high numbers of protein identifications in a single experiment. Quantitative mass spectrometry of proteins is now a standard approach in many laboratories. However, analytical techniques based on the principles of liquid chromatography are dominating and advancing the field. Further technological developments such as single-cell analysis, next-generation proteomics, or proteogenomics will further facilitate a more precise view of changes occurring in proteomes resulting from alterations in biological systems. Another big step will be to go beyond slowing down or stopping neurodegenerative processes and push the immune system to repair damage and promote regeneration. To what extent this is possible and how soon it can be accomplished remains an open question. It is certain, however, that understanding functions of complex biological systems, such as duality of neurotoxic/neurotrophic function of mononuclear phagocytes in the brain during inflammation, will require coordinated monitoring of a large number of parameters simultaneously and well-designed proteomic, genomic, and neuro-imaging experiments."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy

pollinators have been linked to a range of causative factors such as disease, loss of habitats, the quality and availability of food, and exposure to pesticides. Here, we analysed an extensive dataset generated from pesticide screening of foraging insects, pollen-nectar stores/beebread, pollen and ingested nectar across three species of bees collected at 128 European sites set in two types of crop. In this paper, we aimed to (i) derive a new index to summarise key aspects of complex pesticide exposure data and (ii) understand the links between pesticide exposures depicted by the different matrices, bee species and apple orchards versus oilseed rape crops. We found that summary indices were highly correlated with the number of pesticides detected in the related matrix but not with which pesticides were present. Matrices collected from apple orchards generally contained a higher number of pesticides (7.6 pesticides per site) than matrices from sites collected from oilseed rape crops (3.5 pesticides), with fungicides being highly represented in apple crops. A greater number of pesticides were found in pollen-nectar stores/beebread and pollen matrices compared with nectar and bee body matrices. Our results show that for a complete assessment of pollinator pesticide exposure, it is necessary to consider several different exposure routes and multiple species of bees across different agricultural systems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny -

The clinical form of the disease manifests itself in ulcerative skin lesions, which lead to significant weakening of the fish and, in most cases, result in their death. This study was carried out on samples taken from sea trout in the Słupia River in northern Poland. In order to identify the pathogen, experiments on the transmission of the disease were carried out, and additional histopathological, microbiological and electron microscopic examinations were performed. As a result of these studies, it was possible to experimentally transfer the disease from sick to healthy fish. The results indicate a complex etiology of the disease (lack of a clearly defined pathogen), in which the change in the environment from salty to freshwater triggers the related changes in skin physiology, which are the main causes of increased susceptibility to the development of the disease"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d33","5e70947c878c28a0473be308","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0df2","5e709342878c28a0473a5cb8","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c2","5e709486878c28a0473bef46","5e709437878c28a0473b83ce","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"251","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cb8","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4b","5e709486878c28a0473bef46","5e709437878c28a0473b83ce","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c2","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0df2","5e70947c878c28a0473be308","5e709342878c28a0473a5d33"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceac","mniswId":"15767","title":"Pathogens","issn":"2076-0817","eissn":"2076-0817","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0aee51de-2ae0-4570-a31e-61056cf6d598"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6601271c4097070f89e2c52e","year":"2024","volume":"13","number":"3","documentHash":"166e446f-c6f7-4a3e-9c01-3ea45a427074"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pathogenesis","pathology","salmonids","skin lesions","spawning migration"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060302158"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d5a","name":"Karol","lastName":"Stasiak","uuid":"7EA0875FDFBBD4034C5027D66970D3C2D9A8850BD158F9472443B7DABFD45B08FB429A607037AF4487297F459A4A3B6F5772A86A7985AE521894506A0242AD8A","orcidId":"0000-0001-8795-594X","documentHash":"a71c4ffa-56a4-45de-914a-b97a57dde84d"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d34","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Rola","uuid":"CA7CCA550D77B38C39C512D0BF1E1DD989B16A76C798CB003E76583649A413F1CC14D38A1D3A86639806ABD695B555AEFBBA4519ACEEB3448008E1F7F45415DE","documentHash":"9968525a-6722-4aa3-9451-1d6ca31f42fa"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6717950efdbe83553deb4c7d","doi":"10.1111/evj.14351","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/evj.14351","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Genetic variability of equid γ‐herpesviruses detected in thoroughbred mares and their foals in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Equid herpesvirus 2 (EHV-2) and 5 (EHV-5) are two γ- herpesviruses that are commonly detected in horses worldwide. A considerable sequence variability has been demonstrated among glycoprotein\nB sequences of EHV-2, and to a lesser extent for EHV-5.\nObjectives: To characterise the genomic diversity of the glycoprotein B gene of EHV-2 and EHV-5 in the nasal secretions of a cohort of Thoroughbred mares and their foals.\nStudy design: Cross-sectional study.\nMethods: Viral DNA from selected EHV-2 and/or EHV-5 positive swabs was used as a template in conventional PCR assays targeting a1222 bp (EHV-2) and 1339 bp (EHV-5) fragment of the gB gene. Amplified products were subjected to electrophoresis, purified and cloned into pCR™4-TOPO vectors and transformed into Escherichia coli competent cells. At least five clones from each successful amplification were sequenced. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maximum likelihood method with 1000 bootstrap replicates in MEGA7. Sequence identity among sequences analysed in the study was calculated using the identity matrix in BioEdit software.\nResults: Long PCR products were amplified from 24 EHV-2 and 29 EHV-5 PCR positive swabs tested, from which 82 and 94 clones were obtained, respectively. Sequence alignments of partial gB gene\nfrom 77 EHV-2 clones analysed showed 65.4 to 100% identity at the nucleotide level and 58.9 to 100% at the amino acid level. The genetic variability of EHV-2 sequences from mares and their foals was at the\nsame nucleotide level (65.3%–100%). The degree of identity between sequences of 94 EHV-5 clones was higher and ranged from 89.6 to 100% and 86.7 to 100% at the nucleotide and amino acid level, respectively. Based on the phylogenetic tree, Polish EHV-2 sequences clustered within two main branches. Most of them (n = 64) clustered with international sequences (including Australian reference strain EHV-2.86/67) within the main branch, defined as group 1. The 94 EHV-5 sequences clustered within at least three main lineages.\nMain limitations: A limited number of EHV-2/EHV-5 positive swabs from the same mare-foal pairs sampled over several months.\nConclusions: EHV-2 sequences from mares and their foals showed similar, high genetic variability. Weaning does not seem to have an impact on the genetic variability of equid gammaherpesviruses among Thoroughbreds."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d34","5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d5a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"56","issue":"S60","pagesFromTo":"85-86","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d5a","5e709342878c28a0473a5d34"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b38","mniswId":"5905","title":"Equine Veterinary Journal","issn":"0425-1644","eissn":"2042-3306","documentHash":"02f027a4-f245-4e42-a183-a3c24c46a6c4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6717950efdbe83553deb4c7e","year":"2024","volume":"56","number":"S60","documentHash":"9f49a091-3f1f-49b2-b95d-259a2247d429"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["equid herpesvirus 2","equid herpesvirus 5","genetic variability","mares","foals"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060302464"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65fbe88c4097075721b2c530","name":"James","lastName":"Lowther","documentHash":"8d538e67-c6df-4c1b-a7c2-57d4fe329ce4"},{"objectId":"61d510b87523401fc110f98b","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Osiński","uuid":"E22F565289E96FFCC790C3308B040EACB2014326B501B5584615FF116FC560A28AE9E18D03E00DCF6D65AC2D936D26FA7601EAB0455821EA61DAE48F80069623","documentHash":"93775440-a1c8-4c66-9841-5b6d3406f789"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0ddf","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kaupke","uuid":"BB4CD2E891EE29C149E16224967B6459994EDA1FD1864612676536B0873CAF6716213A6EA983883AB4AB95E3FDCD1257ABD4434268B52114615B9242AA80452C","orcidId":"0000-0003-2930-9346","documentHash":"aea3f641-2f16-497b-ad21-2822cc05a109"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d57","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Bigoraj","uuid":"D9EA09CBD5FEE66C3B0D8E7FB675CD05902213F64F52752A51E978B4C7E541C331D4AE9E885997A98FE396CC44E7240A6A0CB4697422BFD2B81882DB07F004B8","documentHash":"99e54bf1-2352-475e-ad06-a09285903a98"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c0","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Kozyra","uuid":"88B5FB85D89A63D7A6754DFB3690254FD5C75FF15361B258D28D82CF61759A3317B65C24AED854BF7B84D84233154773706E94C7D1EA239D10E6E8F3A17098C7","documentHash":"cd042da6-7b05-458a-9977-184c62f50055"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d41","name":"Artur","lastName":"Rzeżutka","uuid":"96C85B61D3E6BA3657F0A0E04C8CE4A1016EFBE59FEB907FB5C3839E3A19929363BE5F9B8C71F56D60D507D45A0D3B09927E0D5EF05EB658908558DB427DC4C1","orcidId":"0000-0001-6301-1143","documentHash":"2a5cb6f9-9a99-43f2-80dc-4cb29ef3c1cf"}],"objectId":"65fbe88c4097075721b2c52e","doi":"10.1016/j.foodcont.2023.110145","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0956713523005455?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Prevalence and quantitative assessment of foodborne viruses on the imported mussels in Polish market","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this study was an assessment of the prevalence of human enteric viruses such as norovirus (NoV) and hepatitis A and E virus (HAV, HEV) in mussels sold on the Polish market. In addition, the presence of human (hAdV) and swine (pAdV) adenoviruses as indicators of faecal contamination of shellfish was also studied. In total, 246 shellfish samples representing 41 batches of blue and Mediterranean mussels were purchased from Polish seafood wholesalers. Shellfish were processed according to the method in ISO 15216-2:2019 followed by isolation of viral nucleic acids using NucliSens®Magnetic Extraction Reagents (bioMérieux). For virus detection several duplex real-time PCR protocols with incorporated internal amplification controls (IAC) were used. The presence of human enteric viruses was shown in 42 shellfish samples (17.1%). The most frequently detected were NoV (41 samples; 16.7%) followed by HEV (1 sample; 0.4%). None of the samples was positive for HAV, hAdV or pAdV. 15 shellfish batches (36.6%) were virus positive. By the use of Bayesian inference, a true seasonal and country related virus prevalence in shellfish was estimated. NoV GI was more frequently detected in Dutch mussels (18.9%; 95% CI: 6.7%–34.0%), while NoV GII was more frequent in Danish mussels (17.1%; 95% CI: 5.8%–32.5%). However significant differences in virus prevalence in individual and shellfish batches between producing countries were not shown. A seasonal virus distribution pattern in shellfish samples was observed. Lower level of NoV contamination was found in mussels harvested during spring-summer (0.0%–1.3%, 95% CI: 0.1%–4.8%) compared to the fall-winter season (13.0%–20.7%, 95% CI: 6.1%–31.2%). For shellfish batches, a similar seasonal correlation was only observed for NoV GII. The monitoring of marketed shellfish would be an essential tool allowing a reduction of the number of viral food-borne outbreaks."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0ddf","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d57","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c0","61d510b87523401fc110f98b","5e709342878c28a0473a5d41"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"157","pagesFromTo":"110145","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d57","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c0","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0ddf","61d510b87523401fc110f98b","65fbe88c4097075721b2c530","5e709342878c28a0473a5d41"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477d10","mniswId":"6693","title":"Food Control","issn":"0956-7135","eissn":"0956-7135","documentHash":"40702c84-be91-49b2-b3b8-68849e56880b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65fbe88c4097075721b2c52f","year":"2024","volume":"157","documentHash":"f99a705b-eb92-4856-a60a-1d425280a1eb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Foodborne viruses","Norovirus","Hepatitis A nad E virus","Detection","Marketed shellfish","Prevalence assessment"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060302476"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677267cffdbe831015c5c121","name":"Nigel","lastName":"Cook","documentHash":"8a15c33a-9ab0-4fb2-b25c-ab932dca3b5d"},{"objectId":"5e7093d4878c28a0473b17a0","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Joniec-Wiechetek","uuid":"8A195E04A5846F409E7101C65EFEE5DA618FF2275EB825B63512AFC9DAE889C09219001F2E4076E51F28DF2BE6F99DED758F328AA40A3C9BC8D7BFE0C9EE6B59","documentHash":"ca512457-89f4-4ee9-8a50-236a7eee469a"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d41","name":"Artur","lastName":"Rzeżutka","uuid":"96C85B61D3E6BA3657F0A0E04C8CE4A1016EFBE59FEB907FB5C3839E3A19929363BE5F9B8C71F56D60D507D45A0D3B09927E0D5EF05EB658908558DB427DC4C1","orcidId":"0000-0001-6301-1143","documentHash":"2a5cb6f9-9a99-43f2-80dc-4cb29ef3c1cf"}],"objectId":"677267cffdbe831015c5c120","doi":"10.1016/b978-0-12-822521-9.00049-6","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:B9780128225219000496?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2024,"title":"Hepatitis A Virus and Food Safety","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article is a comprehensive review of knowledge on HAV and provides valuable information on recent advances on virus\nbiology, course of infection and the disease caused.

Changes in the profiles of cellular ncRNAs and those secreted in exosomes are observed during viral infection. In our study, we analysed differences in expression profiles of snoRNAs isolated from exosomes of influenza (IAV)-infected and non-infected MDCK cells using high-throughput sequencing. The analysis revealed 133 significantly differentially regulated snoRNAs (131 upregulated and 2 downregulated), including 93 SNORD, 38 SNORA, and 2 SCARNA. The most upregulated was SNORD58 (log2FoldChange = 9.61), while the only downregulated snoRNAs were SNORD3 (log2FC = −2.98) and SNORA74 (log2FC = −2.67). Several snoRNAs previously described as involved in viral infections were upregulated, including SNORD27, SNORD28, SNORD29, SNORD58, and SNORD44. In total, 533 interactors of dysregulated snoRNAs were identified using the RNAinter database with an assigned confidence score ≥ 0.25. The main groups of predicted interactors were transcription factors (TFs, 169 interactors) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs, 130 interactors). Among the most important were pioneer TFs such as POU5F1, SOX2, CEBPB, and MYC, while in the RBP category, notable interactors included Polr2a, TNRC6A, IGF2BP3, and FMRP. Our results suggest that snoRNAs are involved in pro-viral activity, although follow-up studies including experimental validation would be beneficial."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d3c","5e709342878c28a0473a5d34","5e709342878c28a0473a5cb0","5e7093ed878c28a0473b36c5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"26","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ed878c28a0473b36c5","677285f2fdbe831015c8af7a","5e709342878c28a0473a5d34","5e709342878c28a0473a5d3c","5e709342878c28a0473a5cb0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","eissn":"1422-0067","documentHash":"30236fd5-adc3-4b09-b2c8-6a106b437fa9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677285f2fdbe831015c8af79","year":"2024","volume":"26","number":"1","documentHash":"fa90354a-4d0f-4569-9ea1-0facc9a3483a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["influenza virus","exosomes","non-coding RNA","snoRNA","TF","RBP"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060308200"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67346f04fdbe8361a5772f3e","name":"Robin A.

Because of the hormonal effects they cause, growth-promoting compounds are banned by legislation in the EU for use in animal husbandry. Consequently, all EU member states are required to conduct monitoring tests on the content and residues of these compounds in prescribed biological matrices to ensure the safety of food consumers. The aim of this research was to develop a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method for the detection of the residue of one such anabolic hormone, clostebol in food animal urine. Material and Methods: Clostebol and its marker metabolite residues were determined by a method involving enzymatic hydrolysis, isolation of compounds from urine on a C18 solid-phase extraction (SPE) column, purification of the extract by liquid–liquid extraction using n-pentane and a NH2 SPE column, and detection by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Results: No traces of this anabolic steroid hormone or its metabolites were found in any of the samples tested. The method was validated in accordance with the current requirements for confirmatory methods, and the determined parameters of the decision limits necessary for assessing sample compliance met the specified criteria. Conclusion: In 2023, the method was introduced for testing under the National Control Plan in Poland. Up to July 19, 2024, 53 urine samples from different animal species had been tested."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61de4b387523403b69b1eda9","5e709342878c28a0473a5cb9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"68","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"611-621","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cb9","61de4b387523403b69b1eda9","677d0fbcfdbe833088abea45","677d0fbcfdbe833088abea46"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research","issn":"2450-7393","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c3fc9638-cd0e-40bb-89b9-22dee2de8b67"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67652f69fdbe832d0ce1e052","year":"2024","volume":"68","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"e4b7eb51-e539-4820-919a-cf5f7728b062"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["urine","clostebol","hormone residue","LC-MS/MS"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060338663"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebeca82752340226956f836","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Bomba","uuid":"12FB755AC252B37BE5C97C4059AA660D336CCB85ECF820137EC4473FE0079489D8E6F29BF1D003D9BC41C079B8FF5D749252A0166BC51069308587C1C55C38AA","documentHash":"1561cffa-00af-4594-82a1-85d53b39ea14"},{"objectId":"5e7094ef878c28a0473c74a8","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Pasik","uuid":"843DCA673511FB6F5B0E0955EE7C75456311BC7EF3D11CDEC72A2651E0F836D3BCAA6BBEB9C56173D8D3FDA331964A4F004552332118466FFE9FFD9A8591D9A1","orcidId":"0000-0003-3120-915X","documentHash":"f8241c09-9c4a-4c0f-8f64-6eb6cd0d1658"},{"objectId":"5e70947a878c28a0473be051","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Iwan","uuid":"33EBD3E683475BFA864644AB9D31D706674486A2817D557E595A515BEAD9160F88B67D72626B71F074CBD2524453831E8C210694767640EA1A8E5B72C6A576C6","documentHash":"8cf90178-0faf-4b6b-9b7c-f55797fd2f37"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b5a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Domańska-Blicharz","uuid":"44C5DFE3C33AA49F72079D496E2377ECFB06FF9CECAF80BDDBA1D06D13EA5BC0296FA0DF1BE18E01648F10BC82C3BF11F8D0520B236A22625EBD476B49E108A6","orcidId":"0000-0002-0642-3931","documentHash":"be2eaa91-303e-4813-a127-8bc4b12d6232"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-12-21","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6777b485fdbe833ec1c92aa4","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2024-0069","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2024-0069","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"High-throughput sequencing as a potential tool in the quality control of infectious bronchitis vaccines","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction\n\nIn Europe, veterinary vaccines are strictly controlled by the Official Medicines Control Laboratories (OMCLs) of the General European OMCL Network, coordinated by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & HealthCare.

The isolates displayed characteristic B. trematum biochemical features and demonstrated a resistance to cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim, while one also exhibited a resistance to ceftazidime. The whole-genome sequencing and comparison with limited public data revealed a high diversity within B. trematum, reaching >48,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with 64 SNP differentiating tested snake isolates and thus, being considered epidemiologically unrelated. This is the first report of B. trematum isolated from an animal source in Europe. The findings provide valuable insights into this rare bacterium’s phenotypic and genomic characteristics, addressing an important knowledge gap in its ecology and AMR profile."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut

during routine meat inspection worldwide, and the first molecular detection of Sarcocystis miescheriana in a domestic pig in Poland. Pigs can become intermediate hosts for S. miescheriana by accidental ingestion of oocysts or sporocysts present in food or water contaminated by the faeces of canids (definitive hosts). Material and Methods: The affected swine showed no clinical symptoms such as weight loss, dermatitis or dyspnoea suggesting sarcocystosis. The presence of grossly visible cyst-like lesions was noticed by veterinary inspectors during post-mortem meat inspection of pig carcasses at a slaughterhouse located in central Poland. Ten rice-grain-shaped white lesions were isolated from the muscle tissue for molecular analysis, and four other macroscopic cyst-like lesions were also isolated for histopathological and microscopy analysis. The molecular characterisation included amplification and sequencing of the cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 mitochondrial gene. Results: The cyst-like structures were whitish, calcified, 1 cm long and 3 mm wide. The presence of S. miescheriana DNA was confirmed in all ten grossly visible cyst-like lesions. Conclusion: This study shows that Sarcocystis spp. may be present in swine muscle tissue and cause lesions leading to carcass discard. Further analyses are needed to fully recognize the prevalence and impact of Sarcocystis spp. on animal and human health, especially taking into account the possible presence of the zoonotic S. suihominis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d79","61de4b387523403b69b1ed6b","5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","63b4f2b975234021979cd4e4","5e709341878c28a0473a5b50"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee5","uid":"bhxR2mGn694vtlivBJujwBw","uuid":"17d23c12-1f2d-4a37-aae2-bb95ac9ee3dd","name":"Instytut Medycyny Wsi im.

Eimeria invasion contributes to gut damage that promotes the growth of other harmful pathogens, such as Clostridium perfringens. Coccidiostats, with toltrazuril as an example, are widely used to control these infections. In this study, we assessed the effects of Eimeria spp. infection and coinfection with Eimeria spp. and Clostridium perfringens on chicken weight and toltrazuril concentrations, along with two metabolites—toltrazuril sulfoxide and toltrazuril sulfone—using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The analysis of liver and muscle samples showed lower levels of residues in groups challenged with Eimeria spp. In the case of combined Eimeria and C. perfringens infection, no significant differences were observed. These findings suggest that the combination of Eimeria and C. perfringens does not significantly alter the residue levels of toltrazuril and its metabolites, providing valuable insight into the pharmacokinetics of toltrazuril in poultry under infection conditions. This research contributes to optimizing drug use and residue management in poultry production."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebede00752340254fc4286c","5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","5e709341878c28a0473a5b68"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"216","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5ebede00752340254fc4286c","5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","5e709341878c28a0473a5b68","6788c805fdbe8373455ee066","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","issn":"2076-2615","eissn":"2076-2615","documentHash":"3a493594-5fb6-4f5f-9a88-e87d49e3df95"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67850dc6fdbe833b318341e4","year":"2025","volume":"15","number":"2","documentHash":"174597f2-8cb9-49cf-b2a3-0f6f94714c2a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Clostridium perfringens","coccidiostats","Eimeria spp","residue","toltrazuril"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060361188"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de0","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Kochanowski","uuid":"22232E0EEDA0B86B551A138FD411D8AD5D9D0AC9E4AE59C77A6370EA12B87E7E4672884EAE5A819DD42801D310BB1EC3B47A1E2C825D4712CEAE5DAFB07121E4","orcidId":"0000-0002-9982-3028","documentHash":"d7c306c3-b933-482a-ade4-610f87bbba34"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d4e","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szczotka-Bochniarz","uuid":"5A50EFE8836EA63AA5BA231195E3DDEB25840BF56F1B77D19D94CD5E6748C7E4E32CFF39CFC6D8497A6D9A3C605C8A92492E03B7B9C14044428FA1775ABD8590","orcidId":"0000-0001-8422-6848","documentHash":"cc1ff5e7-22b6-4115-a0ab-d029278b2b6f"}],"objectId":"67851a53fdbe833b3184448d","publicUri":"https://pspddd.pl/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Biuletyn-4-2024-e-book.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Znaczenie gryzoni w przenoszeniu chorób świń.

of Echinococcus spp. and other taeniid species in lettuces and berries: Two international multicenter studies from the MEmE project","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cystic and alveolar echinococcosis are severe zoonotic diseases characterized by long asymptomatic periods lasting months or years. Viable Echinococcus spp. eggs released into the environment through the feces of canids can infect humans through accidental ingestion via hand-to-mouth contact or consumption of contaminated food or water. Both Echinococcus multilocularis and Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato are considered as foodborne parasites. However, when considering possible pathways of human infection, it appears that food and waterborne related variables do not significantly increase the risk of infection. Providing evidence-based data for the presence of DNA and, potentially, eggs in fresh produce is crucial in understanding foodborne transmission of Echinococcus spp. to humans. Two multicenter and multicountry studies were conducted within the One Health EJP framework to estimate the proportion of lettuces and berries contaminated by E. multilocularis, E. granulosus sensu lato, and other taeniid DNAs from a total of 12 European countries, Tunisia and Pakistan. A total of 1117 lettuces, 71 others vegetables, 300 strawberries, 130 blueberries and 50 others berries samples were collected and analysed by washing, sequential sieving and real-time PCRs. E. multilocularis DNA was detected in 1.2 % (7/ 570) of lettuce samples tested from the seven European endemic countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Latvia, the Netherlands, Poland and Switzerland) and in 2 % (2/100) from Pakistan. E. granulosus sensu lato DNA was identified in 1.3 % of lettuces (9/695) collected in five European endemic countries (France, Italy, Latvia, Poland and Portugal) and in 12 % (9/75) and 4 % (4/100) from Tunisia and Pakistan, respectively. All E. granulosus sensu lato samples were identified as E. granulosus sensu stricto (20/22), except for two identified as E. canadensis (2/22) from Latvia and Pakistan. Regarding berries, E. multilocularis DNA was detected in 5.4 % (n =11/202) of strawberries, 7.3 % (6/82) of blueberries from the seven European endemic countries and 56 % (14/25) of blueberries from Pakistan. High contamination rates of E. granulosus sensu stricto were found outside of Europe, with 12.0 % (3/25) in blueberries from Pakistan and 81.3 %. (13/16) in strawberries from Tunisia. The total contamination rate of all taeniid species DNA in lettuces (5.3 %; 59/1117), others vegetables (5.6 %; 4/71) and berries (12.1 %; 58/480) suggests that the transfer of taeniid eggs from carnivore feces to food is not uncommon. Although we assume that eggs are the source of the DNA detected in this study, the viability of such eggs is unknown. The detection of Echinococcus species in lettuces and berries suggests a potential risk of foodborne human infection. The relative contribution of this risk remains to be estimated. Further studies on food and environmental contamination are necessary to cover different epidemiological contexts and social habits, leading to a better understanding of human infections by Echinococcus spp. eggs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61de4b387523403b69b1ed6b","5e709341878c28a0473a5b69"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"430","pagesFromTo":"111059","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67863639fdbe834d98d8ca10","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca11","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca12","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca13","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca14","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca15","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca16","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca17","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca18","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca19","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca1a","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca1b","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca1c","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca1d","5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca1e","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca1f","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca20","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca21","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca22","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca23","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca24","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca25","61de4b387523403b69b1ed6b","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca26","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca27","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca28","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca29","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca2a","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca2b","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca2c","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca2d","67863639fdbe834d98d8ca2e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781f3","mniswId":"8915","title":"International Journal of Food Microbiology","issn":"0168-1605","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"09f9209b-f8ce-4a3b-afbe-3fa3fdd309f0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67863639fdbe834d98d8ca0f","year":"2025","volume":"430","documentHash":"0e1f9310-ec6b-4409-8f20-f84a78b97371"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Echinococcus multilocularis","Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato","Taenia spp.","Foodborne parasitic infections","Environmental contamination"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060420562"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de0","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Kochanowski","uuid":"22232E0EEDA0B86B551A138FD411D8AD5D9D0AC9E4AE59C77A6370EA12B87E7E4672884EAE5A819DD42801D310BB1EC3B47A1E2C825D4712CEAE5DAFB07121E4","documentHash":"d7c306c3-b933-482a-ade4-610f87bbba34"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d4e","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szczotka-Bochniarz","uuid":"5A50EFE8836EA63AA5BA231195E3DDEB25840BF56F1B77D19D94CD5E6748C7E4E32CFF39CFC6D8497A6D9A3C605C8A92492E03B7B9C14044428FA1775ABD8590","documentHash":"cc1ff5e7-22b6-4115-a0ab-d029278b2b6f"}],"objectId":"6745b9b2fdbe832eab93f2ce","publicUri":"https://pspddd.pl/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Biuletyn-3-2024-e-book.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Znaczenie gryzoni w przenoszeniu chorób świń.

The study aimed to identify e????ective biosecurity measures for controlling\nHEV transmission on pig farms, addressing a critical gap in current knowledge.\nUtilizing a cross-sectional design, fecal samples from gilts, dry sows, and\nfatteners were collected on 231 pig farms of all farm types across nine European\ncountries. Real-time RT-PCR was employed to test these samples for HEV.\nSimultaneously, a comprehensive biosecurity questionnaire captured data on\nvarious potentialmeasures to control HEV. The dependent variable was HEV risk,\ncategorized as lower or higher based on the percentage of positive pooled fecal\nsamples on each farm (25% cut-o????). The data were analyzed using generalized\nlinear models (one for finisher samples and one for all samples) with a logit link\nfunction with country and farm type as a priori fixed factors. The results of the\nfinal multivariable models identified key biosecurity measures associated with\nlower HEV risk, which were the use of a hygienogram in the breeding (OR: 0.06,\np=0.001) and/or fattening area after cleaning (OR: 0.21, p=0.019), the presence\nof a quarantine area (OR: 0.29, p = 0.025), testing and/or treating purchased feed\nagainst Salmonella (OR: 0.35, p = 0.021), the presence of other livestock species\non the farm, and having five or fewer persons in charge of the pigs. Contrary\nto expectations, some biosecurity measures were associated with higher HEV\nrisk, e.g., downtime of 3 days or longer after cleaning in the fattening area (OR:\n3.49, p = 0.005) or mandatory handwashing for farm personnel when changing\nbarn sections (OR: 3.4, p = 0.026). This novel study unveils critical insights\ninto biosecurity measures e????ective in controlling HEV on European pig farms.\nThe identification of both protective and risk-associated measures contributes\nto improving strategies for managing HEV and underscores the complexity of\nbiosecurity in pig farming."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d6f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1328284","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d6f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb3","mniswId":"22511","title":"Frontiers in Veterinary Science","issn":"2297-1769","eissn":"2297-1769","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"7aca7674-d53a-406a-bc77-ca524899ec80"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67124d70fdbe836b556005e2","year":"2024","volume":"11","documentHash":"4713a54e-9c23-4a13-90e2-49bc56054d92"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hepatitis-E-virus","HEV","biosecuritymeasures","pig production","BIOPIGEE","One Health","OH"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060477768"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6790ad95fdbe835da547e0bb","name":"Artur","lastName":"Jabłoński","documentHash":"b4b2ea10-3c1b-4344-bef0-d540925b42aa"},{"objectId":"6790ad95fdbe835da547e0ba","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Jężak","documentHash":"dde6ad28-428b-4544-98a1-1854058d0dc6"},{"objectId":"6790ad95fdbe835da547e0b9","name":"Agata","lastName":"Augustyniak","documentHash":"5f1f0121-4ece-4517-8251-5d3397f5428c"},{"objectId":"6790ad95fdbe835da547e0b8","name":"Ewelina Barbara","lastName":"Czyżewska-Dors","documentHash":"1d5bb7f9-a974-4237-86e7-5d0c7172a855"},{"objectId":"65c59c3840e3ff0466a39534","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Piekutowska-Nóżka","uuid":"BC024547B72CDB68A82F25B1832A177B6EA9AE4169CDF617BC67409D5EAE739A8ED5E8FBC7D6F64B69D5D485C94EC15D61C6E678087102012BB389734C2D213C","documentHash":"628a94c1-4e05-43ba-8c34-aa756318937d"},{"objectId":"5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d5f","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"0CF56F05BC1444EC145C3F9F0244C34241EA3CE9FB305488E439778D5EDD3A940A6ECE07460B993634F9796A71C9C4319F62AE41108C670F05C6624E05EEA4EC","orcidId":"0000-0001-5960-8254","documentHash":"d89286dd-bb34-4422-b2fa-1ad1323c6916"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-12-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6790ad95fdbe835da547e0b7","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2024-0059","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2024-0059","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Serological evidence of <i>Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae</i> antibodies in wild boars (<i>Sus scrofa</i>) in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: This study aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence of Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae among wild boars inhabiting\nPoland.

Due to the lack of effective and safe vaccines, one of the crucial measures to protect farms from the introduction of the ASFV is to apply a strict regime of biosecurity and disinfection. However, in field conditions, the activity of disinfectants may be influenced by temperature, resulting in reduced activity or biodegradation (i.e., freezing or evaporating). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a wide range of temperatures on the virucidal activity of selected active substances commonly used against ASFV. Eight active substances were tested, namely: sodium hypochlorite (1.0%), glutaraldehyde (0.1%), potassium peroxysulfate (0.5%), caustic soda (1.0%), phenol (1.0%), acetic acid (3.0%), benzalkonium chloride (1.0%), and formaldehyde (0.4%). The virucidal activity of each compound was tested at different temperatures (21, −10, and −20 °C for 30 min) and compared to the initial virus titer under the same temperature conditions. Exposure to a range of temperatures did not significantly affect the virucidal efficacy of tested active substances against ASFV. Most of the evaluated substances had reduced virus titers ≥ 4 log10, regardless of the temperature. However, two of them (benzalkonium chloride and acetic acid) were sensitive to sub-zero temperatures, showing a lack of the required 4 log10 virus titer reduction. The conducted study showed that temperature could hamper the virucidal effect of selected substances (i.e., benzalkonium chloride and acetic acid), showing their moderate efficacy against ASFV −10 °C and −20 °C. The results suggest that extreme caution should be taken while applying these substances at sub-zero temperatures. The other substances had no significant sensitivity to the temperature range. Nevertheless, in the case of freezing the agent, insufficient penetration of the disinfected surface may occur, which may result in an ineffective disinfection process."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d2b","5ebee176752340254fc4382c","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e49"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"1-11","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5ebee176752340254fc4382c","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e49","5e709342878c28a0473a5d6b","5e709342878c28a0473a5ccc","5e709342878c28a0473a5d2b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a80","mniswId":"20156","title":"Viruses","issn":"1999-4915","eissn":"1999-4915","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses","documentHash":"204f8987-0c7c-441b-9f4a-748747147d4e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"678602cffdbe834d98d64868","year":"2025","volume":"17","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"8dc07529-3719-46ff-91f7-65a115744c35"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["African swine fever virus","disinfection","biosecurity","sub-zero temperatures"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060511909"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61d510b87523401fc110f98b","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Osiński","uuid":"E22F565289E96FFCC790C3308B040EACB2014326B501B5584615FF116FC560A28AE9E18D03E00DCF6D65AC2D936D26FA7601EAB0455821EA61DAE48F80069623","documentHash":"93775440-a1c8-4c66-9841-5b6d3406f789"},{"objectId":"5f8667f1085dcb410a25edeb","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Zaręba-Marchewka","uuid":"E9268C5333F0CBAE54AD7EA9B5CED9C69030D1CDC64F53761DD613459042120BD6E51EF8B9A3BA336DD6CC4A37C971328861C88710E5C38812BDDC990509D461","orcidId":"0000-0003-0657-4171","documentHash":"7c0d8f04-6ae3-4172-8fc6-76b605a7821e"},{"objectId":"5e709386878c28a0473abe9e","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Jodełko","uuid":"80854D40534202786EF8FF20EFE5A68D397B1B240682D14ABE7E970EA9F88BB468DF711B76E763E8CF4F084C76163ACD3EAE04016862324F0471348C5B533684","orcidId":"0000-0002-4821-4847","documentHash":"9853992a-da1b-45ec-9856-e7be0c969611"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d56","name":"Monika","lastName":"Szymańska - Czerwińska","uuid":"E07CADA3BDAD828B11D62CEBC4FE77CCF81E33CFCE3A9704EF50F3519D3C3BCC13BA152ACABB83FC29A7C80274C453312953EC94D4928898C8078EA038CDC1CD","orcidId":"0000-0001-8974-0870","documentHash":"3114978b-eee1-4e88-802f-7d034c581f01"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc0","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Niemczuk","uuid":"82AA2E7CCF0C6F87FC9C29C9C294AC35E29D444F944ED9F1FA82BB7FF88B5C2DF9A8411764C95A57F695D0609991E5125471404AD969DADA833F258105E54B44","orcidId":"0000-0003-1611-9770","documentHash":"a1f14ea1-835c-4507-ba6c-be8782ab8fbd"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-12-31","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"677d1204fdbe833088ac05e0","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2024-0071","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2024-0071","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Prevalence of chlamydiae in dairy cattle herds and factors contributing to the spread of infections","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction\nDifferent Chlamydia species affect cattle and contribute to economic losses.

A total of 368 bovine and 87 porcine carcasses were tested using the ISO/TS 13136 standard and the STEC isolates were further characterized with whole genomic sequencing (WGS). It was found that 119 (32.3%) of bovine and 14 (16.1%) of porcine carcasses were positive for the stx Shiga toxin gene. Further analysis of the stx-positive samples allowed to isolate 32 (26.9%) bovine and two (14.3%) porcine STEC, respectively. Bovine isolates were classified into 21 different serotypes with the most prevalent O168:H8 (3 isolates), whereas two porcine STEC belonged to two serotypes that were not identified in bovine strains. Isolates of bovine carcass origin were mainly positive for the stx2 Shiga toxin gene, either alone or in combination with stx1 type (26 of 32; 81.2% isolates). Two STEC from porcine carcasses were positive for the stx2e variant only. All STEC, irrespective of the origin, were negative for the eae intimin gene. MLST and cgMLST analyses of all strains tested revealed that they were diverse. However, a close molecular relationship between some bovine isolates based on cgMLST schemes was observed. Comparison of the current bovine STEC with those isolated between 2014-2018 showed that some of them consisted of the same MLST sequence types. However, based on cgMLST analysis only two cases of three genomes of STEC isolates each (two from period 2019-2023 and one isolated between 2014-2018) revealed up to 50 allelic differences."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d66","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"428","pagesFromTo":"110983","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9","5e709342878c28a0473a5d66"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781f3","mniswId":"8915","title":"International Journal of Food Microbiology","issn":"0168-1605","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"09f9209b-f8ce-4a3b-afbe-3fa3fdd309f0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679b765afdbe8318b4ce4ce6","year":"2025","volume":"428","documentHash":"cd267def-b25f-4c4e-a3f2-6723671c74c9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli","bovine and porcine carcasses","prevalence","serotype","virulence genes","WGS","MLST","cgMLST"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060580010"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67c0707ffdbe8328ca674943","name":"Giorgia","lastName":"Angeloni","documentHash":"bae38ebe-1ff0-4a1a-a014-ed48e1ae914d"},{"objectId":"67c0707ffdbe8328ca674942","name":"Luana","lastName":"Cortinovis","documentHash":"9ee78959-7cf3-4ea2-8e5e-3fc00129ca63"},{"objectId":"67c0707ffdbe8328ca674941","name":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Arcangeli","documentHash":"3fdead17-9e9b-4a13-8b7b-1965f7a20193"},{"objectId":"67c0707ffdbe8328ca674940","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Basso","documentHash":"3565d01d-eb2f-422b-b3e2-d03f9719b771"},{"objectId":"67c0707ffdbe8328ca67493f","name":"Amedeo","lastName":"Manfrin","documentHash":"02c56298-2022-4616-bac9-623209477127"},{"objectId":"67c0707ffdbe8328ca67493e","name":"Patrizia","lastName":"Danesi","documentHash":"8209d06d-3fbb-40aa-9504-5dad17ce253a"},{"objectId":"67c0707ffdbe8328ca67493d","name":"Valeria","lastName":"Besutti","documentHash":"710946d1-7010-4760-b9da-c33703b0006f"},{"objectId":"67c0707ffdbe8328ca67493c","name":"Romina","lastName":"Bottazzo","documentHash":"5dd6cc88-06e8-46e2-8f8b-f025eba4eab8"},{"objectId":"67c0707ffdbe8328ca67493b","name":"Elena","lastName":"Lazzaro","documentHash":"0a19d858-e9b6-4373-b094-232419459342"},{"objectId":"67c0707ffdbe8328ca67493a","name":"Lisa","lastName":"Guardone","documentHash":"39b3fdd3-a554-4aa9-b9e1-de9226d284f9"},{"objectId":"67c0707ffdbe8328ca674939","name":"Vasco","lastName":"Menconi","documentHash":"6ea96180-cbae-4d88-8a6d-c525c6dcb3f2"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d79","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Bilska-Zając","uuid":"CA37D40E9E6221954C0E1F92525EB13B265614DDB637B5261A39B130F380056543A7F0D2E0AE9B7220F35F148187F484510166AABC45E68EC5A47A105D08B099","documentHash":"fb1618f1-0e83-472f-b325-e0c87f8a8872"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-01-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67c0707ffdbe8328ca674938","doi":"10.3390/pathogens14010100","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/14/1/100/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"A Case of Dibothriocephalosis (Dibothriocephalus latus) from Iseo Lake (Northern Italy): An Update on a Persistent Sanitary Issue","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Dibothriocephalosis is a fish-borne parasitic zoonosis that is caused by tapeworms of the Dibothriocephalus (syn.

A month after, the patient found a segment of a worm in her stool. Molecular analysis identified it as Dibothriocephalus latus (syn. Diphyllobothrium latum). Several studies reported D. latus infections in patients from the subalpine regions of Switzerland, France, and Italy, but no cases have been reported from this area in the last 10 years.

The aim of this study was to evaluate a modified microscopic method for the detection of particles of insects in poultry feed. A total of 90 samples including PAP of insects (Hermetia illucens and Tenebrio molitor), poultry feeds produced with different levels (0–27%) of insect PAP content, and other poultry feeds spiked with insect PAP at 1% were investigated using a modified microscopic method with a double sedimentation protocol. Characteristic features of insects including cuticulae, muscles, bristles and tracheoles were determined in the microscopic images obtained. In all spiked samples, characteristic fragments of insects were detected. The fragments of muscle and tracheoles only indicated the presence of material from members of the insect class but could not facilitate identification of organisms to species level. The results obtained with this double sedimentation protocol for the isolation of insect PAP from feed for poultry have shown that the method can be used in routine analysis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d5e","5e709342878c28a0473a5caf"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"66","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"403-409","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d5e","5e709342878c28a0473a5caf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research (Poland)","issn":"2450-7393","eissn":"2450-8608","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"5a3ef30a-e992-42a0-a40a-ad7662219310"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["microscopic method","insects","sedimentation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060588985"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61de4b387523403b69b1ede5","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Kozak","uuid":"6C6339291E2BECD20F431B01A11391B60AD18EB7FECAAD063113E658D35369673736F3CBFE7932F696194858EF3025C0EE1F928DDCD08430A56CF9CDD8DC95F2","documentHash":"ef6ed37e-eaeb-49c6-868b-85594ebef247"},{"objectId":"60c3345c9543c723365440d4","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Dziadek","uuid":"45A7FB5A1FD2C927BD37AF9634B24CF95C6C5A402E27C7492A21AEFB7FD8FAE656D7B87C54B97098F162EFA9324EAABBDFE8EFD47CC0AB7435FDB60B944D1845","documentHash":"866d0380-8a74-4b4e-8596-7df5ba9b4d33"},{"objectId":"608a91789543c73526c48c75","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Styś-Fijoł","uuid":"18953671ADAF7EFBEFDD8CC6D7C0ADF412475CD61FBF7A3AEA3F313BD45A5DC3299CE20DAECC4C6A3A20A49CA92ABE51904672A45817502AD0CDBE61FCF6E600","documentHash":"751feae2-867c-4ecc-9595-719b2a8f22f2"},{"objectId":"5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d65","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Świętoń","uuid":"B1451330EBBF3BBF864C6C29ECAB990B8FD8C6E55EB7CC80EED09C3919984400B4DFBF6AA1E5E9E1649048ECC8A1F8E50BEF61772AC319511EF184E34E6AE896","orcidId":"0000-0002-1571-3279","documentHash":"86144e2c-49d5-48c0-85fe-730dbc29a78d"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e54","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Wyrostek","uuid":"FC1F09260F07424DA4AC78D7A4F89433CF76A1110DC789EEA15E08F3EA26403BE4781835ABBB6B989637CC38D3073CD4C0E3DFDD544E10C8477AFFBE83ED3068","documentHash":"f225105a-d3b2-4acf-9e0b-5fa35e3883e2"},{"objectId":"5e70947a878c28a0473be059","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Tarasiuk","uuid":"5294C817CF66234F410C3490D55F53308E7039E81C0AB7B8A2DF44056395AF538BC80403AACB252521179D161FC47BE78551952AFC111FC603D852E2CE0A57B6","documentHash":"adabe201-805f-4f3c-bc1b-6370b267c950"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d58","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Śmietanka","uuid":"0C6A332B0C5346DE004374A65243BBDAE82F9030869912A6C9AA7EDF21BAE52DC03930A036188BF9DADB88EF3FB6A05E4846CBA6C8F206183182FE03FD7CD9C1","documentHash":"68761bee-b0dd-4744-a52b-e925fd08efa9"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc0","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Niemczuk","uuid":"82AA2E7CCF0C6F87FC9C29C9C294AC35E29D444F944ED9F1FA82BB7FF88B5C2DF9A8411764C95A57F695D0609991E5125471404AD969DADA833F258105E54B44","orcidId":"0000-0003-1611-9770","documentHash":"a1f14ea1-835c-4507-ba6c-be8782ab8fbd"}],"objectId":"6299d4784097072c2b7a4eea","publicUri":"https://sciendo.com/it/article/10.2478/jvetres-2022-0017","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5Nx in Poland in 2020/2021: a descriptive epidemiological study of a large-scale epidemic","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks caused by the Gs/Gd lineage of H5Nx viruses occur in Poland with increased frequency. The article provides an update on the HPAI situation in the 2020/2021 season and studies the possible  factors  that  caused the  exceptionally  fast  spread  of  the  virus. Material  and  Methods: Samples  from  poultry  and  wild birds  delivered  for  HPAI  diagnosis  were  tested  by  real-time  RT-PCR  and  a  representative  number  of  detected  viruses  were submitted for partial or full-genome characterisation. Information yielded by veterinary inspection was used for descriptive analysis of the epidemiological situation. Results: The scale of the epidemic in the 2020/2021 season was unprecedented in terms of duration (November 2020–August 2021), number of outbreaks in poultry (n = 357), wild bird events (n = 92) and total number of affected domestic birds (approximately ~14 million). The major drivers of the virus spread were the harsh winter conditions in February 2020 followed by the introduction of the virus to high-density poultry areas in March 2021. All tested viruses belonged to H5 clade 2.3.4.4b with significant intra-clade diversity and in some cases clearly distinguished clusters. Conclusion: The HPAI epidemic in 2020/2021 in Poland struck with unprecedented force.

Our  research  and  the  available  literature  indicate  that  the  alpaca  (Vicugna  pacos)  is  extremely  susceptible  to Mycobacterium bovis infection, and that testing periodicity fails to take into account that animals do not manifest disease symptoms for a long time. The skin test failed to identify Mycobacterium bovis infection in two alpacas prior to their movement from the UK to Poland. The animals were purchased by a breeding centre in Poland, and were then shown at an international animal exhibition. The last owner of the alpacas before their deaths from TB bought the infected animals unwittingly in order to run rehabilitation activities with disabled children on his farm. Material and Methods: Thoracic lymph node, lung and liver tissue samples obtained at necropsy were examined histopathologically after Ziehl–Neelsen staining. Tissue samples were homogenised and mycobacteria present  there  were  cultured  on  Stonebrink’s  medium  during  a  6-week  incubation.  A  commercial  test  using  polymorphism  of the chromosomal direct repeat region provided species identification and additional identification was by spacer oligonucleotide typing and mycobacteria interspersed repetitive unit–variable number tandem repeat analysis with a gel electrophoresis protocol. Results: The microbiological examination confirmed multiorgan TB caused by the SB0666 spoligotype of Mycobacterium bovis. Conclusion: Due  to  the  suboptimal  performance  of  current  diagnostic  tests  for  TB  in  alpacas,  there  is  a  risk  that  infected  animals  may  be  moved  unwittingly.  A  risk  of  TB  spread  associated  with  the  international  movement  of  alpacas  is  implied  by this study."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cb3","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c1","5e709486878c28a0473bef46","60a738179543c758682b6456"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de69","uid":"b8lEq4e8f8p1V09_nBsO4Ew","uuid":"7b1ecf5e-1c1d-40d0-91a9-cbde801c4409","name":"Akademia Bialska im.

Available data on the spectrum of bacteria isolated from the clinical cases being limited, and evaluation of the microbial\nbackground of fish skin lesions being useful, a bacteriological examination has been undertaken. Material and Methods: A total\nof 1,381 cod were caught during two voyages of the Baltica research vessel in the Polish exclusive economic zone of the southern\nBaltic Sea. After an examination which found lesions in 164 of the fish, a microbiological analysis was performed to isolate bacteria\nfrom them. The collected strains were phenotyped and genotyped, and their antimicrobial resistance was analysed by minimum\ninhibitory concentration (MIC) techniques. Results: Bacteriological examinations provided 850 isolates. The dominant\nmicroorganisms were mesophilic Aeromonas spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Shewanella baltica.

Both animals and humans are susceptible to infection by the MTBC. Interspecies transmission is also possible, including to livestock and humans. In the years 1997–2013, many tuberculosis cases were recorded in European bison in the Bieszczady Mountains; more alarmingly, TB was also recorded in wild boar in the years 2013–2020. \r\nMaterial and Methods: In the years 2013–2020, 104 wild boar from the Bieszczady Mountains were tested for TB through necropsy, mycobacterial culture, strain identification and spoligotyping.

This study explores the impact of dietary inclusion of chokeberry pomace on oxidative stress parameters and other milk quality parameters in high-producing dairy goats. Material and Methods: Twenty-seven goats were allocated into three groups: a control group provided standard feed and two experimental groups provided feed supplemented with 15 g or 30 g of chokeberry pomace per kilogram. Milk samples were analysed for physicochemical traits, a range of enzyme activities and antioxidant properties. Results: Supplementation with chokeberry pomace significantly reduced milk fat content, enhanced antioxidative properties and increased most of the quantified enzyme activities. Total polyphenol content and reduced glutathione levels were significantly higher in the supplemented groups, correlating with improved antioxidative potential of the milk. Conclusion: Chokeberry pomace in goat diets enhances milk’s antioxidative properties and upregulates its enzymatic activity profile, suggesting a potential strategy to improve the nutritional quality and health benefits of goat milk. The study underscores the utility of chokeberry pomace as a feed additive that might not only benefit animal health but also contribute to enhanced milk quality."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","uid":"b1f8yFvsXVe0iKjEnSD0moQ","uuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","name":"Instytut Genetyki i Biotechnologii Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d56","5e7092a1878c28a047399828","5e7092ae878c28a04739a77f","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc0","5e70923d878c28a04739228b","671610cdece39836623b1eff","5e709489878c28a0473bf258"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","parentUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea7","rootUuid":"c808eebe-2cda-46c5-bb49-3cbc713eaa75","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61d510b87523401fc110f98b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"68","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"409-417","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d56","671610cdece39836623b1eff","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc0","5e7092ae878c28a04739a77f","61d510b87523401fc110f98b","5e709489878c28a0473bf258","5e70923d878c28a04739228b","5e70929c878c28a047399193","5e7094c3878c28a0473c346c","5e7092a1878c28a047399828"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research","issn":"2450-7393","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c3fc9638-cd0e-40bb-89b9-22dee2de8b67"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dairy goats, chokeberry pomace, feed additives, oxidative stress, milk quality"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060592932"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63b4f2b975234021979cd4d9","name":"Marlena","lastName":"Smagacz","uuid":"8EC9F8F864427DDFAADADBA023A72E5A9C65B97E81FD949741D032C1FB3776D979E223383C1B91E557E5F76BD73644EEF34A24FA28B4747024365354F876D1CC","documentHash":"e871a688-0964-47b4-acd4-7921c7897773"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e1b","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Pluta","uuid":"91975BFAA2B6AEF2FF5BB4DEA817EBA26623D681235A7191700469223EF5B63B27AFA98CDCCC89D48001C5D5EBD9300C9381AA573EDC8D9F32289CCCAB02BCD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-6860-4474","documentHash":"80412959-96c7-497b-934f-aa97eacc6599"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d36","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Rola-Łuszczak","uuid":"EEB52DFEBBC4DD2F08F3D378F3270B2F075B37ACEE7131C551552A6E6DF0DBEBB71870E64B035B60AF49A8A2DB582875540F757D9068F8C17BD08F4089965F5D","orcidId":"0000-0003-3209-3427","documentHash":"185700e3-69a6-4527-9d1c-e6158a50f4a5"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cb7","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Materniak-Kornas","uuid":"62F3AC42F6F58B8EB3F647DB6DE655B54F3BC6DFBD2CEC8FF5E8F98D6A4E462083AD785F23F6EC0001353AC886D27CAF632723E964667D4E121A978657CA445C","orcidId":"0000-0002-2795-597X","documentHash":"850a4011-29f0-4e0d-8626-d7a604886193"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cad","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Kuźmak","uuid":"DCBC0C5773B0C346D5DBB40E3262D8E29184B62793C0D18E82B24E595E4F33FDCB74C41AEC4D6B60F253051482EC522138B936B5ED82B4345F33391A0BD19DAB","orcidId":"0000-0003-2034-0988","documentHash":"b123658e-4d9a-4155-9ddf-df23aa13556a"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5ca8","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kubiś","uuid":"17C61532914EB98F4AC826BDF6CD0F86E79DE6AE2E4D1612719B1EFA45AB7FDBC7151E3EE8F9C12C2EC26B29693CAD785F466ACB678209889D852E3ED54A10A7","orcidId":"0000-0003-3768-893X","documentHash":"2252cab3-51ba-40b9-9e98-6c6eebff4bc8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"63c7a6954097076eb3748bb2","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2022-0072","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2022-0072","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Transcriptome analysis of bovine macrophages (BoMac) cells after infection with bovine immunodeficiency virus","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) is found worldwide in cattle under natural conditions. However, the effect of BIV infection on immune functions has not been fully characterized. Material and Methods: Transcriptome analysis of BoMac cells after in vitro infection with BIV was performed using BLOPlus bovine microarrays. Genes identified as differentially expressed were subjected to the functional analysis in Ingenuity Knowledge Base (IPA). Results: Out of 1743 genes with altered expression 1315 were mapped as unique molecules. In total 718 genes were identified as up regulated and 597 genes as down regulated. Differentially expressed genes were involved in 16 pathways related to immune response. The top enriched canonical pathway was ‘Leukocyte Extravasation Signaling’. Furthermore ‘Il-15 production’ was indicated as the most activated pathway and ‘PFKFB4 Signaling Pathway’ was the most inhibited one. In addition, the study showed that inflammatory response was decreased during BIV infection. Conclusion: This is the first report describing the microarray analysis of changes in gene expression upon BIV infection of bovine macrophages. Our data indicated how BIV influence the expression of genes and signaling pathways engaged in immune response."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy

monitoring on mink farms in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Many countries have reported severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in mink, and transmission back to humans has raised the concern of novel variants emerging in these animals. The monitoring system on Polish mink farms detected SARS-CoV-2 infection first in January 2021 and has been kept in place since then. Material and Methods: Oral swab samples collected between February 2021 and March 2022 from 11,853 mink from 594 farms in different regions of Poland were screened molecularly for SARS-CoV-2. Isolates from those with the highest loads of viral genetic material from positive farms were sequenced and phylogenetically analysed. Serological studies were also carried out for one positive farm in order to follow the antibody response after infection. Results: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in mink on 11 farms in 8 out of 16 Polish administrative regions. Whole genome sequences were obtained for 19 SARS-CoV-2 strains from 10 out of 11 positive farms. These genomes belonged to four different variants of concern (VOC) – VOC-Gamma (20B), VOC-Delta (21J), VOC-Alpha (20I) and VOC-Omicron (21L) – and seven different Pango lineages – B.1.1.464, B.1.1.7, AY.43, AY.122, AY.126, B.1.617.2 and BA.2. One of the nucleotide and amino acid mutations specific for persistent strains found in the analysed samples was the Y453F host adaptation mutation. Serological testing of blood samples revealed a high rate of seroprevalence on the single mink farm studied. Conclusion: Farmed mink are highly susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 of different lineages, including Omicron BA.2 VOC. As these infections were asymptomatic, mink may become an unnoticeable virus reservoir generating new variants potentially threatening human health. Therefore, real-time monitoring of mink is extremely important in the context of the One Health approach."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebedd26752340254fc424a4","5e709342878c28a0473a5d34","5e709342878c28a0473a5d46","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0def","5ebedfd2752340254fc43096","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc0","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5b","5e7093ed878c28a0473b36c5","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc4","5e70947a878c28a0473be051","5ebeca82752340226956f836","63bbeec140970754861d7ddb","5e709341878c28a0473a5b5a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"66","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"449-458","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709341878c28a0473a5b5a","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc4","5e709342878c28a0473a5d46","63bbeec140970754861d7dda","5e709342878c28a0473a5d5b","5e7093ed878c28a0473b36c5","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc0","63bbeec140970754861d7ddb","5ebedd26752340254fc424a4","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0def","5ebedfd2752340254fc43096","5ebeca82752340226956f836","5e70947a878c28a0473be051","63bbeec140970754861d7ddc","5e709342878c28a0473a5d34"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research (Poland)","issn":"2450-7393","eissn":"2450-8608","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"5a3ef30a-e992-42a0-a40a-ad7662219310"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["SARS-CoV-2","surveillance","mink","whole-genome sequencing","Poland"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060604411"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"609b48fd9543c73526c48db5","name":"Anna","lastName":"Ziętek-Barszcz","uuid":"C79B25D061C888B608C52BFC9A99067A950574F010AB0F594E3D1611FFC7E6275D032D19C640A081625F3DA7A7A3B012BEA88B6BE8C9A63ED46316F6CFA6FFDF","documentHash":"e517232b-3a40-449b-8d55-4574aea8321c"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d88","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Bocian","uuid":"4239FC4F1A6A56B4C449D55C845F70D206FD0316490BE74E000F9F96750190FD162A48D60125604A3F67FE1FC3BA677DB5B766BCA6E3D70F855ED39F57117E92","orcidId":"0000-0002-8204-5856","documentHash":"c3f73129-bb4a-4ed7-aaf9-f0ea97957b91"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a660f","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Frant","uuid":"2AD73901C2B1BDDF66264197B4E2A40BB43C9F170B0D3D9252C79378D973DED6BA0DD7DB0E3F16FB50489E4717CA62BAE671805ED94AD0C5F9B3478EE3C561FE","orcidId":"0000-0002-7169-3735","documentHash":"b81b59e2-56af-4ed2-bfbe-bdf26cc5f824"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d4e","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szczotka-Bochniarz","uuid":"5A50EFE8836EA63AA5BA231195E3DDEB25840BF56F1B77D19D94CD5E6748C7E4E32CFF39CFC6D8497A6D9A3C605C8A92492E03B7B9C14044428FA1775ABD8590","orcidId":"0000-0001-8422-6848","documentHash":"cc1ff5e7-22b6-4115-a0ab-d029278b2b6f"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc0","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Niemczuk","uuid":"82AA2E7CCF0C6F87FC9C29C9C294AC35E29D444F944ED9F1FA82BB7FF88B5C2DF9A8411764C95A57F695D0609991E5125471404AD969DADA833F258105E54B44","orcidId":"0000-0003-1611-9770","documentHash":"a1f14ea1-835c-4507-ba6c-be8782ab8fbd"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"NOVEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"63ad8cd14097070d11c00fe9","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2022-0067","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2022-0067","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Dynamics of the African swine fever spread in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: African  swine  fever  (ASF)  is  a  lethal  haemorrhagic  disease  of  Suidae,  present  in  Poland  since  2014.  The natural reservoir of ASF in Europe is the wild boar (Sus scrofa); however, human activity facilitates long-distance introductions of the disease. In ASF control it is important to identify areas at increased risk of infection. Such identification and estimation of the disease’s  progress  and  subsequent  spread  will  help to  identify  the  specific  preventive  action  needs  in  given  zones.  Serving  this purpose, this study is a spatial and statistical analysis of ASF spread through noted outbreak data. Material and Methods: The spatial-temporal  analysis  was  conducted  on  the  basis  of  data  including  the  time  and  location  of  all  ASF  outbreaks  both  in  wild boars and domestic pigs in Poland in 2014–2021. Results: The analysis indicates possible routes and directions for further ASF spread in Poland, estimates the annual increase of the affected area (approx. 25,000 km2 every year since 2017) and marks trends. The strong method-independent correlation between the year and the surface area affected by African swine fever indicated a near-linear  generalised  trend. Conclusion: Given  the  growth  trend,  we  can  expect  ASF  to  expand  further  into  new  territories  of  the country; however, it is important to realise that there is still a significant area to protect, because 60% of Poland remains ASF-free."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d4e","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d88","609b48fd9543c73526c48db5","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc0","5e709347878c28a0473a660f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"66","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"459-471","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d88","5e709347878c28a0473a660f","609b48fd9543c73526c48db5","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc0","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research (Poland)","issn":"2450-7393","eissn":"2450-8608","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"5a3ef30a-e992-42a0-a40a-ad7662219310"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ASF","spread","spatial analysis","geostatistical analysis","Poland"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060604565"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61d510b87523401fc110f98b","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Osiński","uuid":"E22F565289E96FFCC790C3308B040EACB2014326B501B5584615FF116FC560A28AE9E18D03E00DCF6D65AC2D936D26FA7601EAB0455821EA61DAE48F80069623","documentHash":"93775440-a1c8-4c66-9841-5b6d3406f789"},{"objectId":"5e709386878c28a0473abe9e","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Jodełko","uuid":"80854D40534202786EF8FF20EFE5A68D397B1B240682D14ABE7E970EA9F88BB468DF711B76E763E8CF4F084C76163ACD3EAE04016862324F0471348C5B533684","orcidId":"0000-0002-4821-4847","documentHash":"9853992a-da1b-45ec-9856-e7be0c969611"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d56","name":"Monika","lastName":"Szymańska - Czerwińska","uuid":"E07CADA3BDAD828B11D62CEBC4FE77CCF81E33CFCE3A9704EF50F3519D3C3BCC13BA152ACABB83FC29A7C80274C453312953EC94D4928898C8078EA038CDC1CD","orcidId":"0000-0001-8974-0870","documentHash":"3114978b-eee1-4e88-802f-7d034c581f01"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc0","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Niemczuk","uuid":"82AA2E7CCF0C6F87FC9C29C9C294AC35E29D444F944ED9F1FA82BB7FF88B5C2DF9A8411764C95A57F695D0609991E5125471404AD969DADA833F258105E54B44","orcidId":"0000-0003-1611-9770","documentHash":"a1f14ea1-835c-4507-ba6c-be8782ab8fbd"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"63c7aa514097076eb374d2ba","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2022-0070","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2022-0070","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Screening for <i>Coxiella burnetii</i> in dairy cattle herds in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: The intracellular bacterium Coxiella burnetii is the aetiological agent of Q fever, a zoonosis affecting many animal species worldwide. Cattle and small ruminants are considered the major reservoirs of the bacteria and they shed it through multiple routes. Material and Methods: A total of 2,180 sera samples from 801 cattle herds in all Polish voivodeships were tested by ELISA for the presence of specific antibodies. Milk samples were obtained from seropositive cows in 133 herds as part of a separate study. The milk samples were examined by ELISA and real-time PCR tests. Results: Seroprevalence at the animal level was 7.06% and true positive seroprevalence was 6.0% (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1–9.4). Seroprevalence at the herd level was estimated at 11.1% and true positive seroprevalence was 10.5% (95% CI 3.2–15.8). Shedding of the pathogen in milk was detected by real-time PCR in 33 out of 133 tested herds (24.81%, 95% CI 17.74–33.04%) and the presence of C. burnetii antibodies was confirmed in 85 of them (63.9%, 95% CI 55.13–72.05%). The highest level of conformity between ELISA and real-time PCR results was obtained for bulk tank milk samples.

Although not all infected animals develop fully symptomatic disease, they constantly spread the virus in the flock. Since the infection is incurable and no vaccine is available, another approach is necessary to control SRLV infections. In recent years, an alternative for culling infected animals has become the approach based on identifying genetic markers for selecting SRLV-resistant individuals. Recent reports revealed several candidates, including gene encoding transmembrane protein 154 (TMEM154). Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are found within this gene in sheep of different breeds, but only some can be considered as resistant markers. This study aimed to investigate the presence of single polymorphic sites in TMEM154 gene in sheep of selected Polish flocks and assess their association with the infection and proviral load in the context of susceptibility to SRLV infection. In total 107 sheep, representing three breeds, were screened for their SRLV infection status by serological and PCR testing. All these animals were also genotyped to characterize the presence of SNPs in TMEM154 gene and estimate their potential of being the SRLV-resistance marker. The frequency of identified alleles differed among breeds. Moreover, the positive association between TMEM154 genotype and SRLV status was found for E35K polymorphism and two polymorphic sites in 5′UTR in one of analyzed breed.

Since its second introduction into Europe (in 2007), the disease has been spreading consistently, and now ASF-free European countries are at risk. Complex interactions between the host’s immune system and the virus have long prevented the development of a safe vaccine against ASF. This study analysed the possibility of neutralisation of the ASFV <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> by sera collected from ASF-survivor animals.\r\nMaterial and Methods: Two pig and three wild boar serum samples were collected from previously selected potential ASF survivors. All sera presented high antibody titres (&gt;5 log<jats:sub>10</jats:sub>/mL). Primary alveolar macrophages were cultured in growth medium containing 10% and 20% concentrations of selected sera and infected with a haemadsorbing ASFV strain (Pol18_28298_O111, genotype II). The progress of infection was investigated under a light microscope by observing the cytopathic effect (CPE) and the haemadsorption phenomenon. Growth kinetics were investigated using a real-time PCR assay.\r\nResults: Haemadsorption inhibition was detected in the presence of almost all selected sera; however, the inhibition of virus replication <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> was excluded. In all samples, a CPE and decreasing quantification cycle values of the viral DNA were found.\r\nConclusion: Anti-ASFV antibodies alone are not able to inhibit virus replication.

Cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2R), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (p21) and matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1) are potential targets for novel anti-tumour therapeutic strategies. This study evaluated by immunohistochemical means the reactivity of p21, MMP-1 and CB2R proteins in association with a three-tier grading system in cutaneous canine MCTs.\r\n\r\nMaterial and Methods\r\nFormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded canine MCTs were processed for histochemical analysis and immunohistochemical staining using antibodies against p21, MMP-1 and CB2R. The results were analysed statistically.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nThe strongest p21 immunolabelling was detected in grade 3 MCTs, while grade 1 tumours showed mild or no detectable p21 immunoreactivity (P-value < 0.001). Strong immunolabelling of MMP-1 was the most common in grade 1 tumours (P-value < 0.001) and CB2R was significantly less frequent in grade 3 tumours than in grade 1 (P-value < 0.001) and grade 2 (P-value < 0.001).\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nHigh immunoreactivity of MMP-1 can be a marker of grade 1 MCTs in dogs, whereas p21 protein overexpression can be a marker of grade 3 canine MCTs. Strong CB2R immunoreactivity with simultaneous underexpression of p21 and high immunoreactivity of MMP-1 proteins may indicate that the use of cannabinoids in grade 1 MCTs in dogs is practicable."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","uid":"bt6mbuLY9Vpc_KWGkV1Lk4w","uuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w

in the pollen diet of managed bee species across European agroecosystems","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Bee-mediated pollination plays a crucial role in sustaining global food production. However, while the demand for these pollination services is increasing, many bee species are in decline. To address this discrepancy, farmers use managed bee species to improve crop pollination. One key factor affecting pollination efficiency is the affinity for the crop of interest (i.e., the extent to which a bee integrates floral resources of a crop into its diet). In this study, we characterised and compared the pollen foraging preferences of three managed bee species: Apis mellifera, Bombus terrestris, and Osmia bicornis, across European agricultural landscapes and across biogeographic regions. Managed populations of each bee species were experimentally established at 128 agricultural sites growing either apple or rapeseed, in landscapes representing gradients in terms of the proportion of cropland, in eight European countries. We conducted pollen store sampling and employed palynological analyses to describe the foraging preferences of these species and to extrapolate their suitability as pollinators for both crops. Our findings reveal that A. mellifera and B. terrestris exhibited a more generalised pollen diet compared to O. bicornis, which showed stronger preference to certain pollen forage plants, but these were mainly non-crop rather than crop plants. These results question the relevance of using O. bicornis in apple orchards and rapeseed crops given their poor affinity with these crops. Overall, A. mellifera collected the highest proportion of rapeseed pollen in its diet, and A. mellifera and B. terrestris collected higher proportions of apple pollen than O. bicornis. Our findings also highlight substantial variation in the percentage of focal crop pollen in the diet across biogeographic regions, while landscape composition had virtually no impact. These results provide valuable insights for selecting the most suitable managed bee species to enhance the pollination of two key crops in Europe."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709486878c28a0473bef2a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"383","pagesFromTo":"109518","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772ae","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772af","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772b0","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772b1","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772b2","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772b3","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772b4","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772b5","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772b6","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772b7","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772b8","5e709486878c28a0473bef2a","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772b9","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772ba","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772bb","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772bc","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772bd","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772be","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772bf","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772c0","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772c1","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772c2","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772c3","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772c4","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772c5","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772c6","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772c7","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772c8","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772c9","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772ca","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772cb","67c074bbfdbe8328ca6772cc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476f23","mniswId":"674","title":"AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT","issn":"0167-8809","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"bd15ebad-43e4-44a5-b1bd-93b697b4eeb7"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Managed pollinator","Floral choice","Apple orchard","Rapeseed crop","Crop pollination","Bee"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060703186"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d47","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Nawrocka","uuid":"EBE32826F2491E214CA0AFC4EEA02786FEA4A499AF027659085E6926AF5823B364154DB516E1E0DDAF195E1E849947670A95C606ADD8B170A79D3E1144B3DE3B","orcidId":"0000-0003-3081-7727","documentHash":"53491847-cc60-4f79-bb1f-a22d3a13c011"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5ca4","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Kozdruń","uuid":"92417BFED8719CCDFD4C817BFF825E8DF8211DEB1B193FBEB8B9342F72B6CFB5A5668B33A83590A195BB8C4302D6703499EF982E33705E65072F2A5B25651ADB","orcidId":"0000-0003-2747-3804","documentHash":"e55d11c0-58ff-486f-aa9c-0edbe60eab6b"}],"objectId":"67c069ecfdbe8328ca67013f","publicUri":"https://polskie-drobiarstwo.pl","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Toksykologia weterynaryjna w hodowli drobiu – cz.

attribution of human Campylobacter infection: a multi-country model in the European Union","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Infections caused by Campylobacter spp. represent a severe threat to public health worldwide. National action plans have included source attribution studies as a way to quantify the contribution of specific sources and understand the dynamic of transmission of foodborne pathogens like Salmonella and Campylobacter. Such information is crucial for implementing targeted intervention. The aim of this study was to predict the sources of human\ncampylobacteriosis cases across multiple countries using available whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data and explore the impact of data availability and\nsample size distribution in a multi-country source attribution model.\nMethods: We constructed a machine-learning model using k-mer frequency patterns as input data to predict human campylobacteriosis cases per source.\nWe then constructed a multi-country model based on data from all countries.\nResults using different sampling strategies were compared to assess the impact of unbalanced datasets on the prediction of the cases.\nResults: The results showed that the variety of sources sampled and the quantity of samples from each source impacted the performance of the model. Most cases were attributed to broilers or cattle for the individual and multi-country models. The proportion of cases that could be attributed with 70% probability to a source decreased when using the down-sampled data set (535 vs. 273 of 2627 cases). The baseline model showed a higher sensitivity compared to the down-sampled model, where samples per source were more evenly distributed. The proportion of cases attributed to non-domestic source was higher but varied depending on the sampling strategy. Both models showed that most cases could be attributed to domestic sources in each country (baseline: 248/273 cases, 91%; down-sampled: 361/535 cases, 67%;).\nDiscussion: The sample sizes per source and the variety of sources included in the model influence the accuracy of the model and consequently the\nuncertainty of the predicted estimates. The attribution estimates for sources with a high number of samples available tend to be overestimated, whereas\nthe estimates for source with only a few samples tend to be underestimated.\nReccomendations for future sampling strategies include to aim for a more balanced sample distribution to improve the overall accuracy and utility of source attribution efforts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny -

Material and Methods: Overall, 74 samples of wolf faeces were examined with a multiplex PCR and a system of real-time quantitative PCR methods to detect and identify Echinococcus spp. The faeces were additionally examined microscopically. Also, 20 samples of wolf intestines were examined with a sedimentation and counting technique (SCT). Results: Echinococcus multilocularis DNA was detected in 6.8% and E. granulosus s.l. (identified as E. ortleppi) in 4.1% of faeces samples. Taenia spp. DNA was found in 43.2% and Mesocestoides in 4.1%. Examination of the intestines by SCT showed E. multilocularis worms in 10%, E. granulosus s.l. (E. ortleppi) in10%, Taenia spp. in 100%, hookworms in 30%, Alaria alata in 20%, Mesocestoides sp. in 10%, Trichuris vulpis in 15%, Molineus sp. in 5% and Euryhelmis sp. in 5%. By coproscopy, Capillariidae eggs were found in 59% of faeces samples. Genetic analysis of E. multilocularis worms showed the presence of two European haplotypes previously described in Poland in red foxes and pigs. Sequences of nad1 obtained from E. ortleppi worms shared full identity with a sequence from a human case in Poland. Conclusion: The study showed the presence of E. multilocularis in wolves for the first time in Poland and confirmed our earlier observations on E. ortleppi. This double threat from Echinococcus in this wolf population should be taken into account when assessing the epidemiological risk. The study enriched the knowledge of other helminths found in wolves, also those (Euryhelmis) that were recorded for the first time in this species."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d79","61de4b387523403b69b1ed6b","5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c5","5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","5e709341878c28a0473a5b50"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"68","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"539-549","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","61de4b387523403b69b1ed6b","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d79","5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c5","5e709341878c28a0473a5b50"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research","issn":"2450-7393","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c3fc9638-cd0e-40bb-89b9-22dee2de8b67"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Echinococcus","wolf","Canis lupus","helminths"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060703265"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9","name":"Monika","lastName":"Olech","uuid":"9B0A0406A7EDD36FA4801C73080BC03B173E473705A47493F0C38433544479A4BC660CBD60F16ACD61F83868583404238E4E4A1F03B9A0CA29DCC3BD5AAC93DD","orcidId":"0000-0002-8356-5423","documentHash":"0959a77d-a9cb-4a8e-bec6-b983807c59b8"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cad","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Kuźmak","uuid":"DCBC0C5773B0C346D5DBB40E3262D8E29184B62793C0D18E82B24E595E4F33FDCB74C41AEC4D6B60F253051482EC522138B936B5ED82B4345F33391A0BD19DAB","orcidId":"0000-0003-2034-0988","documentHash":"b123658e-4d9a-4155-9ddf-df23aa13556a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"APRIL","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"665ee0ae4097073a823f46c8","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2024-0025","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2024-0025","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Comparison of serological and molecular methods for differentiation between genotype A and genotype B strains of small ruminant lentiviruses","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLV) cause multisystemic, degenerative and chronic disease in sheep and goats.\nThere are five genotypes (A, B, C, D and E), of which A and B are the most widespread.

Because honey is a popular constituent of the human diet, it is relevant to warrant the safety of the product. For that reason, a method for simultaneous determination of PAs and TAs in honey based on liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry was developed. Material and Methods: The analytical protocol used sulphuric acid extraction and solid-phase extraction  purification.  The  developed  procedure  was  subjected  to  validation  in  terms  of  linearity,  selectivity,  repeatability, reproducibility, limits of quantification and determination, matrix effect and uncertainty. A total of 29 honey samples were analysed for  the  determination  of PAs  and  TAs. Results: All  the  evaluated  validation parameters  fulfilled  the  requirements  of  European Commission  Decision  2002/657/EC.  At  least  one  of  the  monitored  alkaloids  was  determined  in  52%  of  the  samples.  Among  the  most  abundant  alkaloids  were  echimidine,  intermedine  and  lycopsamine.  The  total  PA  concentrations  ranged  from  2.2  to  147.0 μg  kg−1.  Contrastingly,  none  of  the  monitored  TAs  was  detected  in  the  analysed  samples.  An  assessment  of  the  dietary exposure to PAs from the consumption of the contaminated honeys showed that three of them would pose a risk to consumers, especially if they were children. Conclusion: A sensitive method suitable for simultaneous determination of PAs and TAs in honey was developed and validated. The analysis of 29 honey samples for PAs and TAs revealed that honey destined for retail could pose a risk to consumers"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d5f","5e709342878c28a0473a5caf"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"66","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"235-243","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d5f","5e709342878c28a0473a5caf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research (Poland)","issn":"2450-7393","eissn":"2450-8608","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"5a3ef30a-e992-42a0-a40a-ad7662219310"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pyrrolizidine  alkaloids","tropane  alkaloids","honey","liquid chromatography–mass  spectrometry (LC-MS)","solid-phase extraction"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060703480"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60a5da029543c758682b63bb","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Czerski","uuid":"29449EF4617421EA204FABB8273D12D92515C40AC3CF73B65719D9C3CCB465A2EBE5F862A17E366D315444131610E3C299088015E2B3FBABE7E09EE99EF7CD20","documentHash":"e2071e2c-bcf4-4df6-823f-6c5d8ec1b15c"},{"objectId":"5e709498878c28a0473c01d0","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Gembal","uuid":"91B91AB14982BDBBE18CC0A310AB4EC1B50275CD94626D67541A12AAEDD46E22BB2184C3C9C26B34961CFEFCB1ACF2B34FA2BEB244F8C5CCFFF4363C31531C76","documentHash":"e7a26224-3e03-40a6-8454-431b08db6a7b"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c4","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Warenik-Bany","uuid":"4712B9142F37DE7444F67A0D87EE1C663B7551CC5403CE356609DD8451AC163AE66C02975F4E46C75BA54D138152C7CA025EC98E7A9BBC1C46CE7FDB9A2F3D49","orcidId":"0000-0002-3839-6464","documentHash":"a8205408-5907-4d58-85e1-a99171e81d41"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"MAY","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"663b49814097070c4ce3d282","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2024-0026","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2024-0026","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Caesium-137 in the muscles of game animals in 2015-2022 – levels and time trend","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Radioactive caesium-137 occurring in the environment may be taken up by plants and animals and pose \na trophic threat to humans. Game animals living in forest ecosystems are very good bioindicators of the level of environmental contamination by ionising radiation. The main species measurably exposed to caesium-137 are the wild boar (Sus scrofa), the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), and the red deer (Cervus elaphus). The study determined the levels of Cs-137 in muscle samples of these game animals in 2015–2022. Material and Methods: Using gamma radiation spectrometry, 858 samples of game animal muscle tissue were examined: 508 wild boar, 145 roe deer and 205 red deer samples. Results: Concentrations of Cs-137 varied widely (from minimum detectable activity (MDA) values to over 4,000 Bq/kg). In 63.4% of cases, the obtained concentrations exceeded the MDA. The permissible limit (600 Bq/kg for food) was exceeded in nine wild boar muscle samples, whereas it was not even exceeded once in roe or red deer muscle. The average concentration in wild boar was three times higher than in roe and red deer and amounted to 42.84 Bq/kg. The highest concentration of Cs-137 in wild boar muscle was 4,195 ± 372.0 Bq/kg, in roe deer muscle it was 111.5 ± 12.50 Bq/kg, and in red deer muscle was 86.70 ± 3.470 Bq/kg. Conclusion: The seven years’ data indicate that wild boar absorb the most caesium-137 among game animals. The concentrations of Cs-137 in the muscle of game animals in the years 2015–2022 were at a nearly constant level, a very slow diminution being noticeable over time in roe and red deer muscle."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70947c878c28a0473be3c4","5e709498878c28a0473c01d0","60a5da029543c758682b63bb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"68","issue":"2","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60a5da029543c758682b63bb","5e709498878c28a0473c01d0","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research","issn":"2450-7393","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"c3fc9638-cd0e-40bb-89b9-22dee2de8b67"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cs-137","contamination","game animals","concentration factors","effective equivalent dose"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060706127"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6391a50d40970764e07bd989","name":"Marta","lastName":"Antas","documentHash":"b4a3a7c8-a639-4992-b32e-83e1fbc33817"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9","name":"Monika","lastName":"Olech","uuid":"9B0A0406A7EDD36FA4801C73080BC03B173E473705A47493F0C38433544479A4BC660CBD60F16ACD61F83868583404238E4E4A1F03B9A0CA29DCC3BD5AAC93DD","orcidId":"0000-0002-8356-5423","documentHash":"0959a77d-a9cb-4a8e-bec6-b983807c59b8"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d4e","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szczotka-Bochniarz","uuid":"5A50EFE8836EA63AA5BA231195E3DDEB25840BF56F1B77D19D94CD5E6748C7E4E32CFF39CFC6D8497A6D9A3C605C8A92492E03B7B9C14044428FA1775ABD8590","orcidId":"0000-0001-8422-6848","documentHash":"cc1ff5e7-22b6-4115-a0ab-d029278b2b6f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"AUGUST","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"6391a50d40970764e07bd988","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2022-0051","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2022-0051","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Characterisation of ORF3, M, N and E gene sequences of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus from domestic pigs in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is an enteric pathogen causing porcine epidemic diarrhoea and acute gastroenteritis in pigs of all ages. Previous analysis of the viral genome of PEDV in Poland was only based on the spike protein (S)  gene  sequences and  no  analysis  of  other  genes  has  been  performed.  The  aim  of  this  study  was  to  analyse  the  envelope  (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) protein and open reading frame 3 (ORF3) gene sequences. Material and Methods: Viral RNA from 18 Polish pig faecal samples that were quantitative reverse transcription PCR-positive for PEDV was analysed in four genomic  regions  (E,  M,  N  and  ORF3). Results: Phylogenetic analysis based on these regions’ sequences revealed that Polish PEDV isolates were highly related and were clustered into group G2a across the four genes compared. Moreover, the Polish strains were located in distinct subclusters on the phylogenetic trees, which suggests the presence of at least three independently evolving PEDV genetic lines circulating in Poland. The occurrence of unique mutations in the sequences of Polish PEDV strains suggests that PEDV continues to undergo evolutionary processes, accumulating the mutations necessary for viral fitness in its natural hosts. The Polish PEDV strains differed genetically from the CV777 vaccine strain, suggesting the risk of relatively low vaccine efficacy if this strain is used. Conclusion: Our results promote a better understanding of the genetic diversity of PEDV field isolates in Poland and highlight the importance of molecular characterisation of PEDV field strains for the development of an effective vaccine against PEDV."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d4e","5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"66","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"317-324","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8be9","6391a50d40970764e07bd989","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research (Poland)","issn":"2450-7393","eissn":"2450-8608","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"5a3ef30a-e992-42a0-a40a-ad7662219310"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus","E gene","M gene","N gene","ORF3","phylogenetic analysis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060706367"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d59","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Śniegocki","uuid":"DB665422E26B81056458B8092E19440B3E95FAF57D925ECDD96FFE05BB70CDD12EECDC321E4DF3001020CF07EE2E390E7E8CD01C36C7D3C8D23EF3B6280C5442","orcidId":"0000-0003-3564-3279","documentHash":"59f5f7f7-f483-4993-8c96-f3d0ac07462f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"MAY","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"62baa25e409707490d795ad6","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2022-0028","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2022-0028","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis of carvacrol in chicken tissues","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Carvacrol is an essential oil derived from oregano that is used as a natural additive to improve the efficiency of livestock nutrition.

The most prevalent resistance genes found in both bacterial species were tet(M) (43.2%) and vgaA (22.2%). Enterococci from dairy products are confirmed to be a potential source of the spread of antimicrobial resistance, MDR strains, and virulence and resistance genes. This study highlights several aspects of the virulence and pathogenicity of E. faecalis and E. faecium isolated from dairy products—aspects which are indications for their ongoing monitoring."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61de4b387523403b69b1edcc","609b46f89543c73526c48db4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"4116","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["609b46f89543c73526c48db4","61de4b387523403b69b1edcc","5e709342878c28a0473a5d35"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"Foods","issn":"2304-8158","eissn":"2304-8158","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"827d8888-1217-4c9f-a068-b8a2e5756417"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63b2ac094097074fedfdff33","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"24","documentHash":"2b4ca8ba-cea3-45ea-81aa-8deae7b50f8d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Enterococcus faecium","Enterococcus faecalis","dairy","resistance genes","antimicrobial resistance","virulence genes","multidrug resistant strains","MDR"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060708758"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61de4b387523403b69b1edcc","name":"Magadalena","lastName":"Łuszczyńska","uuid":"460B4EB2281097EDE4BC091338F5849D618099FB79FC31DCE87DF1513FB9F3CF3270CA028BFAE47E2E20E01533E81A79BF9DD71AA9FC55E5EEDA73F23F4BDCF3","documentHash":"e443efe1-0fc8-464f-b379-0bc97f75a310"},{"objectId":"609b46f89543c73526c48db4","name":"Marlena","lastName":"Gołaś-Prądzyńska","uuid":"316222104AC0CCD68AB8DC37DD51D8D1E7496B372B37FB0F7682C07E819CC91DF6F14528267AB157FAB81509481A462641D9487F79FD661C53A673B8B969868C","documentHash":"4df7c927-2750-4b55-9c45-e38612bd9077"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d35","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Rola","uuid":"00705ED7DBDE5B13952A6D779C93A586FBF4EC024B6F737D64401FCEFE4207F9D59EA740455444C1657EBE6EC800A08C759D963F757348A6683D18938285CCCE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6972-5152","documentHash":"cd369e20-adc3-4a3f-9cfd-095994db2c1a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"AUGUST","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"633c0b504097074f7350235c","doi":"10.3390/foods11172635","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/11/17/2635/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Control of Residues of Antimicrobial Substances by Screening Methods in Raw Milk Based on Participation in Proficiency Tests in Poland, 2017–2021","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Proficiency testing (PT) is an important tool for evaluation of the competences of laboratories which test milk for residues of antimicrobial substances.

Despite the near-complete elimination of the disease from cattle breeding in Poland achieved in 2009, its re-emergence is now observed. Globally, the number of human cases is underestimated and the importance of free-living animals as reservoirs of tuberculosis is growing. As a species highly susceptible to Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex infection, the European bison (Bison bonasus) has a role in the transmission of the disease in Poland. The purpose of the investigation was to assess the epidemiological situation of tuberculosis in Polish European bison serologically.\r\n\r\nA total of 460 serum samples were collected from 436 European bison from 15 out of 26 national populations between 2013 and 2020. An M. bovis ELISA was used, and its sensitivity and specificity were assessed with an eyelid tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon gamma release assay (IGRA).\r\n\r\nMycobacterium bovis antibodies were detected in nine serum samples. The presence of antibodies was found in two animals from the Białowieża Forest (1.2% of the population), and one each from the Borecka Forest (2.4%) and the Warsaw Zoo (14.3%). One European bison among the 14 sampled (7.1%) from Smardzewice was positive on five occasions.

However, it is also a component of the gastrointestinal (GI) microflora (i.e., microbiota) of sick and healthy humans and animals. C. perfringens is linked with different systemic and enteric diseases in livestock and humans, such as gas gangrene, food poisoning, non-foodborne diarrhoea, and enterocolitis. The strains of this opportunistic pathogen are known to secrete over 20 identified toxins that are considered its principal virulence factors. C. perfringens belongs to the anaerobic bacteria community but can also survive in the presence of oxygen. The short time between generations, the multi-production capability of toxins and heat-resistant spores, the location of many virulence genes on mobile genetic elements, and the inhabitance of this opportunistic pathogen in different ecological niches make C. perfringens a very important microorganism for public health protection. The epidemiological evidence for the association of these strains with C. perfringens–meditated food poisoning and some cases of non-foodborne diseases is very clear and well-documented. However, the genetic diversity and physiology of C. perfringens should still be studied in order to confirm the importance of suspected novel virulence traits. A very significant problem is the growing antibiotic resistance of C. perfringens strains.

This biogenic amine is formed as a result of histidine decarboxylation by bacterial decarboxylases present in food, including fish and fish products. The aim of this study was to investigate the content of histamine at different production stages of canned, marinated and smoked fish. Material and Methods: Raw fish, semi-finished fish products, and the final products of the same production batches were collected between 2019 and 2022 from different fish production facilities in Poland. A total of 133 raw fish samples and 76 smoked fish, 54 brined fish, 39 canned fish and 18 marinated fish final products were analysed using high performance liquid chromatography with a diode array detector. Results: Histamine was identified in 55 (17.2%) out of 320 tested samples, including 8 samples of raw fish with a histamine level above 100 mg/kg. However, no samples of fish products had histamine content above the Commission limit. Conclusion: The obtained results show that fish products on the Polish market are generally safe for consumers in regard to histamine intoxication risk."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["609baaf79543c73526c48dd8","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e0f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"66","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"599-604","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["609baaf79543c73526c48dd8","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e0f","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research (Poland)","issn":"2450-7393","eissn":"2450-8608","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"5a3ef30a-e992-42a0-a40a-ad7662219310"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["histamine","fish products","HPLC-DAD","food safety"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060718822"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677301abfdbe831a389ef8ae","name":"Amnart","lastName":"Poapolathep","documentHash":"ff7b9662-70a1-429c-927a-fb7613e0f72d"},{"objectId":"677301abfdbe831a389ef8ab","name":"Mario","lastName":"Giorgi","documentHash":"304dde5f-477c-4766-8b7d-2c9df6e38227"},{"objectId":"677301abfdbe831a389ef8aa","name":"Charbel","lastName":"Fadel","documentHash":"757429c2-3922-4e48-8e4d-abca15a8834f"},{"objectId":"677301abfdbe831a389ef8a9","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Bourdo","documentHash":"7f8e7b7c-ae6f-4f48-8461-f547c2806d9b"},{"objectId":"65c6edb940e3ff0466a3d99a","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Bilecka","uuid":"8A0D8EBA2A40B203527619F5CF551C9A2AA6F41B3E386A9C4122BD15681901F12C99AF759DCF7E33BE5CA8F663EFBEB4DD098361AB2ED8AE4AD0521399A77C85","documentHash":"1fa9a7e0-5bb9-4188-8115-1476dedbd1fe"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b5c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Gajda","uuid":"737BA79C0CDDEA58062EFA3DAF7A11C5B7A456F7185DF5693B57EE4097ED5366D5B5D9FD97385488431E06665C388F3163A713C9B3DC06F30B91B586578814C9","orcidId":"0000-0003-2895-4482","documentHash":"c782825e-7075-4034-aef9-edf206624991"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a047390983","name":"Beata","lastName":"Łebkowska-Wieruszewska","uuid":"7E4E56BE8712FC4ECA0C2EBDA99B1787493DF2AD538B832069421B70F6F8C25F48ECCF8522E29C06D02AAAEF749A70A27BDE8DF9C6C26517E6C24B3DC99C5F47","orcidId":"0000-0002-1569-0599","documentHash":"4f2a258c-3dfd-40e4-ad01-fc72731ded64"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67179372fdbe83553deb2eba","doi":"10.1016/j.tvjl.2024.106245","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023324001849?via%3Dihub","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Pharmacokinetics and tissue residues of colistin following intravenous, and single and repeated oral dosing in domestic geese (Anser anser domesticus)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Colistin, also known as polymyxin E, is a member of the polymyxin group of antibiotics. It is approved in Europe to treat enteric infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, in poultry, although the similarity of infections between species make it likely used off-label in geese as well.This study investigated the pharmacokinetics and tissue residues of colistin in geese through in vivo experiments. The study involved longitudinal open studies on 16 healthy adult male geese, divided into three phases separated by one-month washout period. Geese were administered colistin via intravenous (IV, 1 mg/kg), single oral (PO, 30 mg/kg), and multiple oral (SID, 2.5 mg/kg for five consecutive days) routes, with blood samples drawn at specific intervals. Tissue samples were also collected at pre-assigned times for subsequent analysis. Colistin levels in geese plasma were quantified using a fully validated UHPLC-MS/MS method.\r\nPlasma concentrations could be quantified up to 24 h for the single PO (n= 2) and IV (n= 4) routes, and up to 10 h (n= 6) from the last dose administered for the multiple PO route (n=6). The bioavailability was significantly low, averaging 3 %. The terminal half-life in geese was 2.18 h following IV administration, similar to values found in other avian species. Following IV administration, clearance and volume of distribution values were 0.11 mL⋅h⁻¹⋅g⁻¹ and 0.41 mL⋅g⁻¹, respectively. The body extraction ratio was low at 0.2 %, indicating minimal hepatic and renal elimination of colistin. Multiple oral doses showed no plasma accumulation, and tissue levels consistently remained below the maximum residue limit (MRL) set for food-producing animals. This study highlights the minimal systemic bioavailability and tissue penetration of colistin in geese, consistent with findings in other poultry and mammals. Future research should focus on intestinal colistin content in geese to optimize dosing strategies and minimize anti-microbial resistance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","uid":"bt6mbuLY9Vpc_KWGkV1Lk4w","uuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Lublinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["677301abfdbe831a389ef8a9","5e709225878c28a047390983"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["65c6edb940e3ff0466a3d99a","5e709341878c28a0473a5b5c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"308","pagesFromTo":"106245","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709225878c28a047390983","677301abfdbe831a389ef8a9","677301abfdbe831a389ef8aa","677301abfdbe831a389ef8ab","5e709341878c28a0473a5b5c","65c6edb940e3ff0466a3d99a","677301abfdbe831a389ef8ae"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a65","mniswId":"20098","title":"Veterinary Journal","issn":"1090-0233","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"34abfdb2-5723-434e-97d6-389f60741030"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060718979"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d4f","name":"Maria","lastName":"Szczotka","uuid":"ADF16A0DC33C7E23F46E1C620BBE349C2AB6A18A9C9909107A228536F5F1742277D154D2DCD82C6537D2A8632E5C4391955675EADA516AAA2CDFD89BA5D564C5","orcidId":"0000-0002-7636-296X","documentHash":"ebfccb1f-95d9-4d87-86f7-3bbcd1ac8dd1"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cad","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Kuźmak","uuid":"DCBC0C5773B0C346D5DBB40E3262D8E29184B62793C0D18E82B24E595E4F33FDCB74C41AEC4D6B60F253051482EC522138B936B5ED82B4345F33391A0BD19DAB","orcidId":"0000-0003-2034-0988","documentHash":"b123658e-4d9a-4155-9ddf-df23aa13556a"}],"objectId":"63ad85694097070d11bed83e","doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2022-0035","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2022-0035","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Expression of bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) gp51 protein in blood and milk cells of cows with leukosis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Bovine  leukaemia  virus  (BLV)  is  the  retroviral  causative  agent  of  enzootic  bovine  leukosis,  the  most common  neoplastic  disease  of  cattle  and  a  serious  problem  worldwide.  Its  diagnosis is  commonly  by  tests  for  antibodies recognising the p24 capsid protein and structural glycoprotein (gp) 51. With flow cytometry recently having come to veterinary immunology,  applications  for  it  may  now  include  BLV.  The  study  determined  BLV  gp51  expression  in  blood  and  milk lymphocytes of naturally infected cows by flow cytometry. Material and Methods: Nineteen Polish Black and White Lowland breed  cows  aged  4–9  years and naturally  infected  with  BLV  and  ten  uninfected  counterparts  had  blood  and  milk  sampled and cultured.  The  immunological  status  of  the  animals  was  confirmed  with  ELISA  and  PCR.  Dual-colour  flow  cytometry  analysis was  performed  with  specific  monoclonal  antibodies  for  lymphocyte  cluster  of  differentiation  (CD)  markers  and  gp51  viral envelope  protein  and  conjugates  labelled  with  fluorescein  isothiocyanate  or  phycoerythrin.  Bovine  leukaemia  virus  gp51  was confirmed  in  lymphocytes  by  immunofluorescence  with  anti-gp51  monoclonal  antibodies. Results: The  gp51  antigen  was detected in blood and milk lymphocytes of infected cows, but the percentage of cells expressing it in milk was much lower than in  blood.  A  depleted  number  of  CD4+  lymphocytes,  an  augmented  number  of  CD8+  lymphocytes,  a  lower  ratio  of  CD4+  to CD8+  and  a  proliferation  of  CD19+  immunoglobulin  M+  cells  were  also  found. Conclusion: These  proliferated  cells  were immature, gave no sign of a tendency to differentiation and were characterised by prolonged vitality."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy

analysis of small ruminant lentiviruses originating from naturally infected sheep and goats from Poland based on the long terminal repeat sequences","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"ntroduction: Previous gag and env sequence  studies  placed  Polish  small  ruminant  lentiviruses  (SRLVs)  isolated  from sheep   and   goats   in   subtypes   B1,   B2,   A1,   A5,   A12,   A13,   A16–A18,   A23,   A24   and   A27.   This study   extended   the genetic/phylogenetic analysis of previously identified Polish SRLV strains by contributing long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences. Material  and  Methods: A  total  of  112  samples  were  analysed.  Phylogenetic  analyses  were  carried  out  on  the  LTR  fragment using  the  neighbour-joining,  maximum  likelihood,  and  unweighted  pair  group  method  with  arithmetic  mean  methods. Results: Polish  caprine  and  ovine  LTR  sequences  clustered  within  group  A  and  grouped  in  at  least  10  clusters  (subtypes  A1,  A5,  A12, A13, A16–A18, A23, A24 and A27). Most of the Polish strains (78%) belonged to the same subtype by the indication of the gag, env and  LTR  genomic  regions.  Discrepancies  in  affiliation  depending  on  the  particular  sequence  were  observed  in  24  (21%) strains, most of which came from mixed-species flocks where more than one SRLV genotype circulated. Sequences of the LTR reflected subtype-specific patterns. Several subtype-specific  markers  were identified, e.g. a unique substitution of T to  A in the fifth  position of  the  TATA  box  in  A17,  A27,  A20  and  B3. Conclusion: This  study  provides  valuable  insights  into  the  genetic diversity  of  SRLV  field  strains  in  Poland,  their  phylogenetic  relationships  and  their  position  in  the  recently  established  SRLV classification.

preliminary research","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The hygienic status of arable soils in developed countries has been unknown. In the presented study, preliminary investigation was undertaken to determine the contamination of arable fields in Poland with eggs of parasitic nematodes.The study was conducted from autumn 2021 to spring 2022 in 5 provinces: Dolnośląskie (DS), Mazowickie (MZ), Podlaskie (PL), Pomorskie (PM) and Zachodniopomorskie (ZP). A total of 133 soil samples were collected. Parasitological examination of soil samples was carried out using the PN-Z-19006 method, with confirmed high sensitivity. Parasite eggs were found in a total of 67 samples, of which 56 samples contained eggs of roundworms of  the  genus  Ascaris (an average of 3.29 eggs/100g of soil), 23 contained eggs of whipworms (an average of 1.22 eggs/100g), and 3 contained eggs of To x o ca r a (1 egg/100 g). The percentage of pos-itive samples collected in autumn (53.57%) was higher than the percentage of positive samples collected in spring (48.05%), and this difference was statistically significant (Chi2 test p=0.002). Similarly, the average number of eggs of all three parasite species together in positive samples collected in autumn (3.43 eggs/100 g) was higher than the average number of eggs in samples collect-ed in spring (2.90 eggs/100 g). This difference was statistically significant (Mann-Whitney test p=0.003834). Differences in the percentage of positive samples were also found depending on the region of origin of the samples. The highest percentage of positive samples was found in the PM (85.19%), which is characterized by a 2-5 times higher pig population per 100 ha of agricultural land than in other provinces. The differences in the percentage of positive samples between the PM and other provinces were statistically significant.The conducted research confirms relatively frequent contamina-tion of arable soils with eggs of parasitic intestinal nematodes, al-though the concentration of these eggs in the soil is generally low."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny -

We did a qualitative review of 53 infectious diseases in terrestrial animals with data from DISCONTOOLS, a specialist database and prioritisation model focusing on research gaps for improving infectious disease control in animals. Many diseases do not have any appropriate control tools, but the prioritisation model suggests that we should focus international efforts on Nipah virus infection, African swine fever, contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, peste des petits ruminants, sheeppox and goatpox, avian influenza,\nRift Valley fever, foot and mouth disease, and bovine tuberculosis, for the greatest impact on the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. Easy to use and accurate diagnostics are available for many animal diseases. However, there is an\nurgent need for the development of stable and durable diagnostics that can differentiate infected animals from vaccinated animals, to exploit rapid technological advances, and to make diagnostics widely available and affordable.\nVeterinary vaccines are important for dealing with endemic, new, and emerging diseases. However, fundamental research is needed to improve the convenience of use and duration of immunity, and to establish performant marker vaccines. The largest gap in animal pharmaceuticals is the threat of pathogens developing resistance to available drugs, in particular for bacterial and parasitic (protozoal, helminth, and arthropod) pathogens. We propose and discuss five research priorities for animal health that will help to deliver a sustainable and healthy planet: vaccinology, antimicrobial resistance, climate mitigation and adaptation, digital health, and epidemic preparedness."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d2b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"6","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"e812-e824","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6391b58340970764e07dae43","6391b58340970764e07dae44","6391b58340970764e07dae45","6391b58340970764e07dae46","6391b58340970764e07dae47","6391b58340970764e07dae48","6391b58340970764e07dae49","6391b58340970764e07dae4a","6391b58340970764e07dae4b","6391b58340970764e07dae4c","6391b58340970764e07dae4d","6391b58340970764e07dae4e","6391b58340970764e07dae4f","5e709342878c28a0473a5d2b","6391b58340970764e07dae50","6391b58340970764e07dae51","6391b58340970764e07dae52","6391b58340970764e07dae53"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547eb3d","mniswId":"26781","title":"The Lancet Planetary Health","eissn":"2542-5196","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"d786673b-a005-4cb7-b000-3b7094767cf1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6391b58340970764e07dae42","year":"2022","volume":"6","number":"10","documentHash":"0a7dbf2c-465d-44f3-a654-e368492cc78f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["disease control","prioritisation","animal health"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654668923"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"644629cc4097070d1f50acea","name":"Cairo H.S.","lastName":"Oliveira","documentHash":"d6997032-bb23-4a26-bb9b-8c7c0526ddfe"},{"objectId":"644629cc4097070d1f50ace9","name":"Jenner K.P.","lastName":"Reis","documentHash":"bb0b24da-aa18-4c07-8f1e-928158d72fe7"},{"objectId":"644629cc4097070d1f50ace8","name":"José D.","lastName":"Barbosa","documentHash":"9bdbe257-74a0-495b-bfae-8d793a0e3365"},{"objectId":"644629cc4097070d1f50ace7","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Antos","documentHash":"216ea5ab-ac78-4411-b81a-fc2b18acc3dd"},{"objectId":"644629cc4097070d1f50ace6","name":"Stella F.V.","lastName":"Assunção","documentHash":"60a87953-2d75-4452-8212-0932d547ee9a"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cb1","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Larska","uuid":"B141F329FCEAE537CBBD403DB20EF5682F61733751D3074FAE52498A02662E8A698C6E4BB506A212CBCAAD49E882CE3BC8B3B325375745B32F8A6A5A8D07E028","documentHash":"59dda705-be56-4ee7-9d4e-6b4b6bc19fd5"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","releaseDateMonth":"JULY","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"644629cc4097070d1f50ace5","doi":"10.1590/1678-5150-pvb-6955","publicUri":"http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_pdf&pid=S0100-736X2022000100224&tlng=en","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Diagnosis and phylogenetic analysis of bovine viral diarrhea virus in cattle (Bos taurus) and buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) from the Amazon region and Southeast Brazil","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a highly infectious pathogen that affects bovines\nworldwide leading to great economic impact. Although Brazil has the largest commercial cattle\npopulation throughout the world and an increasing buffalo breeding industry, the country has\nno control or eradication program for BVDV. In this perspective, the aim of this study was to\nevaluate the occurrence of BVDV in cattle and buffaloes from two Brazilian states. Four different\nELISA tests were performed and confirmed by virus neutralization testing (VNT). The presence\nof BVDV antibodies in the serum or plasma from 77 cattle from six herds (ELISA-1 and ELISA-4)\nand from 89 buffaloes from three herds (ELISA-1 through ELISA-4) was detected. Extraction\nof viral RNA was performed from the serum or plasma samples for the detection of BVDV by\nRT-PCR analysis. Amplified nucleotide sequences were used to construct a phylogenetic tree.\nIn cattle, ELISA-1 detected 49.4% of seropositive animals, while ELISA-4 detected 37.7%. In\nbuffaloes, ELISA-1 failed to detect any seropositive animals, while ELISA-2 and ELISA-3 detected\n20.2% of seropositive animals, and ELISA-4 detected 21.3%. Eight of the nine herds tested had\nseropositive animals. The rate of PCR positive animals was 6.5% in cattle and 9% in buffaloes.\nSubtype 1d was found in cattle, and subtypes 1d and 1f were found in buffaloes. This is the first-\ntime subtype 1f has been reported in Brazil. The absence of a control and eradication program\nseems to be favoring the spread of BVDV in the Brazilian herds. In addition, the improvement\nof diagnostic strategies for BVDV in buffaloes are required."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy

neglected zoonosis cystic echinococcosis affects mainly pastoral and rural communities in both low-income and upper-middle-income countries. In Europe, it should be regarded as an orphan and rare disease. Although human cystic echinococcosis is a notifiable parasitic infectious disease in most European countries, in practice it is largely\nunder-reported by national health systems. To fill this gap, we extracted data on the number, incidence, and trend of human cases in Europe through a systematic review approach, using both the scientific and grey literature and accounting for the period of publication from 1997 to 2021. The highest number of possible human cases at the national level was calculated from various data sources to generate a descriptive model of human cystic echinococcosis in Europe. We identified 64 745 human cystic echinococcosis cases from 40 European countries. The mean annual\nincidence from 1997 to 2020 throughout Europe was 0·64 cases per 100 000 people and in EU member states was 0·50 cases per 100 000 people. Based on incidence rates and trends detected in this study, the current epicentre of cystic echinococcosis in Europe is in the southeastern European countries, whereas historical endemic European Mediterranean countries have recorded a decrease in the number of cases over the time."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut

causing gastrointestinal infections in people. Pigs and pig meat are a major source of infection. Although farm biosecurity is believed to be important for controlling Salmonella transmission, robust evidence is lacking on which measures are most effective. This study enrolled 250 pig farms across nine European countries. From each farm, 20 pooled faecal samples (or similar information) were collected and analysed for Salmonella presence. Based on the proportion of positive results, farms were categorised as at higher or lower Salmonella risk, and associations with variables from a comprehensive questionnaire investigated. Multivariable analysis indicated that farms were less likely to be in the higher-risk category if they had ‘<400 sows’; used rodent baits close to pig enclosures; isolated stay-behind (sick) pigs; did not answer that the hygiene lock/ anteroom was easy to clean; did not have a full perimeter fence; did apply downtime of at least 3 days between farrowing batches; and had fully slatted flooring in all fattener buildings. A principal components analysis assessed the sources of variation between farms, and correlation between variables. The study results suggest simple control measures that could be prioritised on European pig farms to control Salmonella."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy

dis-\ntribution data in southern Poland and bordering areas of the Czech Republic, Germany and Slovakia, in June and September–\nNovember 2023. Because of the suspected occurrence of Aedes japonicus or Ae. koreicus in Poland, provided by a photo posted\nearly 2022 on iNaturalist, we targeted the exotic Aedes species in our sampling strategy, but also collected data on other mos-\nquito species. Besides some adult catches, we mainly collected mosquito immature stages from artificial and natural water\ncontainers but occasionally from other aquatic habitats. In addition, we collated citizen data and modelled the distribution of\nAe. japonicus in Europe incorporating the newly collected data. During this snapshot field study, a total of 162 samples, including\n139 yielding mosquitoes, were taken from 111 locations across 47 administrative units, resulting on the detection of 22 mosquito\ntaxa. Our study provides the first substantiated records of Ae. japonicus and Anopheles petragnani in Poland (the second con-\nfirmed by molecular identification). While Ae. japonicus is clearly established over a large part of the country, no other exotic\nmosquito species was detected. The presence of Ae. japonicus was also confirmed at one location by four citizen records submit-\nted to MosquitoAlert in 2023. Regarding native mosquitoes, we identified their presence in 127 species/NUTS3 combinations\n(113 for Poland, including a single record for An. petragnani). An updated modelling of the distribution of Ae. japonicus suggests\nhigher environment suitability in Central and Eastern Europe than has been previously estimated.

The wide range of biological properties of allicin provides the basis for its potential use as an alternative to antibiotic growth promoters that are currently prohibited in farm animal breeding. Among the many benefits resulting from the use of allicin in animal breeding, especially poultry, its modulating effect on intestinal microbiota, which includes the anaerobic spore-forming bacteria of the genus Clostridium spp., seems to be important. The material for this study consists of intestinal content collected from the caecums of Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica). Culture methods were used to isolate the strains, and the obtained isolates were identified based on their phenotypic characteristics. In addition, PCR methods were used for the detection of the ntnh gene-encoding non-haemagglutinin component of botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs), the detection of individual genes responsible for the production of major toxins by Clostridium perfringens, and the amplification of conservative 16S rDNA genes. The 16S rDNA amplicons were subsequently submitted to Sanger sequencing. The obtained sequences were analyzed using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). The ntnh gene was not found in the genetic material of the isolated strains. Among the isolates suspected of belonging to the Clostridium perfringens species, the plc gene determining the production of the alpha toxin was detected, which justifies the classification of the strains into toxotype A. The Sanger sequencing results confirm the presence of mainly saprophytic species in the studied material. The statistical analysis indicated a statistically significant reduction in the level of Clostridium spp., obtained by the use of an appropriate dose of allicin. The presented research results indicate the significant impact of an appropriate dose of allicin on reducing the occurrence of anaerobic intestinal microbiota, while providing important information on the potential application of this compound in animal production in the
