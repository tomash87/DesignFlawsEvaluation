The aim of this study was to investigate the serum levels of selected chemokines in patients with ovarian cancer or benign ovarian tumors to assess their role in tumorigenesis and their potential use in preoperative diagnosis of an adnexal mass.\n\nMaterial and methods: The study group consisted of 59 women with ovarian cancer: 17 epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients and 42 women with benign ovarian tumors. We measured in sera obtained preoperatively the level of CA125 and a panel of 5 chemokines - CX3CL1/fractalkine, CXCL1/GRO-alpha, CXCL12/SDF-1, CCL20/MIP-3 alpha and IL-17F - using the chemiluminescence method with multiplexed bead based immunoassay.\n\nResults: CX3CL1 was significantly elevated in sera of advanced ovarian cancer patients compared to women with benign ovarian tumors. The significant elevation of CXCL1 was also observed (both early and advanced stages). A similar pattern was present with the standard ovarian cancer marker CA125. In our patients with endometriotic cysts CA125 levels were significantly higher than in women with other benign tumors, whereas all analyzed chemokines had similar serum titers in patients with endometriotic vs. other benign ovarian cysts.\n\nConclusions: CX3CL1 and CXCL1 are elevated in sera of EOC patients, which indicates their role in cancer development. Moreover, they might be useful in preoperative differential diagnosis of ovarian tumors, especially as they were not elevated in cases of endometriosis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b7878c28a04739b4f4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397e5a","5e7092ae878c28a04739a76d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","uid":"b8_88IdVhNl7JcW-ZebuD4Q","uuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Łodzi","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397d7a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","parentUuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","rootUuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"682-689","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62c467d14097077bbdc0fca9","62c467d14097077bbdc0fcaa","5e70928e878c28a047397d7a","62c467d24097077bbdc0fcad","5e7092b7878c28a04739b4f4","5e70928e878c28a047397e5a","5e7092ae878c28a04739a76d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454771a3","mniswId":"1677","title":"Archives of Medical Science","issn":"1734-1922","eissn":"1896-9151","documentHash":"027b7fef-377f-4a76-a3f0-aa5647520ec3"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cee45d4097070a2ca740db","year":"2022","volume":"18","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"f589b714-4937-49b9-931c-19530c16a664"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ovarian cancer","endometriosis","CX3CL1","CXCL1"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145680"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60fa43839543c744c19b0ee5","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Pastwińska","uuid":"14781397C7F7AF97AAEE41496FEC60E4D7EB66B223B6AA98976146E70CC314BDFAB9C8D9BCB0169BC46976667BDB2D975E877D83094AB721BB585FA6A160E38B","documentHash":"b11af012-cc92-49fa-a18a-57f86ca76696"},{"objectId":"5e709326878c28a0473a3b52","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Karwaciak","uuid":"07DCCCF633946D0D382FA333B03FA29532E8FAABCE8B31805A354A7069B3E181D2C04FE9EBA0FE5499A48BB2418D45D0FD64AAD6E3B93DCBE6C29AEA62DC47E9","documentHash":"0c2307a8-e439-4e83-97a9-8842d78c5e45"},{"objectId":"5e709325878c28a0473a3b0d","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Ratajewski","uuid":"B1291B914CCBBB6C14FBE1C256BB487B869EF5824C470D3BC8E042F7037B0D9B1804950A658997EE241528D9DD362A0B61F1CE4E6FA15E8A2174837A8745BE4F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5391-5843","documentHash":"ebcf4e46-75f1-4c03-8489-9f1302e03e9f"},{"objectId":"5e7092d8878c28a04739de9d","name":"Anna","lastName":"Sałkowska","uuid":"DA9A4C69FA7D8B0BD6B07187A06C61FB2083E34F29908EF7E64B000054F258198BB36B88124A64B310B10A1A32ED0F6FA6DA6B3E4EF9C529977B4429B4C432C5","orcidId":"0000-0002-3607-2888","documentHash":"0bbe42c9-0ed8-4e05-a232-08e015ef999f"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b7b0","name":"Kaja","lastName":"Karaś","uuid":"110929C60656ECB7DEF1B7327306C4A1680CE63A323B4B9EFC79C2D5852151F2A150F830C5734163364197B896C5894F11CFBF8ECADE2E4D9A286BFAD04BD0DA","documentHash":"f79970e8-a9cd-47f4-bdb0-ee79e36c8324"}],"objectId":"62c4545a4097077bbdc04196","doi":"10.3390/molecules27123651","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/12/3651/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Chlorpromazine, a Clinically Approved Drug, Inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid-Mediated Induction of IL-6 in Human Monocytes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 virus, led to the unprecedented mobilization of scientists, resulting in the rapid development of vaccines and potential pharmaceuticals. Although COVID-19 symptoms are moderately severe in most people, in some cases the disease can result in pneumonia and acute respiratory failure as well as can be fatal. The severe course of COVID-19 is associated with a hyperinflammatory state called a cytokine storm. One of the key cytokines creating a proinflammatory environment is IL-6, which is secreted mainly by monocytes and macrophages. Therefore, this cytokine has become a target for some therapies that inhibit its biological action; however, these therapies are expensive, and their availability is limited in poorer countries. Thus, new cheaper drugs that can overcome the severe infections of COVID-19 are needed. Here, we show that chlorpromazine inhibits the expression and secretion of IL-6 by monocytes activated by SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleocapsid protein and affects the activity of NF-kappa B and MEK/ERK signaling. Our results, including others, indicate that chlorpromazine, which has been used for several decades as a neuroleptic, exerts antiviral and immunomodulatory activity, is safe and inexpensive, and might be a desirable drug to support the therapy of patients with COVID-19."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709325878c28a0473a3b0d","5e709326878c28a0473a3b52","60fa43839543c744c19b0ee5","5e7092b9878c28a04739b7b0","5e7092d8878c28a04739de9d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"27","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"3651","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709326878c28a0473a3b52","5e7092d8878c28a04739de9d","60fa43839543c744c19b0ee5","5e709325878c28a0473a3b0d","5e7092b9878c28a04739b7b0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":"10.3390/molecules","issn":"","eissn":"1420-3049","documentHash":"309cc425-ebce-4d3c-bb55-f82ad45dc6de"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b1bc6b409707603914f90b","year":"2022","volume":"27","number":"12","documentHash":"aa4370b5-5796-44d9-9754-ca4d07783524"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["SARS-CoV-2COVID-19Interleukin 6monocyteschlorpromazinecytokine storm"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145723"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62c45a214097077bbdc0b5f5","name":"Vladimir","lastName":"Shkumatov","orcidId":"0000-0003-1652-5701","documentHash":"ce44c7fa-a369-4e23-a5cd-e9c45b06d516"},{"objectId":"62c45a214097077bbdc0b5f3","name":"Yaroslav","lastName":"Faletrov","orcidId":"0000-0001-8168-5897","documentHash":"9cd55138-6171-48ae-92fd-0b4d27a28e10"},{"objectId":"62c45a214097077bbdc0b5f0","name":"Anna","lastName":"Gorlova","orcidId":"0000-0002-9478-1236","documentHash":"c4953a5d-db23-4699-a880-fd7b84f18ef3"},{"objectId":"62c45a214097077bbdc0b5ef","name":"Matvey","lastName":"Horetski","orcidId":"0000-0003-3065-6214","documentHash":"d149af49-56a7-4095-8240-2dbda2fa08ef"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af7c4","name":"Renata","lastName":"Płocińska","uuid":"260C9298E1D45B4AC665ADA9F03C09F7680F4A7413A8DFEAD7788AE83643C5029167A1D97878B93A59BFF9F3B96E1DB11BA3326F0842179C66B32A364B525B8C","documentHash":"0d25c373-b5fc-4c41-9a52-c469237e5e59"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b4e8","name":"Anna","lastName":"Brzostek","uuid":"B7CD0B072EAF2F79DF37612BEC4819FA8CD9F6ABB8BEA303376F95940DF0D5C01303A6DBA308A61DF9E46B53778E153D47147B7A2251674D40954D26C4195DE7","orcidId":"0000-0002-7335-9853","documentHash":"f55ae53c-35cf-4a73-ae32-ca74544dbe59"},{"objectId":"5e709229878c28a047390e3e","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Dziadek","uuid":"BE506B6FEF9F09CD0BE65E7F9C32A7B11C89A3F9C02BDC99B8AB6B2055112D48AC75C443975729BB2398B3A2EB6EC7210FF8C57C5231A979DE8B6AD84230B2D2","orcidId":"0000-0003-1427-884X","documentHash":"b50df883-d955-45e2-bc1b-2ad9d404bd73"}],"objectId":"62c45a214097077bbdc0b5ed","doi":"10.1002/slct.202200506","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/slct.202200506","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Synthesis, Optical Properties, Preliminary Antimycobacterial Evaluation and Docking Studies of Trifluoroacetylated 3‐Pyrrolyl Boron‐Dipyrromethene","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article provides the route to trifluoroacetylated fluorescent boron dipyrromethene dye (2). The compound performs intensive absorption and emission bands in near-red wavelength region. Photophysical properties of 2 are investigated in different solvents. A notable increase of fluorescence quantum yield after trifluoroacetyl group insertion connected with a change in intramolecular interactions parameters. The role of molecular geometry aspects in observed photophysical properties and molecular fragments rotation energy barriers are explained by quantum-mechanical calculations. 2 performs considerable antimycobacterial activity. According to molecular docking simulations, 2 is capable of affinity binding in the active sites of mycobacterial MycP1 and MycP3 serine proteases. The geometries of final ligand-protein complexes show the possibility of protein active site covalent modification at the serine residue of the catalytic triad. At lower concentrations, 2 can act as a fluorescent dye for microscopy analysis and corresponding staining patterns are shown for Mycobacterium smegmatis and Staphylococcus aureus cells."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af7c4","5e7092b7878c28a04739b4e8","5e709229878c28a047390e3e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"7","issue":"22","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62c45a214097077bbdc0b5ef","62c45a214097077bbdc0b5f0","5e7093b5878c28a0473af7c4","5e7092b7878c28a04739b4e8","62c45a214097077bbdc0b5f3","5e709229878c28a047390e3e","62c45a214097077bbdc0b5f5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bcc5","mniswId":"3517","title":"ChemistrySelect","doi":"10.1002/slct","issn":"2365-6549","eissn":"2365-6549","websiteLink":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)2365-6549","documentHash":"b30ac168-569f-471f-9654-6b3778d8ee29"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c45a214097077bbdc0b5f7","year":"2022","volume":"7","number":"22","documentHash":"c1d549b2-9713-4c5e-80d9-6baa2c5b1cf7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["AcylationAntibioticsDensity functional calculationsFluorescenceMolecular modeling"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058146361"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62cd84cc4097073c6e324319","name":"Enjuro","lastName":"Harunari","documentHash":"09fd8fc1-2f74-43ea-9ae1-55422fa9318d"},{"objectId":"62cd84cc4097073c6e324318","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Kozłowska","documentHash":"bb801762-598c-47d6-9d2c-faabeb1c7b33"},{"objectId":"60fa43839543c744c19b0ee5","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Pastwińska","uuid":"14781397C7F7AF97AAEE41496FEC60E4D7EB66B223B6AA98976146E70CC314BDFAB9C8D9BCB0169BC46976667BDB2D975E877D83094AB721BB585FA6A160E38B","documentHash":"b11af012-cc92-49fa-a18a-57f86ca76696"},{"objectId":"5e709325878c28a0473a3b0d","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Ratajewski","uuid":"B1291B914CCBBB6C14FBE1C256BB487B869EF5824C470D3BC8E042F7037B0D9B1804950A658997EE241528D9DD362A0B61F1CE4E6FA15E8A2174837A8745BE4F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5391-5843","documentHash":"ebcf4e46-75f1-4c03-8489-9f1302e03e9f"},{"objectId":"5e70930c878c28a0473a1c5e","name":"Aurelia","lastName":"Walczak-Drzewiecka","uuid":"A0029E1AA4C32B8F56A8A5F042C2E85C34503F52486FE0ADC5E3A3C8E3E2849E0E7A3AE71E31E8D6DCCA80E17D3C3E08AB933066C07DBCE9B52CC074D9A1C147","orcidId":"0000-0001-9519-8774","documentHash":"b3faf004-8f76-4769-a33b-22bd5fceed3b"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b4ee","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Dastych","uuid":"49154D22EBCC0F6125273D11FAA5681E62AA2C37B7380B2A7EC473E56FA5A48BC85EA8DDE6E2810CB6FD87CD96E6DF83D3AEE8BD280EC3FDA99BAC167067B7D9","documentHash":"3d88e660-cf56-467e-83b3-263f4975adf3"}],"objectId":"62cd84cc4097073c6e324314","doi":"10.1007/s12026-021-09228-x","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12026-021-09228-x.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Hypoxia modulates human mast cell adhesion to hyaluronic acid","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Hypoxia is an inherent factor in the inflammatory process and is important in the regulation of some immune cell functions, including the expression of mast cell pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. Hypoxia also influences cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Hyaluronic acid is one of the major components of the ECM that is involved in inflammatory and tissue regeneration processes in which mast cells play a prominent role. This prompted us to investigate the effects of hypoxia on the expression of hyaluronic acid receptors in mast cells and mast cell adhesion to this ECM component. We found that human LAD2 mast cells spontaneously adhered to hyaluronic acid in a CD44-dependent manner and that reduced oxygen concentrations inhibited or even completely abolished this adhesion process. The mechanism of hypoxia downregulation of mast cell adhesion to hyaluronic acid did not involve a decrease in CD44 expression and hyaluronidase-mediated degradation of adhesion substrates but rather conformational changes in the avidity of CD44 to hyaluronic acid. Hypoxia-mediated regulation of mast cell adhesion to extracellular matrix components might be involved in the pathogenic accumulation of mast cells observed in the course of certain diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and cancer."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709325878c28a0473a3b0d","60fa43839543c744c19b0ee5","5e70930c878c28a0473a1c5e","5e7092b7878c28a04739b4ee"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"70","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"152-160","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60fa43839543c744c19b0ee5","62cd84cc4097073c6e324318","62cd84cc4097073c6e324319","5e709325878c28a0473a3b0d","5e7092b7878c28a04739b4ee","5e70930c878c28a0473a1c5e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478062","mniswId":"8122","title":"IMMUNOLOGIC RESEARCH","doi":"10.1007/12026.1559-0755","issn":"0257-277X","eissn":"1559-0755","documentHash":"4e512c3d-1054-4646-b90c-271d6b68a8e9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cee2214097070a2ca71cde","year":"2022","volume":"70","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"337e0a71-9930-4da8-8621-2975da9d6e31"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Mast cellsAdhesionHyaluronic acidHypoxiaCD44HMMRRHAMM"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149310"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70930c878c28a0473a1c64","name":"Anna","lastName":"Świerzko","uuid":"F607A9AD44DD025956C1DCA575789D8FDF60BCE55743A280447B043D4CA92902C1F9C7F43BC3D11DE9A9CAF91F7F47A18DEFDBA9DA86E9055304EA61232A0A79","documentHash":"0850f3d1-5b60-45e7-9d35-846f7ff97474"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b4d7","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Cedzyński","uuid":"6A0CFDE9C4E950C8F6A238AC13F5E0800F06AECAB87049D178DAD0D9274F67B085B526368CAF9A425BE07BE9649F915CB670C522B9F194486937A58616C3C529","orcidId":"0000-0002-4486-9256","documentHash":"e9a1bb04-61b8-4bf1-9733-94c3fcc63f9f"}],"objectId":"62c5a7fd4097074de22b942d","doi":"10.3390/cancers14061543","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/14/6/1543/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Components of the Lectin Pathway of Complement in Solid Tumour Cancers","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Simple Summary Cancer is a major cause of human deaths.

ROR gamma T is preferentially expressed in Th17 lymphocytes and drives their differentiation from naive CD4+ cells and is involved in the regulation of the expression of numerous Th17-specific cytokines, such as IL-17. Because Th17 cells are implicated in the pathology of autoimmune diseases (e.g., psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis), ROR gamma T, whose activity is regulated by ligands, has been recognized as a drug target in potential therapies against these diseases. The identification of such ligands is time-consuming and usually requires the screening of chemical libraries. Herein, using a Tanimoto similarity search, we found corosolic acid and other pentacyclic tritepenes in the library we previously screened as compounds highly similar to the ROR gamma T inverse agonist ursolic acid. Furthermore, using gene reporter assays and Th17 lymphocytes, we distinguished compounds that exert stronger biological effects (ursolic, corosolic, and oleanolic acid) from those that are ineffective

excision of lymph nodes from pig carcasses or the thermal processing of pork before consumption. Therefore, the presence of anatomopathological lesions with signs of coagulation necrosis in lymph nodes from pigs during post-mortem inspection is concerning, as is the increasing incidence of mycobacteriosis in humans. Therefore, the aim of the present study is to verify whether mycobacteria can be isolated from tuberculous-like lesions in mandibular lymph nodes in slaughtered pigs, and whether further molecular analysis based on MIRU-VNRT, used to identify mycobacteria from the Mycobacterium avium complex, can indicate zoonotic potential. Forty of the fifty isolates from the lymph nodes with signs of coagulation necrosis were classified as Mycobacterium avium complex. MIRU-VNTR analysis allowed for the isolation of six strains, one of which was classified as M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). Our findings confirm the presence of atypical mycobacteria in the lymph nodes of slaughtered pigs. While the isolated strains (other than MAP) do not pose a significant or direct health risk to consumers, further research and monitoring are necessary. Atypical mycobacteria can cause a wide range of diseases in children and compromised adults, and often show resistance to many classes of antibiotics, including those used to treat tuberculosis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709325878c28a0473a3b0c","5e7092d6878c28a04739dd37"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709325878c28a0473a3b0c","602fa00f9543c7410626f6b4","5e709307878c28a0473a17c9","5e709479878c28a0473bdef3","5e70947f878c28a0473be87a","5e709277878c28a047396370","5e709410878c28a0473b5a55","5e70923a878c28a0473920fd","5e7092d6878c28a04739dd37"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceac","mniswId":"15767","title":"Pathogens","eissn":"2076-0817","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"e3cbc691-2d96-4c17-9b90-bb773e877487"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["food safety","lymph nodes","MIRU-VNTR","Mycobacterium avium","pig slaughter","pork"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058301146"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62c464874097077bbdc0eab5","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Borowiec","documentHash":"96eafba1-9760-4b8a-aa60-a90dd7b54ace"},{"objectId":"62c464874097077bbdc0eab4","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kazimierczak","documentHash":"13163eb6-860d-43b6-b91d-97ebbeadebf7"},{"objectId":"62c464874097077bbdc0eab3","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Matusiak","documentHash":"0a267a94-7aa9-48cf-8d02-890284945156"},{"objectId":"62c464874097077bbdc0eab2","name":"Bogumił","lastName":"Zimoń","documentHash":"304a5b0b-f145-4c96-bef0-231471ea8ade"},{"objectId":"62c464874097077bbdc0eab1","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Guziński","documentHash":"2c99c470-fd2e-49f2-901a-78a08feb5a9b"},{"objectId":"62c464874097077bbdc0eab0","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Wójcik","documentHash":"1e743176-d01d-40b8-9d9e-13d5fb182cc9"},{"objectId":"62c464874097077bbdc0eaaf","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Witaszewska","documentHash":"9bd10d74-cd2f-4129-afda-abc317001806"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b07ac","name":"Michał","lastName":"Różański","uuid":"808508D185FF36C4074713A8F737D0AC899A96D55740FB77D7EE1DFF9C16E5DDB2F73037CB5D78D69D2EB43B9FA8338709AF0C12AA7E9D8980F56BF2882372FD","documentHash":"59472bb8-37d7-4d1f-af10-0e58beef7a6f"},{"objectId":"5e70930c878c28a0473a1c5e","name":"Aurelia","lastName":"Walczak-Drzewiecka","uuid":"A0029E1AA4C32B8F56A8A5F042C2E85C34503F52486FE0ADC5E3A3C8E3E2849E0E7A3AE71E31E8D6DCCA80E17D3C3E08AB933066C07DBCE9B52CC074D9A1C147","orcidId":"0000-0001-9519-8774","documentHash":"b3faf004-8f76-4769-a33b-22bd5fceed3b"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dd36","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Paradowska","uuid":"69B5E361102496BA8BA84672F56AD859441DAD971712B2BB0F889CB5F1A58D697FE7311B64E083453DC9AA40D9B3F0A7723D244ED5C38367E0728B6D7D54BBBC","documentHash":"9439b956-3e6b-4ce1-88bb-03da34d6e891"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b521","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Pawełczyk","uuid":"633D8D3C7A804B6BC2640E8A54B660BEB864E273363AC4430224734EA4936A7BC3C05C9C7B9842B7328C3E7A2D20FCEEE7AC8BB811233FA5F29B616921E30C44","orcidId":"0000-0001-6863-8594","documentHash":"ecc9e6ad-1e61-4b8e-8059-589efd8b53d8"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b4f5","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kania","uuid":"B2FC8BC96F5583258162D45CA3222FD01BCA2886B700F73864B1F94959905B1791B15FD27529FA9A056E1F6CA0D77183CF4AB50EC10AD07E1A04827F8ADB75EF","documentHash":"742a40c9-7072-4ec9-9f74-4c6d4ac3f2aa"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b4ee","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Dastych","uuid":"49154D22EBCC0F6125273D11FAA5681E62AA2C37B7380B2A7EC473E56FA5A48BC85EA8DDE6E2810CB6FD87CD96E6DF83D3AEE8BD280EC3FDA99BAC167067B7D9","documentHash":"3d88e660-cf56-467e-83b3-263f4975adf3"},{"objectId":"5e709229878c28a047390e3e","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Dziadek","uuid":"BE506B6FEF9F09CD0BE65E7F9C32A7B11C89A3F9C02BDC99B8AB6B2055112D48AC75C443975729BB2398B3A2EB6EC7210FF8C57C5231A979DE8B6AD84230B2D2","orcidId":"0000-0003-1427-884X","documentHash":"b50df883-d955-45e2-bc1b-2ad9d404bd73"}],"objectId":"62c464874097077bbdc0eaab","doi":"10.1038/s41598-022-12179-4","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-12179-4.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"RT-qPCR-based tests for SARS-CoV-2 detection in pooled saliva samples for massive population screening to monitor epidemics","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Swab, RT-qPCR tests remain the gold standard of diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2 infections. These tests are costly and have limited throughput. We developed a 3-gene, seminested RT-qPCR test with SYBR green-based detection designed to be oversensitive rather than overspecific for high-throughput diagnostics of populations. This two-tier approach depends on decentralized self-collection of saliva samples, pooling, 1(st)-tier testing with highly sensitive screening test and subsequent 2(nd)-tier testing of individual samples from positive pools with the IVD test. The screening test was able to detect five copies of the viral genome in 10 mu l of isolated RNA with 50% probability and 18.8 copies with 95% probability and reached Ct values that were highly linearly RNA concentration-dependent. In the side-by-side comparison, the screening test attained slightly better results than the commercially available IVD-certified RT-qPCR diagnostic test DiaPlexQ (100% specificity and 89.8% sensitivity vs. 100% and 73.5%, respectively). Testing of 1475 individual clinical samples pooled in 374 pools of four revealed 0.8% false positive pools and no false negative pools. In weekly prophylactic testing of 113 people within 6 months, a two-tier testing approach enabled the detection of 18 infected individuals, including several asymptomatic individuals, with substantially lower cost than individual RT-PCR testing."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii

characterized by myofibroblast activation and excessive extracellular matrix deposition. Systemic sclerosis is a prototypic fibrotic disease in which CXCL4 is increased and strongly correlates with skin and lung fibrosis. Here we aim to elucidate the role of CXCL4 in fibrosis development. CXCL4 levels are increased in multiple inflammatory and fibrotic mouse models, and, using CXCL4-deficient mice, we demonstrate the essential role of CXCL4 in promoting fibrotic events in the skin, lungs, and heart. Overexpressing human CXCL4 in mice aggravates, whereas blocking CXCL4 reduces, bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Single-cell ligand-receptor analysis predicts CXCL4 to affect endothelial cells and fibroblasts. In vitro, we confirm that CXCL4 directly induces myofibroblast differentiation and collagen synthesis in different precursor cells, including endothelial cells, by stimulating endothelial-tomesenchymal transition. Our findings identify a pivotal role of CXCL4 in fibrosis, further substantiating the potential role of neutralizing CXCL4 as a therapeutic strategy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709326878c28a0473a3b26"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"38","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"110189","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63a0a6224097072049a00b44","63a0a6224097072049a00b45","63a0a6224097072049a00b46","63a0a6224097072049a00b47","63a0a6224097072049a00b48","63a0a6224097072049a00b49","63a0a6224097072049a00b4a","63a0a6224097072049a00b4b","63a0a6224097072049a00b4c","63a0a6224097072049a00b4d","63a0a6224097072049a00b4e","63a0a6224097072049a00b4f","63a0a6224097072049a00b50","63a0a6224097072049a00b51","63a0a6224097072049a00b52","63a0a6224097072049a00b53","63a0a6224097072049a00b54","63a0a6224097072049a00b55","63a0a6224097072049a00b57","63a0a6224097072049a00b58","63a0a6224097072049a00b59","63a0a6224097072049a00b5a","63a0a6224097072049a00b5b","63a0a6224097072049a00b5c","63a0a6224097072049a00b5d","5e709326878c28a0473a3b26"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477584","mniswId":"3378","title":"Cell Reports","doi":"","issn":"2211-1247","eissn":"2211-1247","websiteLink":"","documentHash":"609d089b-7a76-49c5-83e5-cc6f18e036da"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63a0a6224097072049a00b43","year":"2022","volume":"38","number":"1","documentHash":"9655b701-575a-4f79-a7f4-8e161f74548f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ENDOTHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITIONSYSTEMIC-SCLEROSISPLATELET ACTIVATIONPROTEOMIC ANALYSISMONOCYTE SURVIVALDENDRITIC CELLSDERMAL FIBROSISPLATELET-FACTOR-4MYOFIBROBLASTEXPRESSION"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058360514"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63a0a87c4097072049a03200","name":"Amir Reza","lastName":"Aref","documentHash":"5ecbf20a-2c8d-40d0-a802-740287b94151"},{"objectId":"63a0a87c4097072049a031ff","name":"Amirhossein","lastName":"Ahmadi","documentHash":"d8d084fc-3b89-445e-bb0d-69bd4e509cdc"},{"objectId":"63a0a87c4097072049a031fe","name":"Asieh","lastName":"Jafarzadeh","documentHash":"b26c802e-8e0d-47c6-9d35-70aa60e55924"},{"objectId":"63a0a87c4097072049a031fd","name":"Atena","lastName":"Mansouri","documentHash":"2a81baa6-2cac-40e8-b666-c581b00b5581"},{"objectId":"63a0a87c4097072049a031fc","name":"Nasim","lastName":"Ebrahimi","documentHash":"6b4e307c-6053-4edf-9449-2630f7381714"},{"objectId":"63a0a87c4097072049a031fb","name":"Seyed Ali","lastName":"Miraghel","documentHash":"d57b1791-e77d-4c9b-ad06-17eb6844fb4e"},{"objectId":"621ee4b97523402df08b96db","name":"Leila","lastName":"Khani Khouzani","uuid":"BA688FCE69F333CE74A325CA443C664B62B71F296179BCA6C7AB2458FD837FBAA82A1DCFC6731EA372A45FD2B665D71E7F3EED1D0D91E81957BC55883EB226EE","documentHash":"a1abc7d3-64d2-4f4c-a7a4-599ad9165f27"}],"objectId":"63a0a87c4097072049a031f9","doi":"10.1016/j.phrs.2021.106041","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1043661821006253?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Crosstalk between non-coding RNAs expression profile, drug resistance and immune response in breast cancer","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Drug resistance is one of the most critical challenges facing researchers in treating breast cancer. Despite numerous treatments for breast cancer, including conventional chemical drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and immunotherapeutic drugs known as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), many patients resist various approaches. In recent years, the relationship between gene expression profiles and drug resistance phenotypes has attracted much attention. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are regulatory molecules that have been shown to regulate gene expression and cell transcriptome. Two categories, microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs have been more considered and studied among these ncRNAs. Studying the role of different ncRNAs in chemical drug resistance and ICI resistance together can be beneficial in selecting more effective treatments for breast cancer. Changing the expression and action mechanism of these regulatory molecules on drug resistance phenotypes is the main topic of this review article."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["621ee4b97523402df08b96db"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"176","pagesFromTo":"106041","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63a0a87c4097072049a031fb","63a0a87c4097072049a031fc","621ee4b97523402df08b96db","63a0a87c4097072049a031fd","63a0a87c4097072049a031fe","63a0a87c4097072049a031ff","63a0a87c4097072049a03200"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479221","mniswId":"15959","title":"Pharmacological Research","issn":"1043-6618","eissn":"1096-1186","documentHash":"78ae2c98-767d-441d-87ee-54d647a89462"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63a0a87c4097072049a031fa","year":"2022","volume":"176","documentHash":"2c7e422c-5d9f-4b4b-b451-5a7d728d3b4f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Breast cancerDrug resistanceImmune checkpoint inhibitorsNcRNAsLncRNAsMicroRNAs"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058375954"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bd99284097073596a651d5","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Żuber","documentHash":"df1ce1c3-1335-4d80-a30c-109c462d0f48"},{"objectId":"63bd99284097073596a651d4","name":"Mikael","lastName":"Skurnik","documentHash":"017e862d-fe20-489d-901f-5a963cce7bf8"},{"objectId":"63bd99284097073596a651d3","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Michalski","documentHash":"8de87e3b-3709-4626-86ac-6c89bb5ca980"},{"objectId":"5e70930c878c28a0473a1c64","name":"Anna","lastName":"Świerzko","uuid":"F607A9AD44DD025956C1DCA575789D8FDF60BCE55743A280447B043D4CA92902C1F9C7F43BC3D11DE9A9CAF91F7F47A18DEFDBA9DA86E9055304EA61232A0A79","documentHash":"0850f3d1-5b60-45e7-9d35-846f7ff97474"},{"objectId":"5e7092eb878c28a04739f3a4","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kasperkiewicz","uuid":"730FD67CC95357723916B3665B186CCF9C21CE08B783FE021F6CDD7A56F05C2B634E13064C0A12BFD1670A44A2385EB78CB7662A4EFBA536A6179299A65A506F","orcidId":"0000-0002-9851-790X","documentHash":"6bfa20ed-dcc7-473a-ac47-8e4181794a2d"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dbb2","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Eppa","uuid":"47DA5C54AFA6B229C8A2D1E26C4777D979F58D88D04E5DF091898D91BAA0E0C913002C81D5CCC1A1F9C827418EA771519028ADAC78FCD4CA41EFC194BCB690FD","documentHash":"719ba6dd-3306-4169-a3d6-bb85c92f52b8"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b4d7","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Cedzyński","uuid":"6A0CFDE9C4E950C8F6A238AC13F5E0800F06AECAB87049D178DAD0D9274F67B085B526368CAF9A425BE07BE9649F915CB670C522B9F194486937A58616C3C529","orcidId":"0000-0002-4486-9256","documentHash":"e9a1bb04-61b8-4bf1-9733-94c3fcc63f9f"}],"objectId":"63bd99284097073596a651d1","doi":"10.1155/2022/9627934","publicUri":"http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/jir/2022/9627934.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Antibodies Recognizing Yersinia enterocolitica Lipopolysaccharides of Various Chemotypes in Synovial Fluids From Patients With Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Yersinia enterocolitica O:3 (YeO3) is considered to be associated with reactive arthritis (ReA), and its lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been detected in synovial fluids from patients. Interestingly, YeO3 wild-type LPS was processed by host cells, resulting in truncated LPS molecules presenting the core region. Previously, we reported the immunogenicity but not adjuvanticity of YeO3 LPSs of wild (S) type, Ra, Rd, or Re chemotypes in mice. Here, we demonstrate the presence of YeO3 LPS chemotype-specific antibodies in all analyzed synovial fluids (SF) from patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Interestingly, the high titer of antibodies specific for the Kdo-lipid A region was found in most tested SF. In contrast, only a few were positive for antibodies recognizing O-specific polysaccharides. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of antibodies reacting with fast-migrating LPS fractions and enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) in synovial fluid samples. Our data also suggest the importance of LPS-associated ECA for the antigenicity of endotoxin. Furthermore, we confirmed in vitro that Yersinia LPS processing leads to the exposure of its core region and enhanced potency of complement lectin pathway activation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d6878c28a04739dbb2","5e7092b7878c28a04739b4d7","5e70930c878c28a0473a1c64"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092eb878c28a04739f3a4"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"2022","pagesFromTo":"1-9","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092eb878c28a04739f3a4","5e70930c878c28a0473a1c64","63bd99284097073596a651d3","5e7092d6878c28a04739dbb2","63bd99284097073596a651d4","63bd99284097073596a651d5","5e7092b7878c28a04739b4d7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478798","mniswId":"11405","title":"Journal of Immunology Research","issn":"2314-8861","eissn":"2314-7156","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"5a22e283-d30d-4bad-95cf-ac9015a6c8e4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63171082409707488e9fc621","year":"2022","volume":"2022","documentHash":"ffb40465-0c07-4d41-a5ad-0958fefcb6d8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ENTEROBACTERIAL COMMON ANTIGENVIRULENCEO-3PATHOGENESISCELLSSERUM"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058434633"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63bd89c44097073596a59428","name":"Hugh","lastName":"Kim","documentHash":"7db685d7-1c56-432f-9b29-b6cbf4439dbe"},{"objectId":"63bd89c44097073596a59427","name":"Lari","lastName":"Häkkinen","documentHash":"52621573-733f-4e6b-9993-30215ff4cb5f"},{"objectId":"63bd89c44097073596a59426","name":"Kelly M.","lastName":"McNagny","documentHash":"f03c2cb9-3590-4dc1-a4f1-f183d8104876"},{"objectId":"63bd89c44097073596a59425","name":"Mortimer","lastName":"Poncz","documentHash":"b4dc04bd-2261-4511-9fce-8e1e56511361"},{"objectId":"63bd89c44097073596a59423","name":"Douglas B.","lastName":"Cines","documentHash":"bb325442-2330-4a36-be01-ffc64c61d08f"},{"objectId":"63bd89c44097073596a59422","name":"Flavia","lastName":"Lakschevitz","documentHash":"6d89fc72-8665-413b-8c86-5755aa7056dc"},{"objectId":"63bd89c44097073596a59421","name":"Michael R.","lastName":"Hughes","documentHash":"6540c143-4860-4345-90c1-a13cbcab271d"},{"objectId":"63bd89c44097073596a59420","name":"Ryan","lastName":"Karimi","documentHash":"051dc93a-fa4f-45f6-b977-bc3c5f57290b"},{"objectId":"63bd89c44097073596a5941f","name":"Kalyan","lastName":"Golla","documentHash":"8d863781-2e45-4ec2-b200-78119019bff7"},{"objectId":"63bd89c44097073596a5941e","name":"Hoa T.","lastName":"Le","documentHash":"6525b412-060f-4872-871e-43407e689454"},{"objectId":"5e709326878c28a0473a3b26","name":"Maria","lastName":"Kowalska","uuid":"C793EB10DC26C8FD189BF141DC3677BB43101B83060E1E327EC5D49AEB71FD37E19DA8FC32A72991A8F7637D4D4C88E8874D2640B759CFDE7787B6528F33F7E6","documentHash":"e3e8a053-e4ec-4151-bc8d-98a379211a89"}],"objectId":"63bd89c44097073596a5941d","doi":"10.1038/s41598-022-19850-w","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-19850-w.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Platelet factor 4 (CXCL4/PF4) upregulates matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in gingival fibroblasts","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the release of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) from resident connective tissue cells in tooth-supporting tissues (periodontium). Platelet activation, and the attendant release of pro-inflammatory chemokines such as platelet factor 4 (CXCL4/PF4), are associated with periodontitis although the associated biochemical pathways remain undefined. Here we report that recombinant PF4 is internalized by cultured human gingival fibroblasts (hGFs), resulting in significant (p < 0.05) upregulation in both the production and release of MMP-2 (gelatinase A). This finding was corroborated by elevated circulating levels of MMP-2 (p < 0.05) in PF4-overexpressing transgenic mice, relative to controls. We also determined that PF4 induces the phosphorylation of NF-kappa B; notably, the suppression of NF-kappa B signaling by the inhibitor BAY 11-7082 abrogated PF4-induced MMP-2 upregulation. Moreover, the inhibition of surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) blocked both PF4 binding and NF-kappa B phosphorylation. Partial blockade of PF4 binding to the cells was achieved by treatment with either chondroitinase ABC or heparinase III, suggesting that both chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate mediate PF4 signaling. These results identify a novel pathway in which PF4 upregulates MMP-2 release from fibroblasts in an NF-kappa B- and GAG-dependent manner, and further our comprehension of the role of platelet signaling in periodontal tissue homeostasis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709326878c28a0473a3b26"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63bd89c44097073596a5941e","63bd89c44097073596a5941f","63bd89c44097073596a59420","63bd89c44097073596a59421","63bd89c44097073596a59422","63bd89c44097073596a59423","63bd89c44097073596a59425","63bd89c44097073596a59426","63bd89c44097073596a59427","63bd89c44097073596a59428","5e709326878c28a0473a3b26"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","documentHash":"b6d73d02-ec27-4baa-91e9-d28a7a700218"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6204e9a22467f04219d00aa3","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"1","documentHash":"6f277079-92a2-4906-a3fd-56acdd571480"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["NF-KAPPA-BCHEMOKINE PLATELET-FACTOR-4PORPHYROMONAS-GINGIVALISEXPRESSIONPHOSPHORYLATIONPERIODONTITISPATHOGENESISACTIVATIONHEALTHIP-10"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058434863"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60fa43839543c744c19b0ee5","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Pastwińska","uuid":"14781397C7F7AF97AAEE41496FEC60E4D7EB66B223B6AA98976146E70CC314BDFAB9C8D9BCB0169BC46976667BDB2D975E877D83094AB721BB585FA6A160E38B","documentHash":"b11af012-cc92-49fa-a18a-57f86ca76696"},{"objectId":"5e709326878c28a0473a3b52","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Karwaciak","uuid":"07DCCCF633946D0D382FA333B03FA29532E8FAABCE8B31805A354A7069B3E181D2C04FE9EBA0FE5499A48BB2418D45D0FD64AAD6E3B93DCBE6C29AEA62DC47E9","documentHash":"0c2307a8-e439-4e83-97a9-8842d78c5e45"},{"objectId":"5e709325878c28a0473a3b0d","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Ratajewski","uuid":"B1291B914CCBBB6C14FBE1C256BB487B869EF5824C470D3BC8E042F7037B0D9B1804950A658997EE241528D9DD362A0B61F1CE4E6FA15E8A2174837A8745BE4F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5391-5843","documentHash":"ebcf4e46-75f1-4c03-8489-9f1302e03e9f"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b7b0","name":"Kaja","lastName":"Karaś","uuid":"110929C60656ECB7DEF1B7327306C4A1680CE63A323B4B9EFC79C2D5852151F2A150F830C5734163364197B896C5894F11CFBF8ECADE2E4D9A286BFAD04BD0DA","documentHash":"f79970e8-a9cd-47f4-bdb0-ee79e36c8324"}],"objectId":"63c6c8e64097071bb54001bf","doi":"10.1016/j.bbcan.2022.188754","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0304419X22000798?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Targeting EGFR in melanoma – The sea of possibilities to overcome drug resistance","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Melanoma is considered one of the most aggressive skin cancers.

To bridge the gap between in vitro and in vivo models, we compared the mRNA expression profiles of CRC cell lines (HT29, HTC116, and LoVo and their respective irinotecan-resistant variants) with patient samples to select new candidate genes for the validation of irinotecan resistance. Data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (GSE42387, GSE62080, and GSE18105) and the Human Protein Atlas databases and were subjected to an integrated bioinformatics analysis. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of differently expressed genes (DEGs) between FOLFIRI-resistant and -sensitive CRC patients delivered several potential irinotecan resistance markers: NDUFA2, SDHD, LSM5, DCAF4, COX10 RBM8A, TIMP1, QKI, TGOLN2, and PTGS2. The chosen DEGs were used to validate irinotecan-resistant cell line models, proving their substantial phylogenetic heterogeneity.

It is also an indicator of cancer cells' aggressiveness. The aim of this study was to assess how the expression of E-cadherin varies in primary ovarian cancer tissue in regard to overall survival of patients; FIGO stage; grade; histopathological type of tumor; and potential factors discriminating malignant and nonmalignant ovarian tumors. Our analysis was based on literature research (1 January 2000-8 November 2021) conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Most studies support the assumption that loss/reduced expression of E-cadherin results in shorter overall survival of EOC patients. Moreover, most research has shown that there is a correlation between the low level of E-cadherin and the advancement stage of disease, especially in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma type. However, E-cadherin expression seems to not be helpful to distinguish malignant and nonmalignant tumors. In conclusion, reduced E-cadherin expression in primary ovarian cancer tissue may indicate a less favorable disease outcome and is associated with high advancement of the disease."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b7878c28a04739b4f4","5e709326878c28a0473a3b19"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"22","pagesFromTo":"14383","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709326878c28a0473a3b19","5e7092b7878c28a04739b4f4","5e709326878c28a0473a3b1d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","eissn":"1422-0067","documentHash":"30236fd5-adc3-4b09-b2c8-6a106b437fa9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"637631ac40970765d46d45d8","year":"2022","volume":"23","number":"22","documentHash":"d88380ea-61c2-41cb-854e-709e00014bb8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["E-cadherinovarian cancerpatients survivalclinicopathological parameters"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058576518"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709326878c28a0473a3b1d","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kiełbik","uuid":"D6C26970ACACEC1CCF36776EC26B881747F890466F0B67EB2514E7E868023AB696F3A56002742EE78739503D08C048D0B0A36735F033C2191B6D3507B1A51648","orcidId":"0000-0002-6211-8288","documentHash":"45ca2639-d5f5-4f81-a5f2-53844b139e1c"},{"objectId":"5e709326878c28a0473a3b19","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Szulc-Kiełbik","uuid":"FBC406CC95FD5B9E108329D4D92AF1DCF003D7B35A266A9A0D48308B148192E6FB1195CBF596D35B3C66C2EB4F830F0350DC0EB05F373D5A579C040F49943E83","orcidId":"0000-0003-1290-697X","documentHash":"e48c4d7b-dbc5-48aa-833b-938477fc94b6"}],"objectId":"643e8f224097072d5398f033","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-91311-3_4","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-91311-3_4","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Tumor-Associated Macrophages: Reasons to Be Cheerful, Reasons to Be Fearful","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Tumor microenvironment (TME) is a complex and constantly evolving entity that consists not only of cancer cells, but also of resident host cells and immune-infiltrating cells, among which macrophages are significant components, due to their diversity of functions through which they can influence the immune response against tumor cells. Macrophages present in tumor environment are termed as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). They are strongly plastic cells, and depending on the TME stimuli (i.e., cytokines, chemokines), TAMs polarize to antitumoral (M1-like TAMs) or protumoral (M2-like TAMs) phenotype. Both types of TAMs differ in the surface receptors’ expression, activation of intracellular signaling pathways, and ability of production and various metabolites release. At the early stage of tumor formation, TAMs are M1-like phenotype, and they are able to eliminate tumor cells, i.e., by reactive oxygen species formation or by presentation of cancer antigens to other effector immune cells. However, during tumor progression, TAMs M2-like phenotype is dominating. They mainly contribute to angiogenesis, stromal remodeling, enhancement of tumor cells migration and invasion, and immunosuppression. This wide variety of TAMs’ functions makes them an excellent subject for use in developing antitumor therapies which mainly is based on three strategies: TAMs’ elimination, reprograming, or recruitment inhibition."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709326878c28a0473a3b1d","5e709326878c28a0473a3b19"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"107-140","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709326878c28a0473a3b19","5e709326878c28a0473a3b1d"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"643e8dbb4097072d5398dfe1","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-91311-3","title":"Interaction of Immune and Cancer Cells","year":2022,"isbn":"9783030913106","issn":"1664-431X","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-91311-3.pdf","translation":false,"documentHash":"5defff88-156c-4960-b6b3-a374220ccfd7","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"}},"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Tumor-associated macrophages Tumor cells M1/M2 macrophages Polarization Angiogenesis Metastasis TAMs targeting therapies"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058592195"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709326878c28a0473a3b19","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Szulc-Kiełbik","uuid":"FBC406CC95FD5B9E108329D4D92AF1DCF003D7B35A266A9A0D48308B148192E6FB1195CBF596D35B3C66C2EB4F830F0350DC0EB05F373D5A579C040F49943E83","orcidId":"0000-0003-1290-697X","documentHash":"e48c4d7b-dbc5-48aa-833b-938477fc94b6"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b4f4","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Klink","uuid":"B5C74BA475BF6ED1FC8CED6F1CA9B54FBB7CA8837226E9B7C6FB0E1E6230225C91171D3BDF98A2735C3A500BED69E64BC6B32C0BE772D5A01A81F94BFE9D4A6D","orcidId":"0000-0002-9870-7391","documentHash":"963f7c08-1c0d-4120-9384-4a9d744f954c"}],"objectId":"643e90274097072d5398fb9f","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-91311-3_5","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-91311-3_5","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils and Tumors: Friend or Foe?","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Tumor microenvironment (TME) is a dynamic network that apart from tumor cells includes also cells of the immune system, e.g., neutrophils, which are recruited from blood circulation.

The dual role of neutrophils is determined by their high plasticity and heterogeneity. Analogous to the macrophages, neutrophils can express antitumoral (N1) and protumoral (N2) phenotypes which differ substantially in morphology and function. N1 phenotype characterizes with a high cytotoxic and proinflammatory activities, while N2 phenotype with immunosuppressive and prometastatic properties. The antitumoral effect of neutrophils includes for example the production of reactive oxygen species or proapoptotic molecules. The protumoral action of neutrophils relies on releasing of proangiogenic and prometastatic mediators, immunosuppressive factors, as well as on direct helping tumor cells in extravasation process.

The conformational study of these compounds showed very good agreement between the results established by these three methods. Substitution with a bulky substituent at C8 of adenosine strongly increased the population of the syn orientation around the glycosidic bond, accompanied by a predominance of the South-type conformation between C2’-endo-C3’-exo and C2’-endo-C1’-exo as well as the presence of the +sc orientation of the exocyclic C(4′)-C(5′) bond. Interestingly, 5′O–H····N3 scalar coupling across hydrogen bonds was observed in the 1H-15N gHMBC spectrum, indicating intramolecular 5′ O–H···N3 hydrogen bond formation as a consequence of the coexistence of the syn orientation, South-type conformation and +sc rotamer. The crystal structures of 5 and 7 are the first reported crystal structures of adenosine-boron cluster derivatives."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","uid":"bKH7OhxrOAmP_ULnBGYKnJQ","uuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","name":"Instytut Biochemii i Biofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473aff5d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","parentUuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","rootUuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9e","uid":"b4-9zzGvUfyUhirAhWcr-QA","uuid":"eb155ad0-f9cf-4c26-b470-4c6501ea0a66","name":"Instytut Chemii Bioorganicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709349878c28a0473a685f","5e709349878c28a0473a6867"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9e","parentUuid":"eb155ad0-f9cf-4c26-b470-4c6501ea0a66","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9e","rootUuid":"eb155ad0-f9cf-4c26-b470-4c6501ea0a66","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709400878c28a0473b4ad1","5e709355878c28a0473a7874"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b7878c28a04739b4f3","5e7092b7878c28a04739b42e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"1274","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"134588 (1-11)","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709349878c28a0473a6867","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff5d","5e709400878c28a0473b4ad1","5e709355878c28a0473a7874","5e7092b7878c28a04739b4f3","5e709349878c28a0473a685f","5e7092b7878c28a04739b42e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454788b4","mniswId":"11918","title":"Journal of Molecular Structure","issn":"0022-2860","eissn":"1872-8014","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-molecular-structure/","documentHash":"4bff2014-656e-441f-955f-ddef373955b2"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c53f4f4097074bb0bd1150","year":"2023","volume":"1274","documentHash":"8c82db1e-e7cd-4f7d-a61d-292df30a32fb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Adenosine receptor ligands","Boron clusters","Crystallography","NMR","Nucleoside conformation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058592801"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093f7878c28a0473b4152","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Papiewska-Pająk","uuid":"484E569D95229BB83C03D67B0BA616FEC274634A407DC7EC8B05F06E128379E804A58DE34A80D7D9F48CD978F7479C8C735E51EAE416C47844B5ACED08893C15","orcidId":"0000-0001-6116-3418","documentHash":"f1a11f80-ee18-4b0d-9b7b-e0dca06144e9"},{"objectId":"5e7093f1878c28a0473b3c0c","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Kryczka","uuid":"B6D1AC4EDA7733754BC4EAB53D2BE91BEF31263DCA789CE9A71FE1DF9E01F062B530CC041F28268E16EB264CF742FD7E62CFB209A87E8D63FE96474F1CCC75CE","orcidId":"0000-0002-5719-4139","documentHash":"c42581e1-5180-4c1a-9dc8-35e09b94a552"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa933","name":"Hassan","lastName":"Kassassir","uuid":"561EFF6712CBE0AD65EAFAE29BB3099CA7751CAB531FED0E1C56185819D0BF06D09C71A1754B9CA03401DDD0BA731A7E2A6EABEC06B871590802E7AE915E48CB","documentHash":"3c0a360c-fce0-41f5-ae0a-37d6cf12e6c0"},{"objectId":"5e709326878c28a0473a3b26","name":"Maria","lastName":"Kowalska","uuid":"C793EB10DC26C8FD189BF141DC3677BB43101B83060E1E327EC5D49AEB71FD37E19DA8FC32A72991A8F7637D4D4C88E8874D2640B759CFDE7787B6528F33F7E6","documentHash":"e3e8a053-e4ec-4151-bc8d-98a379211a89"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b4e6","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Boncela","uuid":"922AAA7CAF3D0B741E8168481D9EF8F09AD30485BC125BBA16B8021D18E9598F64B213DAB713A66878B3F87CB3679BE1830D271DC79D6198EE1BE4348A8DFA28","orcidId":"0000-0001-8419-7012","documentHash":"4c7577d6-d1ef-4977-b760-ca15fc82c8bb"}],"objectId":"64413b9a409707555e83a50a","doi":"10.1186/s12964-023-01066-8","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12964-023-01066-8.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Platelet-derived microparticles stimulate the invasiveness of colorectal cancer cells via the p38MAPK-MMP-2/MMP-9 axis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Metastasis is the main cause of death in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Apart from platelets, platelet-derived microparticles (PMPs) are also considered important factors that can modify the activity of cancer cells. PMPs are incorporated by cancer cells and can also serve as intracellular signalling vesicles. PMPs are believed to affect cancer cells by upregulating their invasiveness. To date, there is no evidence that such a mechanism occurs in colorectal cancer. It has been shown that platelets can stimulate metalloproteases (MMPs) expression and activity via the p38MAPK pathway in CRC cells, leading to their elevated migratory potential. This study aimed to investigate the impact of PMPs on the invasive potential of CRC cells of various phenotypes via the MMP-2, MMP-9 and p38MAPK axis.\n\nMethods: We used various CRC cell lines, including the epithelial-like HT29 and the mesenchymal-like SW480 and SW620. Confocal imaging was applied to study PMP incorporation into CRC cells. The presence of surface receptors on CRC cells after PMP uptake was evaluated by flow cytometry. Transwell and scratch wound-healing assays were used to evaluate cell migration. The level of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), MMP-2, and MMP-9 and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38MAPK were measured by western blot. MMP activity was determined using gelatine-degradation assays, while MMP release was evaluated by ELISA.\n\nResults: We found that CRC cells could incorporate PMPs in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, PMPs could transfer platelet-specific integrins and stimulate the expression of integrins already present on tested cell lines. While mesenchymal-like cells expressed less CXCR4 than epithelial-like CRC cells, PMP uptake did not increase its intensity. No significant changes in CXCR4 level either on the surface or inside CRC cells were noticed. Levels of cellular and released MMP-2 and MMP-9 were elevated in all tested CRC cell lines after PMP uptake. PMPs increased the phosphorylation of p38MAPK but not that of ERK1/2. Inhibition of p38MAPK phosphorylation reduced the PMP-induced elevated level and release of MMP-2 and MMP-9 as well as MMP-dependent cell migration in all cell lines.\n\nConclusions: We conclude that PMPs can fuse into both epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like CRC cells and increase their invasive potential by inducing the expression and release of MMP-2 and MMP-9 via the p38MAPK pathway, whereas CXCR4-related cell motility or the ERK1/2 pathway appears to not be affected by PMPs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f7878c28a0473b4152","5e7093f1878c28a0473b3c0c","5e709326878c28a0473a3b26","5e70937a878c28a0473aa933","5e7092b7878c28a04739b4e6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"21","issue":"1","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70937a878c28a0473aa933","5e7093f7878c28a0473b4152","5e7093f1878c28a0473b3c0c","5e7092b7878c28a04739b4e6","5e709326878c28a0473a3b26"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547757b","mniswId":"3366","title":"Cell Communication and Signaling","issn":"1478-811X","eissn":"1478-811X","documentHash":"ac6d0fa9-7fd9-48c3-a52f-ea5b02cb9994"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64413b9a409707555e83a50b","year":"2023","volume":"21","number":"1","documentHash":"6a329af6-0e2b-4dc1-b065-1946eef0674e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Colorectal cancer; Metalloproteases; Platelet-derived microparticles"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058643355"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b0de7e40970719778d5dba","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Waldmajer","documentHash":"bf7875ea-43aa-4e30-a441-3e53bb37f1e4"},{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9c8b","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Sakowski","uuid":"9106B0C1A2E8AEE65662362B56DBEBA86B04271928F05C4CA97F065C6A2079D65AA4775A0DBA4372DFA95814ABE1D1456C3CEF407B4505CE2743C1BB4143A2A9","orcidId":"0000-0002-6127-3403","documentHash":"88cedc06-0700-4bc6-8177-410a4bb7a925"},{"objectId":"5e709325878c28a0473a3b0c","name":"Marta","lastName":"Majchrzak","uuid":"2CDDFFEC4979F63CDA470AC250CD249B86952E68F9F45CBA3132BA9DBF4E38C59033E345BAB3030BA704755C08E89807C878ADC8CB0C73FE9DB39ABB7D1EA738","orcidId":"0000-0002-9092-5538","documentHash":"0367007a-6c37-410c-a96f-055224d2be17"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dd37","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Parniewski","uuid":"DF469BCDE5F7C7F06E77C9810EB85D8037D594248DB897711A15B4010651B040694BD26A2D423C97320A678CDA7BA93AA15F86446C6974ED81D14DD1F8188D9F","orcidId":"0000-0002-9074-2758","documentHash":"8e9db101-4ed2-4c51-91d0-110941b578af"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-28","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64413a4e409707555e83972a","doi":"10.3390/ijms24054681","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/5/4681","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"New Genetic Markers Differentiating IPEC and ExPEC Pathotypes - A New Approach to Genome-Wide Analysis Using a New Bioinformatics Tool","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The increasingly expanding genomic databases generate the need for new tools for their processing and further use.

OX40 (CD134) is thought to be a secondary co-stimulatory immune checkpoint molecule that is expressed by T cells. This study aimed to evaluate the mRNA expression of OX40 and its serum levels in the peripheral blood of patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or Neuromyelitis Optica (NMO).MethodsPatients with MS (n = 60), NMO (n = 20), and 20 healthy subjects were recruited from Sina Hospital, Tehran, Iran. The diagnoses were confirmed by a specialist in clinical neurology. Peripheral venous blood was obtained from all subjects, and mRNA quantification of OX40 was conducted using real-time PCR. Serum samples were also obtained and the concentration of OX40 was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).ResultsThere was a significant correlation between the mRNA expression and serum levels of OX40 and disability as assessed using the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) in the patients with MS, but not in the patients with NMO. Expression of OX40 mRNA was significantly higher in the peripheral blood of MS patients compared to healthy individuals and NMO patients (*P < 0.05). In addition, serum OX40 concentrations were also significantly higher in patients with MS patients compared with healthy subjects (9.08 +/- 2.48 vs. 1.49 +/- 0.54 ng/ml; P = 0.041).ConclusionsIt appears that an increased expression of OX40 may be associated with the hyperactivation of T cells in patients with MS, and this may play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["621ee4b97523402df08b96db"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"19","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64c7c9be40970733d13e4a60","64c7c9be40970733d13e4a61","64c7c9be40970733d13e4a62","64c7c9be40970733d13e4a63","621ee4b97523402df08b96db","64c7c9be40970733d13e4a64","64c7c9be40970733d13e4a65"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476f5a","mniswId":"802","title":"Allergy Asthma and Clinical Immunology","issn":"1710-1484","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"727d16db-29a5-42df-bf2b-9e979621a0a4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64c7c9be40970733d13e4a5f","year":"2023","volume":"19","number":"1","documentHash":"26b321df-693d-4622-a2ef-40b9afa8822d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CD134Multiple sclerosisNeuromyelitis opticaOX40T cell"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058753048"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5faacfbe085dcb5a2b98d94a","name":"Daria","lastName":"Różycka","uuid":"AEFF7E0C5881C0361AA2FFC869D9742D93DCCDFC86072607707DF2585E6341718594418B56182681267E0BE10168634EE7B3EF80D864524E4EA8F453CBF67EDC","documentHash":"2b5020d3-ae8f-4431-a69b-6ef149917d0f"},{"objectId":"5f4db533752340073806a8a2","name":"Olga","lastName":"Kuźmycz","uuid":"D4B1AAAAA69BD77E9CB6EEEF18D2B521412CC5E3C8ABBF57878FBB92CA8CB8CBEC053CEFE160A57FADC3D9F81824064EEEB322D223182D420175EDB1CB42038E","documentHash":"644af59d-f40f-4bd5-b490-2a42f2c3fa53"},{"objectId":"5e70947d878c28a0473be4e3","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"867DA088C06F259F70FBD588AA5170309BAA1A94E98F0524C1285F65EDDF4B0E838691BBFA63232441DF1E1143A645C3FF702FA9877D61DF2ECF9D99D7584B25","orcidId":"0000-0001-9607-7173","documentHash":"c268aa62-9237-4363-ba24-e612e6ab4e79"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa8e2","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Stączek","uuid":"0B3F06F41F89607C30B99AA961F4B84BFF9E8CF1DC6A0A41B3C8536F808159E3DFAB00B1647076C8F75010EEFD8F2A807F2A5361A25C46147DDFBF13035D5C02","orcidId":"0000-0003-4416-8289","documentHash":"27e2b913-3836-417e-8650-b6055b486ac6"},{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9c62","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Gapińska","uuid":"E53B3B3B5C6D0E6DFE8AAA55C76427CAF28BCD63990E53216C164D151ABC5AE373E20BA97C42648DB03BA634DE5C8459D89240E4592D01718B6DBAEF3BC11C29","orcidId":"0000-0002-3125-7920","documentHash":"f8e94ef0-4e06-4808-a689-43e483984a8b"},{"objectId":"5e709352878c28a0473a730c","name":"Marta","lastName":"Denel-Bobrowska","uuid":"6D8083B4C555D9598DACAF3DCBBA093BD9D461D92E7EA2C4F24C6330CE8AB6EA6A6D7B8D1DE6CC5D0D7768C0D648579A701BC6491D1EED18979BFA1E82A22C21","documentHash":"a0516bc2-d499-4a91-9ef0-b50f28539b8c"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dcee","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Olejniczak","uuid":"2BFD5BAD3C8BDB055EFFA165DBD8F3B7EBEEB7832415C5FEC8C2D2E98946C5BD8F683EF6BFA994CA0F6C4EF20EB3D33C5E8236A38378730A9C5126262FF7883A","orcidId":"0000-0003-4628-9017","documentHash":"97bfb663-ebf3-4a2f-8367-0e429d4b2bc5"}],"objectId":"64415d08409707555e84deae","doi":"10.1002/cmdc.202200666","publicUri":"https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cmdc.202200666?af=R","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Acridine/Acridone–Carborane Conjugates as Strong DNA-Binding Agents with Anticancer Potential","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Synthesis of acridine derivatives that act as DNA-targeting anticancer agents is an evolving field and has resulted in the introduction of several drugs into clinical trials.

The fight against TB requires surveillance of the population of strains circulating worldwide and the analysis of the prevalence of certain strains in populations. Nowadays, whole genome sequencing (WGS) allows for accurate tracking of TB transmission. Currently, there is a lack of a comprehensive summary of the characteristics of TB outbreaks.\r\nMethods\r\nWe systematically analyzed studies reporting TB outbreaks worldwide, monitored through WGS of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We 1) mapped the reported outbreaks from 2011- 2020, 2) estimated the average size of the outbreaks, 3) indicated genetic lineages causing the outbreaks, and 4) determined drug-resistance patterns of M. tuberculosis strains involved in the outbreaks.\r\nResults\r\nMost data originated from Europe, Asia, and North America. We found that TB outbreaks were reported throughout the globe, on all continents, and in countries with both high and low incidences. The detected outbreaks contained a median of five M. tuberculosis isolates. Most strains causing the outbreaks belonged to lineage four, more rarely to lineage two. Reported outbreak isolates were often drug resistant.\r\nConclusions\r\nWe conclude that more WGS surveillance of M. tuberculosis outbreaks is needed.

Chemotherapy is ineffective in HCC patients, and the number of drugs that are in use is limited. Thus, new molecules are needed that could increase the effectiveness of anti-HCC regimens. Here, we show that AT7519, a CDK inhibitor, exerts positive effects on HCC cells: it inhibits proliferation, migration and clonogenicity. Detailed analysis of the transcriptomes of cells treated with this compound indicated that AT7519 affects a substantial portion of genes that are associated with HCC development and progression. Moreover, we showed that the concomitant use of AT7519 with gefitinib or cabozantinib sensitized HCC cells to these drugs. Thus, our research indicates that AT7519 is worth considering in monotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma patients or in combination with other drugs, e.g., gefitinib or cabozantinib."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709325878c28a0473a3b0d","5e709326878c28a0473a3b52","60fa43839543c744c19b0ee5","5e7092b9878c28a04739b7b0","5e7094a0878c28a0473c0a85","5e7092d8878c28a04739de9d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"164","pagesFromTo":"115002","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709326878c28a0473a3b52","60c2fbfb9543c723365432bc","5e7092d8878c28a04739de9d","60fa43839543c744c19b0ee5","5e7094a0878c28a0473c0a85","5e709325878c28a0473a3b0d","5e7092b9878c28a04739b7b0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477375","mniswId":"2501","title":"BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY","issn":"0753-3322","eissn":"1950-6007","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"b02abcf4-80b5-4b90-a025-e43873d3f7d1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64c922694097073b97e05969","year":"2023","volume":"164","documentHash":"11e1a718-25d1-4df1-9998-453d7c9a4b70"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ROR & gamma;Hepatocellular carcinomaHCCTranscriptional regulationChemotherapyAT7519"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058875250"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65ae6f5140970719776ff71c","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Weltz","documentHash":"f2f27117-9577-494f-9901-ab0f22bc409a"},{"objectId":"65ae6f5140970719776ff71b","name":"Kaja","lastName":"Urbańska","documentHash":"c02423e0-0ebf-497d-acda-bbef241781e0"},{"objectId":"65ae6f5140970719776ff71a","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Augustynowicz-Kopeć","documentHash":"73357053-3d95-4a2d-a1de-523fd0435f92"},{"objectId":"65ae6f5140970719776ff719","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kozińska","documentHash":"c4247fd8-d594-4af5-8fc8-8f9d5eede636"},{"objectId":"65ae6f5140970719776ff718","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Brzezińska","documentHash":"898d9d78-c855-4105-8ed1-0cee8e76980c"},{"objectId":"65ae6f5140970719776ff717","name":"Anna","lastName":"Zabost","documentHash":"cb0953a9-96d2-4a76-a2d9-80d78a701d74"},{"objectId":"65ae6f5140970719776ff716","name":"Monika","lastName":"Krajewska-Wędzina","documentHash":"626414bd-94ec-4685-9f98-5102d80b711a"},{"objectId":"65ae6f5140970719776ff715","name":"Anna","lastName":"Didkowska","documentHash":"eed66df7-a205-4676-83b6-14b86308aa56"},{"objectId":"65ae6f5140970719776ff713","name":"Blanka","lastName":"Orłowska","documentHash":"4b78cc51-41b6-4c73-9fca-f7f9b15902bb"},{"objectId":"5e709325878c28a0473a3b0c","name":"Marta","lastName":"Majchrzak","uuid":"2CDDFFEC4979F63CDA470AC250CD249B86952E68F9F45CBA3132BA9DBF4E38C59033E345BAB3030BA704755C08E89807C878ADC8CB0C73FE9DB39ABB7D1EA738","orcidId":"0000-0002-9092-5538","documentHash":"0367007a-6c37-410c-a96f-055224d2be17"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dd37","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Parniewski","uuid":"DF469BCDE5F7C7F06E77C9810EB85D8037D594248DB897711A15B4010651B040694BD26A2D423C97320A678CDA7BA93AA15F86446C6974ED81D14DD1F8188D9F","orcidId":"0000-0002-9074-2758","documentHash":"8e9db101-4ed2-4c51-91d0-110941b578af"},{"objectId":"5e70923a878c28a0473920fd","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Anusz","uuid":"C2290DBF040655729BB9E82B4AC0CFB47A8594E727421542EEA851E6036C6EAA68166496E51F380C690DB781F854939E1AA8F2DDD7319CAEFCE97D5F01A8C4C3","orcidId":"0000-0002-8116-8491","documentHash":"06bf0f26-e53b-48d2-8622-98609890f265"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-21","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65200722409707465747bca3","doi":"10.3390/pathogens12091184","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/12/9/1184","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Mycobacterial Interspersed Repeat Unit–Variable Number Tandem Repeat Typing of Mycobacterium avium Strains Isolated from the Lymph Nodes of Free-Living Carnivorous Animals in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous organisms, of which some, especially those of the Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), may be opportunistic animal and human\r\npathogens. Infection with NTM can interfere with tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis and induce zoonoses, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Diseases caused by NTM have become more readily recognized; however, they are likely still underestimated. In this study, we identified and genotyped\r\nMycobacterium avium strains that were isolated during TB monitoring among free-living carnivorous animals from southeastern Poland. In 2011–2020, lymph node samples from 192 such animals were tested for mycobacteria. A total of 41 isolates of M. avium strains were detected with the use of\r\nIS901, IS900, IS1245, and mycobacterial interspersed repeat unit–variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) identification. Thirty-three were identified as M. avium subsp. avium. These strains were derived from 1 beech marten (Martes foina), 1 common buzzard (Buteo buteo), 2 European badgers\r\n(Meles meles), 3 wolves (Canis lupus), and 26 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes). One strain isolated from a wolf was identified as M. avium subsp. hominissuis. The results show the widespread occurrence of MAC bacilli in the studied environment and additionally comprise new data on the molecular characteristics of M. avium subspecies carried by free-living southeastern Polish carnivores.\r\n"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709325878c28a0473a3b0c","5e7092d6878c28a04739dd37"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"1-10","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65ae6f5140970719776ff713","5e709325878c28a0473a3b0c","65ae6f5140970719776ff715","5e70923a878c28a0473920fd","65ae6f5140970719776ff716","65ae6f5140970719776ff717","65ae6f5140970719776ff718","65ae6f5140970719776ff719","65ae6f5140970719776ff71a","65ae6f5140970719776ff71b","65ae6f5140970719776ff71c","5e7092d6878c28a04739dd37"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceac","mniswId":"15767","title":"Pathogens","eissn":"2076-0817","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"e3cbc691-2d96-4c17-9b90-bb773e877487"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["free-living carnivores","MAC","MIRU-VNTR","Mycobacterium avium complex","non- mycobacteria","NTM","Podkarpackie Voivodeship","the Bieszczady Mountains","wildlife"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058894928"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60fa43839543c744c19b0ee5","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Pastwińska","uuid":"14781397C7F7AF97AAEE41496FEC60E4D7EB66B223B6AA98976146E70CC314BDFAB9C8D9BCB0169BC46976667BDB2D975E877D83094AB721BB585FA6A160E38B","documentHash":"b11af012-cc92-49fa-a18a-57f86ca76696"},{"objectId":"60c2fbfb9543c723365432bc","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Chałaśkiewicz","uuid":"C46EEE90BC012C7947F57779E8CE5E5960B64BECFCB6C89E9592F18D0B1840DAB29AAD6A7F3607502506AACF906F0B8E1F7573ED79EB349674BA0ED228AD63EA","documentHash":"3e6a2566-7f2c-4bf1-84ed-08e9b81809ee"},{"objectId":"5e7093c1878c28a0473b0327","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Zakłos-Szyda","uuid":"0BC59FD626C5C506D0C4B9A9A231F308AFC3945C0F6B881760DCBADA302242BC7A4C546C6118C139FF8B598279A9B0CA344502E63ABDD38917DFF48CB61B861F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8341-1654","documentHash":"ee204882-e710-4eda-931d-37699d877adf"},{"objectId":"5e709326878c28a0473a3b52","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Karwaciak","uuid":"07DCCCF633946D0D382FA333B03FA29532E8FAABCE8B31805A354A7069B3E181D2C04FE9EBA0FE5499A48BB2418D45D0FD64AAD6E3B93DCBE6C29AEA62DC47E9","documentHash":"0c2307a8-e439-4e83-97a9-8842d78c5e45"},{"objectId":"5e709325878c28a0473a3b0d","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Ratajewski","uuid":"B1291B914CCBBB6C14FBE1C256BB487B869EF5824C470D3BC8E042F7037B0D9B1804950A658997EE241528D9DD362A0B61F1CE4E6FA15E8A2174837A8745BE4F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5391-5843","documentHash":"ebcf4e46-75f1-4c03-8489-9f1302e03e9f"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b7b0","name":"Kaja","lastName":"Karaś","uuid":"110929C60656ECB7DEF1B7327306C4A1680CE63A323B4B9EFC79C2D5852151F2A150F830C5734163364197B896C5894F11CFBF8ECADE2E4D9A286BFAD04BD0DA","documentHash":"f79970e8-a9cd-47f4-bdb0-ee79e36c8324"},{"objectId":"5e709269878c28a0473953c9","name":"Maria","lastName":"Koziołkiewicz","uuid":"1269FBBF116B0F32ABF91FFED1B441C8EB8213970FFBFCA3B3920057BA52FF4D6D77CD979760571BCEE4202DD1F9DBA8D491F6E35B1380C251B9992111A465A0","orcidId":"0000-0003-4628-4566","documentHash":"54c34c51-f00f-4553-b3ec-63f9a0900b0d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-14","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"653884f540970744d5a746c8","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001429992300239X?via%3Dihub","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Trichostatin A inhibits expression of the human SLC2A5 gene via SNAI1/SNAI2 transcription factors and sensitizes colon cancer cells to platinum compounds","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"GLUT5, a key protein encoded by the SLC2A5 gene, is involved in the uptake of fructose from the intestine.

Tubercle bacilli infecting the human host can be opsonized by hSAA-1, which affects bacterial entry into human macrophages and their intracellular multiplication.\r\nMethods: We applied global RNA sequencing to evaluate the functional response of human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), isolated from healthy blood donors, under elevated hSAA-1 conditions and during infection with nonopsonized and hSAA-1-opsonized Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). In\r\nthe same infection model, we also examined the functional response of mycobacteria to the intracellular environment of macrophages in the presence and absence of hSAA-1. The RNASeq analysis was validated using qPCR. The functional response of MDMs to hSAA-1 and/or tubercle bacilli was also evaluated\r\nfor selected cytokines at the protein level by applying the Milliplex system. Findings: Transcriptomes of MDMs cultured in the presence of hSAA-1 or infected with Mtb showed a high degree of similarity for both upregulated and downregulated genes involved mainly in processes related to cell division and immune response, respectively. Among the most induced genes, across both hSAA-1 and Mtb infection conditions, CXCL8, CCL15, CCL5, IL-1b, and receptors for IL-7 and IL-2 were identified. We also observed the same pattern of upregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFa, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, IL-23, and IL-1) and downregulated anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, TGFb, and antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin) in the hSAA-1 treated-MDMs or the phagocytes infected with tubercle bacilli. At this early stage of infection, Mtb genes affected by the inside microenvironment of MDMs are strictly involved in iron scavenging, adaptation to hypoxia, low pH, and increasing levels of CO2. The genes for the synthesis and transport of virulence lipids, but not cholesterol/fatty\r\nacid degradation, were also upregulated. Conclusion: Elevated serum hSAA-1 levels in tuberculosis enhance the response\r\nof host phagocytes to infection, including macrophages that have not yet been in contact with mycobacteria. SAA induces antigen processing and presentation processes by professional phagocytes reversing the inhibition caused by Mtb infection"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af7c4","5e709229878c28a047390e3e","5e7092b7878c28a04739b521"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-18","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61fc9db87523402df07e94e4","5e7093b5878c28a0473af7c4","5e7093e2878c28a0473b2992","5e7092b7878c28a04739b521","5e7094d9878c28a0473c52ca","5e70937a878c28a0473aa8db","5e709378878c28a0473aa8d8","5e70939c878c28a0473adb7c","5e709229878c28a047390e3e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d5d","mniswId":"6843","title":"Frontiers in Immunology","eissn":"1664-3224","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"f9d56fae-fc2b-4221-9fc5-4d15e6d504c6"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["tuberculosis","human serum amyloid A","monocyte-derived macrophages","immunological response","host-pathogen transcriptomics"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059273841"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"621ee4b97523402df08b96db","name":"Leila","lastName":"Khani Khouzani","uuid":"BA688FCE69F333CE74A325CA443C664B62B71F296179BCA6C7AB2458FD837FBAA82A1DCFC6731EA372A45FD2B665D71E7F3EED1D0D91E81957BC55883EB226EE","documentHash":"a1abc7d3-64d2-4f4c-a7a4-599ad9165f27"},{"objectId":"60b841579543c72336542e4b","name":"Leonardo","lastName":"De  Souza Martin","uuid":"6464EF1F47F1FAEDF85807AE91891ECF5117C290947A6A946A379E27F812E9E590D4A5A553070DF974BDC87EE5941663AACDE4E7E23E113273ED227F6238E8FB","documentHash":"808cd5c1-5f47-4918-ba84-4c9f478634e7"},{"objectId":"5e70930c878c28a0473a1c52","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Pułaski","uuid":"DC4633B01E4F29C9EDA5398DAA8176055D4DB04E46CDCC6A07D019A88001E193B766A0A5AEC562075FCD60EFF4C2BE35FD4A3E695D05263C4433E3BECAF93FAA","orcidId":"0000-0001-8063-801X","documentHash":"c3c2928c-6b39-4a1e-9c9c-e79204ace119"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-07-03","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"65af89b1409707197774599e","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165272","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969723038950","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Cellular and physiological mechanisms of halogenated and organophosphorus flame retardant toxicity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Flame retardants (FRs) are chemical substances used to inhibit the spread of fire in numerous industrial applications, and their abundance in modern manufactured products in the indoor and outdoor environment leads to extensive direct and food chain exposure of humans.

We put in focus those studies that explained or referenced the modes of FR action at the level of cells, tissues and organs. Since FRs are highly hydrophobic chemicals, their biophysical and biochemical modes of action usually involve lipophilic interactions, e.g. with biological membranes or elements of signaling pathways. We present selected toxicological information about these molecular actions to show how they can lead to damaging membrane integrity, damaging DNA and compromising its repair, changing gene expression, and cell cycle as well as accelerating cell death. Moreover, we indicate how this translates to deleterious bioactivity of FRs at the physiological level, with disruption of hormonal action, dysregulation of metabolism, adverse effects on male and female reproduction as well as alteration of normal pattern of immunity. Concentrating on these subjects, we make clear both the advances in knowledge in recent years and the remaining gaps in our understanding, especially at the mechanistic level."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["621ee4b97523402df08b96db","60b841579543c72336542e4b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"897","pagesFromTo":"1-20","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60b841579543c72336542e4b","5e70930c878c28a0473a1c52","621ee4b97523402df08b96db"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"Science of the Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"59516ca8-3554-4f06-a1d4-f330ee71985e"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Flame retardants","Persistent organic pollutants","Cellular signaling","Genotoxicity","Reproductive toxicity","Immunotoxicity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059293440"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b8f3854097073f66008ff3","name":"Cleber P.","lastName":"Camacho","documentHash":"d639792e-3834-474e-ab3f-dac172eb2f6c"},{"objectId":"65b8f3854097073f66008ff2","name":"Humberto","lastName":"Delle","documentHash":"584d7b32-5b56-4e67-9280-7ac2b34170cd"},{"objectId":"65b8f3854097073f66008ff1","name":"João Bosco","lastName":"Pesquero","documentHash":"89939bcf-0e2c-4a78-ad12-2df80266e6f6"},{"objectId":"65b8f3854097073f66008fef","name":"Patrícia","lastName":"Varela","documentHash":"37f2dbb8-db7c-4137-b07b-0c36373db05b"},{"objectId":"65b8f3854097073f66008fee","name":"Flavia Salomão d’Avila","lastName":"Curi","documentHash":"b119f262-ca84-4084-ad0a-ebcb37b16e56"},{"objectId":"65b8f3854097073f66008fed","name":"Maria Clara","lastName":"Albejante","documentHash":"62bef87b-2e9b-469d-a3d3-2f0b80d89642"},{"objectId":"65b8f3854097073f66008fec","name":"Lucas dos Santos","lastName":"Bacigalupo","documentHash":"e1aa3a9a-4765-4573-be19-5878e83844b1"},{"objectId":"65b8f3854097073f66008feb","name":"Robson José de","lastName":"Almeida","documentHash":"de8a5913-ed3f-4571-a1b5-9b578ac95a20"},{"objectId":"65b8f3854097073f66008fea","name":"Valdelena Alessandra da","lastName":"Silva","documentHash":"6b4fbce9-248a-4b92-a338-d32e02a94d31"},{"objectId":"65b8f3854097073f66008fe9","name":"Luiz Antônio de Jesus Rocha","lastName":"Camargo","documentHash":"401699de-6768-45ff-bb11-afd549f67ab3"},{"objectId":"65b8f3854097073f66008fe8","name":"Andréa Harumy de Lima","lastName":"Hirata","documentHash":"b7b1f7c3-5bc6-4af5-9615-d914169c2ba1"},{"objectId":"60b841579543c72336542e4b","name":"Leonardo","lastName":"De  Souza Martin","uuid":"6464EF1F47F1FAEDF85807AE91891ECF5117C290947A6A946A379E27F812E9E590D4A5A553070DF974BDC87EE5941663AACDE4E7E23E113273ED227F6238E8FB","documentHash":"808cd5c1-5f47-4918-ba84-4c9f478634e7"}],"objectId":"65b8f3854097073f66008fe7","doi":"10.3390/ijms242316681","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/23/16681/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Exploring the Potential of Olfactory Receptor Circulating RNA Measurement for Preeclampsia Prediction and Its Linkage to Mild Gestational Hypothyroidism","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Gestational hypothyroidism may lead to preeclampsia development. However, this pathophysiological is unknown. We expect to find a shared mechanism by comparing hypothyroidism and preeclampsia. From our transcriptome data, we recognized olfactory receptors as that fingerprint. The reduction of taste and smell in hypothyroid patients has been known for a long time. Therefore, we decided to look to the olfactory receptors and aimed to identify genes capable of predicting preeclampsia (PEC). Methods: An Ion Proton Sequencer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to construct the transcriptome databases. RStudio with packages Limma v.3.50.0, GEOquery v.2.62.2, and umap v.0.2.8.8 were used to analyze the differentially expressed genes in GSE149440 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) was used for RT-qPCR amplification of OR6X1 and OR4E2. Results: Our transcriptomic datasets analysis revealed 25.08% and 26.75% downregulated olfactory receptor (ORs) in mild nontreated gestational hypothyroidism (GHT) and PEC, respectively. In the GSE149440 GEO dataset, we found OR5H1, OR5T3, OR51A7, OR51B6, OR10J5, OR6C6, and OR2AG2 as predictors of early-onset PEC. We also evaluate two chosen biomarkers' responses to levothyroxine. The RT-qPCR demonstrated a difference in OR6X1 and OR4E2 expression between GHT and healthy pregnancy (p < 0.05). Those genes presented a negative correlation with TSH (r: -0.51, p < 0.05; and r: -0.44, p < 0.05), a strong positive correlation with each other (r: 0.89; p < 0.01) and the levothyroxine-treated group had no difference from the healthy one. We conclude that ORs could be used as biomarkers at the beginning of gestation, and the downregulated ORs found in GHT may be improved with levothyroxine treatment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60b841579543c72336542e4b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"23","pagesFromTo":"16681","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65b8f3854097073f66008fe8","65b8f3854097073f66008fe9","65b8f3854097073f66008fea","65b8f3854097073f66008feb","65b8f3854097073f66008fec","65b8f3854097073f66008fed","65b8f3854097073f66008fee","65b8f3854097073f66008fef","65b8f3854097073f66008ff1","65b8f3854097073f66008ff2","65b8f3854097073f66008ff3","60b841579543c72336542e4b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","eissn":"1422-0067","documentHash":"30236fd5-adc3-4b09-b2c8-6a106b437fa9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"656046ea40970749a8572fd9","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"24","number":"23","documentHash":"bf0d8dda-c3b6-4bd6-a250-8d35ae788806"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mild gestational hypothyroidismpreeclampsiaolfactory receptortranscriptomecirculating RNApredictive biomarkers"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059304051"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b9230f4097073f660d3ec7","name":"João Bosco","lastName":"Pesquero","documentHash":"48e5194c-3611-45c5-afcb-016893d8b9f0"},{"objectId":"65b9230f4097073f660d3ec6","name":"Michael","lastName":"Bader","documentHash":"313fe044-1de6-42b8-b6ef-bb8424aebe02"},{"objectId":"65b9230f4097073f660d3ec5","name":"Fatimunnisa","lastName":"Qadri","documentHash":"4e88ddd3-7644-4cee-b59c-6cc329cd35a7"},{"objectId":"65b9230f4097073f660d3ec4","name":"Ronaldo","lastName":"de Carvalho Araújo","documentHash":"bacd042c-c88d-4d26-a742-7f05facd5367"},{"objectId":"65b9230f4097073f660d3ec3","name":"Marcos Fernandes","lastName":"Gregnani","documentHash":"656f2f97-746c-413d-9ec1-11478ec76cca"},{"objectId":"65b9230f4097073f660d3ec2","name":"Weslley Wallace","lastName":"Amorim","documentHash":"a8433bac-531e-4e88-a09c-1dfa0012c444"},{"objectId":"65b9230f4097073f660d3ec1","name":"Leonardo","lastName":"Martins","documentHash":"9776541e-16a3-4443-8e30-7b71b7739412"},{"objectId":"60b841579543c72336542e4b","name":"Leonardo","lastName":"De  Souza Martin","uuid":"6464EF1F47F1FAEDF85807AE91891ECF5117C290947A6A946A379E27F812E9E590D4A5A553070DF974BDC87EE5941663AACDE4E7E23E113273ED227F6238E8FB","documentHash":"808cd5c1-5f47-4918-ba84-4c9f478634e7"}],"objectId":"65b9230f4097073f660d3ebf","doi":"10.1007/s00011-023-01766-4","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00011-023-01766-4.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Kinin receptors regulate skeletal muscle regeneration: differential effects for B1 and B2 receptors","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objective and designAfter traumatic skeletal muscle injury, muscle healing is often incomplete and produces extensive fibrosis. Bradykinin (BK) reduces fibrosis in renal and cardiac damage models through the B2 receptor. The B1 receptor expression is induced by damage, and blocking of the kallikrein-kinin system seems to affect the progression of muscular dystrophy. We hypothesized that both kinin B1 and B2 receptors could play a differential role after traumatic muscle injury, and the lack of the B1 receptor could produce more cellular and molecular substrates for myogenesis and fewer substrates for fibrosis, leading to better muscle healing.Material and methodsTo test this hypothesis, tibialis anterior muscles of kinin receptor knockout animals were subjected to traumatic injury. Myogenesis, angiogenesis, fibrosis, and muscle functioning were evaluated.ResultsInjured B1KO mice showed a faster healing progression of the injured area with a larger amount of central nucleated fiber post-injury when compared to control mice. In addition, they exhibited higher neovasculogenic capacity, maintaining optimal tissue perfusion for the post-injury phase; had higher amounts of myogenic markers with less inflammatory infiltrate and tissue destruction. This was followed by higher amounts of SMAD7 and lower amounts of p-SMAD2/3, which resulted in less fibrosis. In contrast, B2KO and B1B2KO mice showed more severetissue destruction and excessive fibrosis. B1KO animals had better results in post-injury functional tests compared to control animals.ConclusionsWe demonstrate that injured skeletal muscle tissues have a better repair capacity with less fibrosis in the presence of B2 receptor and absence of B1 receptor, including better performances in functional tests."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60b841579543c72336542e4b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"72","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"1583-1601","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65b9230f4097073f660d3ec1","65b9230f4097073f660d3ec2","65b9230f4097073f660d3ec3","65b9230f4097073f660d3ec4","65b9230f4097073f660d3ec5","65b9230f4097073f660d3ec6","65b9230f4097073f660d3ec7","60b841579543c72336542e4b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780be","mniswId":"8288","title":"Inflammation Research","issn":"1023-3830","eissn":"1420-908X","documentHash":"7e9082bc-f0cb-4f88-8b11-8924f9c494ea"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65b9230f4097073f660d3ec0","year":"2023","volume":"72","number":"8","documentHash":"af80d4a9-6800-40ae-8d74-89ae4f9364a0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["FibrosisSkeletal muscleInjuryMyogenesisKininContusion"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059310560"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6076acde9543c745d80e5cbd","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Lechowicz ","uuid":"9BFF01BC9875C19DC2E115C6CF15DD5A8860E929C19E0CA65AB2D2DD4D0575BBBDCBB7D797DFF38A605608C356EC7945B1DA779E7D3E06B736E7CB494554BD38","orcidId":"0000-0003-3637-9414","documentHash":"68e97683-a533-4b28-b794-b860e5897a82"},{"objectId":"5e7094d9878c28a0473c52ca","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Słomka","uuid":"8C424EA3689D9B046DEBD81C91C9F7D99DD2CF9FE16FDB38587C621D57325A8F79EFB2618FA36A491E277993833CAD7BB5662C3F997A895E953CD0012919E36F","orcidId":"0000-0002-7906-5549","documentHash":"4f5316dc-1dc6-4378-a181-8e3d189927ae"},{"objectId":"5e70947d878c28a0473be468","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Błaszczyk","uuid":"11EFA6EE9597828742233AFC268F3E8F08E320DA6B224FE4F4A41F4775F072A8ECD6435C61F1EB58A1EA5D1568E782802161154C80150299D342A03C3A8A5DCD","documentHash":"13b87717-ea75-4604-b821-0babcb0444e8"},{"objectId":"5e7093e2878c28a0473b2992","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Płociński","uuid":"6B0F29EBEDBD49FBB224A8E05AF7D50631BDB6EEDB48C7256D97F2A0C80FBF0ABBAC39B320A4BA603BAEE85E51F69B2B7DB32F8670F00B169B805DADD4C0DB91","orcidId":"0000-0002-6623-3494","documentHash":"07fbb8d8-b856-437a-a761-5cd45a316088"},{"objectId":"5e70939c878c28a0473adb7c","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Dziadek","uuid":"9B927D3D805FC945C37B101C2485E48FF27D09AE1413782FD28E5D3D0D63884C2414BF61FC4A4808ED7E2EFFBBE16A893F6418C71A119A476BADD4D402E73280","orcidId":"0000-0002-4942-7385","documentHash":"d6d43e8e-9d72-47ea-ac32-0bd0c6a0be16"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dd26","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Korycka-Machała","uuid":"DB40DCCDE6FED01AABD31EC27576214DCD994D6B7EFB62E1D207DF88C602DCEBE1910F802802F33EF76D2B9DC677A70A81CC1D80D9FD008E6E49619B7D76240F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0341-9873","documentHash":"1ec8a168-8a2b-448c-a80c-db6f8bf185eb"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b4e8","name":"Anna","lastName":"Brzostek","uuid":"B7CD0B072EAF2F79DF37612BEC4819FA8CD9F6ABB8BEA303376F95940DF0D5C01303A6DBA308A61DF9E46B53778E153D47147B7A2251674D40954D26C4195DE7","orcidId":"0000-0002-7335-9853","documentHash":"f55ae53c-35cf-4a73-ae32-ca74544dbe59"},{"objectId":"5e709229878c28a047390e3e","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Dziadek","uuid":"BE506B6FEF9F09CD0BE65E7F9C32A7B11C89A3F9C02BDC99B8AB6B2055112D48AC75C443975729BB2398B3A2EB6EC7210FF8C57C5231A979DE8B6AD84230B2D2","orcidId":"0000-0003-1427-884X","documentHash":"b50df883-d955-45e2-bc1b-2ad9d404bd73"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-11-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65b0e1a540970719778d947f","doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-47944-6","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-47944-6","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Depletion of tRNA CCA ‑ adding enzyme in Mycobacterium tuberculosis leads to polyadenylation of transcripts and precursor tRNAs","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In reference to gene annotation, more than half of the tRNA species synthesized by Mycobacterium\r\ntuberculosis require the enzymatic addition of the cytosine-cytosine-adenine (CCA) tail, which is\r\nindispensable for amino acid charging and tRNA functionality.

In sepsis, plasma cfDNA is mostly derived from neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) degradation. Proposed NET-directed therapeutic strategies include preventing NET formation or accelerating NET degradation. However, NET digestion liberates pathogens and releases cfDNA that promote thrombosis and endothelial cell injury. We propose an alternative strategy of cfDNA and NET stabilization with chemokine platelet factor 4 (PF4, CXCL4). We previously showed that human PF4 (hPF4) enhances NET-mediated microbial entrapment. We now show that hPF4 interferes with thrombogenicity of cfDNA and NETs by preventing their cleavage to short-fragment and single-stranded cfDNA that more effectively activates the contact pathway of coagulation. In vitro, hPF4 also inhibits cfDNA-induced endothelial tissue factor surface expression and von Willebrand factor release. In vivo, hPF4 expression reduced plasma thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) levels in animals infused with exogenous cfDNA. Following lipopolysaccharide challenge, Cxcl4-/- mice had significant elevation in plasma TAT, cfDNA, and cystatin C levels, effects prevented by hPF4 infusion. These results show that hPF4 interacts with cfDNA and NETs to limit thrombosis and endothelial injury, an observation of potential clinical benefit in the treatment of sepsis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709326878c28a0473a3b26"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"8","issue":"22","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65b7edeb4097073a0762d3a1","65b7edeb4097073a0762d3a2","65b7edeb4097073a0762d3a3","65b7edeb4097073a0762d3a4","65b7edeb4097073a0762d3a5","65b7edeb4097073a0762d3a6","65b7edeb4097073a0762d3a7","65b7edeb4097073a0762d3a8","65b7edeb4097073a0762d3a9","5e709326878c28a0473a3b26","65b7edeb4097073a0762d3aa","65b7edeb4097073a0762d3ab","65b7edeb4097073a0762d3ac","65b7edeb4097073a0762d3ad","65b7edeb4097073a0762d3ae","65b7edeb4097073a0762d3af"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c667","mniswId":"9859","title":"JCI Insight","issn":"2379-3708","eissn":"2379-3708","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"a9989d26-0976-40f7-b87b-b74100d785aa"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65b7edeb4097073a0762d3a0","year":"2023","volume":"8","number":"22","documentHash":"7901dcee-9ab2-4800-961f-15ae26c28fdf"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["PEPTIDYLARGININE DEIMINASE INHIBITIONHEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIAFACTOR-XICYSTIC-FIBROSISDORNASE-ALPHASEPSISMICECOAGULATIONACTIVATIONELASTASE"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059347837"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b7d8d74097073a07607015","name":"Michal","lastName":"Hocek","documentHash":"9cf5ad8a-ee5c-49cc-b602-9ed632c149a1"},{"objectId":"65b7d8d74097073a07607014","name":"Ciara K.","lastName":"O’Sullivan","documentHash":"574bc221-7223-42a1-a44e-439b3243ddea"},{"objectId":"65b7d8d74097073a07607012","name":"Cansu Pinar","lastName":"Yenice","documentHash":"760cffed-f42d-4e18-b512-490477b8a632"},{"objectId":"65b7d8d74097073a07607011","name":"Veronika","lastName":"Sýkorová","documentHash":"b987d9f1-57d8-461b-829f-b6ff6a2413da"},{"objectId":"65b7d8d74097073a07607010","name":"Mayreli","lastName":"Ortiz","documentHash":"2f01bb87-0a81-4a46-87a8-5d21cc8d77cc"},{"objectId":"65b7d8d74097073a0760700f","name":"David","lastName":"Kodr","documentHash":"2bdd108c-8281-4e66-a9ee-94c30d928d5c"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b42e","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Leśnikowski","uuid":"7ED183972D060C4B717C2F73C569B82B28E699AA5BF497DB4A0ECD7886F30D4958900C7F0FC5BF2DFAAB3DE74B5D1195A0E721A88846245CD0851311556BA425","orcidId":"0000-0003-3158-5796","documentHash":"2e13e105-5001-4930-a975-c988ca2327ac"}],"objectId":"65b7d8d74097073a0760700d","doi":"10.1021/acs.analchem.3c02023","publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c02023","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Normalized Multipotential Redox Coding of DNA Bases for Determination of Total Nucleotide Composition","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The previously reported approach of orthogonal multipotentialredoxcoding of all four DNA bases allowed only analysis of the relativenucleotide composition of short DNA stretches.

Its complex molecular nature leads to significant heterogeneity and variable responses to therapy. ABC proteins, which for many years were regarded as the pillar of the resistance to chemotherapy because they export anticancer drugs from cancer cells, have recently been identified as interesting molecular markers associated with many other physiological functions. We previously reported that during the phenotypic transition, CRC differentially regulates the expression of two transporters, ABCC4 and ABCG2. In cells with a mesenchymal and invasive phenotype, ABCC4 is upregulated, and ABCG2 is downregulated. We have therefore decided to explore this phenomenon by analysing samples from CRC patients with high expression of either ABCC4 or ABCG2 to determine their potential use as markers of therapeutic outcome.Abstract Background: Our previous findings proved that ABCC4 and ABCG2 proteins present much more complex roles in colorectal cancer (CRC) than typically cancer-associated functions as drug exporters. Our objective was to evaluate their predictive/diagnostic potential. Methods: CRC patients' transcriptomic data from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE18105, GSE21510 and GSE41568) were discriminated into two subpopulations presenting either high expression levels of ABCC4 (ABCC4 High) or ABCG2 (ABCG2 High). Subpopulations were analysed using various bioinformatical tools and platforms (KEEG, Gene Ontology, FunRich v3.1.3, TIMER2.0 and STRING 12.0). Results: The analysed subpopulations present different gene expression patterns. The protein-protein interaction network of subpopulation-specific genes revealed the top hub proteins in ABCC4 High: RPS27A, SRSF1, DDX3X, BPTF, RBBP7, POLR1B, HNRNPA2B1, PSMD14, NOP58 and EIF2S3 and in ABCG2 High: MAPK3, HIST2H2BE, LMNA, HIST1H2BD, HIST1H2BK, HIST1H2AC, FYN, TLR4, FLNA and HIST1H2AJ. Additionally, our multi-omics analysis proved that the ABCC4 expression correlates with substantially increased tumour-associated macrophage infiltration and sensitivity to FOLFOX treatment. Conclusions: ABCC4 and ABCG2 may be used to distinguish CRC subpopulations that present different molecular and physiological functions.

Newborns are primarily protected by innate immune mechanisms. Collectins (mannose-binding lectin, collectin-10, collectin-11, collectin-12, surfactant protein A, surfactant protein D) and ficolins (ficolin-1, ficolin-2, ficolin-3) are oligomeric, collagen-related defence lectins, involved in innate immune response. In this review, we discuss the structure, specificity, genetics and role of collectins and ficolins in neonatal health and disease.

The reason for this outcome is the frequent acquisition of cancer cell resistance to platinum-based drugs and unresponsiveness to standard therapy. It has been increasingly recognized that the ability of ovarian cancer cells to adopt more aggressive behavior (mainly through the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, EMT), as well as dedifferentiation into cancer stem cells, significantly affects drug resistance acquisition. Transcription factors in the Snail family have been implicated in ovarian cancer chemoresistance and metastasis. In this article, we summarize published data that reveal Snail proteins not only as key inducers of the EMT in ovarian cancer but also as crucial links between the acquisition of ovarian cancer stem properties and spheroid formation. These Snail-related characteristics significantly affect the ovarian cancer cell response to treatment and are related to the acquisition of chemoresistance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b7878c28a04739b4f4","5e709325878c28a0473a3b0e","5e709326878c28a0473a3b1d","5e709326878c28a0473a3b19"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"1878","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"189003","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709325878c28a0473a3b0e","5e709326878c28a0473a3b19","5e7092b7878c28a04739b4f4","5e709326878c28a0473a3b1d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547731d","mniswId":"2389","title":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta - Reviews on Cancer","issn":"0304-419X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"a699dc7b-b820-4246-bf87-0ebc55e482ca"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65293663409707676961a3bf","year":"2023","volume":"1878","number":"6","documentHash":"be5399de-ed9a-4b54-ac69-d3bfaaf2eb35"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cancer stem cells; Chemoresistance; Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; Ovarian cancer; SNAIL."]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059360706"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"60fa43839543c744c19b0ee5","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Pastwińska","uuid":"14781397C7F7AF97AAEE41496FEC60E4D7EB66B223B6AA98976146E70CC314BDFAB9C8D9BCB0169BC46976667BDB2D975E877D83094AB721BB585FA6A160E38B","documentHash":"b11af012-cc92-49fa-a18a-57f86ca76696"},{"objectId":"5e7094c7878c28a0473c3940","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Bachorz","uuid":"F7A031D1987667908A493430925B57278AA3D1847660C5BD52AFEE2928DA8FE92351D89E49B4BC7F5C7B3F1226E2A152B6E4EC96A110D6B643828570B6F7F475","documentHash":"262b7d3c-a294-4308-aa50-98403ac0ddae"},{"objectId":"5e709326878c28a0473a3b52","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Karwaciak","uuid":"07DCCCF633946D0D382FA333B03FA29532E8FAABCE8B31805A354A7069B3E181D2C04FE9EBA0FE5499A48BB2418D45D0FD64AAD6E3B93DCBE6C29AEA62DC47E9","documentHash":"0c2307a8-e439-4e83-97a9-8842d78c5e45"},{"objectId":"5e709325878c28a0473a3b0d","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Ratajewski","uuid":"B1291B914CCBBB6C14FBE1C256BB487B869EF5824C470D3BC8E042F7037B0D9B1804950A658997EE241528D9DD362A0B61F1CE4E6FA15E8A2174837A8745BE4F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5391-5843","documentHash":"ebcf4e46-75f1-4c03-8489-9f1302e03e9f"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b7b0","name":"Kaja","lastName":"Karaś","uuid":"110929C60656ECB7DEF1B7327306C4A1680CE63A323B4B9EFC79C2D5852151F2A150F830C5734163364197B896C5894F11CFBF8ECADE2E4D9A286BFAD04BD0DA","documentHash":"f79970e8-a9cd-47f4-bdb0-ee79e36c8324"}],"objectId":"65b930e64097073f660ea937","doi":"10.1016/j.bbcan.2023.189021","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0304419X23001701?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"RORγT agonists as immune modulators in anticancer therapy.","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"RORγT is a transcription factor that directs the development of Th17 lymphocytes and other IL-17-expressing cells (e.g., Tc17 and ILC3 cells). These cells are involved in the body's defense against pathogenic bacteria and fungi, but they also participate in maintaining the proinflammatory environment in some autoimmune diseases and play a role in the immune system's response to cancer. Similar to other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, the activity of RORγT is regulated by low-molecular-weight ligands. Therefore, extensive efforts have been dedicated to identifying inverse agonists that diminish the activity of this receptor and subsequently inhibit the development of autoimmune diseases. Unfortunately, in the pursuit of an ideal inverse agonist, the development of agonists has been overlooked. It is important to remember that these types of compounds, by stimulating lymphocytes expressing RORγT (Th17 and Tc17), can enhance the immune system's response to tumors. In this review, we present recent advancements in the biology of RORγT agonists and their potential application in anticancer therapy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709325878c28a0473a3b0d","60fa43839543c744c19b0ee5","5e709326878c28a0473a3b52","5e7094c7878c28a0473c3940","5e7092b9878c28a04739b7b0"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"1878","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"189021","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60fa43839543c744c19b0ee5","5e709326878c28a0473a3b52","5e7094c7878c28a0473c3940","5e709325878c28a0473a3b0d","5e7092b9878c28a04739b7b0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547731d","mniswId":"2389","title":"Biochimica et Biophysica Acta - Reviews on Cancer","issn":"0304-419X","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"a699dc7b-b820-4246-bf87-0ebc55e482ca"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65293663409707676961a3bf","year":"2023","volume":"1878","number":"6","documentHash":"be5399de-ed9a-4b54-ac69-d3bfaaf2eb35"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Adoptive therapy; Agonists; Immune system stimulation; RORγT; Tc17; Th17"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059360915"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"660c2a134097076263dd942b","name":"Wagdy M.","lastName":"Eldehna","documentHash":"e0e9dadf-aa73-4cb2-87ac-4c9b64489e61"},{"objectId":"660c2a134097076263dd942a","name":"Eslam B.","lastName":"Elkaeed","documentHash":"f22d4f3e-a267-4f76-9009-506d88364817"},{"objectId":"660c2a134097076263dd9429","name":"Ahmed E.","lastName":"Elsawi","documentHash":"1262cd0e-5481-4d3a-98e4-a2c1fcc02b87"},{"objectId":"660c2a134097076263dd9428","name":"Mohamed Farouk","lastName":"Hamissa","documentHash":"fda2947c-f660-472a-8737-499d6d2d6c55"},{"objectId":"660c2a134097076263dd9427","name":"Xuan Nguyen","lastName":"Ha","documentHash":"f7ddfc44-c8c4-4f38-b7bd-4671dde58462"},{"objectId":"660c2a134097076263dd9426","name":"Ninh The","lastName":"Son","documentHash":"533c9db5-95fb-457a-8249-ca30db158ebb"},{"objectId":"660c2a134097076263dd9425","name":"Rehab Mustafa","lastName":"Badi","documentHash":"092c6f50-6ee4-4526-b9fa-4d2157047296"},{"objectId":"660c2a134097076263dd9423","name":"Ahmed","lastName":"Sabt","documentHash":"bdc1d9bb-2ea2-43d7-93d4-d728ba42737e"},{"objectId":"660c2a134097076263dd9422","name":"Eman F.","lastName":"Khaleel","documentHash":"93713ae7-3ed1-4312-9e58-03daad0745dc"},{"objectId":"5e70939c878c28a0473adb7c","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Dziadek","uuid":"9B927D3D805FC945C37B101C2485E48FF27D09AE1413782FD28E5D3D0D63884C2414BF61FC4A4808ED7E2EFFBBE16A893F6418C71A119A476BADD4D402E73280","orcidId":"0000-0002-4942-7385","documentHash":"d6d43e8e-9d72-47ea-ac32-0bd0c6a0be16"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dd26","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Korycka-Machała","uuid":"DB40DCCDE6FED01AABD31EC27576214DCD994D6B7EFB62E1D207DF88C602DCEBE1910F802802F33EF76D2B9DC677A70A81CC1D80D9FD008E6E49619B7D76240F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0341-9873","documentHash":"1ec8a168-8a2b-448c-a80c-db6f8bf185eb"},{"objectId":"5e709229878c28a047390e3e","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Dziadek","uuid":"BE506B6FEF9F09CD0BE65E7F9C32A7B11C89A3F9C02BDC99B8AB6B2055112D48AC75C443975729BB2398B3A2EB6EC7210FF8C57C5231A979DE8B6AD84230B2D2","orcidId":"0000-0003-1427-884X","documentHash":"b50df883-d955-45e2-bc1b-2ad9d404bd73"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-01-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"660c2a134097076263dd9421","doi":"10.1016/j.bioorg.2024.107138","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bioorg.2024.107138","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Identification of new anti-mycobacterial agents based on quinoline-isatin hybrids targeting enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Tuberculosis (TB) is a global issue that poses a significant economic burden as a result of the ongoing emergence of drug-resistant strains. The urgent requirement for the development of novel antitubercular drugs can be addressed by targeting specific enzymes. One such enzyme, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) enoyl-acyl carrier protein (enoyl-ACP) reductase (InhA), plays a crucial role in the survival of the MTB bacterium. In this research study, a series of hybrid compounds combining quinolone and isatin were synthesized and assessed for their effectiveness against MTB, as well as their ability to inhibit the activity of the InhA enzyme in this bacterium. Among the compounds tested, 7a and 5g exhibited the most potent inhibitory activity against MTB, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 55 and 62.5 µg/mL, respectively. These compounds were further evaluated for their inhibitory effects on InhA and demonstrated significant activity compared to the reference drug Isoniazid (INH), with IC50 values of 0.35 ± 0.01 and 1.56 ± 0.06 µM, respectively. Molecular docking studies investigated the interactions between compounds 7a and 5g and the target enzyme, revealing hydrophobic contacts with important amino acid residues in the active site. To further confirm the stability of the complexes formed by 5g and 7a with the target enzyme, molecular dynamic simulations were employed, which demonstrated that both compounds 7a and 5g undergo minor structural changes and remain nearly stable throughout the simulated process, as assessed through RMSD, RMSF, and Rg values."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709229878c28a047390e3e","5e7092d6878c28a04739dd26"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"144","pagesFromTo":"1-13","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["660c2a134097076263dd9422","660c2a134097076263dd9423","660c2a134097076263dd9425","660c2a134097076263dd9426","660c2a134097076263dd9427","660c2a134097076263dd9428","660c2a134097076263dd9429","660c2a134097076263dd942a","5e70939c878c28a0473adb7c","660c2a134097076263dd942b","5e709229878c28a047390e3e","5e7092d6878c28a04739dd26"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547737f","mniswId":"2516","title":"Bioorganic Chemistry","issn":"0045-2068","eissn":"1090-2120","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"24ae38a8-632b-44ac-a90c-1303d15954f2"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biological activities","mycobacterium tuberculosis","inhA inhibitors","molecular docking","molecular dynamics simulation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059515621"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"602e23149543c7410626ed18","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Szczerbiec","uuid":"EFDAA069020E1315AFD45B0993FBF5CC30F99A6289AF85D69EDAF0DFD803581C3A9F9BDE4B4E90E0B75E48E14612752851D0C40B3562CF99F4816DA0BC4DF641","orcidId":"0000-0001-9062-456X","documentHash":"c8ff2882-c58d-4fdd-ac6e-c4c2dcc4034d"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa8e3","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Torzewska","uuid":"3EE20B6105C39D2EDB8550E258988B73CB17E015B906107759C4B61536D0E1095BCF01C9BF11D83C61A98858F53148A77083CF4AACB523BCC6DB86F98CB9CA7C","orcidId":"0000-0002-4861-1375","documentHash":"45860a1a-7680-4948-b9e8-dcadcbc72253"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b4f3","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Bednarska-Szczepaniak","uuid":"6F3E3AD75B78EC56272FB31153FFFD39F28F2AAE3A03F35ACD5F5FB6B42F1B524FDE1863DA742E1450548498DD57F10C0F00167E3E8C3B06F8FBE97F972EE9AE","documentHash":"087ddb41-e64d-4c11-a8c0-c1ad450f5e39"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-01-10","releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":0,"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"660c2ab94097076263dd978e","doi":"10.1038/s41598-024-51323-0","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-51323-0","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Antibacterial properties and urease suppression ability ofLactobacillusinhibit the development of infectious urinary stones caused by Proteus mirabilis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Infectious urolithiasis is a type of urolithiasis, that is caused by infections of the urinary tract by \r\nbacteria producing urease such as Proteus mirabilis.

The aim of the study was \r\nto determine the impact of Lactobacillus strains isolated from human urine on crystallization of \r\nurine components caused by P. mirabilis by measuring bacterial viability (CFU/mL), pH, ammonia \r\nrelease, concentration of crystallized salts and by observing crystals by phase contrast microscopy. \r\nMoreover, the efect of lactic acid on the activity of urease was examined by the kinetic method \r\nand in silico study. In the presence of selected Lactobacillus strains, the crystallization process was \r\ninhibited.

One of them is the MnoSR system involved in the regulation of methylotrophic metabolism in M. smegmatis. Methods: Mycobacterium smegmatis mutant strains Delta mnoS, Delta mnoR and Delta mnoS/R lacking functional mnoS, mnoR and both genes were generated using a homologous recombination approach. MnoR recombinant protein was purified by affinity column chromatography. The present study employs molecular biology techniques: cloning strategies, global RNA sequencing, qRT-PCR, EMSA, Microscale thermophoresis, and bioinformatics analysis. Results and discussion: The triangle mnoS, triangle mnoR, and triangle mnoS/R mutant strains were generated and cultured in the presence of defined carbon sources. Growth curve analysis confirmed that inactivation of the MnoSR impairs the ability of M. smegmatis cells to use alcohols such as 1,3-propanediol and ethanol but improves the bacterial growth on ethylene glycol, xylitol, and glycerol. The total RNA sequencing method was employed to understand the importance of MnoSR in the global responses of mycobacteria to limited carbon access and in carbon-rich conditions. The loss of MnoSR significantly affected carbon utilization in the case of mycobacteria cultured on glucose or 1,3-propanediol as sole carbon sources as it influenced the expression of multiple metabolic pathways. The numerous transcriptional changes could not be linked to the presence of evident MnoR DNA-binding sites within the promotor regions for the genes outside of the mno operon. This was confirmed by EMSA and microscale thermophoresis with mutated MnoR binding consensus region. Our comprehensive analysis highlights the system's vital role in metabolic adaptability, providing insights into its potential impact on the environmental survival of mycobacteria."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af7c4","5e7092d6878c28a04739dd26","5e709229878c28a047390e3e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709216878c28a04738fb3a"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"Art. id. 1427829","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af7c4","66d6c40ffdbe834432884a5a","5e7092d6878c28a04739dd26","66d6c40ffdbe834432884a5b","66d6c40ffdbe834432884a5c","5e709216878c28a04738fb3a","66d6c40ffdbe834432884a5e","5e709229878c28a047390e3e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d58","mniswId":"6831","title":"Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology","issn":"2235-2988","eissn":"2235-2988","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"f404ba5b-ab30-482c-9d14-8bb0bf9903c7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66b4977afdbe83691bca3f24","year":"2024","volume":"14","documentHash":"e44ccc46-e649-4b15-8a45-bb82d006af43"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["RNA-Seq","histidine sensor kinase MnoS","methylotrophic metabolism","mycobacterium smegmatis","response regulator MnoR"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059736529"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66d6ade9fdbe834432874229","name":"Rasha Z.","lastName":"Batran","documentHash":"e0c45c5c-597b-4908-a5c8-a9ebc470132b"},{"objectId":"66d6ade9fdbe834432874228","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kuzioła","documentHash":"1529a005-b4ef-4da7-96ab-f7847e27318b"},{"objectId":"66d6ade9fdbe834432874227","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Dziadek","documentHash":"007b98f8-1047-4cb2-bdd6-6bd8e2222ad2"},{"objectId":"66d6ade9fdbe834432874226","name":"Malwina","lastName":"Kawka","documentHash":"7f0118dc-c8de-44a7-bdbd-90d0f2a2eae8"},{"objectId":"66d6ade9fdbe834432874225","name":"Moataz A.","lastName":"Shaldam","documentHash":"30813e6b-5a50-4e2e-8753-b6ae4f38f15a"},{"objectId":"66d6ade9fdbe834432874224","name":"Ahmed","lastName":"Sabt","documentHash":"af1d5bac-a0f9-4b60-9edc-165de6896614"},{"objectId":"66d6ade9fdbe834432874223","name":"Asmaa F.","lastName":"Kassem","documentHash":"0a9061fc-ca0f-4311-b7de-a50a4ffb5aef"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dd26","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Korycka-Machała","uuid":"DB40DCCDE6FED01AABD31EC27576214DCD994D6B7EFB62E1D207DF88C602DCEBE1910F802802F33EF76D2B9DC677A70A81CC1D80D9FD008E6E49619B7D76240F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0341-9873","documentHash":"1ec8a168-8a2b-448c-a80c-db6f8bf185eb"},{"objectId":"5e709229878c28a047390e3e","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Dziadek","uuid":"BE506B6FEF9F09CD0BE65E7F9C32A7B11C89A3F9C02BDC99B8AB6B2055112D48AC75C443975729BB2398B3A2EB6EC7210FF8C57C5231A979DE8B6AD84230B2D2","orcidId":"0000-0003-1427-884X","documentHash":"b50df883-d955-45e2-bc1b-2ad9d404bd73"}],"objectId":"66d6ade9fdbe834432874221","doi":"10.1016/j.bioorg.2024.107511","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0045206824004164?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"New coumarin linked thiazole derivatives as antimycobacterial agents: Design, synthesis, enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA) inhibition and molecular modeling","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Tuberculosis is a global serious problem that imposes major health, economic and social challenges worldwide. The search for new antitubercular drugs is extremely important which could be achieved via inhibition of different druggable targets. Mycobacterium tuberculosis enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA) enzyme is essential for the survival of M. tuberculosis . In this investigation, a series of coumarin based thiazole derivatives was synthesized relying on a molecular hybridization approach and was assessed against the wild type Mtb H37Rv and its mutant strain ( Delta katG ) via inhibiting InhA enzyme. Among the synthesized derivatives, compounds 2b , 3i and 3j were the most potent against wild type M. tuberculosis with MIC values ranging from 6 to 8 mu g/ mL and displayed low cytotoxicity towards mouse fibroblasts at concentrations 8-13 times higher than the MIC values. The three hybrids could also inhibit the growth of Delta katG mutant strain which is resistant to isoniazid (INH). Compounds 2b and 3j were able to inhibit the growth of mycobacteria inside human macrophages, indicating their ability to penetrate human professional phagocytes. The two derivatives significantly suppress mycobacterial biofilm formation by 10-15 %. The promising target compounds were also assessed for their inhibitory effect against InhA and showed potent effectiveness with IC 50 values of 0.737 and 1.494 mu M, respectively. Molecular docking studies revealed that the tested compounds occupied the active site of InhA in contact with the NAD + molecule. The 4-phenylcoumarin aromatic system showed binding interactions within the hydrophobic pocket of the active site. Furthermore, H -bond formation and pi - pi stacking interactions were also recorded for the promising derivatives."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709229878c28a047390e3e","5e7092d6878c28a04739dd26"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"150","pagesFromTo":"107511","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66d6ade9fdbe834432874223","66d6ade9fdbe834432874224","5e7092d6878c28a04739dd26","66d6ade9fdbe834432874225","66d6ade9fdbe834432874226","66d6ade9fdbe834432874227","66d6ade9fdbe834432874228","5e709229878c28a047390e3e","66d6ade9fdbe834432874229"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547737f","mniswId":"2516","title":"Bioorganic Chemistry","doi":"10.1016/j.bioorg","issn":"0045-2068","eissn":"1090-2120","websiteLink":"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00452068","documentHash":"a25c409b-a8c0-4999-a775-ece2c7c18237"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66d6ade9fdbe834432874222","year":"2024","volume":"150","documentHash":"349c515b-4487-4171-8ce3-ff0be35adb5b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CoumarinThiazoleThiosemicarbazideTBInhAMolecular Modeling"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059759900"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66d6b16efdbe834432875308","name":"Wolfgang A.

These substances hinder the function of the sodium-potassium pump within eukaryotic cells. Many reports have shown that these compounds influence the activity of nuclear receptors. Thus, we assessed the effects of various cardiac glycosides at nontoxic concentrations on ROR gamma and ROR gamma T. ROR gamma T is a crucial protein involved in the differentiation of Th17 lymphocytes. Sixteen analyzed cardiac glycosides exhibited varying toxicities in HepG2 cells, all of which demonstrated agonistic effects on ROR gamma, as confirmed in the ROR gamma-HepG2 reporter cell line. The overexpression of both the ROR gamma and ROR gamma T isoforms intensified the effects of these compounds. Additionally, these glycosides induced the expression of G6PC, a gene regulated by ROR gamma, in HepG2 cells. Subsequently, the effects of two endogenous cardiac glycosides (marinobufagenin and ouabain) and the three most potent glycosides (bufalin, oleandrin, and telecinobufagenin) were evaluated in Th17 primary lymphocytes. All of these compounds increased the expression of the IL17A, IL17F, IFNG, and CXCL10 genes, but they exhibited varying effects on GZMB and CCL20 expression. Molecular docking analysis revealed the robust binding affinity of cardiac glycosides for the ligand binding domain of the ROR gamma/ROR gamma T receptors. Thus, we demonstrated that at nontoxic concentrations, cardiac glycosides have agonistic effects on ROR gamma/ROR gamma T nuclear receptors, augmenting their activity. This potential can be harnessed to modulate the phenotype of IL17-expressing cells (e.g., Th17 or Tc17 lymphocytes) in adoptive therapy for combating various types of cancer."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709325878c28a0473a3b0d","60fa43839543c744c19b0ee5","5e709326878c28a0473a3b52","5e7092d8878c28a04739de9d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"759","pagesFromTo":"110085","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709326878c28a0473a3b52","60fa43839543c744c19b0ee5","5e7092d8878c28a04739de9d","5e7094a0878c28a0473c0a85","5e709325878c28a0473a3b0d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477189","mniswId":"1646","title":"ARCHIVES OF BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS","issn":"0003-9861","eissn":"1096-0384","documentHash":"71147359-b59f-4f6f-a122-51fe0789c392"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66d5d283fdbe8351d9254e0a","year":"2024","volume":"759","documentHash":"fc8beb74-56eb-4128-b279-a5d549be8348"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ROR gamma TRORCTh17AgonistCardiac glycosidesBufalinOuabain"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059804150"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66d72350fdbe8344328c27a9","name":"Wagdy M.","lastName":"Eldehna","documentHash":"71cbb8c2-c362-481b-a9e4-e76d2c748169"},{"objectId":"66d72350fdbe8344328c27a8","name":"Bozena","lastName":"Dziadek","documentHash":"a8a9c906-eb5c-4b82-9ba3-bfdbdcbb2767"},{"objectId":"66d72350fdbe8344328c27a7","name":"Ahmed E.","lastName":"Elsawi","documentHash":"c0533a7e-f0d5-45d1-a069-cde2c643937e"},{"objectId":"66d72350fdbe8344328c27a6","name":"Thamer","lastName":"Traiki","documentHash":"b8ceddd3-7c07-4263-bf21-659ac0cbb92a"},{"objectId":"66d72350fdbe8344328c27a5","name":"Mansoor-Ali","lastName":"Vaali Mohammed","documentHash":"508cfe12-ba11-495d-b434-7f5fec23fe7e"},{"objectId":"66d72350fdbe8344328c27a4","name":"Nguyen Xuan","lastName":"Ha","documentHash":"10300dea-08ae-47f6-8785-95a4c406596f"},{"objectId":"66d72350fdbe8344328c27a3","name":"Ninh The","lastName":"Son","documentHash":"564971f9-6faa-499f-8620-665786256c24"},{"objectId":"66d72350fdbe8344328c27a2","name":"Hayam A.","lastName":"Abd El Salam","documentHash":"b49b6882-7bf8-45f8-8376-3b807c09e980"},{"objectId":"66d72350fdbe8344328c27a1","name":"Manal S.","lastName":"Ebaid","documentHash":"83ace9a6-7428-490c-bca3-5b73efe7d493"},{"objectId":"66d72350fdbe8344328c27a0","name":"Maha-Hamadien","lastName":"Abdulla","documentHash":"ee56debb-d8fe-416f-96cf-0d5f7cc8eaea"},{"objectId":"66d72350fdbe8344328c279f","name":"Ahmed","lastName":"Sabt","documentHash":"7ec5ba82-10dd-45ca-ae20-401558bd25be"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b521","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Pawełczyk","uuid":"633D8D3C7A804B6BC2640E8A54B660BEB864E273363AC4430224734EA4936A7BC3C05C9C7B9842B7328C3E7A2D20FCEEE7AC8BB811233FA5F29B616921E30C44","orcidId":"0000-0001-6863-8594","documentHash":"ecc9e6ad-1e61-4b8e-8059-589efd8b53d8"},{"objectId":"5e709229878c28a047390e3e","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Dziadek","uuid":"BE506B6FEF9F09CD0BE65E7F9C32A7B11C89A3F9C02BDC99B8AB6B2055112D48AC75C443975729BB2398B3A2EB6EC7210FF8C57C5231A979DE8B6AD84230B2D2","orcidId":"0000-0003-1427-884X","documentHash":"b50df883-d955-45e2-bc1b-2ad9d404bd73"}],"objectId":"66d72350fdbe8344328c279e","doi":"10.3389/fchem.2024.1424017","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fchem.2024.1424017/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Identification of 2-(N-aryl-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl) quinoline derivatives as antitubercular agents endowed with InhA inhibitory activity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis strains has become a significant economic burden globally. To tackle this challenge, there is a need to develop new drugs that target specific mycobacterial enzymes. Among these enzymes, InhA, which is crucial for the survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is a key target for drug development. Herein, 24 compounds were synthesized by merging 4-carboxyquinoline with triazole motifs. These molecules were then tested for their effectiveness against different strains of tuberculosis, including M. bovis BCG, M. tuberculosis, and M. abscessus. Additionally, their ability to inhibit the InhA enzyme was also evaluated. Several molecules showed potential as inhibitors of M. tuberculosis. Compound 5n displayed the highest efficacy with a MIC value of 12.5 mu g/mL. Compounds 5g, 5i, and 5n exhibited inhibitory effects on InhA. Notably, 5n showed significant activity compared to the reference drug Isoniazid. Molecular docking analysis revealed interactions between these molecules and their target enzyme. Additionally, the molecular dynamic simulations confirmed the stability of the complexes formed by quinoline-triazole conjugate 5n with the InhA. Finally, 5n underwent in silico analysis to predict its ADME characteristics. These findings provide promising insights for developing novel small compounds that are safe and effective for the global fight against tuberculosis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709229878c28a047390e3e","5e7092b7878c28a04739b521"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66d72350fdbe8344328c279f","66d72350fdbe8344328c27a0","66d72350fdbe8344328c27a1","5e7092b7878c28a04739b521","66d72350fdbe8344328c27a2","66d72350fdbe8344328c27a3","66d72350fdbe8344328c27a4","66d72350fdbe8344328c27a5","66d72350fdbe8344328c27a6","66d72350fdbe8344328c27a7","66d72350fdbe8344328c27a8","5e709229878c28a047390e3e","66d72350fdbe8344328c27a9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c1ac","mniswId":"6833","title":"Frontiers in Chemistry","issn":"2296-2646","eissn":"2296-2646","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"0a6d3380-36a7-4f86-b584-b5ea2f1a2bf5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"660fc373409707210bc2383a","year":"2024","volume":"12","documentHash":"64c171eb-6d90-42d8-97b4-1db9efcf34e3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["quinolinetriazolebiological evaluationsmolecular dockingMD simulation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059807750"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66e2e08bfdbe83163ab136ef","name":"Asmaa F.","lastName":"Kassem","documentHash":"6bcd444a-ecb6-4677-946a-ded6257fe4d7"},{"objectId":"66e2e08bfdbe83163ab136ee","name":"Ahmed","lastName":"Sabt","documentHash":"9c404b65-5f7b-4d91-a081-bbcfc6c010bd"},{"objectId":"66e2e08bfdbe83163ab136ed","name":"Rasha Z.","lastName":"Batran","documentHash":"009e3f7b-14ff-4317-924d-1e09b8832c6d"},{"objectId":"5e709229878c28a047390e3e","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Dziadek","uuid":"BE506B6FEF9F09CD0BE65E7F9C32A7B11C89A3F9C02BDC99B8AB6B2055112D48AC75C443975729BB2398B3A2EB6EC7210FF8C57C5231A979DE8B6AD84230B2D2","orcidId":"0000-0003-1427-884X","documentHash":"b50df883-d955-45e2-bc1b-2ad9d404bd73"}],"objectId":"66e2e08bfdbe83163ab136eb","doi":"10.1039/d4ra02746a","publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2024/RA/D4RA02746A","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Design, synthesis and computational studies of new azaheterocyclic coumarin derivatives as anti-<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> agents targeting enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of coumarin derivatives as antitubercular agents targeting the enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA) enzyme.

The system can be readily adapted to target other biological components.image"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b7878c28a04739b4f3","5e709409878c28a0473b5492","5e7093d2878c28a0473b1618","5e7092b7878c28a04739b42e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","uid":"bRRT1dnyPJtioT7xTLQBnOQ","uuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","name":"Centrum Badań Molekularnych i Makromolekularnych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709337878c28a0473a50a7","5e709466878c28a0473bc492"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","parentUuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","rootUuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"30","issue":"14","pagesFromTo":"Article number: e202303531","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b7878c28a04739b4f3","5e709466878c28a0473bc492","5e709409878c28a0473b5492","5e7093d2878c28a0473b1618","5e709337878c28a0473a50a7","664218864097075557705afd","5e7092b7878c28a04739b42e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775f1","mniswId":"3513","title":"Chemistry-A European Journal","doi":"10.1002/chem.","issn":"0947-6539","eissn":"1521-3765","websiteLink":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1521-3765","documentHash":"56606be2-854e-47eb-92eb-2de5acecfa73"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"664218864097075557705afa","year":"2024","volume":"30","number":"14","documentHash":"76d3324c-5046-40d3-97bb-3c14ae2ed856"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["therapeutic nucleic acidsantisense oligonucleotidesEGFR and c-MYC oncogenesanti-cancer therapyboron clusternanoparticles"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060642785"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63b2d241409707109b1b218c","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Wawdysz","documentHash":"44a3af33-39c0-4129-9b7c-1ad86c5ce9fd"},{"objectId":"63b2d241409707109b1b218a","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Mochol-Grzelak","documentHash":"62992530-35cd-4acf-b9fc-68cfc410f6f3"},{"objectId":"63b2d241409707109b1b2189","name":"Adam","lastName":"Karaszewski","documentHash":"b704cba4-d751-490f-b297-8e710a82b1a1"},{"objectId":"60c2fce09543c7233654344d","name":"Michał","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"92D988A2A9CCF07E98B7660B1AFB395A492F2E05B6159E7B400DAE78137287DFD1429D7D1C96CB6028D2D4A8FC27E40B124234CC3376A5AC43E9BAD25BF22CC2","documentHash":"1a5c26ea-6a05-4a35-aabf-7687e83176e9"},{"objectId":"5f1655427523405869ccc2e9","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Miebs","uuid":"5350DEC007E81AACE1B889E6355788CF21C906C427340AA0B3CA886FAF07E8257FAA3F3CA88CD439EDD8C1C354904EB66C2A4004ABDB76D28C1E011A805AF3F4","orcidId":"0000-0002-0628-6949","documentHash":"a43b35f5-cbc7-4235-abcd-f21bd0e3698f"},{"objectId":"5e7094a0878c28a0473c0a85","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Bachorz","uuid":"99D38A7B84E67C8E97FB6073557E6D453AE4F5766853196A832BC1785B6BAA07555D4AD557D884FC674E08992122FD741FE9136200115552FF87EFDF1EDE0547","documentHash":"ea5271c3-da55-429d-835b-323cdc38a635"}],"objectId":"63b2d241409707109b1b2187","doi":"10.1142/s0129065722500563","publicUri":"https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/reader/10.1142/S0129065722500563","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Predicting a time-dependent quantity using Recursive Generative Query Network","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We propose here a novel neural architecture dedicated to the prediction of time series. It can be considered as an adaptation of the idea of (GQN) to the data which is of a sequence nature. The new approach, dubbed here as the (RGQN), allows for efficient prediction of time series. The predictor information (i.e. the independent variable) is one or more of the other time series which are in some relationship with the predicted sequence. Each time series is accompanied by additional meta-information reflecting its selected properties. This meta-information, together with the standard dynamic component, is provided simultaneously in (RNN). During the inference phase, meta-information becomes a query reflecting the expected properties of the predicted time series. The proposed idea is illustrated with use cases of strong practical relevance. In particular, we discuss the example of an industrial pipeline that transports liquid media. The trained RGQN model is applied to predict pressure signals, assuming that the training was carried out during routine operational conditions. The subsequent comparison of the prediction with the actual data gathered under extraordinary circumstances, e.g. during the leakage, leads to a specific residual distribution of the prediction. This information can be applied directly within the data-driven Leak Detection and Location framework. The RGQN approach can be applied not only to pressure time series but also in many other use cases where the quantity of sequence nature is accompanied by a meta-descriptor."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f1655427523405869ccc2e9","60c2fce09543c7233654344d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a0878c28a0473c0a85"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"32","issue":"11","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63b2d241409707109b1b2189","63b2d241409707109b1b218a","60c2fce09543c7233654344d","5f1655427523405869ccc2e9","63b2d241409707109b1b218c","5e7094a0878c28a0473c0a85"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478268","mniswId":"9180","title":"International Journal of Neural Systems","issn":"0129-0657","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"54eeb67d-15e9-4cf4-b93a-89bdc51875e5"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63b2d241409707109b1b2188","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"32","number":"11","documentHash":"eda9fc9d-fa77-4ed4-b28f-9d0a80e6fbd3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["time-series","neural networks","generative model"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654782835"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be927","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Studzian","uuid":"AE122F80A940BB4A49514164BFDFF85D7B9FE6CA603564C953939AF297CA2A67E6FC44A311D2F93B6C9F548C97A544A667C5D48BF375E9A4F3BBC917CBE6EE61","orcidId":"0000-0002-1881-3072","documentHash":"e54e6b07-2a3e-439f-8b24-2c7a2542fe4f"},{"objectId":"5e709378878c28a0473aa8c3","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Klajnert-Maculewicz","uuid":"DC099D748432679FB203E30F8C8C4CD1BC1A86C0A5E9A8F90C1EB65B514453F55D691625FF288436EEF38CD2CAB53245BCCD4E25B4C0D54E8C494242BF0607DD","orcidId":"0000-0003-3459-8947","documentHash":"20f4daac-9ed5-470e-ad77-ddb33ac54dc2"},{"objectId":"5e709352878c28a0473a72ef","name":"Monika","lastName":"Marcinkowska","uuid":"1D240A7B55FF1C326320606D6CCC0B516987FD5A7A2A8F33141D34CF9C5DB10C339E8B31B2118177F03FAFC52AAC5EB14F33601BF5ADDBEB57C94E32538E4159","orcidId":"0000-0003-2189-5221","documentHash":"1f77618d-e2b0-453e-a11b-f1c8f81f1830"},{"objectId":"5e709326878c28a0473a3b52","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Karwaciak","uuid":"07DCCCF633946D0D382FA333B03FA29532E8FAABCE8B31805A354A7069B3E181D2C04FE9EBA0FE5499A48BB2418D45D0FD64AAD6E3B93DCBE6C29AEA62DC47E9","documentHash":"0c2307a8-e439-4e83-97a9-8842d78c5e45"},{"objectId":"5e70930c878c28a0473a1c52","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Pułaski","uuid":"DC4633B01E4F29C9EDA5398DAA8176055D4DB04E46CDCC6A07D019A88001E193B766A0A5AEC562075FCD60EFF4C2BE35FD4A3E695D05263C4433E3BECAF93FAA","orcidId":"0000-0001-8063-801X","documentHash":"c3c2928c-6b39-4a1e-9c9c-e79204ace119"},{"objectId":"5e7092ba878c28a04739b94b","name":"Michał","lastName":"Gorzkiewicz","uuid":"3B1D63B74CF61679BF523285F679B0F9DDC80EB1651ED8672998E972D2C5B15066938822E0BC649EF31A441B98FDC310540CFBE3505632010DD57FD9D9969EF6","orcidId":"0000-0001-9258-3626","documentHash":"5e3bd1ab-5c9b-4263-814e-c1ce3c8ac309"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64c7ce0640970733d13e7f28","doi":"10.2147/ijn.s390763","publicUri":"https://www.dovepress.com/mesalazinepamam-nanoparticles-for-transporter-independent-intracellula-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-IJN","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Mesalazine–PAMAM Nanoparticles for Transporter-Independent Intracellular Drug Delivery: Cellular Uptake and Anti-Inflammatory Activity","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Mesalazine is one of the main drugs used to treat inflammatory bowel diseases. However, its applicability is limited by\r\nits rapid inactivation and removal from the organism, as well as the need for its membrane transporter-dependent cellular uptake to\r\nexert therapeutic effect. The present study involved the development of an innovative nanocarrier, based on poly(amidoamine)\r\n(PAMAM) dendrimer of the 4th generation, to obtain higher concentrations of the drug in the intestinal epithelial cells, thus increasing\r\nits anti-inflammatory potential. The work involved synthesis and in vitro characterization of covalent PAMAM-mesalazine conjugate\r\nwith succinic linker.\r\nResults: PAMAM-mesalazine conjugate was synthesized and characterized by 1\r\nH NMR, 13 C NMR, FTIR and MALDI-TOF MS. This\r\nallowed to confirm the purity of the obtained compound and intermediates. Based on the analyses, it was found that ~45 drug\r\nmolecules were successfully attached to one molecule of PAMAM dendrimer. The conjugate was then characterized in terms of\r\nhydrodynamic diameter, zeta potential, spectral properties, drug release from the carrier, as well as cellular uptake and cytotoxicity in\r\ntwo in vitro models of gastrointestinal epithelium (CaCo-2 and HT-29 human cell lines). Analyzing cellular parameters related to the\r\nspecific mechanism of action of mesalazine (inhibition of NF-κB signaling, decrease in interleukin and prostaglandin synthesis, and\r\nROS scavenging), we showed that such a dendrimer-based carrier may enhance cellular uptake of the drug, which translated into its\r\nimproved anti-inflammatory efficacy.\r\nConclusion: The use of PAMAM macromolecule as a carrier for mesalazine increases the bioavailability of the drug, ensuring\r\nenhanced cellular uptake and bypassing the need to utilize mesalazine-specific membrane transporters. All these characteristics\r\ntranslate into an improved anti-inflammatory activity of mesalazine in vitro. In conjunction with appropriately designed in vivo\r\nstudies, such a compound may prove to be a promising alternative to the therapeutics currently used in inflammatory bowel diseases"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","uid":"bcB7lhI2W2VhoN2PnIDHK1w","uuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","name":"Instytut Biologii Medycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709326878c28a0473a3b52"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","parentUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0b","rootUuid":"dae57100-90d0-49b9-9340-339ce9141f2b","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"2109-2126","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ba878c28a04739b94b","5e709352878c28a0473a72ef","5e70947f878c28a0473be927","5e709326878c28a0473a3b52","5e70930c878c28a0473a1c52","5e709378878c28a0473aa8c3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478264","mniswId":"9171","title":"International journal of nanomedicine","issn":"1176-9114","eissn":"1178-2013","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"352cd6f0-2c5a-498e-90a5-acadd629a8bb"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["PAMAM dendrimer","mesalazine","inflammatory bowel disease","drug delivery"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654790338"}]
