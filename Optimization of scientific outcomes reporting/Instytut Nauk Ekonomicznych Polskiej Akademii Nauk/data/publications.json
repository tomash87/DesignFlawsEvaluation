In those years, there were two very different social regimes. The first was the Hungarian People’s Republic (1949–1989), which was a communist regime with an avowed aim of favouring the working class. The second is the modern liberal democracy (1989–2017), which is a free-market economy. We find five surprising things. First, social mobility rates were low for both upperand lower-class families during 1949–2017, with an underlying intergenerational status correlation of 0.6–0.8. Second, social mobility rates under communism were the same as in the subsequent capitalist regime. Third, the Romani minority throughout both periods showed even lower social mobility rates. Fourth, the descendants of the eighteenth-century noble class in Hungary were still significantly privileged in 1949 and later. And fifth, although social mobility rates did not change measurably during the transition, the composition of the political elite changed rapidly and sharply."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938d878c28a0473ac83d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"35","pagesFromTo":"1551–1588","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70938d878c28a0473ac83d","6176c63f2467f004c3897e31","6176c63f2467f004c3897e32","6176c63f2467f004c3897e33"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789da","mniswId":"12362","title":"JOURNAL OF POPULATION ECONOMICS","issn":"0933-1433","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"4f2b1e88-5d27-4ed2-8969-013e2f9755e3"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6388bc5d4097074ca320eaf5","year":"2022","volume":"35","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"8c3bbf5e-514c-4b2b-8ca2-5fcef1923735"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Social mobility","Status inheritance","Institutions","Transition"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747056491114"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6176c3d62467f004c389561d","name":"Muhammad Farooq","lastName":"Ahmad","orcidId":"0000-0002-2891-7668","documentHash":"b1171e92-1df6-450c-9c04-aa95d9116953"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739707e","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Pisany","uuid":"3E9DB6B8EE9D2168337F8A836B93F2777486CA65AF7E57315B6382DACC4FC88FF72BADE703EFA19EA89836FEEA646F8DF7EB7B228B681499EC14225D6DCA40B1","orcidId":"0000-0001-9665-8840","documentHash":"6e9dfaf4-5469-4f72-b7fb-3926e0360f10"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047394f83","name":"Oskar","lastName":"Kowalewski","uuid":"0C8DE99DE7F07AF99C6965A3ECBB7F048B43B0ACF64E58BC2CDC4BA741E24F8D9C0FF011FBBACEC180BA387EB3AEDBA12BC012252A82CE6862BF1F1A85B91DD7","orcidId":"0000-0001-5520-3559","documentHash":"913e42cd-f030-4b44-ad91-a2d1c7e1e7c0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER","releaseDateMonth":"AUGUST","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"6176c3d62467f004c389561b","doi":"10.1080/10438599.2021.1982712","publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/10438599.2021.1982712?needAccess=true","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"What determines initial coin offering success: a cross-country study","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study investigates the determinants of the presence and success of initial coin offering (ICO) campaigns using data on 503 ICOs from 60 countries launched between 2015 and 2018.

The results show that while insider retention and resource-related signals, such as the number of team members and advisors, contribute positively to the ICO’s funding success and post-ICO activity, presale offers and bonuses contributed negatively. Additionally, the results highlight that a country’s financial system development and ICO-related legal friendliness boost the market.

This study explores the transmissions channels through which regional disparities may affect the country's growth. A system or recursive equation by means of the control function approach (CFA) was applied to empirically assess the weight of these mechanisms. The level of regional disparities within the EU countries at nomenclature of territotial units for statistics-2 level was calculated applying economic polarization measures. Empirical results, based on panel data analysis, showed that overall regional disparities affect negatively growth.

Traditionally, local banks have had an advantage in relationship lending (based on soft credit information), whereas foreign banks are considered to base on hard credit information. With the advent of financial technology (or “fintech”) companies (or “fintechs”) and giant technology (or “bigtech”) companies (or “bigtechs”) providing alternative credit, the conditions of competition in the credit market have changed. In this empirical study, we shed light on the nature of the information advantages fintech and bigtech companies have compared to banks and how alternative lenders use them. We analyze competition in the consumer lending segment between banks and fintechs as well as bigtechs providing alternative lending. We used a database combining bank-level characteristics and country-level proxies for 72 countries from 2013 to 2018. We find that in developed markets, the relationships between fintech and bigtech credit providers and banks are similar and competitive in nature. However, banks' consumer lending grows simultaneously with fintech credit market development in emerging economies, but decreases in the aftermath of the emergence of bigtech credit. Fintech credit seems to penetrate market segments not serviced by banks; thus, it plays a complementary role, however only in emerging economies. Bigtech companies compete even more with banks and push some banking offers out of the market, both in emerging and developed economies. Furthermore, we show that domestic and privately-owned banks are more negatively affected by competition from technology-based lending, particularly bigtech, than foreign banks. Thus, bigtech lending may be treated as a serious competition for banks' relationship lending based on soft credit information processing, traditionally provisioned by local banks."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a04739707e","5e709265878c28a047394f83"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"81","pagesFromTo":"102116","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709265878c28a047394f83","5e709284878c28a04739707e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478326","mniswId":"9536","title":"International Review of Financial Analysis","issn":"1057-5219","eissn":"1873-8079","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"1d8967d0-d6d0-4e30-9f18-740e00f577f3"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63737a914097070c79cd9230","year":"2022","volume":"81","documentHash":"9ca0ddd1-6f97-4849-9cfe-445508948d67"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Alternative credit","Fintech","Bigtech","Financial inclusion","Local banks","Competition","Relationship lending","Soft credit information"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058297732"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739707e","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Pisany","uuid":"3E9DB6B8EE9D2168337F8A836B93F2777486CA65AF7E57315B6382DACC4FC88FF72BADE703EFA19EA89836FEEA646F8DF7EB7B228B681499EC14225D6DCA40B1","orcidId":"0000-0001-9665-8840","documentHash":"6e9dfaf4-5469-4f72-b7fb-3926e0360f10"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047394f83","name":"Oskar","lastName":"Kowalewski","uuid":"0C8DE99DE7F07AF99C6965A3ECBB7F048B43B0ACF64E58BC2CDC4BA741E24F8D9C0FF011FBBACEC180BA387EB3AEDBA12BC012252A82CE6862BF1F1A85B91DD7","orcidId":"0000-0001-5520-3559","documentHash":"913e42cd-f030-4b44-ad91-a2d1c7e1e7c0"}],"objectId":"63739cf74097070c79d6b5d5","publicUri":"https://journals.co.za/doi/abs/10.10520/ejc-rdfin_v12_n1_a4","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Home–Host Distance in Governance Quality, Foreign Banks’ Lending, and Emerging Host Markets’ Resilience","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, we investigate how governance quality determines the lending behavior of foreign-owned banks in emerging host markets.

This article employs the concept of the contact zone both as a theory describing processes of developing energy prosumerism on a local level, and as a research method which enables one to uncover phenomena that are critical to attaining climate objectives. The research field was the Warmia and Mazury Province in Poland, which is the region with the lowest socio-economic potential both in Poland and in the European Union. The analyzed contact zone was divided into two parts: the human administrative legal contact zone and the more-than-human energy contact zone. To describe the relationships occurring in these subzones, the authors used empirical data originating from a survey addressed to citizens living in the above province. The aim was to explore the respondents’ knowledge about current prosumption processes and the opportunities to implement them in the local government sector. Multiple correspondence analysis was used to analyze the data. The main findings were the low knowledge of citizens about prosumption, which was represented by a large number of the prosumption principles not indicated by the respondents, and—on the other hand—the evidence that local communities expect the implementation of digital prosumption, which they know from the market sector, in public administration. It was also demonstrated that the absence of citizens’ involvement in the energy transition is a consequence of two historic colonialisms, German and Russian, which had a huge influence on the emergence of an autocratic management style in the analyzed region. Comparison of the analyzed contact zones with two reference zones showed that grassroots movements in the province are initiated mainly by external factors of a nationwide character. In the Warmia and Mazury contact zones, civic initiatives are in the early stage of development, although they display all features of developed zones, such as autoethnographic gestures, transculturation, struggle, violence, and anti-conquest."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709385878c28a0473abd05"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70921b878c28a04738ffcb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"3560","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70921b878c28a04738ffcb","5e709385878c28a0473abd05"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a4acff2f-2586-4af5-bfb4-ce7217ec1949"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64365b1f4097075c9912bb33","year":"2023","volume":"16","number":"8","documentHash":"6d0c5fb3-7df2-425f-9271-b19127ea63c1"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["digitalization","energy transition","local government sector","virtuous cycle of digitalization","decentralization and electrification","more-than-human energy contact zone","human administrative legal contact zone","autoethnographic texts","transculturation","multiple correspondence analysis","principles of prosumption"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058611921"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"648fed5640970747b95b1911","name":"Jan","lastName":"Grzegorek","documentHash":"46b896e5-c793-487f-a742-aa31efcfe825"},{"objectId":"6376fc3a752340568b004f2c","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Celiński","uuid":"FDB256E573D24A88CF43111A735A8E2BF9F8A47693833FA9BE9B0800CE57CC30CF589D2BA28572235D8C33425F73F4C0D76634AB168FED73FA5D75E0E8ABFFEF","documentHash":"980b90f7-55cf-48e4-89df-dab6e95d8bec"},{"objectId":"5e7094c0878c28a0473c32a2","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Jaruga","uuid":"77FAA94B74EDB8F7C1E9FB98595DC79DC6B357F8ADB86A74314CCA890208CC5859233F09266F0F58E5EAD8CA6C6A629958AFB48E201A013F3B41A554E8AA558D","orcidId":"0000-0001-7700-6249","documentHash":"b2c4effd-07db-47bb-b618-745b3ccc6544"},{"objectId":"5e7093a8878c28a0473ae86e","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Cetera","uuid":"663D4A002F95CBC91C0DA4CB03A3761564DE28B8F020BD99A2040D8A689FBD30C4FE28CF6CC9C616D4E832EAD43DCA3C1B5D71EA695B22BB9C027CDFC932F7BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-5409-4570","documentHash":"092b8ba1-d513-4840-b829-c3a9203bfcba"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a047397a23","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Żołnierski","uuid":"FA356C1458063C2F00E822AA164B8C1AB5CB4DB29321860955F2352ECAAE07DCBBD29BB35CDF7EA69ECE03C06946B4D83707C22F284D6707DC86D594F2390A44","orcidId":"0000-0002-4930-0069","documentHash":"9c5b7695-5f27-4252-83cc-a406f352d320"}],"objectId":"648fed5640970747b95b190e","doi":"10.1007/s43937-023-00016-2","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s43937-023-00016-2.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Information refining and big data analysis on the crisis on the fossil fuel market to identify of Russia’s hostile narratives towards European Union countries","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Fossil fuels helped Russian president Putin build military power of Russia and attack Ukraine.

These considerations have their starting point in transformations of the energy sector in prosumer capitalism, which has dramatically changed the picture of the global economy in recent years. Subsequently, a futuristic approach is applied to determine the role and importance of energy from renewable sources for further human development. The main objective of the paper is to explain the current situation of the energy sector in prosumer capitalism and to extrapolate these relationships for the future, considering the need to enter the path of sustainable development to eliminate the global warming processes and climate changes. A review of the existing scientific literature was applied as the research method. The historical wave concept, proposed by Toffler, was found to be highly useful because of its high potential in futurology, where it enables one to study megatrends. The Fourth Wave was linked to prosumer capitalism, and it provided the base for defining the next ones: the Fifth Wave of Computing (ecosocialism) and the Sixth Wave in the form of technological and energy communism (solar communism). It also turned out that the key to solving mankind’s energy problems lies in the global mean entropy budget. The literature review shows that founding the global energy system on solar radiation is the only known method for eliminating the anthropogenic greenhouse effect, which is the source of global warming and, consequently, of climate change. Therefore, the second law of thermodynamics provides a physical, economic, and logical justification for introducing a new and ultimate management form—solar communism—by 2050."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70921b878c28a04738ffcb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"23","pagesFromTo":"9120","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70921b878c28a04738ffcb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"637f4f38409707772c20edd2","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"23","documentHash":"30c26638-cece-4599-b2be-12653eead8c8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["energy transition","prosumer capitalism","synergistically double exploitation","futurology","dot-communism","revised diagram of the Toffler’s civilization revolutions","second law of thermodynamics","global mean entropy budget","solar energy","solar communism"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059034827"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70921b878c28a04738ffcb","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Jakimowicz","uuid":"429E2A92239541EEF4616C09282B3B80B4651D819746787095A6EE7396FB3CD1E8E3314436FD23FD98F1F5A4D78446639E0AAAE35206C8E015FBA8ADC6953B24","orcidId":"0000-0003-2522-082X","documentHash":"ddbbb3ca-ff2d-4716-8eaf-ec6ef81d59bb"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"655f710f409707331074eb0a","doi":"10.3390/en15239109","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/23/9109/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The Energy Transition as a Super Wicked Problem: The Energy Sector in the Era of Prosumer Capitalism","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate that the energy transition as part of prosumer capitalism is a socio-economic process whose complexity increases over time, which makes it an example of a super wicked problem. It comprises many new phenomena emerging spontaneously, and often unpredictably, in the energy markets. The main contemporary challenge involves such an energy sector transformation which will prevent climate change and will ensure the sustainable development of the global economy. However, this requires solving a large number of sub-problems in areas such as legislation, energy distribution, democracy, and cybersecurity. Therefore, this is a multidisciplinary issue. Moreover, the situation is complicated by the frequently omitted fact that energy transition is not part of the standard capitalism model, extensively described in handbooks and scientific literature, but it is conducted as part of a new economic system—prosumer capitalism, which has not been properly explored yet. However, a solution to this super wicked problem has to be found soon, as the energy system may be threatened with complexity catastrophe, which denotes exceeding the upper complexity limit associated with the breakdown of its adaptability. Therefore, developing effective techniques for alleviating the complexity catastrophe, including redefining the change management and complexity management methods to the global scale, becomes the top priority among the tasks faced by science."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70921b878c28a04738ffcb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"23","pagesFromTo":"9109","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70921b878c28a04738ffcb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"637f4f38409707772c20edd2","year":"2022","volume":"15","number":"23","documentHash":"30c26638-cece-4599-b2be-12653eead8c8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["energy transition","super wicked problem","prosumer capitalism","energy policy","climate change","renewable energy","energy prosumerism","complexity catastrophe","change management","complexity management"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059034951"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"655f7f5040970733107562cb","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Matyjas","documentHash":"abba6a32-eada-4a6c-923d-a21e205ca11a"},{"objectId":"655f7f5040970733107562ca","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Sowula","documentHash":"57b7da6f-9a10-4a01-9450-eda1dbfabeb6"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a047397a23","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Żołnierski","uuid":"FA356C1458063C2F00E822AA164B8C1AB5CB4DB29321860955F2352ECAAE07DCBBD29BB35CDF7EA69ECE03C06946B4D83707C22F284D6707DC86D594F2390A44","orcidId":"0000-0002-4930-0069","documentHash":"9c5b7695-5f27-4252-83cc-a406f352d320"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_SA","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"FEBRUARY","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"655f7f5040970733107562c9","doi":"10.26399/meip.1(72).2022.03/a.zolnierski/g.sowula/z.matyjas","publicUri":"https://bibliotekanauki.pl/articles/2204917","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Social capital of an innovative research organisation (case study)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the article is to analyse the importance of social capital as a key factor in transforming information resources into knowledge and the process of commercialization. The study is based on the case study method used to present the Institute of Electronic Materials Technology.\nThe authors analyse the role of social capital in creating innovation in the organization’s environment. Social capital plays a significant role in the context of the necessary information resources, its typology, where informal information turns out to be important in creating innovation.\nThe credibility of information sources is determined primarily by the knowledge of the subject and the reliability and intentions shown by the information source. Innovative enterprises, but also research institutes (ITME type), make advanced use of all types of information sources regardless of the type of innovations they introduce. Scientific institutions with low levels of social capital, with sporadic and difficult interactions with external partners, cease to understand the needs of the market and may misdirect scientific development, therefore making poor decisions related to the management of other components of their capital resources."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928b878c28a047397a23"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","issue":"1(72)","pagesFromTo":"58-76","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928b878c28a047397a23","655f7f5040970733107562ca","655f7f5040970733107562cb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9ac1dad204581b62ebb8a","mniswId":"201352","title":"Myśl Ekonomiczna i Polityczna","issn":"2081-5913","eissn":"2545-0964","metadataSource":"MINISTRY","documentHash":"1c4220b5-eed5-4628-b55f-a3868b04918e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"639ae6bb4097074c71d31fa2","year":"2022","volume":"72","number":"1","documentHash":"8aab3186-83f3-4d32-b132-a2a9b2c68175"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["social capital","innovation","information management","ITME"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059035159"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"655f67404097073310747705","name":"Piotr Michal","lastName":"Mazur","documentHash":"213f1b9f-a05f-4e92-a5ad-77840c290fc8"},{"objectId":"655f67404097073310747704","name":"Petra","lastName":"Pawlowski","documentHash":"7e81091e-9006-425f-8904-88a314c7a839"},{"objectId":"5e7094b6878c28a0473c22d8","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Borsuk","uuid":"54E5E4530CD93C4C62E1354A8D463B5E9C8B1682C4AD151CCB9405AA0920419534485B0BAC1DA149A82CDC83F4B103ED8B7349245A95D0BFA9F38C02939D4A07","orcidId":"0000-0002-7687-0948","documentHash":"643477fa-b68a-40d2-9644-786b0ec9d966"},{"objectId":"5e7093a0878c28a0473ae049","name":"ANETA","lastName":"HRYCKIEWICZ-GONTARCZYK","uuid":"36B7034310CB5F5225D49FD7840FA74B9783C1EED355B74822887942602611678225D90A5FED460F17597FD7AC8396D53DD28F010226DD73222BD3FDCB3B4B85","orcidId":"0000-0002-2546-1829","documentHash":"3df64e20-723b-4f89-a952-c1ce4ec678e3"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER","releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022},"objectId":"655f67404097073310747702","publicUri":"https://www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb22q5a1.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Sovereign Debt Holding and Bank Sensitivity toward Market Risk: An Alternative View of the Bank–Sovereign Problem","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Government bonds have always been a popular type of investment for banks. However, this trend has been further enhanced by the provisions of numerous banking regulations aimed at promoting investment in these securities. We empirically test the role of the fiscal incentive provided by Polish authorities aimed at encouraging banks to invest in sovereign debt. Additionally, we verify whether and how increased sovereign debt holding has exposed banks to fair-value accounting and test the consequent market risk related to such investment. To this end, we use unique quarterly balance sheet data on sovereign holdings at Polish banks for the period from 2008:Q1 to 2017:Q4, organized in line with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as \"available for sale,\" \"held for trading,\" and \"held to maturity.\" Our regression results evidence that fiscal incentives greatly increase banks' bias towards sovereign debt while reducing other investment. More importantly, our findings document that banks have enlarged the share of sovereign debt heavily exposed to market changes, primarily holding it under \"available for sale.\" Our stress tests document that a yield curve shock might leave less-capitalized banks with the shortage of regulatory capital. Our findings seem particularly important today, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the deteriorating fiscal situation of many countries may give a rise to a bond-yield shock and force banks to include potential losses in the regulatory capital."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094b6878c28a0473c22d8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"1-52","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093a0878c28a0473ae049","655f67404097073310747704","655f67404097073310747705","5e7094b6878c28a0473c22d8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478194","mniswId":"8695","title":"International Journal of Central Banking","issn":"1815-4654","eissn":"1815-7556","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"7ea961b3-a6a7-4ca6-b15b-ad3d81866bfc"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"655f67404097073310747703","year":"2022","volume":"18","number":"5","documentHash":"292b83c9-8730-4b29-9788-8fb31ef2832f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059121535"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"655f7c5d40970733107547cf","name":"Bianka","lastName":"Godlewska-Dzioboń","documentHash":"3bc9e706-007c-4218-863a-706f9a13c291"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ace1","name":"Anna","lastName":"Ujwary-Gil","uuid":"6160632B89AF1998A06B5D3123B622F6EC531D295BB3D518FFD0F69DF978750F293CA0C9A461CB8A608FA0BFD1D07E27C6C05753D0D803B8DCD87864A213ED16","orcidId":"0000-0002-5114-7366","documentHash":"a8138fc8-ecd2-4dcc-9b92-519f0c654f51"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-08-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"655f7c5d40970733107547ce","doi":"10.34190/eckm.23.2.327","publicUri":"https://papers.academic-conferences.org/index.php/eckm/article/download/327/550","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Digital Innovation Hubs: Two-mode and Network-Based View on Technology and Services Provided","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Digital Innovation Hub (DIH) is a relatively young research area emerging on the basis of well-known ideas of technology parks or clusters. DIH is mainly focused on the digital transformation of enterprises and the development of a given region in the context of Industry 4.0 based on digital technology. The European Union is the initiator of the \"Digital Europe\" program for 2021-2027, aiming to promote the transfer of digital specialist knowledge to economic entities. The authors chose the DIHs operating in Poland as a starting point for network analysis in the context of the technology and services provided by Polish DIHs. This research aims to measure network cohesion, the centrality of individual DIH, and its specialty (exclusivity). It is based on secondary data collected using the Smart Specialization Platform based on which the two two-mode networks have been developed: actor x technology (ATij) and actor x services provided (ASPij). Measurements and visualization were made using two network programs (UCINET and ORA PRO). The following social network analysis techniques were used: 1) Two-mode cohesion: density, diameter, and fragmentation; 2) Two-mode centrality: degree and betweenness, and 3) Two-mode specialty (exclusivity). The results show two-mode networks consisting of the following nodes: 15 actors (A) or DIHs; 29 technologies (T), and 16 services provided (SP) forming a meta-network. They provide an insight into the network structure, most influential actors (DIHs), technologies, and services, as well as the specialty of each DIH in the European country, thus giving rise to further comparative research, using secondary data for the other 26 countries of the European Union."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii

Firms and individuals upload and store enormous amount of data. Most of the produced data is stored on private servers, but a considerable part is made publicly available across the 1.83 billion websites available online. These data can be accessed by researchers using web-scraping techniques.\nWeb scraping refers to the process of collecting data from web pages either manually or using automation tools or specialized software. Web scraping is possible and relatively simple thanks to the regular structure of the code used for websites designed to be displayed in web browsers. Websites built with HTML can be scraped using standard text-mining tools, either scripts in popular (statistical) programming languages such as Python, Stata, R, or stand-alone dedicated web-scraping tools. Some of those tools do not even require any prior programming skills.\n\nSince about 2010, with the omnipresence of social and economic activities on the Internet, web scraping has become increasingly more popular among academic researchers. In contrast to proprietary data, which might not be feasible due to substantial costs, web scraping can make interesting data sources accessible to everyone.\nThanks to web scraping, the data are now available in real time and with significantly more details than what has been traditionally offered by statistical offices or commercial data vendors. In fact, many statistical offices have started using web-scraped data, for example, for calculating price indices. Data collected through web scraping has been used in numerous economic and finance projects and can easily complement traditional data sources."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094bc878c28a0473c2d39"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094bc878c28a0473c2d39","6591ce714097072bfd972fc7","6591ce714097072bfd972fc8"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"6591cc7c4097072bfd97251f","title":"Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Economics and Finance","year":2022,"isbn":"9780190625979","url":"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/oxford-research-encyclopedias-economics-and-finance-9780190625979?cc=pl&lang=en&","translation":false,"documentHash":"3f338608-7a6b-4df8-9776-0e5960617ad5","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb75c","mniswId":"1800","name":"Oxford University Press","documentHash":"271d88b1-5188-4c4a-9b77-7569c26422a0"}},"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["web scraping","online prices","online vacancies","web-crawler","iMacros","big data"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059211344"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093c1878c28a0473b036e","name":"Błażej","lastName":"Socha","uuid":"2F1E88BEAB837CFB16DD0EC68820EDBD9C8E96465CA135ED128DCF5BA83296DE13CD43491ED172276FE5780B06BBEE34C345FD045E9CAEA6C2A5A74CD5F9B897","orcidId":"0000-0002-2422-6851","documentHash":"7fc16847-3149-4843-ad8a-d8ed0fddf0ab"},{"objectId":"5e70939e878c28a0473ade8a","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Majda-Kariozen","uuid":"62E57558C4A5CD5ACC0D5C8FB6795EAF06D10DAD6783A3C221C710759B5C51929CEAC2174808399BA84F77A946798B171AB4456D31C5449563B233E06E5106AD","orcidId":"0000-0002-6651-9767","documentHash":"2b344285-daef-4305-9066-d4663f1ab231"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047394f83","name":"Oskar","lastName":"Kowalewski","uuid":"0C8DE99DE7F07AF99C6965A3ECBB7F048B43B0ACF64E58BC2CDC4BA741E24F8D9C0FF011FBBACEC180BA387EB3AEDBA12BC012252A82CE6862BF1F1A85B91DD7","orcidId":"0000-0001-5520-3559","documentHash":"913e42cd-f030-4b44-ad91-a2d1c7e1e7c0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER","releaseDateMonth":"SEPTEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"65af8dd64097071977747470","doi":"10.1002/jsc.2547","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/jsc.2547","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Founder involvement in CEO turnover","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We study the role of a company founder in the internal governance of firms.

Instead, there is a mood of euphoric elation in these circles without even an attempt to reflect on why this kind of nuclear power is in a state of perennial crisis and lack of development prospects in Western countries. The purpose of this chapter is to consider from an economic perspective the potential role of nuclear power in decarbonising the Polish power sector. It needs to answer two questions: why not develop large-scale nuclear power and why small modular reactors (SMRs) can be a better alternative for decarbonisation of the Polish power sector. The primary research method used in the preparation of this chapter is a critical analysis and synthesis of the literature on the subject. A technological revolution will offer electricity customers increasingly better alternatives. Among them there is also technology of SMRs which seems to be much less risky option in terms of its compatibility with the direction of the power sector's evolution as well as cost of sectors’ decarbonisation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709269878c28a047395399"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"161-174","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709269878c28a047395399"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"654fc8f840970749a8d430d3","doi":"10.1108/9781837536542","title":"Modeling Economic Growth in Contemporary Poland","year":2024,"isbn":"978-1-83753-655-9","url":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/publication/doi/10.1108/9781837536542","translation":false,"documentHash":"16221eb6-b80d-464b-ae48-365b20ca846f","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb7dd","mniswId":"22700","name":"Emerald Publishing","documentHash":"c2aa91cc-4fa3-4329-a230-ba6e8e71085f"}},"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Large nuclear reactors","Small nuclear reactors","Economy of scale","Reactor's flexibility","death spiral","Modularisation and modularity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059452742"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396b34","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Bartosik","uuid":"92AC81A47E60D5214100071AB194614B231AA426D35ED744DA47E7850B57DCFAE7D9ECDAA47AF830BCFDAD3499FE32C59CB12EDA281288252BE25D276FAB2F6A","orcidId":"0000-0002-1488-7031","documentHash":"89c53f6e-cd2d-42fe-9338-efc9bf5c1394"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-14","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6630b3b14097071c38a65746","doi":"10.2478/ceej-2023-0002","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/ceej-2023-0002","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The Family 500+ benefit and changes in female employment in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper investigates the relationship between the implementation of the Family 500+ benefit, changes in female employment and female economic inactivity.

The new feature of the model is that the insurer and workers interact repeatedly. Repeated interactions make it possible to threaten workers with exclusion from future insurance benefits after a default on insurance premia. With exclusion, the insurer can offer not only insurance against unemployment risk itself but also against bad news about a future job loss. We discipline our model with estimates of the willingness to pay for unemployment insurance and the costs of adverse selection in the US. Our quantitative results illustrate that private unemployment insurance could be profitable for an exclusion length of one year. To stimulate the emergence of a private unemployment insurance market, policymakers can facilitate the creation of a registry that archives past defaults on insurance premia."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094e0878c28a0473c5c9a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"224","pagesFromTo":"104946","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094e0878c28a0473c5c9a","6630cb844097071c38a75725"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478a09","mniswId":"12447","title":"Journal of Public Economics","issn":"0047-2727","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"265fea75-d4f6-43f1-9a1f-347371bfc124"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6630cb844097071c38a75724","year":"2023","volume":"224","documentHash":"db777eaf-7eb0-4c4a-bec3-7f1a89c53650"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Advance information","Subjective expectations","Adverse selection","Unemployment insurance","Repeated interactions","Dynamic contracts"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059582256"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6630c9b34097071c38a74b28","name":"Jianping","lastName":"Qi","documentHash":"399ef06b-52cf-415e-be72-3870c35860d9"},{"objectId":"5e7094b6878c28a0473c22d8","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Borsuk","uuid":"54E5E4530CD93C4C62E1354A8D463B5E9C8B1682C4AD151CCB9405AA0920419534485B0BAC1DA149A82CDC83F4B103ED8B7349245A95D0BFA9F38C02939D4A07","orcidId":"0000-0002-7687-0948","documentHash":"643477fa-b68a-40d2-9644-786b0ec9d966"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047394f83","name":"Oskar","lastName":"Kowalewski","uuid":"0C8DE99DE7F07AF99C6965A3ECBB7F048B43B0ACF64E58BC2CDC4BA741E24F8D9C0FF011FBBACEC180BA387EB3AEDBA12BC012252A82CE6862BF1F1A85B91DD7","orcidId":"0000-0001-5520-3559","documentHash":"913e42cd-f030-4b44-ad91-a2d1c7e1e7c0"}],"objectId":"6630c9b34097071c38a74b26","doi":"10.1016/j.jbankfin.2023.107041","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0378426623002315?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The dark side of bank taxes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We investigate the impact of a new bank tax in Poland on bank lending behavior.

Furthermore, the characteristics of multinational banks play a significant role in determining their organizational decisions in a host country. Our results indicate that less profitable banks are less likely to open representative offices and are more likely to have branches. In contrast, multinational banks with high asset growth are more likely to operate a representative office abroad and less likely to open a subsidiary. These findings suggest that parent bank profitability and asset growth are important considerations when determining the optimal organizational mode of foreign expansion.

Fed’s disinflationary shocks increase Bitcoin price, while the ECB’s decrease, hence providing little support for it as an inflation hedge."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60123d0f9543c74f831550d7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"545-559","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60123d0f9543c74f831550d7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b991","mniswId":"1235","title":"Annals of Finance","issn":"1614-2446","eissn":"1614-2454","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"36719698-b5cf-406d-8981-1231b37bb994"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"664770264097071861ed20db","year":"2023","volume":"19","number":"4","documentHash":"f888b2d8-8d1a-42dd-b9e9-1eb1a1cd807a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Bitcoin","Time-varying parameter VAR","Monetary policy","Information effect"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059600400"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"602e54849543c7410626f106","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Matuszak","uuid":"5FC960F5EC49E0F5DE70203F4F713E950EADC389D1E092E8FD4FB1213988C6FEE641B9D71BB012017BE78B89AB8241178D3A444487A9774D0C73BCD3BD713602","orcidId":"0000-0003-4572-3168","documentHash":"c0ae7125-bee8-4751-a7f9-bcd445c06c70"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"MARCH","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"6647688c4097071861ece426","doi":"10.24425/cejeme.2023.144999","publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/Content/126297/mainFile.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"State-Owned Enterprises and Endogenous Growth","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article analyzes the growth impact of state ownership in enterprises by introducing state-owned enterprises (SOEs) into the endogenous, Romer-type economic growth model.

Among the criteria used to evaluate them, the most important are the amount of matter needed to sustain the technology itself and the environmental impact. Much emphasis is placed here on the fourth law of thermodynamics, which introduces the concept of material entropy. Zemansky–Georgescu-Roegen’s Law of Inevitable Dissipation of Useful Concentrated Matter states that, in the economic process, some matter is inevitably degraded and becomes unavailable matter. This has tremendous implications for humanity as a whole since the Earth is thermodynamically a closed system, meaning that it cannot exchange matter with space but is open to the flow of solar energy. This results in the need to conserve matter and natural resources. This law can be used as an important criterion for the selection of energy technology. Moreover, the flow–fund model, which was proposed by Georgescu-Roegen, was used to assess the viability of energy technologies. The final conclusion is that there is no Promethean technology of the third kind yet, but the closest to meeting this condition is solar technology. Technology based on nuclear fission has been rejected due to its adverse ecological effects, while fusion technology has proven to be less useful due to the matter criterion, the negative environmental impact, since radioactive waste only becomes safe for humans after 500 years, and the risks associated with nuclear proliferation. Solar technology can become Prometheus III only after all of humanity is involved with this project, which requires profound social changes, widespread demilitarization, and the development of organic agriculture. This implies the necessity of the emergence of a global solar society based on an economic system called solar communism."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70921b878c28a04738ffcb"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"3861","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70921b878c28a04738ffcb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6448bfab409707285d46345b","year":"2023","volume":"16","number":"9","documentHash":"a4bde67a-7918-41e6-b03b-70107c501f87"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["entropy of matter","fourth law of thermodynamics","flow–fund model","energetic dogma","viability of energy technology","solar energy","nuclear fission energy","controlled fusion energy","Promethean recipe","entropic debt"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059604469"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"664774754097071861ed4727","name":"Hinnerk","lastName":"Gnutzmann","documentHash":"188ef3b6-4e5c-4292-8fd6-6006176af46e"},{"objectId":"5e7094bc878c28a0473c2d39","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Śpiewanowski","uuid":"1CD48F2A174536E1F7CB86839E597D2334514405E0987381DBF3CB0AA43546411174CF0A4DC679D095F11270E8C78DC614442FA15445FCB894507E157246EF83","orcidId":"0000-0001-9812-4674","documentHash":"148b7104-8634-47a2-8333-6bfaec7c6d11"}],"objectId":"664774754097071861ed4725","doi":"10.1016/j.tranpol.2023.03.017","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0967070X23000768","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Can consumer rights improve on-time performance?

The effect is more pronounced in firms with better corporate governance, less analyst follow-up, and higher growth opportunities. These results support the signaling role of dividends rather than the role of agency theory in explaining dividend payouts when firms are associated with higher levels of political risk.

We address endogeneity concerns by running placebo tests and conducting instrumental variable analysis and we alleviate self-selection bias by performing propensity score matching technique."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709265878c28a047394f83"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"86","pagesFromTo":"102546","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["664762634097071861ec8d89","664762634097071861ec8d8a","664762634097071861ec8d8b","5e709265878c28a047394f83"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478326","mniswId":"9536","title":"International Review of Financial Analysis","issn":"1057-5219","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"9c1e4624-47ba-4fd2-9999-acb4bcbc05dd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"664762634097071861ec8d88","year":"2023","volume":"86","documentHash":"235212b8-30ae-4bd3-80ba-e41e3d720088"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059618311"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70923a878c28a047391f7f","name":"Anna","lastName":"Wziątek-Kubiak","uuid":"AEC2D92D859D82D4CF75D525B05F7349EEE06C57FFC4FD59B363CB341B0FAB1680B8BCEF47D6BB87E45283EDF6094682EC5B36B6FEF13FE2BFE99DA6AF93323F","orcidId":"0000-0003-0516-1391","documentHash":"edb40fa5-cf03-49ff-9762-8a74e264b210"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"6647722d4097071861ed340d","doi":"10.52335/ekon/174758","publicUri":"https://ekonomista.pte.pl/pdf-174758-98201","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Rozwój w ujęciu współczesnej ekonomii ewolucyjnej","otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"Development in modern evolutionary economics perspective"}],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Celem pracy jest identyfikacja głównych elementów i współzależności ewolucyjnego mechanizmu rozwoju stanowiących podstawę i ramy jego funkcjonowania i odróżniających go od neoklasycznych modeli wzrostu.

In the context of multinational banks (MNBs), we empirically investigate how the establishment of multiple affiliate forms affects the performance of their subsidiaries in the same host country. We also examine the factors influencing and effective entry mode choices. Based on the transaction cost theory, we hypothesize that MNBs can benefit foreign subsidiaries using entry modes based on cost minimization and value maximization. For the period 2005–2015, we test this hypothesis on a sample of 1026 subsidiaries established by 96 MNBs across 106 countries. The results show that the simultaneous operation of multiple affiliate forms positively influences their foreign subsidiary’s performance. The transaction costs determine MNBs’ entry choices. MNBs can enhance their subsidiary’s performance using entry modes considering institutional and cultural contexts and achieving cost and value targets in the host country. This study has policy implications in that it calls for collaboration between host and home countries to develop effective supervision and resolution regimes for MNBs operating multiple affiliate forms in host countries."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709265878c28a047394f83"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"65","pagesFromTo":"101926","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709265878c28a047394f83"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d0aa","mniswId":"17235","title":"Research in International Business and Finance","issn":"0275-5319","documentHash":"6ea7e03f-c937-4b3b-88dc-23b003f266c9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66475fcc4097071861ec760a","year":"2023","volume":"65","documentHash":"3198c1ea-eb99-4cb2-a03c-50644f3608fe"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059618634"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094c0878c28a0473c32a2","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Jaruga","uuid":"77FAA94B74EDB8F7C1E9FB98595DC79DC6B357F8ADB86A74314CCA890208CC5859233F09266F0F58E5EAD8CA6C6A629958AFB48E201A013F3B41A554E8AA558D","orcidId":"0000-0001-7700-6249","documentHash":"b2c4effd-07db-47bb-b618-745b3ccc6544"},{"objectId":"5e7093a8878c28a0473ae86e","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Cetera","uuid":"663D4A002F95CBC91C0DA4CB03A3761564DE28B8F020BD99A2040D8A689FBD30C4FE28CF6CC9C616D4E832EAD43DCA3C1B5D71EA695B22BB9C027CDFC932F7BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-5409-4570","documentHash":"092b8ba1-d513-4840-b829-c3a9203bfcba"},{"objectId":"5e709353878c28a0473a7566","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Gogołek","uuid":"3FAE47D618E1B850AD8D5F63C13EE16538C1F971D6804A2BEFFE630A7CE9FCA7F733845FBC4696FF4898D0E7A36B2B27E5C738BB5BFC0E6CFA373C0F1D638FCA","orcidId":"0000-0002-3073-3817","documentHash":"b931bb2a-0d77-4f49-a9bc-01b9f901d6c2"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a047397a23","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Żołnierski","uuid":"FA356C1458063C2F00E822AA164B8C1AB5CB4DB29321860955F2352ECAAE07DCBBD29BB35CDF7EA69ECE03C06946B4D83707C22F284D6707DC86D594F2390A44","orcidId":"0000-0002-4930-0069","documentHash":"9c5b7695-5f27-4252-83cc-a406f352d320"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-28","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY"},"objectId":"626ae5fb4097075861ce2f77","doi":"10.1186/s40537-022-00610-6","publicUri":"https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40537-022-00610-6","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Potential for the use of large unstructured data resources by public innovation support institutions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Efective programming of research and development (R&D) support, adjusted to the actual potential of benefciaries, requires the use of modern analytical tools. An efcient R&D support system requires up-to-date data on technological trends, ongoing (and planning) research, market needs and developing innovation. The most popular programming methods were based on the analysis of data with a 4 to 5-year time delay until recently. Having described the method of refning information from unstructured data, we explore how to make it possible not only to solve the issue of up-to-date data but to identify of the latest trends in R&D activities. The analytical tools we describe were already fully functional in 2018 and are constantly being improved. The article presents the potential of one tool that can be applied in public support institutions. Methods of identifying and diagnosing technology trends are presented within the case study of the electric cartechnology trend. The presented case study shows the efectiveness of the method we developed for identifying and diagnosing areas requiring support from public funds. Public institutions, including public institutions supporting R&D and innovation processes, can apply tools that allow an increase in the quality of public support programmes ofered, but also benefcial for the quality of strategic resources management within the institution itself. The comparison of the predictions made by the described tools with the classifcations made by experts, the former are more accurate and precise. Moreover, the results of the analyses performed by the presented model are not infuenced by distorting factors—fads, trends, political pressures, or processes with an unidentifed, non-substantive background. It should be emphasized that the accuracy of the whole model is 0.84. The described tools and methods are already directly applicable in many areas related to the support of R&D activity worldwide. The article presents a solution that efectively enables the management of more precise programmes supporting innovative activities used for the frst time in Poland. It is also one of the frst uses of these methods by public administration in the world. Our approach not only strengthens improved adjustment of the support ofered for R&D activity, but also makes it possible to apply and improve management methods in public institutions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet

Odzwierciedla ona postęp Ukrainy w integracji z UE w okresie poprzedzającym napaść Rosji na Ukrainę. Wykorzystując mierniki handlu zagranicznego, w tym międzynarodowej specjalizacji, pokazujemy specyfikę integracji Ukrainy z UE. Szacując poziom oraz zmiany udziałów rynkowych grup towarowych Ukrainy na unijnym rynku, wskazujemy na jej postęp w penetracji tego rynku względem krajów nieunijnych. Z jednej strony, w latach 2010–2021 miały miejsce radykalne zmiany struktury geograficznej handlu zagranicznego Ukrainy. Z drugiej, mniejszym zmianom struktury towarowej eksportu i międzynarodowej specjalizacji Ukrainy, towarzyszył wzrost udziałów rynkowych eksportu Ukrainy na unijnym rynku. Odzwierciedlał on poprawę zdolności ukraińskich towarów do konkurowania, a więc spełnienia przez Ukrainę jednego z kryteriów akcesji. Obliczony, na podstawie udziałów rynkowych, wzrost zdolności do konkurowania ukraińskich towarów potwierdzają szacunki wskaźników konkurencyjności eksportu: ujawnionych przewag komparatywnych Balassa oraz Lafaya. Poziom i zmiany trzech wskaźników konkurencyjności były zróżnicowane między grupami towarowymi. Wzrostowi udziałów rynkowych trzech grup towarów: surowców, tzw. pozostałych wyrobów przemysłowych (o średnim i niskim poziomie technologii) i żywności towarzyszył znaczący i rosnący poziom wskaźników konkurencyjności eksportu. Spadkowi udziałów rynkowych pozostałych grup towarów towarzyszył niski i zmniejszający się poziom wskaźników specjalizacji eksportu. Tym samym dotychczasowa integracja Ukrainy z UE oparta jest na ekspansji towarów konkurencyjnych i zwiększających konkurencyjność, w produkcji których Ukraina się specjalizuje."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The study aims to assess changes in the ability of Ukrainian goods to compete in the EU market. It reflects Ukraine’s progress towards EU integration in the run-up to Russia’s attack on Ukraine. Using foreign trade measures, including international specialisation, we show the specifics of Ukraine’s integration into the EU. By estimating the level and changes in the market shares of Ukraine’s commodity groups in the EU market, we show its progress in penetrating this market compared to non-EU countries. On the one hand, the geographical structure of Ukraine’s foreign  trade changed radically between 2010 and 2021. On the other hand, more minor changes in the commodity structure of exports and Ukraine’s international specialisation were accompanied by an increased market share of Ukraine’s exports in the EU market. It reflected an improvement in the ability of Ukrainian goods to compete, thus fulfilling one of Ukraine’s accession criteria. Calculated on the basis of market shares, the increase in the ability of Ukrainian goods to compete is confirmed by estimates of export competitiveness indicators: the Balassa index of revealed comparative advantages and the Lafay index. Levels and changes in the three indicators varied between commodity groups. The increase in the market shares of three commodity groups (raw materials, so-called “other manufactured goods” (medium and low technology) and food products) was accompanied by significant and increasing levels of export competitiveness indicators. The decline in the market shares of other commodity groups was accompanied by low and declining levels of export specialisation indicators. Thus, Ukraine’s integration into the EU has so far been based on the expansion of competitive and competitive-enhancing goods, in the production of which Ukraine specialises."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii

Employing a methodological arsenal that includes the GARCH process, enhanced by Dynamic Conditional Correlations (DCC), as well as the Markov Switching Model, this research assesses the propagation of mean returns and volatility across markets. The analysis uncovers significant linkages between monetary policy and stock market indices, underscoring the profound impact of monetary policy on cross-market performance transmission.

Digital Innovation Hub is also one of the S3 Smart Specialization Platform mapping tools and identifying areas of economic specialization of regions, aimed at facilitating interregional cooperation and creating partnerships between different actors across Europe. While the functions and goals of DIH are more and more often presented in national and regional development documents, little is known about the network structure of DIHs operating in a given country (region) and in the European Union. The study used structured and secondary Smart Specialization Platform data, which allows the creation of two-mode relationship networks and shows how interrelated the studied DIHs and digital technologies they use are. Based on the social network analysis and network metrics (centrality, density, and network projection) integrated into programs such as UCINET and ORA-PRO, the visualization and measurement of the network structure of two-mode networks (actor x technology ATij) as well as its projection into actor x actor (AAij) and technology x technology (TTij) networks were created.

By contrast, it was shown that board members’ independence, activity, and ownership are positively correlated with a firm’s fraudulent activities. Therefore, not all internal governance mechanisms are related to reduced corporate misconduct. Moreover, the study shows that some internal governance mechanisms, such as the share of female board members, mitigate certain types of corporate misconduct."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094bc878c28a0473c2d39","5e709265878c28a047394f83"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"92","pagesFromTo":"103109","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67ab671efdbe837dc7630f89","5e709265878c28a047394f83","5e7094bc878c28a0473c2d39"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478326","mniswId":"9536","title":"International Review of Financial Analysis","issn":"1057-5219","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"9c1e4624-47ba-4fd2-9999-acb4bcbc05dd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67ab671efdbe837dc7630f88","year":"2024","volume":"92","documentHash":"5eda18b7-bd33-48c4-9d7b-9ea8258a152a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Corporate misconduct","Internal governance mechanisms","Board of directors","Committees","Ownership"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060530373"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094b6878c28a0473c22d8","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Borsuk","uuid":"54E5E4530CD93C4C62E1354A8D463B5E9C8B1682C4AD151CCB9405AA0920419534485B0BAC1DA149A82CDC83F4B103ED8B7349245A95D0BFA9F38C02939D4A07","orcidId":"0000-0002-7687-0948","documentHash":"643477fa-b68a-40d2-9644-786b0ec9d966"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739707e","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Pisany","uuid":"3E9DB6B8EE9D2168337F8A836B93F2777486CA65AF7E57315B6382DACC4FC88FF72BADE703EFA19EA89836FEEA646F8DF7EB7B228B681499EC14225D6DCA40B1","orcidId":"0000-0001-9665-8840","documentHash":"6e9dfaf4-5469-4f72-b7fb-3926e0360f10"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047394f83","name":"Oskar","lastName":"Kowalewski","uuid":"0C8DE99DE7F07AF99C6965A3ECBB7F048B43B0ACF64E58BC2CDC4BA741E24F8D9C0FF011FBBACEC180BA387EB3AEDBA12BC012252A82CE6862BF1F1A85B91DD7","orcidId":"0000-0001-5520-3559","documentHash":"913e42cd-f030-4b44-ad91-a2d1c7e1e7c0"}],"objectId":"67ab53d3fdbe837dc761efe5","doi":"10.1016/j.intfin.2024.101947","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1042443124000131?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"State-owned banks and international shock transmission","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study re-examines the relationship between commercial bank ownership and lending growth from 1996–2019.

The research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in BPM education to determine if LLMs can supplement educators. The study involved 33 master’s degree students. Students’ works were manually evaluated and compared to LLM-generated responses. Results highlight the effectiveness and limitations of LLMs in supporting BPM education, revealing discrepancies between human and AI assessments. Our findings indicate that LLMs like ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4o can aid BPM education, but their performance and reliability differ from traditional human grading. The findings underscore LLMs’ potential to offer additional perspectives and reduce educators’ workload. However, LLMs should be supplementary tools, not replacements for traditional methods. This exploration contributes to understanding the transformative role of LLMs in reshaping educational methodologies. Future research should consider larger samples and a broader range of tasks to validate and extend these findings."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii

such as wages or earnings, to multiple outcomes e.g. wages jointly with leisure, health. This changes the view of overall gender differences. Drawing on the literature on welfare and inequality measurement, we motivate a concrete class of multivariate evaluation functions and show that this is the only class with some desired properties. We examine its sensitivity to parts of the distribution and to the valuations of attributes. We exploit decomposability by gender, single dimensions, interdependence and counterfactual effects, to guide policy decisions and evaluation. The joint gender gap in wages and leisure in the US is shown for the period 2005–2022. It differs from the wage gap due to several negative effects of leisure: a slowing down of the downward trend, larger differences at the bottom of the distribution than at the top, and an increase in within-gender inequality for women. The contribution of the leisure gap to the joint gap has increased over time."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f9878c28a0473b4409","5e709413878c28a0473b5d75"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"89","pagesFromTo":"102582","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093f9878c28a0473b4409","5e709413878c28a0473b5d75","67ab6296fdbe837dc76301df"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478c6a","mniswId":"13412","title":"LABOUR ECONOMICS","issn":"0927-5371","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"a5e36dc5-fe7e-4891-a5b4-5947c5905df3"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67ab6296fdbe837dc76301de","year":"2024","volume":"89","documentHash":"611471d4-9dcb-4b0f-bfb7-1ad436404edf"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060613550"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64f29e2a40e3ff0176646ee5","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Kapuściński","uuid":"203FB3D12C625ECFDBE52E4AAF1A5498C0BAE108D05E54C3CFECE0E301A7C34BCF91BD74B0B07942DCBAED0C4D781E7F73838A956AD6C490754B6E0B114DEE4B","orcidId":"0009-0008-7245-8463","documentHash":"20e387be-d5c6-466b-980a-db64329ed9d2"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"JUNE","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"67ab662dfdbe837dc7630e8d","publicUri":"https://bankikredyt.nbp.pl/content/2024/03/BIK_03_2024_02.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The short-term effects of changes in capital regulations in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study I attempt to address two questions.

Both of these factors had an impact on the labour market. This paper investigates changes in employment across groups of workers during the coronavirus pandemic in Poland and the effect of output on these changes. Firstly, it examines changes in employment growth rates across different groups of workers in 2020. Secondly, the paper analyses the impact of the coronavirus crisis on employment by comparing actual and predicted employment growth during the pandemic period (2020). Using Okun’s law, Ordinary Least Squares, and quarterly data, the elasticities of employment growth with respect to GDP growth in the pre-pandemic period (2003–2019) are calculated. These elasticities are then used to estimate projected employment growth during the pandemic. The results suggest that the total employment response to output change was relatively small, compared to the historical pattern. However, the response was unequal across groups of workers. The youngest workers, particularly women, and those with temporary employment contracts were most affected by the pandemic."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii

The evidence of decline is robust, corroborated with alternative instruments and industry-level analysis for the United States and the European Union."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938d878c28a0473ac83d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"42","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"683-716","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67ab5cb1fdbe837dc762a400","5e70938d878c28a0473ac83d","67ab5cb1fdbe837dc762a401"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454787f9","mniswId":"11607","title":"JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS","issn":"0734-306X","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"baf51813-1351-4b87-85bc-f419ad888f0f"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67ab5cb1fdbe837dc762a3ff","year":"2024","volume":"42","number":"3","documentHash":"84acf54e-2301-4814-9369-fbb4432b1771"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060614231"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67ac76f2fdbe8304dc00d620","name":"Maren","lastName":"Froemel","documentHash":"06a3836d-2943-4e2b-98db-a1d5f4ddf222"},{"objectId":"5e7094f9878c28a0473c843e","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Paczos","uuid":"DA7A820BE327355A8A73A797AD0431BD76B822090B75206F8881371592F6DD5B7652B6E1E151F37FD1E17FC058F359ADD68B72862ACA2402FB60F6BA16ABB09F","orcidId":"0000-0002-8129-0235","documentHash":"e760748f-3bd3-4074-9f0d-436412776c81"}],"objectId":"67ac76f2fdbe8304dc00d61e","doi":"10.1016/j.euroecorev.2024.104786","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0014292124001156?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Imperfect financial markets and the cyclicality of social spending","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper explores the link between default risk and fiscal procyclicality. We show that countries with higher sovereign risk have a more procyclical fiscal expenditure policy, which is driven mostly by transfers. We build a small open economy model with income inequality, social transfers, and default risk to rationalize this fact. Without default risk transfers are countercyclical, inequality is procyclical, and external debt is used to smooth distortionary taxation. With default risk, transfers account for most of fiscal adjustment because taxation becomes costly for the government. Transfers become procyclical and inequality worsens during times when risk premia are high. We confirm the predictions of the model in the data: in recessions in economies with default risk, transfers take the bigger burden relative to government consumption, whereas the opposite is true in economies with low default risk."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f9878c28a0473c843e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"167","pagesFromTo":"104786","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67ac76f2fdbe8304dc00d620","5e7094f9878c28a0473c843e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b7e","mniswId":"6108","title":"European Economic Review","issn":"0014-2921","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"4ba28e75-798f-43e8-9732-e76879bff285"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67ac76f2fdbe8304dc00d61f","year":"2024","volume":"167","documentHash":"fe822c78-7eb3-43f4-8470-8e1e54b4972e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fiscal policy","Default risk","Income inequality","Redistribution","Emerging markets"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060618365"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67aa2acbfdbe83111771511b","name":"Jan","lastName":"Toporowski","documentHash":"d1dcbc60-8cfd-4c3f-8bdf-dad68777f215"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b8e","name":"Epaminondas","lastName":"Osiatyński","uuid":"3482B1F0CB4D7FAEDF240A731FD68579FFD723CD591EAC512307A328A5A6B313AD8FA2A601A9ABE9F7B57011E0EF5B3FC0A23FD70D3C4C21B5136FA42B426ACC","documentHash":"dd054f2f-e836-4e74-b871-5aafdccb1ab9"}],"objectId":"67aa2acbfdbe83111771511a","publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/book/43743/chapter-abstract/370673293?redirectedFrom=fulltext","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Introduction: Kalecki’s Alternative to Keynes and White and its Consequences","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A short account of the origin the book is followed by a brief biography of Kalecki.

the link between past investment performance and choice of auto-investing tool. Our results suggest that investors who experience fewer defaults in the manual mode are more inclined to switch to automatic investment. Several factors account for this relationship, including investor inattention, decision speed, investment delegation, and experience. Regarding the latter, our results suggest that experienced investors are more likely to continue self-directed bidding, even if they have faced defaults in manual investments in the past. These investors may attribute their previous mistakes to their own actions rather than the limitations of the self-directed bids.

This way the central bank tries to address excessive household debt. While the merits of such policy have been analysed, I argue that there are two dimensions that have been overlooked but are crucial: (i) ability of borrowers to freely adjust outstanding debt (refinancing) and (ii) dominant mortgage type in the economy (fixed or adjustable rate). I answer the research question using a standard macroeconomic model extended for the presence of borrowers who consume all their disposable income (hand-to-mouth) net of payments on long-term mortgage. I find that the optimal simple policy rule significantly depends on the ability to adjust debt and on mortgage type.

A systematic literature review of 434 ANP studies for a 10-year period (2012–2021) within the Scopus database was conducted using the keyword “Analytic Network Process” in articles indexed in the following two categories: (1) Business, Management and Accounting, and (2) Economics, Econometrics and Finance. Further analysis using a citation-based graph and contingency analysis approaches was performed to identify usage trends. Our findings indicate that the most common ANP applications are with sustainable supply chain management and business evaluation frameworks. There is also a trend of applications engaging stakeholders in the decision-making process. Finally, it was found that the ANP is most commonly used as part of a multicriteria multi-method (a method followed by others) or integrated decision-making (hybridization of methods) approach rather than alone. The most common use (>80%) of the ANP is as part of a multi-method or integrated method with other tools such as DEMATEL, which suggests these approaches, in particular integrated ones (>50%), are becoming the preferred method of analysis to simplify the ANP process. From a practical point of view, it was found that the ANP is particularly utilized in sustainable projects to facilitate the participation of various stakeholders. This is the first focused review of the use of the ANP in the areas of economics, finance and management with an emphasis on its application as well as its contingent factors. Also, representative studies have been highlighted in each area. Traditional reviews have not delved deeply into the areas and contingent factors that this study explores."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b1878c28a04739ace1"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"237","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"121415","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67b4a56bfdbe835d67acca0a","67b4a56bfdbe835d67acca0b","5e7092b1878c28a04739ace1","67b4a56bfdbe835d67acca0c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477c8b","mniswId":"6463","title":"Expert Systems With Applications","issn":"0957-4174","eissn":"1873-6793","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/expert-systems-with-applications/#description","documentHash":"7187b0b6-7b52-4e50-9086-c3095ca9337e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67b4a56bfdbe835d67acca09","year":"2024","volume":"237","documentHash":"38565402-d304-4411-a259-5c0d11f6aa26"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Analytic network process","Economics","Finance","Management","Literature review","Contingency factors","Research directions"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060645618"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67b4a873fdbe835d67acdf82","name":"Alberto","lastName":"Blázquez","documentHash":"d3f5449b-4d77-4593-a9aa-bdc48b9984b6"},{"objectId":"67b4a873fdbe835d67acdf81","name":"María Teresa","lastName":"Fernández Fernández","documentHash":"331cd9fc-e527-41d8-ac02-2bb1499f9b7d"},{"objectId":"65ea863840e3ff25249c8af8","name":"Juan","lastName":"Santos","uuid":"8B92B54AA203128354EF85FAC49AA714CC2FE9E282930FD33E4A3AFE5AB71D1B91E605CC83161A420CDCCA361045201C60763A28C6E6E9AC8F3F3E936119910E","documentHash":"73b4054d-0f8e-4ab7-8fdc-546e8729681e"}],"objectId":"67b4a873fdbe835d67acdf7f","doi":"10.5209/aguc.97589","publicUri":"https://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/AGUC/article/download/97589/4564456570308","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Desploblación y periurbanización en la Alcarria","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"spa","content":"Se investigan los factores que influyen en el despoblamiento y la periurbanización en áreas rurales, seleccionando una región homogénea con 191 municipios.

The scale of this outflow was unprecedented in the CEE history and its structure was also different from previous emigration waves as it was more heavily biased towards young and educated people. I exploit this post-accession emigration wave to study the aggregate and redistributive effects of emigration. Using a small open economy general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents and endogenous migration choice calibrated to Polish data, I show that emigration lowers output per capita and improves the international investment position of the source country. Changes in population structure resulting from population outflows affect the wage distribution between high-skilled and low-skilled workers, thereby increasing economic inequalities. Moreover, I find that lifting labour mobility barriers is beneficial not only for people who move abroad, but also for skilled never-migrants"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d8878c28a0473b1c4d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"160","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"99 - 143","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093d8878c28a0473b1c4d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479567","mniswId":"17380","title":"REVIEW OF WORLD ECONOMICS","issn":"1610-2878","eissn":"1610-2886","documentHash":"a12b3204-98a4-4077-bcc5-11d9a9a931c3"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66507c7e4097072d8659e4ca","year":"2024","volume":"160","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"e3192085-5bd6-402d-97c2-4b7f7233b44e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Migration","Sending country","Heterogeneous agents","EU accession"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060658941"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab601ffdbe837dc762f661","name":"Florian","lastName":"Sniekers","documentHash":"803421d3-e4c8-46d3-b2ae-19f9d12ba54c"},{"objectId":"5e7094e0878c28a0473c5c9a","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Denderski","uuid":"5C31CE81025037EE118A632028EE75A1BB1991FEC0C695A16A818EB1C27FA586EF6210C76BDCB949DB695167C1A8FCB16F8FF942F17EA7D34394081B492CBABC","orcidId":"0000-0003-2410-5694","documentHash":"83ce162f-109e-48f2-8934-73128405b64d"}],"objectId":"67ab601ffdbe837dc762f65f","doi":"10.1093/ej/uead093","publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/ej/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/ej/uead093/56400270/uead093.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Declining Search Frictions, Unemployment and Self-Employment","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In most OECD countries, unemployment rates show no trend, which is puzzling if advancements in information and communication technologies decrease labour-market frictions. We show, both analytically and quantitatively, that accounting for the secular decline in self-employment rates solves the puzzle. While declining labour-market frictions can theoretically explain these trends, we provide contradictory causal evidence that the roll-out of broadband internet has increased self-employment and decreased unemployment rates. We reconcile these observations with a new model featuring frictions in both labour and goods markets. We explain falling self-employment and non-trending unemployment quantitatively by labour-market frictions declining relatively more than goods-market frictions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094e0878c28a0473c5c9a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"134","issue":"659","pagesFromTo":"1100-1145","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094e0878c28a0473c5c9a","67ab601ffdbe837dc762f661"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477a16","mniswId":"5368","title":"Economic Journal","issn":"0013-0133","eissn":"1468-0297","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"a3375e9e-7546-4a9b-8162-e9c21a28430e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67ab601ffdbe837dc762f660","year":"2024","volume":"666","number":"135","documentHash":"20ef816a-6055-4251-9b90-df9621b5f551"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Employment","Unemployment","Wages","Intergenerational Income Distribution","Aggregate Human Capital","Aggregate Labor Productivity","Unemployment Models","Job Search","Technological Change","Diffusion Processes"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060659364"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67b4aa9afdbe835d67ace1d7","name":"Markus","lastName":"Grabka","documentHash":"ea94f676-51d7-4e50-b0b3-63e6742d336b"},{"objectId":"67b4aa9afdbe835d67ace1d6","name":"Daniela","lastName":"Piazzalunga","documentHash":"e7eed35c-9d76-43bd-a7c9-0839fb1ddb62"},{"objectId":"651cce2a40e3ff22d348287f","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Siermińska","uuid":"BBBF5DAF3E728E7DAC06A0D0B0F52311DACE5413B230E4ED7B70A0CFEB865FF7F0950E14DC3828C8691E0829A6464157DF0010A08A11109722EA7B220D9BEC61","orcidId":"0000-0003-1936-814X","documentHash":"a799d08b-6aa8-45aa-9f0e-afb421d61ac6"}],"objectId":"67b4aa9afdbe835d67ace1d4","doi":"10.1515/bejeap-2023-0259","publicUri":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/bejeap-2023-0259/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Women’s Labour Market Attachment and the Gender Wealth Gap","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article examines the evolution of the gender wealth gap in Germany during the first decade of the XXI century. This period is characterized by an increase in labour supply of women and change in occupational structure due to numerous reforms undertaken by the government. We use the Firpo, Fortin, Lemieux detailed decomposition technique throughout the wealth distribution to identify the main factors explaining the gap over time. Findings indicate that an increase in the labour market participation of women and the resulting changes in the occupational structure are accompanied by positive changes in women’s wealth accumulation, which reduce the gender wealth gap. The role of permanent income decreases due to a reduction both in the gender difference in average permanent income and in gender differences in its returns. There remain substantial differences in the way women and men accumulate wealth. Policy interventions to further reduce the gap are discussed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["651cce2a40e3ff22d348287f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"1045-1071","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67b4aa9afdbe835d67ace1d6","67b4aa9afdbe835d67ace1d7","651cce2a40e3ff22d348287f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454772ba","mniswId":"2223","title":"B E Journal of Economic Analysis & Policy","issn":"1935-1682","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"febd2c24-9d37-46d4-a83a-0ae8716238e9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67b4aa9afdbe835d67ace1d5","year":"2024","volume":"24","number":"4","documentHash":"da744b3c-7b54-4e6a-9cbc-db805aa6224b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["gender wealth gap","decomposition analysis","labour supply","Germany"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060663311"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"664760f64097071861ec7b90","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Kozłowski","documentHash":"c13b3e42-8765-4edc-8695-2e62523208ea"},{"objectId":"664760f64097071861ec7b8f","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Jackowicz","documentHash":"69f02f4b-a696-4bab-b3a8-e23f50f44c4e"},{"objectId":"664760f64097071861ec7b8e","name":"Iftekhar","lastName":"Hasan","documentHash":"c201825f-9ab0-4def-9ae1-c49a04059cac"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047394f83","name":"Oskar","lastName":"Kowalewski","uuid":"0C8DE99DE7F07AF99C6965A3ECBB7F048B43B0ACF64E58BC2CDC4BA741E24F8D9C0FF011FBBACEC180BA387EB3AEDBA12BC012252A82CE6862BF1F1A85B91DD7","orcidId":"0000-0001-5520-3559","documentHash":"913e42cd-f030-4b44-ad91-a2d1c7e1e7c0"}],"objectId":"664760f64097071861ec7b8c","doi":"10.1016/j.intfin.2023.101736","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1042443123000045","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Cultural values of parent bank board members and lending by foreign subsidiaries: The moderating role of personal traits","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, we investigate whether the cultural values of a parent bank’s board members affect lending by the bank’s foreign subsidiaries and how this influence is moderated by the board members’ personal traits.

We establish that different sensitivities of female and male directors modify the relevance of individual cultural dimensions in lending by foreign bank subsidiaries.

Recent research shows that returns on human capital investment can be higher than those on physical capital investment. Yet, national accounts classify human capital expenditures as consumption and only investment in physical capital is recognized as investment. We propose new classification methodology and apply it to the data on public and private expenditures in 28 EU countries. We find that human capital investment constitutes on average 11.1% of GDP, of which 8.8 p.p. come from public sector. Physical capital investment constitutes on average 20.6% of GDP, of which 17.6 p. p. come from private sector.

(BPM) education in Poland and provides evidence-based recommendations for improvement. Through a survey of 44 BPM educators, the study evaluates BPM lifecycle coverage, IT tool utilization, and incorporation of the Six Core Elements of BPM. The findings reveal a focus on process modeling and analysis, identifying gaps in the way the entire BPM lifecycle is addressed. Despite the utilization of various IT tools, there is a notable absence of coverage for emerging topics such as process mining, AI, and Robotic Process Automation. Only 12% of courses cover all Six Core Elements of BPM, and there is a critical gap in student education, which is the underrepresentation of the People and Culture elements. The paper concludes with a manifesto for greater alignment between academic education and industry needs through comprehensive BPM curricula, dedicated software tools, and more robust coverage of the strategic and governance aspects of BPM. This will bridge the gap between academic education and real-world BPM applications, so that graduates can be better prepared for the challenges of the modern business landscape, which can enhance the quality and effectiveness of BPM education, thereby aligning it with the evolving demands of the business environment and contributing to the growth and competitiveness of organizations in Poland."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b1878c28a04739acc4"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","issue":"2 (104)","pagesFromTo":"91-98","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70945c878c28a0473bb65e","5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70","5e70922b878c28a04739104a","5e709358878c28a0473a7a94","5e70923a878c28a04739204d","5e70925d878c28a0473946b5","5e70922b878c28a04739108e","5e709472878c28a0473bd40a","5e7092b1878c28a04739acc4","66f10757fdbe83273711610c","5e709347878c28a0473a640f","5e70922b878c28a04739115b"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479dee","mniswId":"5605","title":"E-Mentor","issn":"1731-6758","eissn":"1731-7428","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"78d6f9af-759d-4646-944a-2cef3cd51130"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"666adbd04097072419007d99","year":"2024","volume":"","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"0f041c9c-0c3e-4b2c-b9f7-42902de94aa7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["BPM education","Business Process Management","technologies in BPM education","academic teaching","manifesto"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060732402"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094c7878c28a0473c3874","name":"BIANKA","lastName":"GODLEWSKA-DZIOBOŃ","uuid":"1146A96A63D5345047FD2360D94B028CEF3019E6B87FB8CD8583BA8EC40A798F37807E33A81A5B4595059A52F42F962052CFB91F3521DAB0C11AABF2C8206A7D","orcidId":"0000-0001-9668-458X","documentHash":"19743a46-3e04-4943-ac6c-9db394085208"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ace1","name":"Anna","lastName":"Ujwary-Gil","uuid":"6160632B89AF1998A06B5D3123B622F6EC531D295BB3D518FFD0F69DF978750F293CA0C9A461CB8A608FA0BFD1D07E27C6C05753D0D803B8DCD87864A213ED16","orcidId":"0000-0002-5114-7366","documentHash":"a8138fc8-ecd2-4dcc-9b92-519f0c654f51"}],"objectId":"637383244097070c79d210f6","doi":"10.15678/eber.2022.100211","publicUri":"https://eber.uek.krakow.pl/index.php/eber/article/view/1612/770","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The two-mode network approach to digital skills and tasks among technology park employees","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objective: The article predicts how the performance of tasks understood as tasks shared between a dyad can be predicted based on the perceptual difference of behaviors in terms of the digital skills of technology park employees (social actors). Here, employees serve park tenants mainly from the creative, game, IT and multimedia industries, and broadly understood audiovisuals.\nResearch Design & Methods: The questionnaire previously validated by other authors was used to measure employees’ digital skills and two non-parametric network statistics tests based on data permutation were conducted: the quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) and the multiple regression quadratic assignment procedure (MRQAP), which are good at error autocorrelation.\nFindings: The results show that there is a relationship between selected digital skills and tasks shared among employees; digital skills influence behavior patterns, thus increasing or decreasing tasks shared in the workplace; moreover, dyad embedded in an intra-organizational social network is more appropriate for anticipating inherently relational tasks sharing between employees in a knowledge-intensive organization.\nImplications & Recommendations: The findings contribute to the literature on digital skills and shared tasks from a dyadic and organizational perspective by deepening the understanding of the relationship between a pair of employees. Organizations should apply digital skills training to influence interpersonal relationships and thus the effectiveness of task performance and business processes. It seems necessary to develop and implement policy’s assumptions about increasing the digital skill level of its employees.\nContribution & Value Added: The article shows digital skills (information management, information evaluation, communication sharing, communication building, communication networking, collaboration, critical thinking, creativity, problem solving) in connection with the tasks performed in the workplace in terms of dyads and two-mode networks (actors and digital skills; actors and tasks performed). In this perspective, the perceptual differences of behaviors in digital skills are considered, which from the network perspective have not yet been explored by other researchers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3f","uid":"b_mU9PNOiJAy4luPpgunvBw","uuid":"35bdf5a0-c4e2-4ae5-8ac3-0e449b57baba","name":"Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c7878c28a0473c3874"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3f","parentUuid":"35bdf5a0-c4e2-4ae5-8ac3-0e449b57baba","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3f","rootUuid":"35bdf5a0-c4e2-4ae5-8ac3-0e449b57baba","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b1878c28a04739ace1"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"187-204","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b1878c28a04739ace1","5e7094c7878c28a0473c3874"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479df5","mniswId":"5769","title":"Entrepreneurial Business and Economics Review","issn":"2353-883X","eissn":"2353-8821","documentHash":"cbba20cc-0986-4305-8b2a-8cc90f0d679e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"637383244097070c79d210f7","year":"2022","volume":"10","number":"2","documentHash":"0c085784-3082-45b5-bf13-199ee0e79196"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["digital skills","dyad","two-mode network","tasks","social networks","social network analysis","QAP","MRQAP"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654723644"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63737dfd4097070c79cdbd7c","name":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Parente","documentHash":"bfda31c7-e45c-4db9-bcf2-db877e225dbb"},{"objectId":"63737dfd4097070c79cdbd7b","name":"Michelle","lastName":"Lo Re","documentHash":"4373e27f-d4ec-497f-bef7-062e6a704f4d"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ace1","name":"Anna","lastName":"Ujwary-Gil","uuid":"6160632B89AF1998A06B5D3123B622F6EC531D295BB3D518FFD0F69DF978750F293CA0C9A461CB8A608FA0BFD1D07E27C6C05753D0D803B8DCD87864A213ED16","orcidId":"0000-0002-5114-7366","documentHash":"a8138fc8-ecd2-4dcc-9b92-519f0c654f51"}],"objectId":"63737dfd4097070c79cdbd79","doi":"10.23762/fso_vol10_no1_1","publicUri":"https://depot.ceon.pl/bitstream/handle/123456789/21216/Actor%20network%20model%20of%20economic%20networks.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The actor-network model of economic networks in a geo-economic context: the conceptual considerations","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Contemporary economic networks operate in a turbulent geo-economic context in which the external environment determines the formation or disintegration of such networks. The article focuses on economic networks through the prism of network analysis, actor-network theory, and network theory. As a consequence, the authors attempted to develop an actor-network model, taking into account the geo-economic context, social and technical actors, their roles and positions in the economic network, and network measures (centrality, knowledge/resource/task diversity, and redundancy). Due to the conceptual nature of the article, a less formalised, narrative literature review was used, which allowed for the free selection of literature and its interpretation in the context of the research question posed. As a result, a conceptual actor-network model for economic networks was created, understood as a framework for the analysis of the network of relations, interactions, and interdependencies occurring between the socio-technical actors of the economic networks through the prism of the allocation and distribution of information, knowledge, resources, and tasks. The actor-network model is the starting point for further, more advanced research, as well as the operationalisation and validation of the model, which would contribute to the actor-network theory and network theory. In this conceptual form, the presented actor-network model seems to be universal, and its application is possible whenever we can identify actors and the relationships between them. Its implementation in the study of economic networks in any sector is conditioned by the definition of social and technical actors; their relations, roles, and positions in the network affecting the efficiency of the network as a whole."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b1878c28a04739ace1"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"9-28","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b1878c28a04739ace1","63737dfd4097070c79cdbd7b","63737dfd4097070c79cdbd7c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479e5e","mniswId":"200028","title":"Forum Scientiae Oeconomia","issn":"2300-5947","eissn":"2353-4435","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"a7ea9791-cf04-4d30-8024-654dafa354c6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63737dfd4097070c79cdbd7a","year":"2022","volume":"10","number":"1","documentHash":"36add2e3-a1c9-4d29-aa4c-957c79fade1c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["actor-network model","economic networks","network efficiency","actor-network theory","network theory","geo-economic context"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654723722"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094b6878c28a0473c22d8","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Borsuk","uuid":"54E5E4530CD93C4C62E1354A8D463B5E9C8B1682C4AD151CCB9405AA0920419534485B0BAC1DA149A82CDC83F4B103ED8B7349245A95D0BFA9F38C02939D4A07","orcidId":"0000-0002-7687-0948","documentHash":"643477fa-b68a-40d2-9644-786b0ec9d966"}],"objectId":"6630c6814097071c38a73f76","doi":"10.21314/jcr.2023.003","publicUri":"https://www.risk.net/journal-of-credit-risk/7956264/climate-policy-relevant-sectors-and-credit-risk","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Climate-policy-relevant sectors and credit risk","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Climate change poses several risks to the value of financial assets and to financial stability.

Then, we translate changes in climate-related variables into changes in banks’ balance-sheet losses.We provide empirical evidence of the heterogeneous effect of energy-related variables on the quality of loans in various sectors of the economy. Our results show that banks exposed to climate-policy-relevant sectors are more sensitive to changes in environmental risk drivers and are thus subject to a higher credit risk than those exposed to less carbon emitting sectors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094b6878c28a0473c22d8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"1-18","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094b6878c28a0473c22d8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454785ea","mniswId":"10714","title":"Journal of Credit Risk","issn":"1744-6619","eissn":"1755-9723","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"13031dc1-caf4-41c6-b6e2-d1b9d59711d7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6630c6814097071c38a73f77","year":"2023","volume":"19","number":"1","documentHash":"dfd848c8-5a99-4c42-a8a9-8a206f733c08"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654857093"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"663cbbe54097071b758687f1","name":"Edmund H.","lastName":"Mantell","documentHash":"f987b36e-9992-47e1-a149-7feddce99ee8"},{"objectId":"663cbbe54097071b758687f0","name":"Abdul","lastName":"Wahid","documentHash":"8196eeac-0635-458c-9b88-ea2d3ca80423"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047394f83","name":"Oskar","lastName":"Kowalewski","uuid":"0C8DE99DE7F07AF99C6965A3ECBB7F048B43B0ACF64E58BC2CDC4BA741E24F8D9C0FF011FBBACEC180BA387EB3AEDBA12BC012252A82CE6862BF1F1A85B91DD7","orcidId":"0000-0001-5520-3559","documentHash":"913e42cd-f030-4b44-ad91-a2d1c7e1e7c0"}],"objectId":"663cbbe54097071b758687ef","doi":"10.1108/jpif-06-2021-0051","publicUri":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JPIF-06-2021-0051/full/html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Determinants of the prices of residential properties in Pakistan","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This research aims to identify the statistically significant characteristics of a hedonic model to explain the pricing of residential properties in two cities in Pakistan.  The research methodology applies extreme bounds analysis and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. Estimators of efficient pricing were measured via stochastic frontier analysis. The study findings show that the market valuation of residential properties in Islamabad and Rawalpindi is systematically related to numerous factors, including property location, neighborhood characteristics, environmental characteristics, structural characteristics and administrative qualities of local housing societies. The authors also find statistical evidence that suggests that residential estate properties in the two cities are overpriced in the sense that the market transaction prices tend to be higher than the fair prices of the properties in the two cities. In Pakistan, the term “real estate” is used rather synonymously with the word “investment.” The findings of this research will help investors to identify the measurable factors that affect the transaction prices of residential real estate. These identifications will facilitate the development of strategic plans toward achieving sustainable rates of return in residential real estate markets. The residential real estate sector in Pakistan is constantly changing. There are myriad causes for these changes, including changes in social structure, cultural attitudes and technology. Customary methods for forecasting market prices for residential properties have been rendered unreliable because of the dynamics of the market. This study will contribute to the understanding of the changing dynamics of residential real estate pricing. Although Pakistan's residential real estate market is growing very rapidly, there is little published research identifying the drivers of this growth. This study covers these aspects to fill the theoretical gap in a real estate context"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709265878c28a047394f83"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"41","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"35-49","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["663cbbe54097071b758687f0","5e709265878c28a047394f83","663cbbe54097071b758687f1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547ca08","mniswId":"12409","title":"Journal of Property Investment & Finance","issn":"1463-578X","eissn":"1470-2002","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"b6dd2b26-3d29-462f-8fbe-8f49c2335488"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["actual price","hedonic model","fair price","LASSO regression","EBA","housing society reputation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654944100"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70934c878c28a0473a6b4e","name":"Michał","lastName":"Zajfert","uuid":"17BF811C4CADE55CF17D66399ECC8B3C3D44B6DACEBD1BD2CA0EC4FA7774AFFC1C50A6D80D11DBAE0F007A5B94FA12DB6349072790B7A80D1795935FA371EBA5","orcidId":"0000-0001-8104-9401","documentHash":"718fcd4c-be00-40d9-93c6-54e4c9da3557"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"6630cf594097071c38a7b115","doi":"10.33119/gn/174499","publicUri":"https://gnpje.sgh.waw.pl/pdf-174499-98333","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"A Study of the Efficiency of Regional Railway Services: The Case of Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Regional railway transport is an alternative to individual transport that contributes to a reduction in external costs and is considered a public service obligation (PSO). A common way to measure the efficiency of regional railway transport is compensation for operational performance in train-kilometres. However, this metric does not accurately reflect the true efficiency of this kind of transport as it overlooks the main objective of engaging public funds. The goal is not merely to operate trains at the lowest possible cost, but rather to provide maximum societal benefits. Our analysis revealed a significant challenge in determining the actual efficiency of regional railway services. The nationwide railway company appears to employ cross-subsidisation of services to generate abnormal profits, thereby reducing its expectations in the face of potential competition and artificially improving its efficiency in areas where there is real competition. The current organisation of regional railway transport makes it difficult to assess its efficiency and, consequently, to select the optimal operator in economic terms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70934c878c28a0473a6b4e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"316","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"30-53","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70934c878c28a0473a6b4e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479ead","mniswId":"27368","title":"Gospodarka Narodowa","issn":"2300-5238","documentHash":"eaf36461-e2fb-43e9-b53f-9788256fe732"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6630cf594097071c38a7b116","year":"2023","volume":"316","number":"4","documentHash":"303170ee-1ddf-4eeb-adf1-816c99037ea8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["public transport","regional transport","railway transport","public service obligation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654944280"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a04739707e","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Pisany","uuid":"3E9DB6B8EE9D2168337F8A836B93F2777486CA65AF7E57315B6382DACC4FC88FF72BADE703EFA19EA89836FEEA646F8DF7EB7B228B681499EC14225D6DCA40B1","orcidId":"0000-0001-9665-8840","documentHash":"6e9dfaf4-5469-4f72-b7fb-3926e0360f10"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047394f83","name":"Oskar","lastName":"Kowalewski","uuid":"0C8DE99DE7F07AF99C6965A3ECBB7F048B43B0ACF64E58BC2CDC4BA741E24F8D9C0FF011FBBACEC180BA387EB3AEDBA12BC012252A82CE6862BF1F1A85B91DD7","orcidId":"0000-0001-5520-3559","documentHash":"913e42cd-f030-4b44-ad91-a2d1c7e1e7c0"}],"objectId":"6772b4eafdbe831015cc0930","doi":"10.1108/s1569-376720220000022002","publicUri":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/S1569-376720220000022002/full/xml","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"Banks’ Patenting as an Answer to Emerging Fintech and Bigtech Competition: A Cross-Country Empirical Study","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a04739707e","5e709265878c28a047394f83"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"13-36","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709265878c28a047394f83","5e709284878c28a04739707e"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"6772b4acfdbe831015cc07cb","doi":"10.1108/s1569-3767202222","title":"Fintech, Pandemic, and the Financial System: Challenges and Opportunities","year":2023,"isbn":"978-1-80262-948-4","url":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/publication/doi/10.1108/s1569-3767202222","translation":false,"documentHash":"bdcd5ffa-f535-438b-b178-d41aae9e774f","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb7dd","mniswId":"22700","name":"Emerald Publishing","documentHash":"c2aa91cc-4fa3-4329-a230-ba6e8e71085f"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747654948011"}]
