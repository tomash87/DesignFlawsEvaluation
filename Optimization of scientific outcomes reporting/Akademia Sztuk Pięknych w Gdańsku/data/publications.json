Syncretic activities on the borderline of composition, improvisation, \ninterpretation, and sensory experience of the emerging work expand the areas of \ncreative creation. The interdisciplinary approach deepens artistic awareness \nand encourages experimentation, bringing together diverse artistic communities to shape a space for multidimensional collaboration. The Albion project was inspired by British composer Thomas Adès' music. This audiovisual work is a collaboration between a music choreographer and a visual artist. The premise of the Albion - remix project is an attempt to give a new quality to an earlier creation, in which the guiding idea was to 'hear and see' music through the \nprism of the virtual world. The means of expression sought were focused on \ncreating a work in which the music and all its elements become a stimulus for \nmovement interpretation, as well as all visual activities, creating an integrated \npolymedia artistic message. The project was realised outdoors, where the natural \nenvironment influenced the artistic decisions made - becoming one of the \nelements of the creative work. By projecting animations onto spatial \nobjects, they were given new dimensions and/or brought to life. The resulting\nproject was recorded and used to further explore both the music and the visual \nand movement layers. Using the previously recorded work, the focus was\non finding a kind of dialogue between what was recorded and the new idea. \nThe resulting form of the image corresponds with the earlier recording, while deforming it through visual treatments to create a kind of artistic cognitive hybrid. The live movement blends into the background of the projection through a kind of image manipulation resulting from the animation's reaction to the performer's \nmovement. The course of the performer's movement is a planned composition with elements of improvisation resulting from the need to shape the image of the \nemerging projection. Each of the assumptions made was intended to show \nthe dynamics of the creative process resulting in an interdisciplinary, generative aesthetic work."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de5e","uid":"bRZlv-2e1jmUjrBsAuk6whg","uuid":"07b1296a-15ed-4caf-a2ca-1a24a57f5959","name":"Akademia Sztuk Pięknych w Gdańsku","affiliatedPersonIDs":["633f8f297523402e340fee6f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de5e","parentUuid":"07b1296a-15ed-4caf-a2ca-1a24a57f5959","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de5e","rootUuid":"07b1296a-15ed-4caf-a2ca-1a24a57f5959","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de58","uid":"bvET7ACr0TvRyXolzkWhHkA","uuid":"91ab4da1-a170-40fc-a351-2339b7ef3899","name":"Akademia Muzyczna im.

Returning to his native France in towards the end of his career, Callot’s work became quite serious as he documented the horrors of the Thirty Years’ War in his ‘Mysteries of war’ series, which would continue to influence the artistic representation of conflict and social injustice into the 19th and 20th centuries."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de5e","uid":"bRZlv-2e1jmUjrBsAuk6whg","uuid":"07b1296a-15ed-4caf-a2ca-1a24a57f5959","name":"Akademia Sztuk Pięknych w Gdańsku","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f3f3d66752340073806a841"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de5e","parentUuid":"07b1296a-15ed-4caf-a2ca-1a24a57f5959","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de5e","rootUuid":"07b1296a-15ed-4caf-a2ca-1a24a57f5959","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","pagesFromTo":"31-38","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f3f3d66752340073806a841"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"67b7215dfdbe830bf0419ccd","title":"Sztuka europejskiego baroku.

He extended from the parterres great blocks of trees contracting progressively to accentuate the perspective, and related them to the fountains, the waterworks and the statuary, obtaining maximum reflection by drawing attention to water levels. So delighted with the result was Louis XIV that he charged Le Nôtre with planning the gardens at Versailles, where the grounds covered more than 15,000 acres (6,000 hectares). Transforming a muddy swamp into a park of magnificent vistas, he extended and enhanced the architecture of the palace, and his monumental style reflected and heightened the splendour of Louis XIV’s court."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de5e","uid":"bRZlv-2e1jmUjrBsAuk6whg","uuid":"07b1296a-15ed-4caf-a2ca-1a24a57f5959","name":"Akademia Sztuk Pięknych w Gdańsku","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f3f3d66752340073806a841"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de5e","parentUuid":"07b1296a-15ed-4caf-a2ca-1a24a57f5959","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de5e","rootUuid":"07b1296a-15ed-4caf-a2ca-1a24a57f5959","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","pagesFromTo":"11-20","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f3f3d66752340073806a841"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"67b7215dfdbe830bf0419ccd","title":"Sztuka europejskiego baroku.

He designed the Château of Vaux-le-Vicomte (1656–1661) for Nicolas Fouquet, the yound Louis XIV’s Superintendent of Finances. What made it distinctive from earlier styles was the unity of its architecture, interior, and landscape around it. Its facade featured stylized monumental columns, wings combined with mansard roofs and a prominent dome, in the baroque style. The interior was lavishly decorated with murals by Le Brun, and it was placed in the centre of enormous formal gardens designed by André Le Nôtre, laid out in geometric patterns paths, flower beds, fountains and reflecting pools, which seemed to extend the architecture of the house in every direction. The grand salon of the building opened out onto the garden, which thereafter became a regular feature of baroque palaces.The same three artists scaled this concept up to monumental proportions in the royal hunting lodge and later the main Palace of Versailles (1661–1690). On a far grander scale, the palace is a hypertrophied and somewhat repetitive version of Vaux-le-Vicomte. It was both the most grandiose and the most imitated residential building of the 17th century."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de5e","uid":"bRZlv-2e1jmUjrBsAuk6whg","uuid":"07b1296a-15ed-4caf-a2ca-1a24a57f5959","name":"Akademia Sztuk Pięknych w Gdańsku","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f3f3d66752340073806a841"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de5e","parentUuid":"07b1296a-15ed-4caf-a2ca-1a24a57f5959","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de5e","rootUuid":"07b1296a-15ed-4caf-a2ca-1a24a57f5959","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","pagesFromTo":"21-30","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f3f3d66752340073806a841"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"67b7215dfdbe830bf0419ccd","title":"Sztuka europejskiego baroku.
