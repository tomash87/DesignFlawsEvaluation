The new arguments are based on a study of the morphology, microstructure, and microtaphonomy of early Cambrian (Tommotian and Atdabanian) archaeocyathan specimens from northeastern Siberia. Light microscopic and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) observations revealed that in many specimens the outer, often microlaminated, skeletal fabric grades continuously into the microfabric similar to that of microbial bush-like and dendritic microfossils such as Angulocellularia and Renalcis. The polyhedral to subglobular units characterizing the skeletal microfabric of the studied archaeocyaths and their microbial outgrowths are most similar to recent and fossil mineralized (calcified) colonies of benthic coccoidal cyanobacteria. This means that what had heretofore been interpreted as skeletons secreted by archaeocyathan organisms represent calcareous crusts precipitated by epibiontic cyanobacteria-like microbes, probably associated with a variety of other bacteria, colonizing surfaces and internal spaces of soft-bodied archaeocyathan organisms. Our study shows that a number of the morphological traits of archaeocyaths conserved by the mineralized microbial cover are similar to those of of modern siphonous green algae, like the marine genus Codium Stackhouse (Bryopsidales). Identifiable in well-preserved archaeocyaths are remains of such traits characteristic for Codium species as utricles, medullary threads, juvenile stages (primordia), and coalescence structures. The taxonomic and palaeoenvironmental implications of the recognition of archaeocyaths as possible consortia of siphonous green seaweeds (Chlorophyta) and cyanobacteria-like microbes are briefly discussed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Methods capable of synthesizing information from extant and fossil species have yielded novel insights into diversification rate variation through time, but little is known about their behavior when analyzing entirely extinct clades. Here, we use empirical and simulated data to assess how two popular methods, PyRate and Fossil BAMM, perform in this setting. We inferred the first tip-dated trees for ornithischian dinosaurs and combined them with fossil occurrence data to test whether the clade underwent an end-Cretaceous decline. We then simulated phylogenies and fossil records under empirical constraints to determine whether macroevolutionary and preservation rates can be teased apart under paleobiologically realistic conditions. We obtained discordant inferences about ornithischian macroevolution including a long-term speciation rate decline (BAMM), mostly flat rates with a steep diversification drop (PyRate) or without one (BAMM), and episodes of implausibly accelerated speciation and extinction (PyRate). Simulations revealed little to no conflation between speciation and preservation, but yielded spuriously correlated speciation and extinction estimates while time-smearing tree-wide shifts (BAMM) or overestimating their number (PyRate). Our results indicate that the small phylogenetic data sets available to vertebrate paleontologists and the assumptions made by current model-based methods combine to yield potentially unreliable inferences about the diversification of extinct clades. We provide guidelines for interpreting the results of the existing approaches in light of their limitations and suggest how the latter may be mitigated."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Coralliths, or circumrotatory colonies, are passively motile coral colonies constantly overturned by wave action or currents. Such overturning allows tissue growth on all sides of the colony. They are among the most rarely reported growth forms. Recent corallith-forming scleractinian corals mostly inhabit the shallowest reef environments, but coralliths can also develop at greater depths in areas of low topographic relief, unconsolidated substratum, low coral cover and high water movement. Here, we report on Devonian (Givetian Favosites goldfussi and Frasnian Alveolites? tenuissimus) coralla from the Holy Cross Mountains, Poland. Our analysis suggests these colonies are coralliths, although less mature than usually reported. These corals, unlike previously described growth forms of this kind, lived in relatively deep environments: probably the upper mesophotic (Givetian, Miłoszów), or deep reef fore-slope (Frasnian, Jaźwica and Kowala). Microfacies analysis of the Jaźwica site suggests unconsolidated substratum and high hydrodynamic energy. We conclude that these corals lived in deeper environments where bottom currents caused their autorotation. A good modern analogue for such a corallith-forming environment is the Wistari Channel (Southern Great Barrier Reef), where bottom tidal currents at nearly 30 m of depth are strong enough to overturn colonies of Stylocoeniella cf. guentheri reaching 15 cm in diameter. Our discovery shows that the spectrum of coral growth forms during the Devonian peak of reef development was broader than previously assumed, and that tabulate corals displayed numerous adaptive strategies to various environments."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Despite the fact that they were also abundant in the geological past, their fossil record is uneven. For example, little is known about sponge communities that inhabited the Tethyan areas during the Cenozoic. Here, we record an abundant and taxonomically diverse assemblage of middle–late Eocene sponges from east-central Ukraine. The material consists of preserved whole-body specimens as well as disassociated spicules. The taxonomic composition of this new assemblage, supplemented with previously published data obtained from sponge materials originating from the middle and upper Eocene of the East European Platform, documents a surprisingly rich sponge community that inhabited shallow waters (depths of 100 m) and comprised at least 30 demosponge species, including two new taxa, Paratetilla milanek Łukowiak and Theonella alexandriae Łukowiak, three hexactinellids and a single homoscleromorph. Additionally, we report the first fossil occurrence of Vetulina, a demosponge genus that currently is found near the Philippines and Australia and in the Caribbean Sea. Some of the sponge taxa recognized were previously noted from the upper Eocene of Australia and New Zealand. This is indicative of their wide distribution during the early Cenozoic and also shows that a non-interrupted connection existed between the western Tethyan and peri-Australian areas, explaining the patchy distribution of some sponge taxa in modern seas."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Here, we re-examined time-lapse movies made in 2017 and \ncrawling traces produced by stalked crinoids (the isocrinine Metacrinus rotundus) in previously \npublished neoichnological experiments using new 3D digitization techniques (laser scanning and \nphotogrammetry) in order to provide a more detailed 3D morphology of these traces. These data \nreveal some previously unnoticed crawling behavior and features of the traces of M. rotundus. We \nalso demonstrate that crinoid-bearing beds are sometimes associated with ichnofossils that can \nbe potentially interpreted as crinoid crawling traces. These data sources may provide more direct \nevidence of active locomotion in fossil crinoids."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623319c82467f0713d54e5cb","635c90287523405a7dcc91ed","623319c82467f0713d54e5cc","5e7092ec878c28a04739f43e"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

The bryozoans are preserved as moulds and cannot be precisely identified but are evidently membraniporimorph cheilostomes. By comparison with similar modern cheilostomes, the colonies are estimated to have taken a week or more to grow to their preserved sizes. From this it can be inferred that the encrusted leaves remained intact and may potentially have been transported several kilometres from the site of origin.

The composition of the assemblage from dolomite beds at Miedary is similar to those from the Muschalkalk facies, whereas the assemblage from glauconite beds appears to be the first brackish vertebrate assemblage of the Serrolepis lake-type recognized from the eastern Germanic Basin. Comparative analysis of all sites, using hierarchical clustering, nonmetric multidimensional scaling, and principal component approaches, revealed the existence of vertebrate taxa associated withfreshwater, brackish and marine conditions, as well as euryhaline taxa with wide salinity preferences. Moreover, it confirms the brackish nature of Serrolepis-bearing assemblages, and suggests that Serrolepis suevicus is a brackish specialist, indicative of oligohaline to miohaline paleosalinities.

An influx of molecular studies has transformed scleractinian systematics, highlighting that cryptic species may be more common than previously understood. In this study, we test the hypothesis that Plesiastrea versipora (Lamarck, 1816), a species currently considered to occur throughout the Indo-Pacific in tropical, sub-tropical and temperate waters, is a single species. Molecular and morphological analyses were conducted on 80 samples collected from 31 sites spanning the majority of the species putative range and twelve mitogenomes were assembled to identify informative regions for phylogenetic reconstruction. Congruent genetic data across three gene regions supports the existence of two monophyletic clades aligning with distinct tropical and temperate provenances. Multivariate macromorphological analyses based on 13 corallite characters provided additional support for the phylogeographic split, with the number of septa and corallite density varying across this biogeographic divide. Furthermore, micromorphological and microstructural analyses identified that the temperate representatives typically develop sub-cerioid corallites with sparse or absent coenosteal features and smooth septal faces. In contrast, tropical representatives typically develop plocoid corallites separated by a porous dissepimental coenosteum and have granulated septal faces. These data suggest that at least two species exist within the genus Plesiastrea Milne Edwards & Haime, 1848. Based on examination of type material, we retain the name Plesiastrea versipora (Lamarck, 1816) for the temperate representatives of the genus and resurrect the name Plesiastrea peroni Milne Edwards & Haime, 1857 for the tropical members. This study highlights how broadly distributed hard coral taxa still need careful re-examination through an integrated systematics approach to better understand their phylogeographic patterns. Furthermore, it demonstrates the utility of integrating micro-, macro-morphological and genetic datasets, and the importance of type specimens when dealing with taxonomic revisions of scleractinian taxa."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Overall, the order of genes in the mitochondrial\ngenome (mitogenome) together with DNA sequences have been used to successfully untangle evolutionary re-\nlationships in several groups of organisms. Published mitogenomes of two caryophylliid genera (Desmophyllum\nand Solenosmilia) present a transposition of the gene block containing cob, nad2, and nad6, which is located\nbetween nad5 5′ exon and trnW, while that of Polycyathus chaishanensis presents the same gene order as the\nmajority of scleractinian corals. In molecular-based evolutionary reconstructions, caryophylliids that have the\nmitochondrial gene rearrangement were recovered as a monophyletic lineage (“true” caryophylliids), while\nmembers of the genus Polycyathus were placed in a different position. In this study, additional mitogenomes of\nthis family were assembled and included in evolutionary reconstructions of Scleractinia in order to improve our\nunderstanding on whether the mitogenome gene rearrangement is limited to and, therefore, could be a synap-\nomorphy of the actual members of Caryophylliidae. Specimens of Caryophyllia scobinosa, Premocyathus sp.,\nHeterocyathus sulcatus, and Trochocyathus caryophylloides, as well as Desmophyllum pertusum and Solenosmilia\nvariabilis from the Southwest Atlantic were sequenced using Illumina platforms. Then, mitochondrial genomes\nwere assembled and annotated, and nuclear datasets were recovered in-silico from assembled contigs using a\npreviously published set of baits. Evolutionary reconstructions were performed using mitochondrial and nuclear\ndatasets and based on Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference. Obtained mitogenomes are circular and\nrange between 15,816 and 18,225 bp in size and from 30.76% to 36.63% in GC content. The gene rearrangement\nis only seen in C. scobinosa, D. pertusum, Premocyathus sp., and S. variabilis, which were recovered as a mono-\nphyletic clade in both mitochondrial and nuclear phylogenies. On the other hand, the “caryophylliids” with the\ncanonical mitogenome gene order were not recovered within this clade.

They represent the \nmost important library of information on the evolution of life and its environmental conditions. Organisms produce soft \nand hard tissues in a bottom-up process, a construction principle that is intrinsic to biologically secreted materials. This \nprocess emerged early on in the geological record, with the onset of biological mineralization. The phylum Brachiopoda is a \nmarine animal group that has an excellent and continuous fossil record from the early Cambrian to the Recent. Throughout \nthis time interval, the Brachiopoda secreted phosphate and carbonate shells and populated many and highly diverse marine \nhabitats. This required great fexibility in the adaptation of soft and hard tissues to the diferent marine environments and \nliving conditions. This review presents, juxtaposes and discusses the main modes of mineral and biopolymer organization in \nRecent, carbonate shell-producing, brachiopods. We describe shell tissue characteristics for taxa of the orders Rhynchonellida, \nTerebratulida, Thecideida and Craniida. We highlight modes of calcite and organic matrix assembly at the macro-, micro-, \nand nano-scales based on results obtained by Electron Backscatter Difraction, Atomic Force Microscopy, Field Emission \nScanning Electron Microscopy and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy. We show variation in composite hard tissue \norganization for taxa with diferent lifestyles, visualize nanometer-scale calcite assemblies for rhynchonellide and terebratu\u0002lide fbers, highlight thecideide shell microstructure, texture and chemistry characteristics, and discuss the feasibility to use \nthecideide shells as archives of proxies for paleoenvironment and paleoclimate reconstructions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

However, their ecological significance is not well understood, partly because they remain largely undescribed with most records being of the type species, G. oviformis. To enhance our knowledge of gromiid biodiversity, we use morphological and genetic data to describe four new species with tests of different shapes from sublittoral depths (21–136 m) in South Georgia fjords: G. pashukae (ovate), G. landrethi (spherical), G. amygdaliformis (almond-shaped), and G. saoirsei (elongate), maximum lengths 3.4, 2.5, 1.4 and 4.5 mm, respectively. We also describe two smaller (~1 mm) gromiid species from intertidal sites on the Falkland Islands: G. cedhageni (ovate test with finely granular, orange-coloured contents), and Gromia psammophila (subrectangular test with numerous small mineral grains embedded in pale, finely granular material). Gromia landrethi is also represented by DNA sequences from specimens collected in Ushuaia (Argentina) and G. psammophila by sequenced specimens from southern Chilean fjords, but the other species are known only from localities in South Georgia or the Falkland Islands. Analysis of partial SSU rRNA genes confirms the presence of these six new species, as well as an undescribed species represented by a clade of three sequences branching separately. Our results increase the number of described gromiid species from 10 to 16, and underline the importance of these poorly known relatives of the foraminifera in higher-latitude intertidal and fjord settings. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

The vast majority of these finds are referable to Discosauriscus austriacus, and almost exclusively represent larvae and juveniles tied to aquatic environments. Only one of the specimens discovered to date has been interpreted as an early adult, although late juvenile and early sub-adult stages have been proposed for it as well. Regardless, no other seymouriamorph adults have been reported from the Boskovice Basin so far. Here we present the first comprehensive assessment of seymouriamorph tracks and a trackway from the Asselian (lowermost Permian) of the Boskovice Basin. The morphology of the tracks is congruent with that of the ichnotaxon Amphisauropus and indicates an attribution to Discosauriscidae or that they belong to as yet unrecognized large seymouriamorphs. All tracks were made by individuals much larger than the largest discosauriscid known from bodily preserved material and are interpreted as those of adults tied to terrestrial environments, thus apparently documenting a habitat shift that occurred relatively late in the ontogenetic development of these seymouriamorphs. Furthermore, the largest track is preserved in extraordinary detail and includes soft part impressions such as digital, palmar and plantar flexion creases, making the specimen one of the best preserved seymouriamorph tracks described to date. Finally, one of the tracks originates from the lowermost Asselian and is therefore among the oldest known records of seymouriamorphs worldwide. © 2022 The Palaeontological Association."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Herein, we describe skeletal abnormalities in the Middle Triassic bone material from the Vossenveld Formation of Winterswijk, the Netherlands. The aim of the study is to distinguish in the studied bones pathologies resulting from malady or trauma and taphonomic alterations. Furthermore, an attempt was made to assess on how the pathologies also represent paleoecological data. Our survey led to the identification of one broken and healed bone, one case of abnormal coossification, and one case of posttraumatic fibro-osseous dysplasia. While the latter two pathologies give little insight into the ecology and function of the affected animals, the fractured dentary is attributed to Nothosaurus marchicus, a common sauropterygian macropredator. It proves that the individual survived long enough to heal, despite the injury hampering its hunting potential. One abnormally shaped humerus is interpreted as postmortem taphonomic deformation, emphasizing the necessity of utilization of detailed diagnostics to distinguish actual paleopathologies from nonbiological distortion."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ea878c28a04739f232","5e7092ea878c28a04739f1e4"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

The skeletons of sponges are mostly characterized by the presence of mineral elements termed spicules, which structurally support the sponge bodies, though they also minimize the metabolic cost of water exchange and deter predators. The description of the spicules' shape and the skeleton organization represents the fundamental basis of sponge taxonomy and systematics. Here, we provide an illustrated catalogue of sponge spicules, which is based on previous works on sponge spicules, for example, and gathers and updates all terms that are currently used in sponge descriptions. Each spicule type is further illustrated through high quality scanning electron microscope micrographs.

Omphalosauridae, an enigmatic clade of open-water durophagous marine reptiles, potentially played an important role in the recovery, but their fragmentary fossils and uncertain phylogenetic position have hindered our understanding of their role in the process. Here we report the large basal ichthyosauriform Sclerocormus from the Early Triassic of China that clearly demonstrates an omphalosaurid affinity, allowing for the synonymy of the recently erected Nasorostra with Omphalosauridae. The skull also reveals the anatomy of the unique feeding apparatus of omphalosaurids, likely an adaptation for feeding on hard-shelled pelagic invertebrates, especially ammonoids. Morphofunctional analysis of jaws shows that omphalosaurids occupy the morphospace of marine turtles. Our discovery adds another piece of evidence for an explosive radiation of marine reptiles into the ocean in the Early Triassic and the rapid recovery of pelagic ecosystems after the PTME. © 2022, The Author(s)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Based on shape and structure, two distinct types are identified. The first type comprises sinuously folded, coiled, or spiral string-shaped specimens, interpreted as faecal material, coprolites. The specimens measure between less than one and two mm, the strings being long and against their subcircular to circular cross-section (60–150 μm). Many strings are folded in few to more than 30 regular loops, in this exceptional complexity unknown from any comparable fossil or extant faeces. Fully stretched, such strings may have an estimated length of more than three cm, suggesting continuous production of such faeces and resistance very a longer period after defecation until fossilization. Modelling similar strings indicates that the loops were produced by sidewards swinging of the body end of the producer during forward move. EDS analysis of the strings revealed low silica content, but high amounts of phosphate pointing to a organic-rich muddy bottom, which the producers swallowed and eventually became phosphatized as faeces. The producers of this faeces might have been few millimeter long and benthic, not infaunal worms, yet, none of the putative coprolites can be unquestionably ascribed to a particular animal group. The second type of fossils comprises between 100 and 220 μm long ellipsoidal to spherical forms with a smooth but wrinkled surface. They are interpreted as collapsed and deformed eggs or embryos lacking the egg shell, rather than coprolites made of digested and squeezed remains of possibly phosphatocopid crustaceans, the most abundant component of the Polish and Baltoscandian Orsten-type fossil assemblages. The spheres also have a smooth surface, which in all cases is partly broken off, uncovering an internal mass. This ranges from a small hump of possibly embryonic material in a large void, to a completely round body possibly presenting a late shield-bearing embryo filling the entire space underneath the egg shell. We interpret this second type of fossils as the first evidence of eggs in Orsten-type preservation, most likely belonging to phosphatocopid crustaceans."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Here we present an overview of present-day sponges reported from such communities, as well as a review of all supposedly vent- and seep-associated fossil sponges reported so far. The most common sponges in the present-day seep and vent communities are Demospongiae, while Hexactinellida are rare. Most of these sponges are considered as “background” fauna with an exception of Cladorhizidae, which may thrive in deep-water hydrothermal vents. The oldest confirmed sponges from ancient seep sites are reported from the Late Jurassic of France and Jurassic/Cretaceous boundary beds in Svalbard. Additionally, we report herein new hexactinellids from Late Cretaceous localities in Japan. The Paleogene and Neogene records of seep sponges are more common but limited mostly to US Pacific Coast. Our review clearly shows that in the fossil record of chemosynthesis-based communities, sponges were equally common and diversified as they are today but were just overlooked."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

A list of gastropod occurrences in ancient hydrocarbon seeps is provided in this chapter, and the most important taxa common at seeps are discussed in more detail. The fossil record shows that the trochomorph gastropods are already known from Paleozoic seeps and vents though they are poorly preserved and thus researched. Already in Late Triassic seeps, gastropods are well diversified, including the first possible abyssochrysoids. The Jurassic and Cretaceous were times of abyssochrysoid dominance in seep and vent gastropod communities not only in number of taxa but also in number of individuals. Two new families (Desbruyeresidae and Rubyspiridae) and one new subfamily (Alviniconchinae) are described. It is suggested that the latter belongs to Paskentanidae. The oldest report of neomphalid gastropods in seeps is from the Jurassic though their diversity is rather restricted and apparently they are absent at Mesozoic vents. Most likely, the neomphalid radiation in vents came much later.

Carbonate deposits enriched in methanogenic carbon are found in ancient rock formations as old as the Silurian. In contrast to their recent equivalents, they are mostly found on land in uplifted ancient sedimentary formations. Unlike their extant equivalents, ancient seeps are no longer active and have been frequently subjected to burial which has not yet affected recent seeps. Furthermore, aragonite forming bulk of extant seep carbonates is largely recrystallized into calcite in their ancient equivalents. Some exposures of fossil rock formations offer a three-dimensional view of plumbing system supplying ancient seeps, but this is largely hidden below the seabed where extant seeps are located.\n\nDespite distinct approaches required by occurrence and history of ancient and extant seep deposits, the petrographic features characterizing them are similar. Both are composed of microcrystalline carbonates with a variable amount of dispersed pyrite. Sparry cements, especially botryoidal aragonite and calcite, are the hallmark of seep deposits and are one of the first features noticed by any researcher. These features of seep carbonate remained virtually unchanged throughout 420 Ma of their known history and allow for easy recognition of such carbonates in the fossil record."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

The chronostratigraphic ranges of seep-inhabiting chemosymbiotic bivalves show an overall increase in diversity at seeps since the Paleozoic.

The most common infaunal chemosymbiotic bivalve taxa at modern seeps, lucinids and thyasirids, appeared at seeps in the Late Jurassic and earliest Cretaceous. They diversified during the Cretaceous synchronous with the peak of the “Mesozoic Marine Revolution” and first occurrences of gastropod predatory drill holes in the shells of seep-inhabiting bivalves, soon after the appearance of these gastropods in the mid-Cretaceous. The two dominant bivalve clades of the modern vent and seep fauna, bathymodiolins and vesicomyids, appeared in the Eocene. Their origin has been linked to a deep-water extinction event at the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. However, the fossil record of chemosymbiotic bivalves at seeps during this time interval does not display any extinction. Rather, the mid-Eocene appearance of semi-infaunal and epifaunal bivalves such as bathymodiolins and vesicomyids might be linked to a dramatic rise in seawater sulfate concentrations at this time."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

This Upper Eifelian to Middle Givetian, ca. 250–280 m thick unit, consists of marly and clay shales, interbedded many times with various limestone types (including encrinite and biohermal varieties), as well as with marls and siltstones. Its diagnostic feature is the presence of variable skeletal accu\u0002mulations, formed by exceptionally numerous, well-preserved and diverse macrofauna (including brachiopods, corals, crinoids, bryozoans), described since the 19th century. The stratotype is located in the eastern slope of the Dobruchna stream near the Skały village and belongs to the Silurian to Upper Devonian Grzegorzowice-Skały sec\u0002tion. Compared to the previously used term, Skały Beds sensu Pajchlowa (1957), the lower boundary is redefined, owing to a new exposure in the active Skała Quarry, and placed higher, at the base of the famous brachiopod shales (set XIV of Pajchlowa), instead of the formerly accepted lower boundary at the base of set XIII. Set XIV is formal\u0002ly distinguished as the Dobruchna Brachiopod Shale Member. The higher part of the Skały Fm (sets XV–XXVA) is not subdivided further, as the poorly exposed succession, including in particular the type area, precludes a more accurate recognition of lithological variability. The upper boundary of the Skały Fm is placed at the top of set XXV sensu Pajchlowa (1957), corresponding to the boundary between subsets XXVA and XXVB sensu Malec and Turnau (1997). A hypostratotype of the upper boundary is selected in the outcrop M0 at Miłoszów, 2.5 km west\u0002wards from the type section, allowing recognition of the diachroneity of lithological change defining the transition from the Skały Fm to Świętomarz Beds. A borehole situated in a key location would be an obvious next step in the further elucidation of the stratigraphic sequence of the Łysogóry Region."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

The\nmaterial consists of preserved whole-body specimens as well as\ndisassociated spicules. The taxonomic composition of this new\nassemblage, supplemented with previously published data\nobtained from sponge materials originating from the middle\nand upper Eocene of the East European Platform, documents\na surprisingly rich sponge community that inhabited shallow\nwaters (depths of 100 m) and comprised at least 30 demosponge\nspecies, including two new taxa, Paratetilla milanek Łukowiak\nand Theonella alexandriae Łukowiak, three hexactinellids and\na single homoscleromorph. Additionally, we report the first\nfossil occurrence of Vetulina, a demosponge genus that currently\nis found near the Philippines and Australia and in the\nCaribbean Sea. Some of the sponge taxa recognized were previously\nnoted from the upper Eocene of Australia and New\nZealand. This is indicative of their wide distribution during\nthe early Cenozoic and also shows that a non-interrupted connection\nexisted between the western Tethyan and peri-\nAustralian areas, explaining the patchy distribution of some\nsponge taxa in modern seas."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

The biological significance of RM systems extends beyond their defensive function, but the data on the regulatory role of Type I MTases are limited. We have previously characterized molecularly a non-canonical Type I RM system, NgoAV, with phase-variable specificity, encoded by Neisseria gonorrhoeae FA1090. In the current work, we have investigated the impact of methyltransferase NgoAV (M.NgoAV) activity on gonococcal phenotype and on epigenetic control of gene expression. For this purpose, we have constructed and studied genetic variants (concerning activity and specificity) within M.NgoAV locus. Deletion of M.NgoAV or switch of its specificity had an impact on phenotype of N. gonorrhoeae. Biofilm formation and planktonic growth, the resistance to antibiotics, which target bacterial peptidoglycan or other antimicrobials, and invasion of human epithelial host cells were affected. The expression of genes was deregulated in gonococcal cells with knockout M.NgoAV gene and the variant with new specificity. For the first time, the existence of a phasevarion (phase-variable regulon), directed by phase-variable Type I MTase, is demonstrated.

Early to Middle Givetian in age, were investigated in\nfour sections at Miłoszów Wood in the Łysogóry Region (northern region of the Holy Cross Mountains, central\nPoland). The dating is based on conodonts (Polygnathus timorensis Zone to the later part of the Polygnathus\nvarcus/Polygnathus rhenanus Zone; early Polygnathus ansatus Zone cannot be excluded) and spores (Ex1–2\nsubzones) and, coupled with cartographic analysis and geophysical investigation, allows correlation within the\nstrongly faulted succession. Significant lateral facies variations within the carbonate ramp depositional system in\ncomparison with the better studied Grzegorzowice–Skały section, about 3 km distant, are documented, thanks to\nconodont-based correlation of both successions. Foraminifers, fungi, sponges, rugose and tabulate corals, medusozoans,\nmicroconchids and cornulitids, polychaetes (scolecodonts), molluscs (bivalves, rostroconchs, and gastropods),\narthropods (trilobites and ostracods), bryozoans, hederelloids, ascodictyids, brachiopods, echinoderms\n(mostly crinoids, rare echinoids, holuthurians, and ophiocistoids), conodonts, fish, plants (prasinophytes, chlorophycophytes,\nand land plant spores), and acritarchs are present. Brachiopods are the most diverse phylum present\n(68 species), other richly represented groups are bryozoans and echinoderms; in contrast, cephalopods and\ntrilobites are low in diversity and abundance. The muddy, middle to outer ramp biota (200 marine taxa, including\n170 species of marine animals, 22 photoautotrophs, 6 forams) represents a mixture of allochthonous shallower-water\ncommunities (upper BA3), including storm- and possibly tsunami-affected coral mounds, and autochthonous\ndeep-water soft-bottom brachiopod (e.g., Bifida–Echinocoelia) communities (BA 4–5). The richness and diversity\nof the Miłoszów biota is relatively high, comparable with other approximately coeval pre-Taghanic ecosystems\nduring the Devonian climatic deterioration (cooling). Preliminary data indicate that in the Holy Cross Mountains,\nno large-scale replacement of brachiopod (and probably many other benthic ones, like crinoids) communities\ntook place between the Early–Middle Givetian and the Early Frasnian, in contrast to the demise of the Hamilton/\nUpper Tully fauna in the Appalachian Basin. Such a similarity of pre- and post-Taghanic faunas does not exclude\nthe occurrence of environmental perturbations and transient community turnovers, caused by immigrations during\nthe Taghanic Biocrisis, but evidences the successful recovery of the indigenous biota."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

The top-Eifelian stra\u0002ta, recording the carbonate crisis during the global Kačák Bioevent, are well known for having a particularly \ndiverse brachiopod fauna. The four brachiopod assemblages, recognised herein, were mainly controlled by \nthe evolving bottom-sediment properties of the outer carbonate ramp basin. Soft, unstable substrates were inhabit\u0002ed by the poorly-diversified Poloniproductus assemblage, associated with a distinctive, ‘incumbent’ set of largely \nsemi-infaunal, generalist species. The pioneer community, as a result of progressive consolidation of bioclast-en\u0002riched sediment, evolved toward a more diverse biota. This consequent stabilisation of the substrate resulted in \nthe progressive growth of crinoid thickets or bryozoan-dominated biostromes and patches, associated with rich, \nsubordinate, sessile and vagile benthos. In this stage, diverse brachiopod assemblages were dominated by the \npedunculate, eurytopic, ribbed spiriferide Eleutherokomma or specialized orthides (Aulacella, Costisorthis) in \nthe Dobruchna Mbr, and by the expansive, large, free-lying orthotetide Xystostrophia in the overlying set XV of \nthe Skały Fm The cyclic ecological replacement, with the characters of ecological succession in the final phase, \nwas evidently stimulated by an irregular transition from soupy muds to a mosaic of bioclast-rich and firmer, \nbiogenic sediments, within the cyclic pattern of distal tempestite sedimentation. The three episodes of variously \nreduced deposition rate, recorded in the more diverse benthos, culminated in the pioneer bryozoan/coral reef \ngrowth and abundance of epibionts, alternating with times of destructive storm activity and deposition from \nsuspension clouds in the muddy habitats."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

In this paper,\nwe explored the association between shell ornamentation and latitude/bathymetry\nusing the latest global database of living brachiopods.

Both findings are puzzling for\nliving brachiopods as they are sharply contrasted to the patterns of fossil brachiopods\nwhereby the latter, especially Paleozoic brachiopods, are known to exhibit (1) a much\ngreater ornamentation diversity and (2) (at least for the geological periods that have\nbeen studied) a linear latitudinal gradient of ornamentation complexity existed. The\nreasons why living brachiopods have such a high proportion of smooth or weakly\nornamented shells and fail to demonstrate an unequivocal linear latitudinal ornamen\u0002tation gradient were explored and are linked to a multitude of potential factors rather\nthan uniquely only to the predation pressure. Among these, the most plausible fac\u0002tor seems to be the cryptic (refuge-type) habitats (e.g., deep waters, cold polar re\u0002gions, and submarine rock caves) that living brachiopods have been adapted to due\nto their low metabolism, where predation pressure is low, allowing brachiopods to\nenact the predator avoidance strategy rather than having to manufacture robust shell\nornamentation to survive in an otherwise highly engaged predator–prey global marine\necosystem."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Animals produce the energy necessary for life via chemical reactions in which biomolecules (such as glucose) react with oxygen to release CO2, H2O, and energy. The metabolism is determined from the animal's reported mass growth curve (the mass of the animal as a function of age during its juvenile growth) using a model based on conservation of energy. The metabolism reveals the rate at which oxygen is used by the animal. The efficiency of oxygen extraction is assumed to be the same as observed in modern birds (which have a very efficient \"one-way\"breathing modality and are direct descendants of dinosaurs). Using the estimated concentration of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere during the Late Triassic period yields the amount of air that P. trossingensis breathed each minute. Finally, the tidal volume (the volume of air inhaled in each breath) was used to calculate its resting breathing rate. This exercise has been used in introductory and intermediate courses on thermal physics, and the students find it empowering (and fun) to be able to gain this insight into the physiology of a dinosaur. © 2023 Author(s)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Different lineages within the Glires evolved basically opposite chewing movements: a mostly transversal power stroke in lagomorphs, and a mostly proal power stroke in rodents, but the ancestral condition for Glires is still unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we studied the mandibles of Chinese Palaeocene Glires representing the duplicidentate (lagomorph-like; Mimotona) and simplicidentate (rodent-like; Eomylus and Heomys) lineages. To assess the mechanical resistance of mandibles to bending and torsion, we calculated the section modulus. The dentaries differ greatly in morphology and the region where the maximum grinding force was likely applied. The early Palaeocene Mimotona lii and the middle Palaeocene Mimotona robusta and Heomys orientalis all show a pattern of increasing strength moving posteriorly along the mandible, similar to sciurids and the mountain beaver. By contrast, the late Palaeocene Eomylus sp. mandible was strongest in the m1 region, a pattern seen in lagomorphs and the stem placental Zofialestes. Our results indicate the early diversification of mandible structure of Glires, demonstrate a mixture of duplicidentate and simplicidentate characters among the basal Glires and suggest an early occurrence of a lagomorph-like morphotype.

The fauna is Early to early Middle Givetian in age (timorensis to rhenanus/varcus conodont zones) and thus predates the Middle Givetian Taghanic Bioevent. One new genus and three new species are described. Leiocyrtia Baliński gen. nov. (type species: Leiocyrtia rara Baliński gen. et sp. nov.; Spiriferida, Cyrtiidae) is characterised by a non-costate shell with prominent sulcus and fold and capillate microornament. Undispirifer sidoniae Halamski and Baliński sp. nov. is characterised by transverse shells and dense ribbing. Moravilla andreae Baliński and Halamski sp. nov. is characterised by relatively coarse radial capillate ornament and is the first representative of the genus outside the type species from the Givetian of Moravia. The most abundant species are: Spinulicosta cf. spinulicosta, Antirhynchonella linguiformis, Pentamerelloides davidsoni, Peratos beyrichi, Plectospira ferita, Spinatrypa wotanica (confirmed to belong to that genus and not to Spinatrypina), Ambothyris sp., and Echinocoelia dorsoplana. ‘Spirifer’ quadriplicatus Sandberger and Sandberger, 1856, a rare species known from Miłoszów and the Rhenish Massif, is an orthide and belongs to Teichertina. The relationship between Skenidioides polonicus and S. cretus, formerly understood as anagenesis, is re-interpreted as budding cladogenesis. Davidsonia septata is reported as an epizoan on rugosan corals, a relationship never previously observed in representatives of that genus. Brachiopods represent different palaeoecological groupings, from relatively shallow-water taxa (BA3, globetum) to deep-water mud-dwelling ones (BA5, deeper brachiopodetum). The richest beds are M1-IIa (28 brachiopod species), M3-7 (23 species), and M0-9 (22 species). Eighteen species described here were not known previously in the Holy Cross Mountains, so the corrected total number of brachiopod species from the Middle Devonian of the Łysogóry Region is 140."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Characters concerning the ICA, such as its course in the auditory region, have been employed frequently in phylogenetic analyses of mammals, including extinct taxa. In lagomorphs, however, our knowledge on vascular features of the auditory region has been based predominantly on living species, mostly on the European rabbit. We present the first survey on 11 out of 12 extant genera and key fossil taxa such as stem lagomorphs and early crown representatives (Archaeolagus and Prolagus). The ICA pattern shows a modified transpromontorial course in stem taxa (Litolagus, Megalagus and Palaeolagus) and Archaeolagus, which we propose as the ancestral character state for Lagomorpha, similar to that for the earliest rodents, plesiadapids and scandentians. The ICA pattern in leporids is perbullar, but shows structural similarities to stem taxa, whereas the extrabullar ICA course in Ochotona is apparently a highly derived condition. Prolagus shows a mixed character state between leporids and Ochotona in its ICA route. The persistence of the transpromontorial ICA course and similarities in the carotid canal structure among stem taxa and crown leporids support morphological conservatism in Lagomorpha, in contrast to their sister clade Rodentia.

However, recent fieldwork in the Asselian (lowermost Permian) of the Boskovice Basin has yielded a diverse assemblage of tetrapod tracks, illuminating a hidden terrestrial tetrapod diversity. Here, we describe well-preserved isolated tracks, manus-pes couples, and a slab with trackways composed of approximately 20 tracks in at least four different directions belonging to early-diverging, or ‘pelycosaur-grade’, synapsids. The material originates from three localities situated within the Letovice and Padochov formations and is assignable to the ichnotaxon Dimetropus. The best-preserved specimen further shows rare skin impressions, which have not been observed from the hands or feet of early-diverging mammal-line amniotes before. The new material adds to the scarce record of synapsids from the Carboniferous/Permian transitional interval of equatorial Pangea. At the same time, it highlights the significance of the ichnological record of the Boskovice Basin which has long been neglected despite offering evidence for the presence of diverse faunal components that have not been reported from these basinal deposits before. © 2023, The Author(s)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

In our dynamically changing world, it is essential to monitor changes in these vulnerable settings. Here, we present a baseline study of \"living\"(rose-bengal-stained) benthic foraminifera from fjords of South Georgia, including fjords with and without tidewater glaciers. Their distribution is analyzed in the light of new fjord water and sediment property data, including grain size and sorting, total organic carbon, total sulfur, and δ13C of bulk organic matter. Four well-defined foraminiferal assemblages are recognized. Miliammina earlandi dominates in the most restricted, near-shore and glacier-proximal habitats, Cassidulinoides aff. parkerianus in mid-fjord areas, and Globocassidulina aff. rossensis and an assemblage dominated by Ammobaculites rostratus, Reophax subfusiformis, and Astrononion echolsi are in the outer parts of the fjords. Miliammina earlandi can tolerate strong glacial influence, including high sedimentation rates in fjord heads and sediment anoxia, as inferred from sediment color and total organic carbon¯/¯sulfur ratios. This versatile species thrives both in the food-poor inner reaches of fjords that receive mainly refractory petrogenic organic matter from glacial meltwater and in shallow-water coves, where it benefits from an abundant supply of fresh, terrestrial, and marine organic matter. A smooth-walled variant of C. aff. parkerianus, apparently endemic to South Georgia, is the calcareous rotaliid best adapted to inner-fjord conditions characterized by moderate glacial influence and sedimentation rates and showing no preference for particular sedimentary redox conditions. The outer parts of fjords with clear, well-oxygenated bottom water are inhabited by G. aff. rossensis. Ammobaculites rostratus, R. subfusiformis, and A. echolsi dominate in the deepest-water settings, with water salinities ≥¯33.9¯PSU and temperatures 0.2-1.4¯ C, characteristic of winter water and Upper Circumpolar Deep Water. The inner- and mid-fjord foraminiferal assemblages seem specific to South Georgia, although with continued warming and deglaciation, they may become more widespread in the Southern Ocean. © 2023 The Author(s)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Seven extant genera comprising a total of 22 valid species are currently recognised. Recent studies have re-organised the taxonomy of the family at the genus level based on molecular and morphological data, including a comprehensive revision of Euphyllia and the resurrection of Fimbriaphyllia. Here, three mitochondrial loci (coi, 12S rRNA, and 16S rRNA) were sequenced and morphological examinations were conducted at three scales (macro/micromorphology and microstructure of the skeleton, and polyp morphology) to study the phylogeny and taxonomy of Euphylliidae. We analysed a total of 11 valid species collected from seven Indo-Pacific localities. The monotypic genus Coeloseris, currently in Agariciidae, was also investigated since previous molecular data suggested a close relationship with the Euphylliidae. Molecular and morphological phylogenetic trees were broadly concordant in the definition of genus-level clades. All analysed genera, i.e., Ctenella, Euphyllia, Fimbriaphyllia, Galaxea, and Gyrosmilia, were reciprocally monophyletic based on molecular results. Coeloseris was nested within the family and, therefore, is formally moved into Euphylliidae. Updated morphological diagnoses are provided for each investigated genus. This study further demonstrated that a phylogenetic classification of scleractinian corals can be achieved by applying a combined morpho-molecular approach. Finally, we encourage phylogenetic and taxonomic studies of the euphylliid taxa not yet analysed molecularly, such as the monotypic genera Montigyra and Simplastrea. © Roberto Arrigoni et al., 2023."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Although significant progress has been made in recent years to understand their body size evolution, a complete characterization of their body-size dynamics at macroevolutionary scale and over extended time periods using up-to-date source of data remains largely unexplored. Here, we compiled a new database on crinoid calyx biovolumes throughout the Paleozoic and Mesozoic to explore their size dynamics. Despite complexities of the observed body size trajectories that differ at various taxonomic and temporal scales, a common pattern emerges from our analyses: the mean size of crinoid calyx declined significantly around most of the major extinction events (during the late Ordovician, the mid-late Devonian, the end Permian and the mid-late Cretaceous). The observed decline in the mean size of crinoid calyces is mostly governed by extinction of larger taxa, except during the mid-late Cretaceous anoxic events, when it appears to be mostly driven by origination of small-sized taxa. Overall, these findings highlight important role of extinction events in altering body size evolution."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

They form a distinctive condensed interval of considerable stratigraphical, palaeontological, and economic value. Here, we correlate the classical section at Annopol with a recently investigated section at Chałupki. We propose a new stratigraphic interpretation of the phosphorite interval, based on lithological correlations, Rare Earth Elements and Yttrium (REE+Y) signatures of phosphorites, age-diagnostic macrofossils, and sequence stratigraphic patterns. This interval has long been considered as exclusively Albian in age. However, new macrofossil data allow us to assign the higher phosphorite levels at Annopol and Chałupki, which were the primary target for the phosphate mining, to the lower Cenomanian. In terms of sequence stratigraphy, the phosphorite interval encompasses the depositional sequence DS Al 8 and the Lowstand System Tract of the successive DS Al/Ce 1 sequence. The proposed correlation suggests that lowstand reworking during the Albian–Cenomanian boundary interval played an important role in concentrating the phosphatic clasts and nodules to exploitable stratiform accumulations. Our conclusions are pertinent to regional studies, assessments of natural resources (in view of the  recent interest in REE content of the phosphorites), and dating of the fossil assemblages preserved in the phosphorite interval. On a broader scale, they add to our understanding of the formation of stratiform phosphorite deposits."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df17","uid":"bxvEdTB_rZDwTwDCxKD8MAA","uuid":"baafdd5c-15d8-49db-ac14-1067a5fabd1b","name":"Wydział Geologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709356878c28a0473a7895"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

However, understanding locomotion adopted by extinct animals in the absence of trace fossils and modern analogues is extremely challenging. Here, we develop a biomimetic soft robot testbed with accompanying computational simulation to understand fundamental principles of locomotion in one of the most enigmatic mobile groups of early stalked echinoderms—pleurocystitids. We show that these Paleozoic echinoderms were likely able to move over the sea bottom by means of a muscular stem that pushed the animal forward (anteriorly). We also demonstrate that wide, sweeping gaits could have been the most effective for these echinoderms and that increasing stem length might have significantly increased velocity with minimal additional energy cost. The overall approach followed here, which we call “Paleobionics,” is a nascent but rapidly developing research agenda in which robots are designed based on extinct organisms to generate insights in engineering and evolution."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

We describe one new genus (Palaeoargentina gen. nov.), six new otolith-based species (Pteralbula polonica sp. nov., Protalbula pentangularis sp. nov., Kokenichthys kuteki sp. nov., Protoelops gracilis sp. nov., Palaeoargentina plicata sp. nov., Archaeotolithus aptychoides sp. nov.) from Wąwał and compare them to species known from similar assemblages elsewhere. The comparison of teleost diversity shows similarity to the Aptian (late Early Cretaceous) and less distinctly to the Maastrichtian (latest Cretaceous) assemblages, rather than to its coeval equivalents from Germany and southern England, and indicates that a considerable teleost diversity already existed before the mid-Cretaceous. The vertical succession of otolith taxa in the Wąwał section is in concordance to the pattern already revealed from the succession of bivalves and other benthic invertebrates and it is attributed to sea level and temperature variations. Previously identified causes of benthic invertebrate succession in the Wąwał section are used to infer paleoenvironmental factors governing fish distribution in the Valanginian marine environment recorded at this site. The new findings suggest that the radiation of teleosts started before the Valanginian, and it was a relatively long and apparently gradual process. This fossil association also reveals a significant shift in the abundance ratio of fish otoliths vs. cephalopod statoliths in fully marine deposits, with otoliths much more abundant than the statoliths in Valanginian and younger sediments while it is otherwise in the Jurassic deposits."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Changing environmental conditions, including a sharp reduction of water exchange between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, altered the geographical ranges of many organisms, including sponges (Porifera). Here, we report a unique assemblage of isolated sponge spicules from the upper Miocene of southwestern Spain. The newly recognized sponge fauna was inhabiting the Guadalquivir Basin—the corridor between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean at that time. It represents a taxonomically rich sponge community that consisted of members of “soft” and “lithistid” demosponges and hexactinellids. Demosponges are represented by at least thirty-four taxa, while hexactinellids are significantly rarer; only six taxa have been identified. From among eighteen taxa recognized to the species level, at least eight seem to be inhabiting this area to these days; six are recorded from adjacent areas, such as the Western Mediterranean, South European Atlantic Shelf, and the Azores, and three are present in the Red Sea and/or the Northern Atlantic. Intriguingly, some taxa seem to have their closest relatives in distant areas, such as the Indo-Pacific and Japanese waters which suggests that the range of some once widely-distributed populations shrunk after the isolation of the Mediterranean and the Messinian Salinity Crisis, surviving to the present day only in refugia."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

The bimodality was found to be largely persistent and consistent irrespective of taxonomic, bathymetric and spatial scales. We tested the strength of seven ecological hypotheses thought to potentially explain the classic unimodal latitudinal diversity gradient. The Rapoport's rule was found to be the strongest model fitting the bimodal pattern, followed by the Species-Energy hypothesis. The mechanisms through which the mean latitudinal ranges and thermal niches of living brachiopods may have combined to produce the bimodality are further linked to two other factors: 1) most living brachiopods seem to have a strong adaptation to the mesothermal conditions of the WTZs, and 2) for living brachiopods, the WTZs appear to represent both a source of speciation indicated by a relatively higher per-genus diversification rate and a ‘sink’ of biodiversity due to biogeographic mixing and a concentration of species range-end points."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Here, we pinpoint the appearance of large body size and robust dentitions to early-Middle Jurassic (Bajocian) pliosaurids from northeastern France and Switzerland. These specimens include a new genus that sheds light on the nascent diversification of macropredatory pliosaurids occurring shortly after the Early-Middle Jurassic transition, around  ~ 171 Ma. Furthermore, our multivariate assessment of dental character states shows that the first gigantic pliosaurids occupied different morphospace from coeval large-bodied rhomaleosaurid plesiosaurs, which were dominant in the Early Jurassic but declined during the mid-Jurassic, possibly facilitating the radiation and subsequent ecomorph acme of pliosaurids. Finally, we posit that while the emergence of macropredatory pliosaurids was apparently coordinated with regional faunal turnover in the epeiric basins of Europe, it paralleled a globally protracted extinction of other higher trophic-level marine reptiles that was not completed until after the earliest-Late Jurassic,  ~ 161.5 Ma."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

However, despite being historically significant, the taxon disappeared from the literature shortly after its initial description and has not been mentioned for over a century. Thus, it has never been properly assessed. The holotype comprises seven vertebrae, including a supposed sacral vertebra and caudal vertebrae. The specimens were collected from the Lochen mountain massif near Balingen in southwestern Germany and derive from the Dentalienton Formation. As such, they are most likely early Bathonian (Middle Jurassic) in age. Here, we provide a thorough redescription of the material, illustrate it, and assess its phylogenetic affinities through a parsimony analysis. Our results show that T. macrocephalus shares characters with members of the Rhomaleosauridae, including, for example, the length-height ratio of the caudal centra as well as the placement of caudal ribs and hemapophyseal facets. Rhomaleosaurid affinities of the material are likewise supported by our phylogenetic analysis. Comparisons further indicate that the taxon belonged to large-bodied members of the clade, with a body length similar to that of Rhomaleosaurus. Even though the material does not enable Trematospondylus to be properly diagnosed, thus making it a nomen dubium, it still adds to the rare Middle Jurassic record of rhomaleosaurid plesiosaurs. At the same time, it enhances our knowledge of the plesiosaur taxic diversity during the pre-Callovian Middle Jurassic, which has been very limited."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

stony corals and their dominance as tropical reef builders, it is critical to understand the adaptive capacity of corals to ongoing climate change. Biological mediation of the carbonate chemistry of the coral calcifying fluid is a fundamental component for assessing the response of corals to global threats. The Tara Pacific expedition (2016–2018) provided an opportunity to investigate calcification patterns in extant corals throughout the Pacific Ocean. Cores from colonies of the massive Porites and Diploastrea genera were collected from different environments to assess calcification parameters of long-lived reef-building corals. At the basin scale of the Pacific Ocean, we show that both genera systematically up-regulate their calcifying fluid pH and dissolved inorganic carbon to achieve efficient skeletal precipitation. However, while Porites corals increase the aragonite saturation state of the calcifying fluid (Ωcf) at higher temperatures to enhance their calcification capacity, Diploastrea show a steady homeostatic Ωcf across the Pacific temperature gradient. Thus, the extent to which Diploastrea responds to ocean warming and/or acidification is unclear, and it deserves further attention whether this is beneficial or detrimental to future survival of this coral genus."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Chez les deux taxons, nous avons observé de grandes régions médullaires internes remplies de trabécules endo-osseuses et des cortex périostés à fibres parallèles faiblement à modérément vascularisés (évoluant localement à lamellaires). La vascularisation primaire est principalement longitudinale, chez Proterochersis porebensis elle est localement radiale.

In both taxa we observed large, internal medullary regions filled with endosteal trabeculae and poorly to moderately vascularized parallel-fibered (grading locally to lamellar) periosteal cortices. Primary vasculature is predominantly longitudinal, in Proterochersis porebensis locally with radial inclination. In large specimens, secondary remodeling is significant in the deeper cortex, but it neither completely obliterates the primary tissue nor reaches the external surface of the bone in either taxon. Comparison of histological data, limb morphology, shell and limb lengths as well as proportions reveal differences in growth patterns between the taxa: Proganochelys quenstedtii seems to grow faster during early life stages than Proterochersis porebensis and attained distinctly larger body sizes earlier in ontogeny, even though the asymptotic body size is roughly the same for both species. Overall, the histological and microstructural characteristics of stylopodial bones of Triassic turtles more closely resemble those of more recent representatives of that group than earlier stem turtles."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Aside from their fairly rich record of body fossils, diadectomorphs are also well-known from widely distributed tracks and trackways referred to as Ichniotherium. Here, we provide detailed description of a diadectomorph trackway and a manus-pes couple originating from two different horizons in the Asselian (lowermost Permian) of the Boskovice Basin in the Czech Republic. The specimens represent two distinct ichnotaxa of Ichniotherium, I. cottae and I. sphaerodactylum. Intriguingly, the I. cottae trackway described herein illustrates a ‘transitional’ stage in the posture evolution of diadectomorphs, showing track morphologies possibly attributable to a Diadectes-like taxon combined with distances between the successive manus and pes imprints similar to those observable in earlier-diverging diadectomorphs, such as Orobates. In addition, this trackway is composed of 14 tracks, including six well-preserved manus-pes couples, and thus represents the most complete record of Ichniotherium cottae described to date from the Asselian strata. In turn, the manus-pes couple, attributed here to I. sphaerodactylum, represents only the second record of this ichnotaxon from the European part of Pangea. Our study adds to the diversity of the ichnological record of Permian tetrapods in the Boskovice Basin which had been essentially unexplored until very recently."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

At the same time, it is rather unstable and prone to evaporation. For these reasons, its application in sensors requiring reagents in solid state, for example in paper-based microfluidics, is hindered. Usually in paper-based analytical devices reagents are stored in a dried form within paper matrix until the device is used. This approach is not feasible in case of hydrogen peroxide. Here, hydrogen peroxide stabilization on paper with the aid of silica xerogel was studied and optimized to create long-term stable systems which rapidly deliver hydrogen peroxide.\nResults\nThe variables affecting hydrogen peroxide stability such as gelation time, silica to H2O2 ratio, type of solid support and storage conditions were optimized to find the combination of variables providing stable H2O2 concentration for the longest time possible. Such paper-silica-H2O2 composites allow to maintain steady hydrogen peroxide concentration for at least 27 days in the optimal conditions. Hydrogen peroxide is rapidly released from silica-paper matrix within a few minutes upon contact with water, without any byproducts. The obtained systems were characterized using scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy, revealing that silica is present as a thin film covering cellulose fibers. Finally, to test the developed hydrogen peroxide stabilization method in real sensing scenario, a proof-of-concept paper-based sensor was created for phenolic content determination in fruits and wine.\nSignificance\nThe outcome of this research will open new avenues in the development of user-friendly, long-term stable paper-based analytical devices which utilize hydrogen peroxide as one of reagents. Owing to the fact, that silica matrix is insoluble in water, the proposed H2O2 stabilization method is compatible with most detection schemes without the risk of interfering with the assay."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["66f3c456fdbe8326af946afb","5e709359878c28a0473a7d3f"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Recent fossil discoveries from the Guanling Formation (Middle Triassic) of southern China have revealed a dramatic increase in the known ecomorphological diversity of these extremely long-necked archosauromorphs, including the fully marine and viviparous Dinocephalosaurus orientalis. These recent discoveries merit a reinvestigation of enigmatic Triassic diapsid fossils from contemporaneous European deposits housed in historical collections. Here, we provide a redescription of Trachelosaurus fischeri, represented by a single, disarticulated specimen first described in 1918. Due to its unique morphology, which includes short, bifurcating cervical ribs, and a high presacral vertebral count, this taxon has been referred to either as a “protorosaurian” archosauromorph or a sauropterygian. Our revision clearly shows that Trachelosaurus represents the first unambiguous Dinocephalosaurus-like archosauromorph known from outside the Guanling Formation. Our finding has important systematic implications. Trachelosauridae Abel, 1919 represents the senior synonym for the recently identified Dinocephalosauridae Spiekman, Fraser and Scheyer, 2021. Based on our phylogenetic analyses, which employ two extensive datasets, we also corroborate previous findings that tanystropheids and trachelosaurids represent two families within a larger monophyletic group among non-crocopodan archosauromorphs, which is here named Tanysauria (clade nov.). Trachelosauridae is minimally composed of Trachelosaurus fischeri, Dinocephalosaurus orientalis, Pectodens zhenyuensis, and Austronaga minuta, but one of our analyses also found a probably taxonomically broader clade that may also include Gracilicollum latens and Fuyuansaurus acutirostris. Trachelosaurus fischeri considerably expands the known spatial and temporal range of Trachelosauridae to the earliest Anisian and the Central European Basin. Our findings add to the growing evidence for the presence of a diverse group of fully marine reptiles during the Middle Triassic among Tanysauria. These trachelosaurids possess flipper-like limbs, high vertebral counts, and elongate necks, thus superficially resembling long-necked Jurassic and Cretaceous plesiosaurs in some regards."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

During their formation, control over, e.g., morphology and carbonate polymorph is influenced by complex insoluble collagen-like protein and soluble non-collagenous protein assemblages; many of these proteins are incorporated into their aragonite crystal structure. However, in the fossil record these proteins are considered lost through diagenetic processes, hampering studies of past biomineralization mechanisms. Here we report the presence of 11 fish-specific proteins (and several isoforms) in Miocene (ca. 14.8–14.6 Ma) phycid hake otoliths. These fossil otoliths were preserved in water-impermeable clays and exhibit microscopic and crystallographic features indistinguishable from modern representatives, consistent with an exceptionally pristine state of preservation. Indeed, these fossil otoliths retain ca. 10% of the proteins sequenced from modern counterparts, including proteins specific to inner ear development, such as otolin-1-like proteins involved in the arrangement of the otoliths into the sensory epithelium and otogelin/otogelin-like proteins that are located in the acellular membranes of the inner ear in modern fish. The specificity of these proteins excludes the possibility of external contamination. Identification of a fraction of identical proteins in modern and fossil phycid hake otoliths implies a highly conserved inner ear biomineralization process through time"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Whereas trace fossils of animal activity are relatively common and actively studied within the field of ichnology, and natural impressions of internal or external surfaces are a frequent preservation mode in fossil invertebrates, natural molds of bones are comparatively rare and less extensively documented and discussed. Among them, internal molds (steinkerns) of turtle shells are a relatively well-known form of preservation, but the mechanisms and taphonomic prerequisites leading to their formation are poorly studied. External shell molds are even less represented in the literature. Herein, we describe a historic specimen of a natural external turtle plastron mold from the Triassic (Norian) Löwenstein Formation of Germany–a formation which also yielded a number of turtle steinkerns. The specimen is significant not only because it represents an unusual form of preservation, but also due to its remarkably large size and the presence of a potential shell pathology. Although it was initially interpreted as Proterochersis sp., the recent progress in the knowledge of proterochersid turtles leading to an increase in the number of known taxa within that group allows us to verify that assessment. We confirm that the specimen is morphologically consistent with the genus and tentatively identify it as Proterochersis robusta, the only representative of that genus from the Löwenstein Formation. We note, however, that its size exceeds the size observed thus far in Proterochersis robusta and fits within the range of Proterochersis porebensis from the Grabowa Formation of Poland. The marks interpreted as shell pathology are morphologically consistent with Karethraichnus lakkos–an ichnotaxon interpreted as a trace of ectoparasites, such as leeches. This may support the previously proposed interpretation of Proterochersis spp. as a semiaquatic turtle. Moreover, if the identification is correct, the specimen may represent a very rare case of a negative preservation of a named ichnotaxon. Finally, we discuss the taphonomy of the Löwenstein Formation turtles in comparison with other Triassic turtle-yielding formations which show no potential for the preservation of internal or external shell molds and propose a taphonomic model for the formation of such fossils."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

This structure is precisely adapted to facilitate movements of the head during feeding, locomotion, predator evasion, and social interactions. Eutheria, the clade including crown placentals, has a fossil record extending back more than 125 million years revealing significant morphological diversification in the Mesozoic. Yet very little is known concerning the early evolution of eutherian cervical morphology and its functional adaptations. A specimen of Zalambdalestes lechei from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia boasts exceptional preservation of an almost complete series of cervical vertebrae (C2–C7) revealing a highly modified axis (C2). The significance of this cervical morphology is explored utilizing an integrated approach combining comparative anatomical examination across mammals, muscle reconstruction, geometric morphometrics and virtual range of motion analysis. We compared the shape of the axis in Zalambdalestes to a dataset of 88 mammalian species (monotremes, marsupials, and placentals) using three-dimensional landmark analysis. The results indicate that the unique axis morphology of Zalambdalestes has no close analog among living mammals. Virtual range of motion analysis of the neck strongly implies Zalambdalestes was capable of exerting very forceful head movements and had a high degree of ventral flexion for an animal its size. These findings reveal unexpected complexity in the early evolution of the eutherian cervical morphology and suggest a feeding behavior similar to insectivores specialized in vermivory and defensive behaviors in Zalambdalestes akin to modern spiniferous mammals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

We found that echinoids cultured in seawater with a low magnesium to calcium ratio produced a skeleton with lower both magnesium content and nanohardness than those of the control specimens incubated under normal (high) magnesium to calcium ratio conditions. These results may suggest that at certain times in the geological past (during the so-called calcite seas) sea urchins with decreased skeletal magnesium contents were more susceptible to damage due to physical disturbances, predation and post-mortem taphonomic processes. Increased skeletal hardness of echinoids from the so-called aragonite seas is expected to enhance their taphonomic potential, thus, to some extent, mitigates the preservation bias related to increased solubility of high-magnesium calcite."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Their remains are currently known from that time from Asia, Europe, North America, and South America, and represent at least three separate clades. Whereas the generic and suprageneric attribution of comparatively well-preserved and studied European and South American taxa, such as Proganochelys quenstedtii, Proterochersis robusta and Proterochersis porebensis, Palaeochersis talampayensis, and Waluchelys cavitesta sparks no controversy, the more fragmentary and less common species have been variably considered representatives of separate genera or referred to already existing ones – most commonly, Proganochelys. This uncertainty is unfortunate, as it severely muddles the picture of the evolution, diversity, and geographical distribution of the earliest turtles. One such problematic species, coming from the Norian Huai Hin Lat Formation of Thailand, was described in 1980s as Proganochelys ruchae. However, this generic attribution was subsequently put into question and the recent increase of available Triassic turtle material allows to remove the species ruchae from Proganochelys to a new genus, Thaichelys gen. nov., and place it in the clade of Proterochersidae, together with Proterochersis spp., Keuperotesta limendorsa, and Chinlechelys tenertesta. As a result, the genus Proganochelys is considered here to be solely a central Pangean (modern-day European) taxon. Moreover, Thaichelys ruchae exhibits in some respects a transitional morphology between other Triassic taxa and Proterochersis spp., and may constitute a sister taxon to the grouping of Proterochersis spp. and Keuperotesta limendorsa from Europe. This, in turn, considering the lack of a Carnian record of pantestudinates outside of Asia, suggests that Thaichelys ruchae could represent an early radiation of the Proterochersidae which branched off before the Testudinata dispersed into the western Pangea."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Here, we report it for the first time from coral reefs of the Caribbean Sea (Belize). The morphoanatomical characteristics of the Caribbean specimens from Holocene sediment cores, which were collected in offshore reef environments, match those of the type material and other specimens reported from the Pacific and Indian Oceans, including the preservation of diagnostic characteristics (cuneate thallus morphology, morphology of the conceptacles and their pore canals, and dimensions of the cells). Similar to L. cuneatum from the Holocene of the Indian and Pacific oceans, Holocene specimens from Belize share two unique hosts represented by the coralline algae Porolithon onkodes and Neogoniolithon sp. The unique occurrence of this species in the Caribbean Sea can be explained either (1) by pre-Pliocene dispersal toward the west from the present-day Indian Ocean area along the Tethyan seaway and/or (2) by dispersal toward the east via the Pacific (Fiji) Ocean when the Panama Isthmus was still open. Although morphologically-equivalent coralline algae can belong to either cryptic or pseudocryptic species, both scenarios imply a broader, more continuous geographic distribution of lineage leading to semi-endophytic Lithophyllum cuneatum prior to the Pliocene, which is in contrast to the more fragmented distribution during the Holocene. Although the lack of information about the geographic range of L. cuneatum prior to the Holocene can be coupled with sampling biases and cannot discriminate among these scenarios, other cases of such disjunct distributions, which were formerly documented among marine invertebrates, indicate that the geographic distribution of this species was less fragmented in the past, and thus supports the Tethyan dispersal hypothesis, including the relict character of its present-day geographic distribution."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

They include the remains of large- to small-bodied ichthyosaurians originating from six stratigraphic levels spanning the lower Carnian to middle Norian. The material is mostly represented by isolated vertebrae and ribs, which are not possible to accurately diagnose, but also includes specimens comprising associated vertebrae and a fragmentary skeleton that preserves cranial remains (parabasisphenoid, fragmentary quadrate, partial mandible and hyoids). Based on vertebral and rib morphology, we identify the specimens as representatives of the following taxonomic groups: large-bodied shastasaurids, medium-sized indeterminate ichthyosaurians with a single rib facet in the presacral centra, and small euichthyosaurians with double rib facets present throughout the presacral vertebrae that likely represent toretocnemids and/or basal parvipelvians. In addition, the cranial and mandibular remains preserved in one of the specimens, ZIN PH 5/250, were studied using micro-computed tomography. Its mandible is highly similar to that of toretocnemids, whereas the parabasisphenoid demonstrates a peculiar combination of both plesiomorphic and derived character states, providing the first detailed data on this cranial element in a Late Triassic ichthyosaurian. Furthermore, the specimen also demonstrates a distinctive condition of rib articulation in the anteriormost presacral (cervical) vertebrae, which together with other features allows for the erection of a new taxon - Auroroborealia incognita gen. et sp. nov. Although the phylogenetic position of this taxon is uncertain due to its fragmentary nature, its anatomy, indicating toretocnemid or parvipelvian affinities, further supports the previously hypothesised sister-group relationships between these two clades. The morphology of the parabasisphenoid and vertebral column of the new taxon is discussed in broader contexts of the patterns of evolution of these skeletal regions in ichthyosaurs.

Fluctuating but mostly oligotrophic regimes and low primary production levels were influenced by weak upwelling below the perennial oxygen minimum zone, which controlled the interplay between biosiliceous and siliciclastic deposition in the oceanic basin, with episodic oxygen deficiency. The Hangenberg Black Shale has been identified in this oceanic setting based on its characteristics described worldwide (including mercury enrichments). A tectonic uplift of the sediment source area near the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary, recorded in the distinguishing provenance signal of old continental crust, was paired with a global transgression, anoxia, and volcanic episode in an interglacial interval. Assuming paleogeographic affinity with the Bavarian facies of the Saxothuringian terrane, we interpret the allochthonous sediments as part of an accretionary prism that was gravitationally redeposited into the late orogenic basin in front of advancing Variscan nappes. The oceanic basin parental to the Bardo pelagic succession is therefore thought to represent a tract of the waning Saxothuringian Ocean in the Peri-Gondwanan paleogeographic domain that was eventually subducted beneath the Brunovistulian margin of Laurussia. The sediments of the Bardo Ocean basin also include a distal record of Famennian explosive volcanic activity that was likely related to a continental magmatic arc whose remnants are preserved as the Vrbno Group of the East Sudetes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

These unique microfossils fill the gap in the fossil record between Jurassic and Cenozoic forms, and are more similar to the former. We compare the morphology of the Mesozoic forms with the statoliths from Recent and Cenozoic decabrachians. This comparison shows the closest resemblance to the Recent Idiosepiidae. We suggest that Mesozoic cephalopod statoliths belong to the basal decabrachians and they are related to the idiosepiids. The belemnitid identity of these forms can be neither confirmed nor rejected though some positive correlation in the investigated materials between findings of belemnitid rostra and statoliths do occur. These finds support also some previous suggestions that decabrachians and vampyropods diverged earlier than in the Early Jurassic. We discuss the absence of the wing in the Mesozoic statoliths and suggest that the robustly developed spur could play a similar role to the wing in Cenozoic and Recent decabrachian statoliths. We suggest that the statolith morphology might be a useful tool to interpret cephalopod evolution. We also note an evident shift in the abundance ratio of statoliths vs fish otoliths, the former being dominant in the Jurassic while declining in abundance in the Cretaceous. This supports a Cretaceous turnover in several groups of marine organisms. © Publications scientifiques du Muséum et/and Académie des sciences, Paris."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

However, although displaying the same morphological characteristics as other species of Deltocyathus, molecular data suggested that D. magnificus was phylogenetically distant from Deltocyathidae, falling within the family Turbinoliidae instead. To elucidate the enigmatic evolutionary history of this species and skeletal microstructural features, the phylogenetic relationships of Deltocyathidae and Turbinoliidae were investigated using nuclear ultraconserved and exon loci and complete mitochondrial genomes. Both nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenomic reconstructions confirmed the position of D. magnificus within turbinolids. Furthermore, a novel mitochondrial gene order was uncovered for Deltocyathidae species. This gene order was not present in Turbinoliidae or in D. magnificus that both have the scleractinian canonical gene order, further indicating the taxonomic utility of mitochondrial gene order. D. magnificus is therefore formally moved to the family Turbinoliidae and accommodated in a new genus (Dennantotrochus Kitahara, Vaga & Stolarski, gen. nov.). Surprisingly, turbinolids and deltocyathids do not differ in microstructural organisation of the skeleton that consists of densely packed, individualised rapid accretion deposits and thickening deposits composed of fibres perpendicular to the skeleton surface. Therefore, although both families are clearly evolutionarily divergent, macromorphological features indicate a case of skeletal convergence while these may still share conservative biomineralisation mechanisms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Osteological variation across testudine clades remains poorly documented. Here, we systematically describe the humerus anatomy for all major extant turtle clades based on 38 species representing the phylogenetic and ecological diversity of crown turtles. Three Late Triassic species of shelled stem turtles (Testudindata) are included to establish the plesiomorphic humerus morphology. Our work is based on 3D models, establishing a publicly available digital database. Previously defined terms for anatomical sides of the humerus (e.g., dorsal, ventral) are often not aligned with the respective body sides in turtles and other quadrupedal animals with sprawling gait. We propose alternative anatomical directional terms to simplify communication: radial and ulnar (the sides articulating with the radius/ulna), capitular (the side bearing the humeral head), and intertubercular (opposite to capitular surface). Turtle humeri show low morphological variation with exceptions concentrated in locomotory specialists. We propose 15 discrete characters to summarize osteological variation for future phylogenetic studies. Disparity analyses comparing non-shelled and shelled turtles indicate that the presence of the shell constrains humerus variation. Flippered aquatic turtles are released from this constraint and significantly increase overall disparity. Ontogenetic changes of turtle humeri are related to increased ossification and pronunciation of the proximal processes, the distal articulation areas, and the closure of the ectepicondylar groove to a foramen. Some turtle species retain juvenile features into adulthood and provide evidence for paedomorphic evolution. We review major changes of turtle humerus morphology throughout the evolution of its stem group."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

However, a recent taxonomic revision and re-examination of the cranial osteology allowed for the assignment of five additional specimens to the taxon. Here, we analyse, describe and discuss the postcranial anatomy of Besanosaurus leptorhynchus in detail. The size of the specimens examined herein ranged from slightly more than one meter to eight meters. Overall, several diagnostic character states for this taxon are proposed, demonstrating a mosaic of plesiomorphic and derived features. This is best exemplified by the limbs, which show very rounded elements in the forelimbs, and pedal phalanges with retained rudimentary shafts. We suggest that the widely spaced phalanges in the forefins of Besanosaurus leptorhynchus were embedded in a fibrocartilage-rich connective tissue, like in modern cetaceans. We also review the similarities of Besanosaurus with Pessopteryx and Pessosaurus, allowing us to conclude that Besanosaurus is not a junior synonym of either of the two taxa. Lastly, to test the swimming capabilities of Besanosaurus leptorhynchus, we expanded on a previously published study focussing on reconstructing the swimming styles of ichthyosaurs. Besanosaurus leptorhynchus was found to possess a peculiar locomotory mode, somewhat intermediate between anguilliform swimmers, such as Cymbospondylus and Utatsusaurus, and some shastasaur-grade (e.g., Guizhouichthyosaurus) and early-diverging euichthyosaurian (e.g., Californosaurus) ichthyosaurs. Based on our results, we furthermore suggest that mixosaurids acquired their characteristic body profile (dorsal fin and forefins that are distinctly enlarged compared to the hindfins) independently and convergently to the one that later appeared in Parvipelvia. Moreover, the different swimming styles inferred for Cymbospondylus, Mixosauridae, and Besanosaurus strengthen the earlier hypothesis of niche partitioning among these three distinct ichthyosaur taxa from the Besano Formation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

However, the Triassic ichthyolith record is relatively poor, unlike that from younger time periods, what skews the published palaeontological data heavily towards skeletal materials. Our bulk collecting targeting fish microfossils from soft siliciclastics in the Cassian Fm. resulted in a collection of several ichthyoliths (i.e. bone fragments, teeth and scales) and otoliths in Picolbach, Settsass Scharte, Stuores and Misurina Skilift localities in Dolomites, Southern Calcareous Alps, Italy. We compare this micro-ichthyofauna with other such faunas and in particular with the Jurassic–Cretaceous otolith-based faunas and their Cenozoic and Recent counterparts. We argue that most of the otoliths from Picolbach belong to a variety of actinopterygians, from stem-neopterygians (most likely peltopleuriforms), to holosteans. Otoliths from Settsass Scharte are reminiscent of teleost otoliths rather than ‘palaeoniscid’ otoliths as it was suggested previously, and may therefore constitute the earliest-known occurrence of such otoliths to date. From the microfossil point of view, the Cassian Fm. fish associations were comparable to the roughly coeval skeletal associations of the late Ladinian–Carnian, and Norian age from Austria and northern Italy (e.g. Raibl, Polzberg and Bergamo Lagerstätten). We argue that Carnian (Late Triassic) Tethyan marine fish fauna was quantitatively dominated by neopterygians other than teleosts, and may represent a very early stage of teleost diversification. It seems also that Triassic Tethyan chondrichthyan fauna was limited to durophagous forms only."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

The process of fish otolith formation is biologically controlled by numerous biomacromolecules which not only affect crystal size, shape, mechanical properties, but also selection of calcium carbonate polymorph (e.g., aragonite, vaterite). The proteinaceous control over calcium carbonate polymorph selection occurs in many other species (e.g., corals, mollusks, echinoderms) but the exact mechanism of protein interactions with calcium and carbonate ions – constituents of CaCO3 – are not fully elucidated. Herein, we focus on a native Starmaker-like protein isolated from vaterite asteriscus otoliths from Cyprinus carpio. The proteomic studies show the presence of the phosphorylated protein in vaterite otoliths. In a series of in vitro mineralization experiments with Starmaker-like, we show that native phosphorylation is a crucial determinant for the selection of a crystal's polymorphic form. This is the first report showing that the switch in calcium carbonate phase depends on the phosphorylation pattern of a single isolated protein."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

The holotype possesses a peculiar combination of features, which Osmólska suggested were indicative of a primitive position among theropods that could not be resolved further. Other researchers have pointed to affinities with either derived bird-like coelurosaurs or tyrannosaurids. Here, we reanalyse all material collected by Osmólska, which reveals it to be a chimaera of multiple theropod taxa. The femur, tibiotarsus, one pedal phalanx, and most of the bones undescribed in Osmólska’s paper are identified as Caenagnathidae indet. The mandible, cervical vertebrae, pelvis, tail, and one pedal phalanx, which we consider the holotype of B. ostromi, show tyrannosaurid affinities, which are here supported by phylogenetic analyses. We find only two potentially unique diagnostic features of the Bagaraatan holotype: double surangular foramina and a horizontal ridge on the lateral surface of the postacetabular process of the ilium. Both, however, may be ontogenetically or intraspecifically variable, and thus we conclude that the holotype of B. ostromi represents an indeterminate tyrannosaurid. The small size of the holotype and its possession of many features known to characterize juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex indicate that the skeleton belongs to a juvenile, which is one of the smallest juvenile tyrannosaurids currently known."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

In other continental landmasses, however, ceratopsians were extraordinarily rare and the affinities of their proposed representatives often turned out to be inconclusive. Arguably the most significant evidence of Ceratopsia from outside North America and Asia is represented by Ajkaceratops kozmai from the Santonian (Upper Cretaceous) of Hungary. We provide a detailed osteological description of Ajkaceratops and highlight its bizarre anatomy. Ajkaceratops has been ‘traditionally’ interpreted to represent a Bagaceratops-like coronosaur, and its occurrence on the European islands was hypothesized to probably result from an early Late Cretaceous dispersal event from Asia. However, while the snout of Ajkaceratops may resemble that of some ceratopsians, closer inspection of the preserved elements indicates that these similarities are largely superficial. While it cannot be ruled out that Ajkaceratops represents a highly peculiar member of the clade, its placement is far from certain. Still, the discovery of Ajkaceratops exemplifies the importance and uniqueness of European dinosaur faunas."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","name":"Wydział Biologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc48e42085dcb1e6ae0b83e"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Throughout their evolutionary history exceeding 140 million years plesiosaurs dispersed globally, achieved substantial diversity, occupied a variety of ecological niches, and experienced multiple faunal turnovers. Of those, the Early/Middle Jurassic transition event (∼175–171 Mya) has recently became of increased interest because it apparently profoundly affected all three major lineages of plesiosaurs. Once dominant Rhomaleosauridae started to vanish, while Pliosauridae and Plesiosauroidea diversified and gave rise to several clades that flourished for tens of millions of years. Here, we report exquisite, three-dimensionally preserved skeletons of a new plesiosaur from the Lower Jurassic of Germany. Franconiasaurus brevispinus gen. et sp. nov. lived during the late Toarcian (∼175 Mya), near the onset of the Early–Middle Jurassic turnover. Franconiasaurus displays an intriguing mixture of features, combining characters almost uniformly distributed among early plesiosaurs with those typically observed in later-diverging members of the clade.

Most recently, a multi-proxy approach combining these two ratios (e.g. D'Olivo et al., 2018) and the Srsingle bondU method (DeCarlo et al., 2016) have proved to be more robust to reconstruct paleo-temperatures. To date, no study has been carried out on the application of these new approaches on the Diploastrea heliopora coral, another massive reef-building genus that can potentially provide longer temperature records. Moreover, only a few studies have assessed coral SST calibrations at the scale of the Indo-Pacific basin and compared SST reconstructions obtained from two massive coral genera from the same site.\n\nIn this study, we investigated the elemental composition of the topmost portion of 34 modern tropical Porites and 6 Diploastrea colonies collected during the Tara Pacific expedition (2016–2018) from various hydrological contexts in the Pacific Ocean. We derived and discussed annual Sr/Ca, Li/Mg, combined Sr/Ca-Li/Mg and Sr/Ca-Li/Ca-Mg/Ca and Srsingle bondU vs. SST calibrations as well as potential intra-colonial and genus specific effects and evaluated the use of these basin-wide calibration equations. Overall, multi-ratio and multi-genera SST calibrations perform better than single-ratio calibrations and seem to improve temperature reconstructions.\n\nThese new SST calibrations were applied to two colonies of Porites and Diploastrea collected from the same site in the North-West of the Palau archipelago located in the western Pacific Ocean to evaluate the applicability of universal calibrations based on different proxies and their combination. Coral-based SST records spanning the last 141 years show decadal changes and recent warming episodes that are related to major El Niño Southern Oscillation events. However, differences in reconstruction remain between both genera in the long-term trends, amplitudes, and absolute temperatures, depending on which genus or temperature proxy is considered."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Molecular fossils of methane-oxidizing prokaryotes and abundant banded botryoidal cements indicate strong fluid flux at this site. We systematically describe the fauna of this and another seep deposit previously reported from Buje. The faunal assemblages are composed of eight species, these being an unidentified solemyid protobranch bivalve, the nuculid Nucula bowerbanki?, the nuculanid Nuculana? sp., the mytilid Brachidontes? amanoi sp. nov., the two thyasirids Channelaxinus dinaricus sp. nov. and Thyasira histriaensis sp. nov., the lucinid bivalve Amanocina bujensis sp. nov., and a possible provannid gastropod. The two assemblages are of low diversity (4 and 5 species, respectively), and are dominated by chemosymbiotic species whose occurrence is largely restricted to seeps. Despite their spatial and stratigraphic proximity, the two deposits share only a single species, Channelaxinus dinaricus, probably due to different fluid flux regimes at both seeps. The Buje seep assemblages are among the very few Late Cretaceous to Palaeogene chemosynthesis-based faunal assemblages from the Tethys Ocean (the others being Late Cretaceous vent assemblages from Cyprus). From an evolutionary perspective, the Buje seep communities consist of genera with Mesozoic origins but lack Cenozoic novelties such as bathymodiolin mussels and vesicomyid clams, which are known from coeval deposits from the Pacific and dominate vents and seeps today. Thus, the Buje seep fauna support previous assertions that the Eocene Tethyan seep faunas preserved an ancient aspect, whereas evolutionary novelties arose in the Pacific."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Mixosauridae, a clade of small, early-diverging ichthyosaurs, were of particular significance for this process, being abundant predators in Middle Triassic shallow seas. Despite the abundance of well-preserved mixosaurid specimens from South China, Mixosaurus panxianensis remains the only comprehensively described species, hindering our understanding of the variability, taxonomy and diversity of mixosaurids from this re-gion. Here, we report a new species of Mixosaurus, Mixosaurus luxiensis, from Luxi County, Yunnan Province, South China. The wider postorbital skull portion differentiates the new species from Mixosaurus cornalianus and Mixosaurus kuhnschnyderi from central Europe. The non-durophagous dentition, composed of tiny piercing mesial teeth and robust but pointed distal teeth, resembles the dentition of M. cornalianus. However, the distal teeth of M. luxiensis sp. nov. are twice the size of the mesial ones, in contrast to M. cornalianus, in which the mesial and distal teeth are approximately equal in size. The forelimb exhibits a unique morphology, including a proportionally narrow radius, the presence of a peripheral notch on the ulna, and a large metacarpal V.

In contrast to the Chaohusaurus species from Chaohu, Chaohusaurus zhangjiawanensis remains poorly known, hindering our understanding of early ichthyosauriform evolution. Here, we report a new specimen of Chaohusaurus zhangjiawanensis, which provides new information on its dentition. The new specimen confirms that Chaohusaurus zhangjiawanensis had heterodont dentition consisting of pointed anterior teeth and robust, rounded posterior teeth, indicating a generalist diet. The posterior teeth of Chaohusaurus zhangjiawanensis are more robust (broader and larger) than the posterior dentition of Chaohusaurus chaoxianensis and Chaohusaurus brevifemoralis from Chaohu. This suggests differences in hard-shelled prey preference between species of Chaohusaurus from Chaohu and Nanzhang-Yuan’an, with Chaohusaurus zhangjiawanensis likely capable of feeding on harder and larger prey than Chaohusaurus brevifemoralis and Chaohusaurus chaoxianensis. In turn, this probably reflects differences in durophagous prey availability between the shallow-marine palaeoecosystem of Nanzhang-Yuan’an and the deeper, slope-basin palaeoecosystem of Chaohu. The posterior dentition and forefin of Chaohusaurus zhangjiawanensis are strikingly similar to those of Chaohusaurus geishanensis, the rarest species of Chaohusaurus from the Chaohu fauna. The scarcity of Chaohusaurus geishanensis in the Chaohu fauna, and its morphological similarity to Chaohusaurus zhangjiawanensis, possibly indicate that Chaohusaurus geishanensis was closely related with Chaohusaurus zhangjiawanensis and that it was also a shallow-marine species that was not a typical component of the Chaohu fauna. It probably occasionally wandered out into the deeper waters of Chaohu from a nearby coastal environment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Although protection is its most apparent role, the carapace and plastron are also related to many physiological functions and their shape influences hydrodynamics and self-righting ability. As such, analysing the functional morphology of the shell could help understanding the ecology of Triassic stem-turtles, which will contribute to the century-long debate on the evolutionary origins of turtles. Here, we used 3D imaging techniques to digitize the shells of two of the earliest stem-turtle taxa, Proganochelys and Proterochersis, and submitted their models to biomechanical and shape analyses. We analysed the strength performance under five predation scenarios and tested the function of two morphological traits found in stem-turtles, the epiplastral processes and an attached pelvic girdle. The latter, also present in the crown-lineage of side-necked turtles, has been suggested to increase load-bearing capacity of the shell or to improve swimming in pleurodires. Our results do not confirm the shell-strengthening hypothesis and, together with the results of our shape analyses, suggest that at least one of the first stem-turtles (Proterochersis) was an aquatic animal."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Although the oldest ascidians, or at least ascidian-like tunicates, are mid-Cambrian in age, the quality of the ascidian fossil record is extraordinarily poor. It mostly consists of isolated finds or low-diversity assemblages, often represented by mineral spicules. Our study reports the world's most diverse assemblage of ascidian spicules, originating from the Middle Miocene Bogutovo Selo near Ugljevik, Bosnia and Herzegovina. This material includes 31 spicule types, with four assignable to species (Lissoclinum cf. perforatum, Polysyncraton cf. bilobatum, Didemnum cf. vexillum and D. cf. leopardi) and 10 to genera, all belonging to aplousobranchiate ascidians. Comparing our findings with those of two other studies that use modern biological nomenclature, our assemblage shows a closer resemblance to the distant Eocene Australian assemblage than to the Miocene ascidians from Eastern Paratethys. This suggests the persistence of a once-homogeneous and widely distributed Eocene fauna into the Miocene, while the Eastern Paratethyan basin developed an endemic fauna after the isolation of Eastern Paratethys from the open sea. Some taxa of our assemblage currently inhabit the Mediterranean Sea. The discovery of one species in distant South African waters suggests that tectonic and environmental changes during the Late Miocene, including the closure of the Gibraltar Strait and prior disconnection from the Indian Ocean, may have limited its survival to remote refugia. The study underscores the importance of including spicules in reconstructing ascidian faunas in the geological past, an area that has been surprisingly understudied."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

The richly fossiliferous Cretaceous–Paleogene (Maastrichtian–Danian) boundary interval exposed in Poland provides opportunities to test the influence of burrow-generated pseudobreccia on the preservation of associated hiatal fossil concentrations. Here, we document pseudobreccia anatomy and fossil-sediment relationships by three-dimensional X-ray computed tomography imaging. In the pseudobreccia zone, we identify a distinctive assemblage of late Maastrichtian fossils, which underwent subsurface preparation by burrowers in a hitherto unreported ichno-taphonomic process.

High-throughput sequencing methods coupled with morphological analyses have facilitated revision of several scleractinian lineages, including the aforementioned family. In previous studies that relied on few mitochondrial and nuclear markers, the caryophylliid genera Stephanocyathus and Vaughanella were phylogenetically recovered in separate clades from the lineage that includes the type genus of the family, Caryophyllia, which is considered the ‘true’ Caryophylliidae. To help untangle the relationship among taxa of this family, here a new deep-sea scleractinian family (Stephanocyathidae Vaga, Cairns & Kitahara fam. nov.) is proposed based on phylogenomic reconstructions coupled with molecular features, specifically gene order, of the complete mitochondrial genome. Evolutionary reconstructions were based on both mitochondrial and nuclear ultraconserved elements (UCEs) and exon loci data sets and confirmed the divergent position of the genera Stephanocyathus and Vaughanella. The new family shows a specific gene transposition in the mitochondrial genome, not present in the ‘true’ caryophylliid lineage, but instead already observed for the species Paraconotrochus antarcticus, recovered as sister taxon of the here proposed new family. Although its phylogenetic position is unknown, the genus Ericiocyathus is also added to the new family, based on macromorphological similarities. This study represents a step forward in our understanding of deep-sea corals relationships and provide further information (e.g., mitochondrial gene order) that will aid in future efforts of assessing the systematic of caryophylliid lineages."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Assessing the relative role of those controls is essential for understanding echinoid biomineralization, taphonomy, diagenesis, and their potential as geochemical archives. In this study, we (1) contrast geochemical signatures of specimens collected across multiple taxa and environmental settings to assess in situ the effects of environmental and physiological factors on skeletal biomineralogy; and (2) analyze the nanomechanical properties of the echinoid skeleton to assess potential linkages between magnesium/calcium (Mg/Ca) ratios and skeletal nanohardness. Live specimens of sand dollars and sea biscuits (Mellita tenuis, Encope spp., Leodia sexiesperforata, and Clypeaster subdepressus) were collected from three different salinity regimes: (1) a coastal region of Cedar Key influenced by freshwater input from Suwannee River, with low and fluctuating salinity; (2) St. James Bay with less fluctuating, higher salinity; and (3) Florida Keys with stable, fully marine salinity conditions. No clear relationship was found between the bulk skeletal barium/calcium (Ba/Ca), zinc/calcium (Zn/Ca), sodium/calcium (Na/Ca), cadmium/calcium (Cd/Ca), copper/calcium (Cu/Ca), phosphorous/calcium (P/Ca), lead/calcium (Pb/Ca), boron/calcium (B/Ca), manganese/calcium (Mn/Ca) ratios pooled across all taxa. In contrast, bulk Mg/Ca, strontium/calcium (Sr/Ca), sulfur/calcium (S/Ca) and lithium/calcium (Li/Ca) ratios exhibited notable differences between the three regions, indicating that distribution of these elements can be at least partly influenced by environmental factors such as salinity. However, such patterns were highly variable across taxa and regions, indicating that both environmental and physiological factors influenced geochemical signatures to varying degrees, depending on the species and environmental setting. In addition, regardless of species identity, different types of stereom within single tests were characterized by distinct skeletal Mg/Ca ratios and nanohardness. The inner galleried and coarse labyrinthic stereom typically exhibited a lower Mg/Ca ratio and nanohardness than the outer imperforate stereom layer that locally forms tubercles. Such heterogeneity in Mg distribution within single specimens cannot be ascribed solely to environmental changes, indicating that these echinoids actively regulate their intraskeletal Mg content: the higher magnesium concentration at the tubercles relative to that of the underlying stereom may be interpreted as a strategy for enhancing their mechanical strength to withstand surface friction and wear. The results suggest that the trace element composition of echinoid tests is a complex outcome of environmental and physiological factors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

The fossilized tests were of exceptional preservation and similar to modern tests in terms of structure and crystalline organization, but had experienced partial loss of embedded organic structures, thus a priori offering fewer preferential pathways for porewaters to penetrate the tests. NanoSIMS imaging revealed that oxygen isotope exchange was pervasive in fossil tests, with isotopic exchange occurring at approximately half the rate of modern tests.

For animals that existed c.a. 500 million years ago, such as pleurocystitids, little information about their locomotion can be drawn from modern analogs and trace fossils. However, with recent advancements in simulation and soft robotics, our team was able to use the novel approach to study these extinct animals we refer to as Paleobionics. By using CT scans of fossils to design a soft robotic testbed combined with an advanced simulation, our team was able to provide an unprecedented view of a soft extinct echinoderm. We demonstrate that increased stem length seen in fossil evidence over time may have had a significant impact on the speed of this creature with little increase in energy cost. We also display that wide sweeping gaits from a biomimetic muscular stem could have pushed the animal forward on the sea bed. This approach has the ability to revolutionize understanding in evolution, biomechanics, and soft robotic locomotion."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Therefore, we provide a current overview of geological and paleontological research at the locality. Fossil marine invertebrates are the most common, and the vertebrate fossil record is represented mainly by bony fishes, sharks, and rays. Rare remains of a crocodylian and a sea turtle are newly identified. A tooth of Crocodylia indet. and a proximal fragment of a left femur of Pan-Cheloniidae indet. are described and compared within spatiotemporally co-occurring forms. The presence of a sea turtle fits well within the context of the strict marine fauna documented from Kienberg, whereas the crocodylian tooth in the marine section could imply a saltwater tolerant crocodylian species or a transport of this only crocodylian remain from more distant brackish/freshwater environment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

A transitional macrofauna-free facies marks the passage in some sections, sometimes with faint lamination. Thin section petrography, SEM-EDS analyses, and X-ray diffraction revealed a high textural and mineralogical variability between the studied sections and facies. In general, the upward facies transition is associated with a switch from massive packstone/grainstone with complex carbonate mineralogy to laminated mudstone microfacies with monomineralic, mostly dolomitic, carbonate composition. The δ13C values of all facies indicate domination of methane-derived carbon, thus demonstrating a methane-charged sedimentary setting with precipitation of authigenic carbonates induced by anaerobic oxidation of methane. The transitional and laminated facies contain several structures typical of microbial sediments, such as peloids, filamentous features, clotted micrite, fibrous cement, and frequent fenestrae; web-like structures are remnants of cyanobacterial mats and resemble Entophysalidaceae thriving at the bottom of the Messinian sea. The distinctive depositional and biotic switch (abrupt disappearance of macrofauna and planktonic foraminifera, predominance of dolomite over calcite, absence of aragonite, presence of horizontal lamination) reflects important environmental changes taking place in the basin. The rise of δ18O from the massive, through transitional, to the laminated facies suggests either a drop of bottom-water temperature or an increase of salinity. Nevertheless, other paleoenvironmental changes must have co-occurred in order to account for the dramatic facies shift observed. We hypothesize that this change could reflect the development of water-column stratification with respect to both salinity and oxygen concentration shortly before the Messinian Salinity Crisis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

In this contribution we compare and ­discuss members of three extinct families previously proposed as possible neogastropod stem groups, i.e., Maturifusidae Gründel, 2001, Pseudotritoniidae Golikov & Starobogatov, 1987, and Purpurinidae Zittel, 1895. Their morphological characteristics, especially the differences in protoconch morphology, strongly suggest that they should all be considered as separate clades. The taxonomic status and the composition of each family is here reviewed and accordingly revised. Angularia kittli n. sp. is introduced from the Carnian (Late Triassic) of the St. Cassian Formation (Italy). It differs from its congeners in having a more pronounced axial ornamentation, which makes it similar to Fossacerithium Gerasimov, 1992 from the Jurassic. However, the protoconch of the new species is unknown and therefore its taxonomic position is tentative. An evolutionary lineage from the oldest known purpurinid species of genera Khetella Beisel, 1977 and Cretadmete Blagovetshenskiy & Shumilkin, 2006 to the recent tonnoids is proposed. We conclude that in the Jurassic, purpurinids were divided into two groups. One of them, represented by Khetella, could be considered as the ancestor of Tonnoidea, while the other, represented by Fossacerithium, can be interpreted as the ancestor of Neogastropoda. Maturifusidae most likely went extinct without direct descendants.

Some topological stability is inferred near the basal divergence of Iguanodontia, though the ingroup relationships remain unclear. For instance, Rhabdodontidae, a clade of Late Cretaceous European ornithopods ‘traditionally’ considered to include eight to nine species, presents significant taxonomic challenges. We explore the diversity and disparity of European Rhabdodon-lineage iguanodontians. We assembled a novel dataset comprising morphological and morphometric data obtained from rhabdodontomorph dentaries, which are abundant, well-preserved in the majority of the taxa, and distinctive. Special attention is given to Rhabdodon septimanicus, a poorly known taxon from the upper Campanian to lower Maastrichtian of southern France, established based on a particularly robust dentary bone that has been subjected to conflicting taxonomic interpretations. Our restudy of the specimen, combined with a multivariate and phylogenetic assessment, shows that this taxon is a clear morphological outlier among European rhabdodontomorphs, providing a basis for its assignment to a new genus, Obelignathus. Although further large-scale studies, especially detailed osteological descriptions, are needed to clarify the taxonomic significance of certain European rhabdodontomorphs, our results indicate that the group exhibits greater diversity than currently recognized, with several sympatric taxa co-occurring, at least in southern France and possibly also in Romania."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

Our study supports thevalidity of the plesiosauroid taxon Plesiopterys wildi, which was considered ajunior synonym of Seeleyosaurus in a previous joint assessment of the taxa.Our phylogenetic evaluation places S. guilelmiimperatoris among Microcleidi-dae, in congruence with previous studies. However, in contrast to earlier phy-logenetic reconstructions, our analyses, which take into account numerouschanges to the character matrix, reconstruct S. guilelmiimperatoris as fallingwithin the Microcleidus clade.

Subsequently, these species had been assigned to various cypraeid genera. Examination of the type material of Cypraea tithonica reveals that this species represents a new genus: Coffeacypraea Nützel & Schneider. Cypraea gemmellaroi also belongs to this new genus and is potentially synonymous with Coffeacypraea tithonica. The Upper Jurassic caenogastropod genera Colombellina and Zittelia (family Colombellinidae) also have narrowly elongated siphonate apertures and are closely related to Cypraeidae but their shells are not convolute.
