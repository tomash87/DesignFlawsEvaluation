It was found that incompatibility between the crossed genotypes manifests itself at various stages of hybridization – from flower pollination and fruit setting to the growth of the hybrid seedlings obtained. In the interspecific hybridization Japanese plum × apricot, fruit setting is more dependent on the Japanese plum genotype as the maternal form than on the apricot genotype as the pollen donor. Post-zygotic crossability barriers have the effect that a large number of obtained fruit contain an underdeveloped seed. Seed germination capacity and viability of the obtained hybrid seedlings depend on the interaction of the crossed parental forms. The Japanese plums ‘Trumlar’ and D 17–73 are useful maternal forms for obtaining hybrid seedlings of Japanese plum × apricot as well as Japanese plum × myrobalan plum. The use of the myrobalan plum ‘Amelia’ as the maternal parent allows obtaining hybrid seedlings of myrobalan plum × apricot. The results showed that by using these genotypes in traditional distant hybridization it is possible to obtain more hybrids of Japanese plum × apricot, Japanese plum × myrobalan plum, and also myrobalan plum × apricot than by using the other genotypes tested in the study."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928f878c28a047397e96","5e709295878c28a04739871c","5e709401878c28a0473b4c1e"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"146","pagesFromTo":"624-633","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709401878c28a0473b4c1e","61c040f52467f064509b85f4","5e70928f878c28a047397e96","5e709295878c28a04739871c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454797cb","mniswId":"18733","title":"South African Journal of Botany","issn":"0254-6299","eissn":"1727-9321","documentHash":"0092fce4-ea29-412f-a8bf-7ba2121c9d13"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61c040f52467f064509b8604","year":"2022","volume":"146","documentHash":"36120b77-8efa-44dd-b3f8-ca7822ee1762"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Apricot","Distant crossing","Fruit breeding","Japanese plum","Myrobalan plum"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747057444170"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61c9bbd62467f00f2d5c5e2c","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Kowalska","documentHash":"6bae4a9b-cede-4a72-8aac-b6ec561d4b39"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Marasek-Ciołakowska","uuid":"6FAB3AE6D9EBCFA4FD26AA8B3CD63FA73B99A6498DEF6A1770D2A9643E68A306803F24C467726C9A84745750C9B2D96EDD4F279404023C905B13853E9A49233F","orcidId":"0000-0001-9349-2566","documentHash":"1c86d2dd-6830-448a-8df1-57210e29a74d"},{"objectId":"5e7093fd878c28a0473b476f","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Starzycka-Korbas","uuid":"694B914F896F9BC0F760F24A28FBB351927B85DEACB50FFF25CBCF9A6ABF08653F0EB9C74551120829AF098CE5DC62E314EAA6E92FB662EBB441C016743477AE","orcidId":"0000-0002-3590-2958","documentHash":"cf3dd5c7-b7b2-4c8c-9dd6-46d45184b020"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a9be","name":"Michał","lastName":"Starzycki","uuid":"A12DA593ABE888BFBD5C8C61609DF1E3184DB843AB1EB1FBCD83AA9717A0675937E9D2A6439F3CC581770D292FFCB24556975344792027776F0C94F09F896708","orcidId":"0000-0002-5532-0955","documentHash":"aa589753-276a-47cd-b527-63dd151028c1"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398339","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Podwyszyńska","uuid":"B2F52BE0F8A5B79B13A48C312966FAF67C57B8B98C867157CF8141B8D7208AF78325A4F99008EDCBA6781E8BB00736EC29CC4B6CD7950AC77678B349D9B9CC47","orcidId":"0000-0003-3005-4053","documentHash":"685f5ee6-b147-4b3e-b614-46c6ff16b171"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a047397975","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kamiński","uuid":"E9F44EC1380F12AD1DE04ECB73794FF24275BC44AD3C6BF4680147EB45EF8116C31A19B53EBB4F957595F3EB7E997B4461AD0DD5ED77A6B4C1E265925A237CC3","orcidId":"0000-0002-6954-6197","documentHash":"c53c2a2c-1797-4d68-826c-ea9a403e3051"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"61c9bbd52467f00f2d5c5e27","doi":"10.3390/agronomy12010026","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/1/26/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Effect of Meiotic Polyploidisation on Selected Morphological and Anatomical Traits in Interspecific Hybrids of Brassica oleracea × B. napus","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In Brassica, interspecific hybridisation plays an important role in the formation of allopolyploid cultivars. In this study, the ploidy of F1 and F2 generations resulting from interspecific hybridisation between B. oleracea inbred lines of head cabbage (B. oleracea L. var. capitata) (2n = 18) and kale (B. oleracea L. var. acephala) (2n = 18) with inbred lines of rapeseed (B. napus L.) (2n = 38) was examined by flow cytometry analysis and chromosome observation. Furthermore, the effect of meiotic polyploidisation on selected phenotypic and anatomical traits was assessed. The F1 hybrids of head cabbage × rapeseed (S3) and kale × rapeseed crosses (S20) were allotriploids with 2n = 28 chromosomes, and nuclear DNA amounts of 1.97 (S3) and 1.99 pg (S20). These values were intermediate between B. oleracea and B. napus. In interspecific hybrids of the F2 generation, which were derived after self-pollination of F1 hybrids (FS3, FS20) or by open crosses between F1 generation hybrids (FC320, FC230), the chromosome numbers were similar 2n = 56 or 2n = 55, whereas the genome sizes varied between 3.81 (FS20) and 3.95 pg 2C (FC230). Allohexaploid F2 hybrids had many superior agronomic traits compared to parental B. napus and B. oleracea lines and triploid F1 hybrids. In the generative stage, they were characterised by larger flowers and flower elements, such as anthers and lateral nectaries. F2 hybrids were male and female fertile. The pollen viability of F2 hybrids was comparable to parental genotypes and varied from 75.38% (FS3) to 88.24% (FC320), whereas in triploids of F1 hybrids only 6.76% (S3) and 13.46% (S20) of pollen grains were fertile. Interspecific hybrids of the F2 generation derived by open crosses between plants of the F1 generation (FC320, FC230) had a better ability to set seed than F2 hybrids generated from the self-pollination of F1 hybrids. In the vegetative stage, F2 plants had bigger and thicker leaves, larger stomata, and significantly thicker layers of palisade and spongy mesophyll than triploids of the F1 generation and parental lines of B. oleracea and B. napus. The allohexaploid F2 hybrids analysed in this study can be used as innovative germplasm resources for further breeding new vegetable Brassica crops at the hexaploid level."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","5e70928b878c28a047397975","5e709292878c28a047398339"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"26","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","5e70928b878c28a047397975","5e709292878c28a047398339","61c9bbd62467f00f2d5c5e2c","5e7092ae878c28a04739a9be","5e7093fd878c28a0473b476f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d9","mniswId":"689","title":"Agronomy","issn":"2073-4395","eissn":"2073-4395","documentHash":"f748c34e-fa45-428e-abf2-7624cc5986fd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61c421832467f0264d189e80","year":"2021","volume":"12","number":"1","documentHash":"f1afdd90-928f-4bf9-95eb-20b7eaeb9f2a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["B. oleracea × B. napus","anatomy","flow cytometry","interspecific crosses","phenotype evaluation","polyploidy breeding","phenotypic variation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747057709475"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61cc1f912467f06e5d34888b","name":"Marian","lastName":"Saniewski","documentHash":"a18baf60-c71c-4a64-9216-492c8299b626"},{"objectId":"61cc1f912467f06e5d34888a","name":"Junichi","lastName":"Ueda","documentHash":"d5b8f247-8dcc-4ad3-9ec7-806293802248"},{"objectId":"61cc1f912467f06e5d348889","name":"Kensuke","lastName":"Miyamoto","documentHash":"cee766c8-3204-4f33-9d9a-7732af34cdba"},{"objectId":"5ee98cd57523404d1000e9f7","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Szablińska-Piernik","uuid":"4D81EC5A28E701B2C846D6498DB17288CDD5D85E40EEE36021BF203B2D57DE58A4A5C04B3EC84E6576941F247978A22642037F1E66F9A9BE423DBCEA842281A9","orcidId":"0000-0003-0265-940X","documentHash":"05d413dc-1d13-40f3-81b9-b591c4a6fbf8"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4af1","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Góraj-Koniarska","uuid":"9FC40A1F1A091811F5417DDDC0A27F9D6E4A7EBB7061A55729BDF382AC1C4764ACC6D5ECDCECC86E5F3AF92A60C7C453705F203CC84916CE364E17F25BA5DC27","orcidId":"0000-0001-7667-0279","documentHash":"2201bd21-407f-41c6-b322-bf2d514266ed"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390822","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Horbowicz","uuid":"607EF236052A333800DE056FB5A49C78E0BD32EA3C4E508F9FB7ED235589344FC6C4F33BB9310E91A5B461AF27BB59D282084C55F508C78931D9721F2D7A9019","orcidId":"0000-0002-1789-4034","documentHash":"49a74256-9b3b-4181-8fc7-f7c0367507c3"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"61cc1f912467f06e5d348884","doi":"10.3390/ijms23010266","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/1/266/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Changes in Polar Metabolites Content during Natural and Methyl-Jasmonate-Promoted Senescence of Ginkgo biloba Leaves","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The present study clarified changes in the contents of polar metabolites (amino acids, organic acids, saccharides, cyclitols, and phosphoric acid) in leaf senescence in Ginkgo biloba with or without the application of methyl jasmonate (JA-Me) in comparison with those in naturally senescent leaf blades and petioles. The contents of most amino acids and citric and malic acids were significantly higher in abaxially, and that of myo-inositol was lower in abaxially JA-Me-treated leaves than in adaxially JA-Me-treated and naturally senescent leaves. The levels of succinic and fumaric acids in leaves treated adaxially substantially high, but not in naturally senescent leaves. In contrast, sucrose, glucose, and fructose contents were much lower in leaf blades and petioles treated abaxially with JA-Me than those treated adaxially. The levels of these saccharides were also lower compared with those in naturally senescent leaves. Shikimic acid and quinic acid were present at high levels in leaf blades and petioles of G. biloba. In leaves naturally senescent, their levels were higher compared to green leaves. The shikimic acid content was also higher in the organs of naturally yellow leaves than in those treated with JA-Me.

However, the minimum cost, maximum income, environmental pollution protection and the ability to save water and energy are all factors that should be taken into account in this process. The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in agriculture to meet all of these criteria serves the purpose of precision agriculture. As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can easily obtain real-time data, they have a great potential to address and optimize solutions to the problems faced by agriculture. Despite some limitations, such as the battery, load, weather conditions, etc., UAVs will be used frequently in agriculture in the future because of the valuable data that they obtain and their efficient applications. According to the known literature, UAVs have been carrying out tasks such as spraying, monitoring, yield estimation, weed detection, etc. In recent years, articles related to agricultural UAVs have been presented in journals with high impact factors. Most precision agriculture applications with UAVs occur in outdoor environments where GPS access is available, which provides more reliable control of the UAV in both manual and autonomous flights. On the other hand, there are almost no UAV-based applications in greenhouses where all-season crop production is available. This paper emphasizes this deficiency and provides a comprehensive review of the use of UAVs for agricultural tasks and highlights the importance of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for a UAV solution in the greenhouse."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1047","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61f0f8772467f06d26f0fc7e","61f0f8772467f06d26f0fc7f","61f0f8772467f06d26f0fc81","5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","61f0f8772467f06d26f0fc83"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences-Basel","issn":"2076-3417","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"01301afc-a0dc-4e98-8fba-0ab08483b798"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["indoor and outdoor environments","greenhouse","precision agriculture","SLAM","UAV"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058042399"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61f27aeb2467f039a444c878","name":"Przemysław Piotr","lastName":"Tomczyk","orcidId":"0000-0003-4175-0185","documentHash":"9d8527d5-9a2b-407a-9e74-e0a09a0fa33a"},{"objectId":"60c33b509543c72336544174","name":"Monika","lastName":"Marat","documentHash":"ba2ad016-f6d9-4755-b8ce-62cd4ffbb3e3"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bdde0","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"97CA3174080827A6B0A0270F12F022527EAC69DEAF9A298A7090DB405A36D9BD3C5300A23E15C79339219E9F5C5A610F383406AAEF43CA7180E096A8773B797B","orcidId":"0000-0001-7802-9733","documentHash":"5b2d0c7c-4406-469f-b682-f04386f8910b"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b81d3","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"15C84D361E7F90D4BC9678770A73D2603CAF45B8230680F4C3B3F1A7800752AE280D80EC1A108C0FE59CC58F62B268FE75D4405BA63AC5570743AB59944C41E5","orcidId":"0000-0002-3556-8080","documentHash":"88d10266-fa30-4cda-bfba-7401a9772c60"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Marasek-Ciołakowska","uuid":"6FAB3AE6D9EBCFA4FD26AA8B3CD63FA73B99A6498DEF6A1770D2A9643E68A306803F24C467726C9A84745750C9B2D96EDD4F279404023C905B13853E9A49233F","orcidId":"0000-0001-9349-2566","documentHash":"1c86d2dd-6830-448a-8df1-57210e29a74d"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4ac2","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Filipczak","uuid":"DF80C8D8C9ED74592E363265B540B7F6688E313F2B526E6A0B1400A2396075F5E7678E22E83DB844F28B3084237514161976A58528C98FD3894685E54323E1B8","orcidId":"0000-0002-7309-8526","documentHash":"4bcc2c59-0a77-4152-8e46-26dd6aaa0346"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a0473986e0","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Treder","uuid":"CA809C02520EED47C9A82056AF627806F94D6BB9721D9DB8BB14025A6684CE9FE71CFD1C9D18ECE0B1A2610D5554D573E7368A857C8E508CD75D20E6A051643E","orcidId":"0000-0003-1640-9671","documentHash":"c6034984-8a2c-4af0-ae6a-63868a0ca950"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398339","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Podwyszyńska","uuid":"B2F52BE0F8A5B79B13A48C312966FAF67C57B8B98C867157CF8141B8D7208AF78325A4F99008EDCBA6781E8BB00736EC29CC4B6CD7950AC77678B349D9B9CC47","orcidId":"0000-0003-3005-4053","documentHash":"685f5ee6-b147-4b3e-b614-46c6ff16b171"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a0473979a2","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Klamkowski","uuid":"7E450B39DF810DB41FC8F651E1A7E17AD750C7E9A422D49912DC393B84655FBED245B386CD93F921C9DE3C513917FBB447B953F71C4C91C5B479A20AFAD3CB05","orcidId":"0000-0003-0358-3726","documentHash":"cbebff37-3723-4ee6-9d6e-43c807f2539a"},{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a0473976f9","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Buler","uuid":"CC6580B632FD24939F8B679B94B5B7904887E80507B6B280BCC1CBF56A2244D049AA807FEEFE0A132CDFE055DFE2C2C58982798684B917C4B8B00FF69ABF352B","orcidId":"0000-0003-4111-5501","documentHash":"e2a88ca3-b5ca-4580-9769-1f25c8f2628c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-10","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"61f27aeb2467f039a444c870","doi":"10.3390/agronomy12010161","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/1/161/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Apple Autotetraploids—Phenotypic Characterisation and Response to Drought Stress","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Polyploidization is an important source of variability for plant breeding. Polyploids are often characterised by increased resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Since drought and pathogen attack are the main threats to apple cultivation, obtaining new sources of resistance is an important issue for apple breeding. The newly obtained autotetraploid clones of apple cv. ‘Redchief’ showed superior resistance to fire blight. The aim of the presented research was the in-depth phenotypic characterisation of ‘Redchief’ tetraploids and assessment of their response to drought at the physiological and genetic level. The growth of own-rooted five-year-old trees of ‘Redchief’ tetraploids was poor compared with diploids; all growth parameters—the number and length of current season shoots, the total length of current season shoots per tree and the cross-section area of the trunk—were reduced in tetraploid clones. Grafting on M9 rootstock improved the growth characteristics of ‘Redchief’ tetraploids. Compared with diploid plants, the leaves of tetraploids were thicker, with altered shape, higher chlorophyll content, and larger stomata, but the stomatal density decreased. The leaf anatomical structure of tetraploids was changed, the adaxial and abaxial epidermis and both types of mesophyll were significantly thicker than in diploids. Moreover, the pollen grains of tetraploids were larger, but their viability and germination were reduced. Under conditions of limited water supply, the reduction in growth parameters was smaller and the physiological parameters were higher in the ‘Redchief’ tetraploid clone 4x-25 than in diploid plants. The expression of APX gene was higher in tetraploids than in diploids 15 days after drought stress induction. The results suggest the enhanced drought tolerance of the studied ‘Redchief’ autotetraploid clone compared with its diploid counterpart."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","5e70928b878c28a0473979a2","5e709434878c28a0473b81d3","60c33b509543c72336544174","5e709295878c28a0473986e0","5e709292878c28a047398339","5e709288878c28a0473976f9","5e709479878c28a0473bdde0","5e709400878c28a0473b4ac2"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"161","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709434878c28a0473b81d3","60c33b509543c72336544174","5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","5e70928b878c28a0473979a2","5e709288878c28a0473976f9","5e709292878c28a047398339","61f27aeb2467f039a444c878","5e709295878c28a0473986e0","5e709400878c28a0473b4ac2","5e709479878c28a0473bdde0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d9","mniswId":"689","title":"Agronomy","issn":"2073-4395","eissn":"2073-4395","documentHash":"f748c34e-fa45-428e-abf2-7624cc5986fd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61d431cf2467f0627d077fec","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"1","documentHash":"f75e7399-5df9-48a8-bced-9ecdfd23d8d2"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["apple","autotetraploid","phenotypic characteristics","drought tolerance"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058047936"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473be973","name":"Agata","lastName":"Gryta","uuid":"7A599A80898846E39A0928AFF148C0109204A33487D92C4474CD7E87542DC8C541574E6A8030D21A9FCE8D3F5EFBD911BFA7F4F7B3DF41AE3A1A60AF6D108F45","orcidId":"0000-0002-6880-3112","documentHash":"b3ff6975-710e-48a7-8cf5-bcfb9951a144"},{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b423b","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Frąc","uuid":"DB7317F3078EAE2173CC896E4BA6E90BB0A524CBBF87F4FD301CCE20C9BABA9C9A82075C72E316FC40712199000F8AC2D5940BF7D278C98AA695622BAAE8AE31","orcidId":"0000-0001-9437-3139","documentHash":"9e52e582-5b2c-4d87-af08-89b425ea9091"},{"objectId":"5e7093de878c28a0473b23af","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Mącik","uuid":"580AB022EB4C8FC9B4E6034F7E9516070D814F47AB06ACD18FAA88FEEC73F85FA774165563825430AA52FE26E80A94DCA7E0DFF808F6C5C60D64005637C5458C","orcidId":"0000-0002-1585-4776","documentHash":"6b44c6ae-4a47-42cb-a2aa-625fe2b7adaf"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398362","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Sas-Paszt","uuid":"F65BF0798F03691C5ACA3C2A1EA4E5FD87ED5CB37729DF32BC5DB47710F0EBA374AA8CB082C6E75E322B257742E90231A958EB8FE9204AC6F2B651D5DF6471FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-4076-4032","documentHash":"c4b1b795-a964-4309-87da-3ec6e5c5aacd"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"61e959dc2467f0651ffddee2","doi":"10.1002/ldr.4179","publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ldr.4179","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Composition, activity and diversity of bacterial and fungal communities responses to inputs of phosphorus fertilizer enriched with beneficial microbes in Brunic Arenosol degraded soil","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Anthropogenic-induced deterioration of soil health remains a global problem, resulting in a diminished productivity of agroecosystems. In order to improve soil quality, we investigated the impact of phosphorus biofertilizer on the microbiological parameters of soil (type Brunic Arenosol) degraded as a result of inappropriate cultivation and fertilization, characterized by low pH and decrease in K and Mg content. Two-year field experiment included control treatment (FC) without microbial enrichment and FA100 and FA60 treatments containing beneficial microorganisms. The results showed that the biofertilizer enhanced soil enzymatic activity (as expressed by the increased activities of urease, protease, acid phosphomonoesterase and β-glucosidase), increased number of operational taxonomic units associated with metabolic processes (including phosphorus related pathways and degradation of xenobiotics), improved crop yield, increased bacterial diversity and changed the quantity of phytoavailable phosphorus in the soil. Biofertilizer also stimulated the occurrence of plant growth promoting microorganisms involved in phosphorus biotransformations, decomposition of organic matter, nitrogen fixation and protection plants against pathogens. NGS and BiologTM analyses showed that the composition of soil microbiome was affected also by soil sampling time, suggesting seasonal variations in the preferred carbon sources and level of C-substrates utilization and pointing the differences in the relative abundance of individual microbial groups at particular stages of the experiment. Taking into consideration the improvement of microbiological indicators of soil health, phosphorus biofertilizer seems to be effective approach to implement in sustainable agriculture linking soil microbiome quality with the general soil condition."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Bakterie takie dysponują mechanizmami, które umożliwiają bezpośrednie i/lub pośrednie ograniczanie sprawców chorób, wykazując wobec nich aktywność antagonistyczną, a możliwie także indukując odporność roślin na porażenie. Ich zastosowanie w praktyce wymaga jednak przeprowadzenia szczegółowych badań, bowiem nawet te same szczepy mogą korzystnie oddziaływać na rośliny, a jednocześnie stanowić różnego rodzaju zagrożenia.

The mixture of beneficial soil fungi contained two species: Aspergillus niger and Purpureocillium lilacinum. The mixture of beneficial bacteria contained three strains of Bacillus (Bacillus sp., Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Paenibacillus polymyxa). The analysis of mineral content and leaf greenness (SPAD index) was performed on the samples collected from the trees in August. The lack of mineral fertilization caused a significant decrease in the nitrogen content of apple leaves, which resulted in their lighter color (lower SPAD index). The application of filamentous fungi or bacterial strains had a modifying effect on the mineral composition of apple leaves, what became evident especially in the third year of the study. An increase in the concentration of nitrogen, calcium, magnesium, sulphur and most microelements (except for boron) was found as a result of the influence of tree mineral fertilization and microorganisms applied to the soil. In the absence of mineral fertilization of the trees, the applied microbial inocula resulted in the significant increase of concentration of most macro- and microelements in the leaf tissue (except for magnesium and boron)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397d85","5e70928b878c28a0473979a2","5e709295878c28a0473986e0","5e709292878c28a047398362","5e709479878c28a0473bdde0","5e709400878c28a0473b4a21"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"297","pagesFromTo":"110975","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709295878c28a0473986e0","5e70928b878c28a0473979a2","5e709400878c28a0473b4a21","5e709292878c28a047398362","6220b1362467f004a5a7dbc0","5e70928e878c28a047397d85","5e709479878c28a0473bdde0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b4","mniswId":"18258","title":"SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE","issn":"0304-4238","eissn":"1879-1018","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"2a554406-91f1-426c-8e10-e67b2e56031a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6220b1372467f004a5a7dbc4","year":"2022","volume":"297","documentHash":"65c3d34e-b6b5-497c-8dd6-77c856cc8abf"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fertilization","Beneficial microorganisms","Leaf greenness","Malus domestica"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058074065"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6220c7952467f004a5a85456","name":"Monika","lastName":"Niedzińska","documentHash":"523c6edd-07b2-49b3-a443-2b9d1eb5ee16"},{"objectId":"602e509d9543c7410626f0b7","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Łaźny","uuid":"5179453DE13F8A30B17B7CCB92D133CA37285EE827710BE963D4B9EC35AA9F20E4984FACD278DFED2C2792FECD5A9AF8C9D23963CC919503BA5543AD9B21E35A","orcidId":"0000-0001-5922-8016","documentHash":"a02b7918-4066-4d89-b859-0eb6d82cba88"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397f69","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"9E538886BAEC63D822291227462DC5326050A9D565F74EE2E32A6843C2F96B70C99B1D2881EF31E6974EAE0A6A97C1906FBC6D71B47EC440D61916F795BADDB5","orcidId":"0000-0002-5962-936X","documentHash":"95877ed5-692d-4970-9e1d-6384aba950fc"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d85","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"3897AF5C7E4FAAF35F404A9BC0F9A8CC22B535BAEF573567F51A2A1A784D9620935E656E73521A53CD02CED856407343E2833BC3E064485F8738EE7724777E10","orcidId":"0000-0002-1473-9207","documentHash":"93393335-9114-4927-8bda-c788c468a09e"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923b7","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Mirgos","uuid":"DECA988361EA69CF7C50F6DD6DC4DBBAFBD4F3B6BD64C009708BE59FAA9720C7AAEB72EF30BBA5AE5EE16A4291F98677DADC939A6C119F709EB4E359DEC518A3","orcidId":"0000-0003-2940-7771","documentHash":"eb666088-7a98-4cb9-99aa-1aeab6536153"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923b0","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"5E24C8B8B82DF92592988E62BA167E1795C7030CAA13FBF43C8E3E309E47D2B063B2A06E7D1E473EB259EC2EA2D331879136BA5359B07A5F51FFFD5960C5042F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5282-7331","documentHash":"6d722aee-6cf4-4a44-abc1-e7b73aedf070"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a047392360","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Przybył","uuid":"916B830365DBE2ACC0F901844157A461A9EC440885E084CEC646E87D58AB1DDE59E325561362273D6B2B01F78E259A5B0FF966BA0A733A2DEEFA1B6D70E8068A","orcidId":"0000-0003-0959-184X","documentHash":"172369e8-7957-4c4b-ba60-e93aa185365a"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a04739235e","name":"Janina","lastName":"Gajc-Wolska","uuid":"0B5E2326A0561B418D8D4A7D2B65BDF17E21FC131E2F6F649B8381CCF8263C0A7A87C0003711CD0A9049BCEDF2DFB6D847C77C725C765F9C251FB130C60F212A","orcidId":"0000-0003-4237-5575","documentHash":"d6286f62-1a01-4ee9-b07d-dfdd41c12ebb"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a047392225","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Kalisz","uuid":"8E22C4561261C3FD5F8351CC0C4A6E15A7F4F62D6E6AD8C0D42C8A507AEA55944C38947F307F248C58A4BFB96C88F7D87400F06A7FA2736124B424ADE3EC3101","orcidId":"0000-0001-7592-2470","documentHash":"4ffb4552-ecf5-4159-9ba7-cbaa806bef1d"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-28","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6220c7952467f004a5a85451","doi":"10.3390/agronomy12030608","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/3/608","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Lignite substrate and EC modulates positive eustress in cucumber at hydroponic cultivation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Hydroponic cultivation using organic, fully biodegradable substrates that provide the right physical properties for plant growth and development is now the future of soilless production. Despite the high productivity and strict control of production conditions in this method, excessive salinity of the substrate often occurs. However, recent research results indicate that salinity at a high enough threshold can improve yield quality, while prolonged exposure to too high EC, or exceeding the safe EC threshold for a given species, leads to reduced quality and reduced or even no yield. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of biodegradable lignite substrate (L) and eustressor in the form of high EC nutrient solution (7.0 dS·m−1) on morphological and physiological parameters, as well as the quality and yield of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) in hydroponic cultivation compared to the mineral wool substrate (MW). The MW/high EC combination showed a significant reduction in shoot diameter by nearly 6% compared to the MW/control EC combination. The stomatal conductance (gs) and the transpiration rate (E) were also significantly reduced in this combination. The present study indicates that the effects of eustressor application vary depending on the growing medium used, and more favorable effects in terms of yield quality were obtained using biodegradable lignite substrate. The high EC of nutrient solution combined with lignite substrate (L/high EC) significantly increased in cucumber fruit the content of β-carotene, lutein, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and the sum of chlorophyll a + b by 33.3%, 40%, 28.6%, 26.3% and 26.7%, respectively, as compared to MW/high EC combination."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397d85","5e70928f878c28a047397f69"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"608","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602e509d9543c7410626f0b7","5e70923d878c28a0473923b7","5e70923d878c28a047392360","6220c7952467f004a5a85456","5e70923d878c28a04739235e","5e70928e878c28a047397d85","5e70928f878c28a047397f69","5e70923b878c28a047392225","5e70923d878c28a0473923b0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d9","mniswId":"689","title":"Agronomy","issn":"2073-4395","eissn":"2073-4395","documentHash":"f748c34e-fa45-428e-abf2-7624cc5986fd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"621de6a72467f06798e1658c","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"3","documentHash":"791f6fee-b3db-49ee-bc68-ae9bd65e5552"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["organic substrate","eustress","photosynthetic pigment","photosynthetic efficiency","chlorophyll fluorescence","bioactive compounds"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058074121"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"602cb8d09543c7410626e252","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Belcar","uuid":"D5AC78AC0A3F3ADC421ACAA96100F5238CC58BC191ED65F55CAFEBB6F4786449BBD60F67B5B128D8D22794BBD6C84AAF2753D40BC57DB3D618F246DED583B2DC","documentHash":"849a9a87-3ef7-4297-bd2f-d6aeaebb9dec"},{"objectId":"5e70948d878c28a0473bf720","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Michałowska","uuid":"3C86BF221054E0DA638132A262E735B5FE3D56538D97B5BC92E3042316086870CA18020EAA276AC6A2A538830016D8E26EE844D701125EDD06FBC2F5D0ADFFF7","orcidId":"0000-0003-0417-000X","documentHash":"627d10e0-4032-442e-8eb0-5930e9018c10"},{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fbcf","name":"Ireneusz","lastName":"Kapusta","uuid":"6DAB645BDC2EBEE02DD000181F5F143BD9D7E0423ACCC8A800CA763AD09A0FEA916CE715E99056C761B940E21E587089ED03A23C4A9765611BE7A70B5ED64E47","orcidId":"0000-0002-1197-2361","documentHash":"a4c18afe-c217-4921-96ed-6e1885929b72"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fa6b","name":"Józef","lastName":"Gorzelany","uuid":"01AA9F188746F416312B40F1C61903D0DB1C4144CC8069253446F7F2341E4B3F345DAE0168357303756732B094D322130D378DF3447DFA99AB9A93B0B44ED399","orcidId":"0000-0002-1028-097X","documentHash":"8b812766-eba4-4169-880a-e829b2876f5f"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e669","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Pluta","uuid":"A389F119DF07BF98605FE425265C9D7AAFC056C945E0F9E7F5B4B226B0057BD6E8D3D999781461C4DD166DE67E1F1EED446BB62F6F662DA5A98F3DB3747DFCD6","orcidId":"0000-0003-2837-7304","documentHash":"c4cc3f4e-bb2b-4925-be1d-b7e627597a4a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-18","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6239c6c82467f009d300126a","doi":"10.3390/molecules27061976","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/6/1976/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Effect of Ozone-Treated or Untreated Saskatoon Fruits (Amelanchier alnifolia Nutt.)

By treating Saskatoon fruits with gaseous ozone, and adding the material as an enhancer to barley beers, it is possible to impact the contents of bioactive compounds in the produced fruit beers. Sensory tests showed that beers made from barley with addition of Saskatoon fruit of the ‘Smoky’ cultivar were characterised by the most balanced taste and aroma. Physicochemical analyses of fruit beers, produced with Saskatoon fruit pulp added on the seventh day of fermentation, showed that the beers enhanced with ozone-treated and untreated ‘Smoky’ Saskatoon fruits had the highest contents of alcohol, 5.51% v/v and 5.66% v/v, respectively, as well as total polyphenol contents of 395 mg GAE/L and 401 mg GAE/L, respectively, and higher antioxidant activity (assessed using DPPH•, FRAP and ABTS+• assays). It was demonstrated that the ozonation process led to a decrease in the contents of neochlorogenic acid, on average by 91.00%, and of caffeic acid by 20.62%, relative to the beers enhanced with ‘Smoky’ Saskatoon fruits not subjected to ozone treatment. The present study shows that Saskatoon fruits can be used in the production of beer, and the Canadian cultivar ‘Smoky’ is recommended for this purpose."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709200878c28a04738e669"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709217878c28a04738fbcf","5e709214878c28a04738fa6b","602cb8d09543c7410626e252"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a04738564a","uid":"beGpESG6icEeopJ3VnMkvIw","uuid":"0e8f33a2-7d2c-4765-a697-b104163eb1ac","name":"Instytut Biotechnologii Przemysłu Rolno-Spożywczego im. prof.

Until now its presence in elm trees in Poland has not been detected. In 2017–2018, during visual inspection of elm trees grown in four areas of southern Silesia Province leaf yellowing, shoot proliferation, phloem necrosis and dieback of branches were observed on European field elm trees grown in nature reserve close to the border with the Czech Republic. Phloem tissue from shoots collected from six symptomatic and twenty asymptomatic trees was used for extraction nucleic acids. Nested PCR with primer pairs amplifying 16Sr RNA sequences of phytoplasmas resulted in specific products for samples from six symptomatic trees however the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and phylogenetic analyses of the sequenced products did not allow to clearly classify newly detected isolates within the elm yellows group (16SrV). The isolates found in Poland clustered on the boundary of the 16SrV-A and 16SrV-C ribosomal subgroups. Sequence analyses of less conservative genes rpl22- rps3 and secY confirmed the affiliation of the phytoplasma isolates found in Poland to ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma ulmi’; however, the significant nucleotide changes in signature sequences for all three genes were shown compared with EY1T reference strain. Surprisingly, the newly detected isolates shared a common origin and were phylogenetically closer to EY1-SRB and EY10-SRB strains from Serbia as well as NK16 strain from Croatia strains than to the EYCZ1 strain from the Czech Republic.

Laboratory measurements of chemical compounds of grains are expensive, time-consuming predominantly done on powdered samples. Therefore, a rapid and reliable method integrating image processing and machine learning was evaluated for the prediction of total phenolic compounds (TPCs), tannin, and protein.\nFindings\n\nThe highest TPC (0.83%) was obtained for genotype KGS36 (the brown pericarp) followed by KGS23 (0.54%). The concentration of tannin ranged from 0.008% to 0.616%. Mean comparison revealed variation for the protein concentration (15.17%–11.53%); the highest content obtained by KGS25 and the lowest by KGS36 (p < .01).

For the MLP network, the minimum number of hidden networks was set to 8 and the maximum number was set to 25. For learning and saving, the number of networks was set to 20 and the number of saved networks was set to 5. The best MLP models were selected based on performance (R) and error values for the train, test, and validation sets.\nConclusions\n\nAn ANN for the prediction of the chemical concentration was suggested.

Processing of the plum stone images included the conversion of the images to individual color channels, image segmentation, region of interest (ROI) determination, and texture parameter extraction. Then, the discriminant analysis, including the texture selection and building discriminative models for the evaluation of the diversity of the plum stone cultivars, was carried out. The obtained results of discrimination of plum stone cultivars were very accurate and confirmed the effectiveness of image processing to evaluate the cultivar diversity. The most satisfactory results, reaching 96.67% for the average accuracy for three cultivars (97% for ‘Emper’, ‘Kalipso’, and 96% for ‘Polinka’), were obtained for the models built based on combined textures selected from all the color channels using the IBk classifier. The developed procedure can be of practical importance for the correct identification of plum stone cultivars and avoiding their mixing to preserve cultivar uniformity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"762","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d9","mniswId":"689","title":"Agronomy-Basel","issn":"2073-4395","eissn":"2073-4395","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"1984f72c-0b5b-40a4-98ab-23a13480a3bd"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["plum stone cultivars","image processing","textures","discrimination accuracy"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086107"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6b6","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Patocchi","documentHash":"7d2ad89c-f5b2-450e-a3c9-298c148b10f6"},{"objectId":"624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6b5","name":"Hélène","lastName":"Muranty","documentHash":"9c2eef05-b1c8-4417-a8e1-870607048229"},{"objectId":"624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6b4","name":"Bruno","lastName":"Studer","documentHash":"8f804e8a-404e-442d-b7cd-a7fa459236ed"},{"objectId":"624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6b3","name":"François","lastName":"Laurens","documentHash":"efdb7d29-c239-4dbc-b2a0-af96409dbbff"},{"objectId":"624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6b2","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Knauf","documentHash":"2a469696-c911-4ce0-9179-7e2a52d0ee32"},{"objectId":"624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6b1","name":"Carolina","lastName":"Font i Forcada","documentHash":"46e84a8d-f642-4867-8fa7-530000a84d3e"},{"objectId":"624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6b0","name":"Christian","lastName":"Dujak","documentHash":"f0a64882-8ebe-4252-ad55-fe76d5776eb7"},{"objectId":"624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6af","name":"Frédérique","lastName":"Didelot","documentHash":"46b3affd-39e5-463a-a8ce-66a927a8911f"},{"objectId":"624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6ae","name":"Marijn","lastName":"Rymenants","documentHash":"f6b9ab4b-ef43-4253-bc82-d2070d8691bf"},{"objectId":"624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6ad","name":"Nadia","lastName":"Sanin","documentHash":"d51aebaa-ffc4-417a-87fc-4b847d7c1b60"},{"objectId":"624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6ac","name":"Mehdi","lastName":"Al-Rifaï","documentHash":"4664973b-aaf7-496c-81c7-ae9144216bf0"},{"objectId":"624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6ab","name":"Walter","lastName":"Guerra","documentHash":"38967c5d-dbe0-43fb-8cea-97a7f3477607"},{"objectId":"624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6aa","name":"Annemarie","lastName":"Auwerkerken","documentHash":"5ecdef42-7125-4d64-b327-63637afb3fa5"},{"objectId":"624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6a9","name":"Maria José","lastName":"Aranzana","documentHash":"146be9c6-a751-47d5-a078-de74571a7798"},{"objectId":"624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6a8","name":"Morgane","lastName":"Roth","documentHash":"7799fc24-ca2b-47ff-8810-b27d1c950694"},{"objectId":"624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6a7","name":"Beat","lastName":"Keller","documentHash":"8bc2328f-57ef-4888-9f59-99bcb42e6b4c"},{"objectId":"624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6a6","name":"Michaela","lastName":"Jung","documentHash":"8a9db71a-0af1-4f0d-9743-a33f8120b8ba"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397ea0","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Lewandowski","uuid":"FF9CB12B6F29964A550A5E57E5FD89260B52352595E70F20C435F3D419C03232071E90EF786DD9DE8845ACEF45C58EFA629D010F430B68BF6C31B8E066171866","orcidId":"0000-0002-4852-5514","documentHash":"a75b54d4-0935-425b-ad8e-156f972f1c3e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6a4","doi":"10.1093/hr/uhac028","publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/hr/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/hr/uhac028/42558362/uhac028.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Genetic architecture and genomic predictive ability of apple quantitative traits across environments","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"abk","content":"Implementation of genomic tools is desirable to increase the efficiency of apple breeding. Recently, the multi-environment apple reference population (apple REFPOP) proved useful for rediscovering loci, estimating genomic predictive ability, and studying genotype by environment interactions (G × E). So far, only two phenological traits were investigated using the apple REFPOP, although the population may be valuable when dissecting genetic architecture and reporting predictive abilities for additional key traits in apple breeding. Here we show contrasting genetic architecture and genomic predictive abilities for 30 quantitative traits across up to six European locations using the apple REFPOP. A total of 59 stable and 277 location-specific associations were found using GWAS, 69.2% of which are novel when compared with 41 reviewed publications. Average genomic predictive abilities of 0.18-0.88 were estimated using main-effect univariate, main-effect multivariate, multi-environment univariate, and multi-environment multivariate models. The G × E accounted for up to 24% of the phenotypic variability. This most comprehensive genomic study in apple in terms of trait-environment combinations provided knowledge of trait biology and prediction models that can be readily applied for marker-assisted or genomic selection, thus facilitating increased breeding efficiency."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928f878c28a047397ea0"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","issue":"uhac028","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6a6","624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6a7","624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6a8","624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6a9","624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6aa","624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6ab","624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6ac","624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6ad","624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6ae","624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6af","624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6b0","624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6b1","624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6b2","624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6b3","624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6b4","624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6b5","624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6b6","5e70928f878c28a047397ea0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c2eb","mniswId":"7727","title":"Horticulture Research","issn":"2052-7276","eissn":"2052-7276","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"3e157e9e-1da8-4442-9da5-599cb1850b98"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"624ae1dd2467f01ec7fdd6b9","year":"2022","volume":"9","documentHash":"c599bd59-2a70-4176-9466-db08c3368e5f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Malus domestica","apple breeding","environment interactions","GWAS"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058092392"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"624d5ed52467f063114d0229","name":"Nemanja","lastName":"Kuzmanović","documentHash":"6c0d7212-4dae-490d-ac7a-af40566e4b95"},{"objectId":"5e7094a5878c28a0473c0f43","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Trzciński","uuid":"1B08C5745BBED0DD2FA6FC7FE765081039817AF55DC1966754B0DE57E0E12A703A4C86A0543480A443BEF70D758B4A7D0A02070D72D9249897FB8DAEA4264074","orcidId":"0000-0003-4568-6504","documentHash":"f5b9cc24-31a2-45ba-ad71-30588d171d96"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398341","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Puławska","uuid":"A2F13D21947DD9E5CA8586F26E280B3CE2C9F1E3B7EDE455195E9E313A348C66551979BBD618F4DBE6F5E5EF071DC6DC28BB1E1BD29693C3A50E2DB9BBEFE4EF","orcidId":"0000-0001-5327-1056","documentHash":"3475c8e9-bf80-473e-9268-fbb10a5ccf56"}],"objectId":"624d5ed52467f063114d0226","doi":"10.1016/j.syapm.2022.126319","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0723202022000261?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Agrobacterium vaccinii sp. nov. isolated from galls on blueberry plants (Vaccinium corymbosum)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Four non-pathogenic strains isolated from the galls on blueberry plants (Vaccinium corymbosum) were characterized by using polyphasic taxonomic methods.

Analyses showed that the strains belong to “rubi” sub-clade of Agrobacterium genus and their closest relatives are Agrobacterium rubi and “Agrobacterium bohemicum”. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization (dDDH) comparisons between genome sequences of representative strains B7.6T and B19.1.4, and their closest relatives, confirmed the distinct phylogenetic position of studied strains, because obtained values were considerably below the proposed thresholds for the species delineation. The four strains studied were phenotypically distinguishable from other species of the genus Agrobacterium. Overall, polyphasic characterization showed that the strains studied represent a novel species of the genus Agrobacterium, for which the name Agrobacterium vaccinii sp. nov. is proposed.

Little is known about the relationship between the physical characteristics of lignite substrate and cucumber yield. The study analyzed the effect of bulk density and water holding capacity of lignite substrate in comparison to mineral wool and EC of nutrient solution on plant morphological parameters, yield and fruit quality of greenhouse cucumber. A positive relation was found between the bulk density of lignite mats and the increase in the number of leaves per week, shoot diameter as well as leaf length and leaf area (calculated as the product of leaf length × width) in cucumbers grown in this medium. Bulk density of lignite growing mats also affected the macro- and micro-nutrient content of cucumber leaves. The physical properties of the substrate and the high EC of the medium had a significant effect on the hardness, color and lutein content of cucumber fruits. The content of biologically active compounds in cucumber fruits depended on the water holding capacity of the medium and the water readily available to plants; these parameters were lower in the lignite medium compared to mineral wool. However, when the lignite substrate was used in hydroponic cucumber cultivation, for a period of 51 days after planting (DAP) there was an increase of more than 23% in the bulk density of the substrate and an increase of nearly 55% in the water readily available compared to the new lignite mats"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397d85","5e70928f878c28a047397f69","5e709401878c28a0473b4bea"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"4480","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602e509d9543c7410626f0b7","5e70928f878c28a047397f69","5e70923d878c28a0473923b7","5e70923d878c28a047392360","5e7094a1878c28a0473c0b52","5e709401878c28a0473b4bea","5e70923d878c28a04739235e","5e70928e878c28a047397d85","5e70923d878c28a0473923b0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences-Basel","issn":"2076-3417","eissn":"2076-3417","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"8a20a31f-8131-4357-899d-7b8f694df717"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["organic substrate","correlation coefficient","marketable yield","concentration of minerals in leaves","fruit quality"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111232"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"623a16472467f009d3017f1f","name":"Kadir","lastName":"Sabanci","orcidId":"0000-0003-0238-9606","documentHash":"407cd0e4-86b3-4b08-8eb0-40df6224488a"},{"objectId":"623a16472467f009d3017f1e","name":"Akif","lastName":"Durdu","documentHash":"1948d72d-8423-4b5e-963a-c2f9f6c63ad7"},{"objectId":"623a16472467f009d3017f1d","name":"Muhammed Fahri","lastName":"Unlersen","documentHash":"4c658f71-f22d-4926-a7ca-c984f6cd0bc4"},{"objectId":"623a16472467f009d3017f1b","name":"Muhammet Fatih","lastName":"Aslan","documentHash":"318c7397-2c22-4b1b-b96c-f1c2c2b06864"},{"objectId":"5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ropelewska","uuid":"E3575740307CA373F3BD454AAC58C202E1C2CA28B9FC90C6BC3006DB867893BEE70DFAC85C7D9667CD0ACB7837B8DF63F7D6636679B032F0F1E0E534A3F3CBD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8891-236X","documentHash":"e9d0e369-fc46-40fe-9cb3-5236d6ea38a0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2022-03-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"623a16472467f009d3017f1a","doi":"10.1007/s12161-022-02251-0","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12161-022-02251-0","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"A Novel Convolutional-Recurrent Hybrid Network for Sunn Pest–Damaged Wheat Grain Detection","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The sunn pest–damaged (SPD) wheat grains negatively affect the flour quality and cause yield loss.

We determined how potato virus Y (PVY) coat protein (CP) is recognised by Rysto, a TNL immune receptor.\n    We applied structural modelling, site-directed mutagenesis, transient overexpression, co-immunoprecipitation, infection assays and physiological cell death marker measurements to investigate the mechanism of Rysto–CP interaction.\n    Rysto associates directly with PVY CP in planta that is conditioned by the presence of a CP central 149 amino acids domain. Each deletion that affects the CP core region impairs the ability of Rysto to trigger defence. Point mutations in the amino acid residues Ser125, Arg157, and Asp201 of the conserved RNA-binding pocket of potyviral CP reduce or abolish Rysto binding and Rysto-dependent responses, demonstrating that appropriate folding of the CP core is crucial for Rysto-mediated recognition.\n    Rysto recognises the CPs of at least 10 crop-damaging viruses that share a similar core region. It confers immunity to plum pox virus and turnip mosaic virus in both Solanaceae and Brassicaceae systems, demonstrating potential utility in engineering virus resistance in various crops. Our findings shed new light on how R proteins detect different viruses by sensing conserved structural patterns."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397ddc"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","uid":"bKH7OhxrOAmP_ULnBGYKnJQ","uuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","name":"Instytut Biochemii i Biofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8ba7","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f2f","5e709413878c28a0473b5db4","5e7093b3878c28a0473af66c","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f42"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","parentUuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","rootUuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","uid":"bmfkTgrYux51kKuOA70Q27Q","uuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","name":"Instytut Hodowli i Aklimatyzacji Roślin - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70943f878c28a0473b8ba7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","parentUuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","rootUuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"235","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1179-1195","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709413878c28a0473b5db4","62b1a0c2409707603913aa20","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f2f","5e70943f878c28a0473b8ba7","5e70928e878c28a047397ddc","5e7093b3878c28a0473af66c","62b1a0c2409707603913aa25","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f42"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479029","mniswId":"15047","title":"NEW PHYTOLOGIST","issn":"0028-646X","eissn":"1469-8137","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"99ad9585-bd83-4ebb-ba85-80e159277349"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b1a0c2409707603913aa28","year":"2022","documentHash":"7db05338-1578-4094-bd4d-ffc5cd28d1ce"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cell death","coat protein structure","potato virus Y","Potyvirus resistance engineering","Rysto"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138517"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bdde0","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"97CA3174080827A6B0A0270F12F022527EAC69DEAF9A298A7090DB405A36D9BD3C5300A23E15C79339219E9F5C5A610F383406AAEF43CA7180E096A8773B797B","orcidId":"0000-0001-7802-9733","documentHash":"5b2d0c7c-4406-469f-b682-f04386f8910b"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4a21","name":"Anna","lastName":"Tryngiel-Gać","uuid":"98A77A282439EDFDCA5A17C1FCC501D6ACC64EE0DDE21EC927CAE3EE0F051AFE4F6A667D73E28FFE19E620EEB1194BF4B6A9636A0DD3524FA5494BB0B1F7D3D5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8766-6010","documentHash":"483e9d4e-640a-450f-9733-0cdcfc8af5db"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a0473986e0","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Treder","uuid":"CA809C02520EED47C9A82056AF627806F94D6BB9721D9DB8BB14025A6684CE9FE71CFD1C9D18ECE0B1A2610D5554D573E7368A857C8E508CD75D20E6A051643E","orcidId":"0000-0003-1640-9671","documentHash":"c6034984-8a2c-4af0-ae6a-63868a0ca950"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a0473979a2","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Klamkowski","uuid":"7E450B39DF810DB41FC8F651E1A7E17AD750C7E9A422D49912DC393B84655FBED245B386CD93F921C9DE3C513917FBB447B953F71C4C91C5B479A20AFAD3CB05","orcidId":"0000-0003-0358-3726","documentHash":"cbebff37-3723-4ee6-9d6e-43c807f2539a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-06-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62b2b4c3409707737cef39c8","doi":"10.24425/jwld.2022.140779","publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/dlibra/publication/140779/edition/123346/content","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Assessment of rainfall efficiency in an apple orchard","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Atmospheric precipitation is the major input to the soil water balance. Its amount, intensity, and temporal\ndistribution have an indubitable influence on soil moisture. The aim of the study (conducted in the years 2010–2013)\nwas to evaluate soil water balance in an apple orchard as determined by daily rainfall. The amount and intensity of\nrainfall and daily evapotranspiration were measured using an automatic weather station. Changes in soil water content\nwas carried out using capacitance probes placed at a depth of 20, 40 and 60 cm. The most common were single events\nof rainfall of up to 0.2 mm, while 1.3–3.6 mm rains delivered the greatest amount of water. A significant correlation was\nfound between the amount of daily rainfall and changes in water content of individual soil layers.

This genus has been the subject of numerous cytological and cytometric studies and have shown enormous variation in terms of genome size, ploidy level, and even the basic chromosome number. The basic chromosome numbers are 5 or 7, but 10, 11, and 12 have been recorded as well. Most narcissus cultivars are euploid tetraploids. There are also numerous triploids. Some cultivars are aneuploid such as tetraploids or triploids, with missing chromosomes or possessing additional chromosomes. Due to their very complex parentage, cultivars have various numbers of chromosomes not found in the species. In this publication, we present a study on the genome size and assessment of the likely ploidy level of 38 cultivars and breeding clones of Narcissus in relation to their selected morphological traits and information on their parental forms. For the first time, 12 Polish cultivars and breeding clones of narcissus were the subject of such an evaluation. Perianth diameter, leaf length, and width were evaluated and rated with notes according to the descriptor of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants. Stomatal density and stomata length were measured using light microscopy. Analysis of genome size was carried out using flow cytometry. For three selected genotypes, the chromosome number was counted. Our results lead to the general conclusion that the morphological traits studied and nuclear DNA content can be useful for determining the possible ploidy level of narcissi. The information on the origin and parental forms of narcissi can be helpful in determining the ploidy level of narcissi. However, clear confirmation of ploidy level requires verification of chromosome number and preferably karyotyping. The results obtained are a prelude to further studies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398339","5e709337878c28a0473a50c3"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1-12","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709200878c28a04738e658","5e709292878c28a047398339","5e709337878c28a0473a50c3","625fa2ea2467f059f6b47cb2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d9","mniswId":"689","title":"Agronomy","issn":"2073-4395","eissn":"2073-4395","documentHash":"f748c34e-fa45-428e-abf2-7624cc5986fd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"621de6a72467f06798e1658c","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"3","documentHash":"791f6fee-b3db-49ee-bc68-ae9bd65e5552"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["chromosome","daffodils","flow cytometry","genome size","light microscopy","phenotype","stomata"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058146066"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ropelewska","uuid":"E3575740307CA373F3BD454AAC58C202E1C2CA28B9FC90C6BC3006DB867893BEE70DFAC85C7D9667CD0ACB7837B8DF63F7D6636679B032F0F1E0E534A3F3CBD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8891-236X","documentHash":"e9d0e369-fc46-40fe-9cb3-5236d6ea38a0"},{"objectId":"5e7094da878c28a0473c5539","name":"Artur","lastName":"Kowalski","uuid":"4E70ECAD79B95724316AFED089B9D5E0988D10579DD350FD6E3773C87A570C8254CA3E32506A802661E7CB0A1FACD83EDF403A24E2514D5F028A605759887B53","orcidId":"0000-0003-4279-4411","documentHash":"808892e6-9d4b-4a6e-bce8-d1613ec6fc89"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c2c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Wrzodak","uuid":"DD0902EC722F650D2557905DC36078794A03753014017DFA37805D32092EF1907648778A1814F55ABC2B1B2D4FE4EAE0B2D82D20ED3B546C9BDD9309E2D00A80","orcidId":"0000-0001-5472-888X","documentHash":"4ffe1343-e9dd-4148-8301-038630a669bd"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a047397980","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Kaniszewski","uuid":"40B382442323D114A5BADE56702303FCCE4F37CB4A0FDF9D59F4ECE4E7F3F49E4EF5DE0D3113286E9B59A087663E36ABF3EEFABF5B44B31037767B6BEE6570D1","orcidId":"0000-0002-0611-8515","documentHash":"cbde5f0e-0e7e-422f-85bf-cd22d74b947d"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e666","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Matysiak","uuid":"900FBC197657FBB627FF12FF3E79CE37217F63AA052CFCFD3C0D9184DF01E2067A5895FE7B1741E08AE4FFDACAC2713ACAF8948615ADD64B2B13389EC8DD6F38","orcidId":"0000-0002-3892-6429","documentHash":"3fbd23e8-8d5d-4db0-a2c1-591195b7d0fe"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62692e654097070159877487","doi":"10.3390/agronomy12051026","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/5/1026/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Yield and Quality of Romaine Lettuce at Different Daily Light Integral in an Indoor Controlled Environment","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, the effect of different photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) provided by LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) and photoperiod on biomass production, morphological traits, photosynthetic performance, sensory attributes, and image texture parameters of indoor cultivated romaine lettuce was evaluated. Two cultivars of lettuce Lactuca sativa var. longifolium namely ‘Casual’ (Syngenta)—midi romaine lettuce with medium-compact heads—and ‘Elizium’ (Enza Zaden)—a mini type (Little Gem) with compact heavy heads—were used. PPFD of 160 and 240 µmol m−2 s−1 and photoperiod of 16 and 20 h were applied, and Daily Light Integral (DLI) values were 9.2, 11.5, 13.8, and 17.3 mol m−2 day−1. The experiment lasted 30 days in the Indoor Controlled Environment Agriculture facility. DLI equal to 17.3 mol m−2 per day for cv. ‘Casual’ and 11.5–17.3 mol m−2 per day for cv. ‘Elizium’ allowed to obtain a very high fresh weight, 350 and 240 g, respectively, within 30 days of cultivation in an indoor plant production facility. The application of the lowest PPFD 160 µmol m−2 s−1 and 16 h photoperiod (9.2 mol m−2 per day DLI) resulted in the lowest fresh weight, the number of leaves and head circumference. The level of nitrate, even at the lowest DLI, was below the limit imposed by European Community Regulation. The cv. ‘Elizium’ lettuce grown at PPFD 240 µmol m−2 s−1 and 16 h photoperiod had the highest overall sensory quality. The cv. ‘Casual’ lettuce grown at PPFD 160 µmol m−2 s−1 and 20 h photoperiod had the lowest sensory quality. The samples subjected to different photoperiod and PPFD were also successively distinguished in an objective and non-destructive way using image features and machine learning algorithms. The average accuracy for the leaf samples of cv. ‘Casual’ lettuce reached 98.75% and for cv. ‘Elizium’ cultivar—86.25%. The obtained relationship between DLI and yield, as well as the quality of romaine lettuce, can be used in practice to improve romaine lettuce production in an Indoor Controlled Environment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709401878c28a0473b4c2c","5e709200878c28a04738e666","5e7094da878c28a0473c5539","5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","5e70928b878c28a047397980"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"1026","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709200878c28a04738e666","5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","5e709401878c28a0473b4c2c","5e70928b878c28a047397980","5e7094da878c28a0473c5539"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d9","mniswId":"689","title":"Agronomy","issn":"2073-4395","eissn":"2073-4395","documentHash":"f748c34e-fa45-428e-abf2-7624cc5986fd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62692e65409707015987748f","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"5","documentHash":"994a1483-997c-49d4-8a3f-ea247a0a685a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["artificial lighting","quality features","image processing","sensory analysis","indoor farming","Lactuca sativa var. longifolia"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058152078"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"627a54604097077f84ef91a4","name":"Muhammet Fatih","lastName":"Aslan","orcidId":"0000-0001-7549-0137","documentHash":"f92133ea-a22b-4418-a5f1-e4e272a2efbb"},{"objectId":"627a54604097077f84ef91a3","name":"Kadir","lastName":"Sabanci","orcidId":"0000-0003-0238-9606","documentHash":"f43b4e29-b287-42c3-9cc6-cc401b626fec"},{"objectId":"5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ropelewska","uuid":"E3575740307CA373F3BD454AAC58C202E1C2CA28B9FC90C6BC3006DB867893BEE70DFAC85C7D9667CD0ACB7837B8DF63F7D6636679B032F0F1E0E534A3F3CBD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8891-236X","documentHash":"e9d0e369-fc46-40fe-9cb3-5236d6ea38a0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"627a54604097077f84ef91a1","doi":"10.1007/s00217-022-04016-9","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00217-022-04016-9.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Preservation effects evaluated using innovative models developed by machine learning on cucumber flesh","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The objective of this study was to compare the slice image features of cucumbers preserved in different ways and fresh cucumbers.

Moreover, they also positively increased the fruit set percentage and final yield of ‘Le Conte’ pear. The fruit weight, size and firmness were also improved under the influence of aforementioned treatments. The fruit soluble solids, total sugars, leaf nitrogen, leaf phosphorus and leaf potassium of pear were also enhanced as compared with the control. Additionally, spraying of GA3 at 150 ppm, as well as, HA at 5 and 4% were the superior treatments and showed the most significant impact on plant growth, yield, fruit quality and leaf mineral content of pear.

Moreover, imported drones are present in the environment and mate naturally with queens from the local subspecies. The resulting admixture complicates population genetics analyses, and population stratification can be a major problem for association studies. To better understand Western European honey bee populations, we produced a whole genome sequence and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data set from 870 haploid drones and demonstrate its utility for the identification of nine genetic backgrounds and various degrees of admixture in a subset of 629 samples. Five backgrounds identified correspond to subspecies, two to isolated populations on islands and two to managed populations. We also highlight several large haplotype blocks, some of which coincide with the position of centromeres. The largest is 3.6 Mb long and represents 21% of chromosome 11, with two major haplotypes corresponding to the two dominant genetic backgrounds identified. This large naturally phased data set is available as a single vcf file that can now serve as a reference for subsequent populations genomics studies in the honey bee, such as (i) selecting individuals of verified homogeneous genetic backgrounds as references, (ii) imputing genotypes from a lower-density data set generated by an SNP-chip or by low-pass sequencing, or (iii) selecting SNPs compatible with the requirements of genotyping chips."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709288878c28a0473976e2"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"3068-3086","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62e7cf4240970778ffaa4bee","62e7cf4240970778ffaa4bef","62e7cf4240970778ffaa4bf0","62e7cf4240970778ffaa4bf1","62e7cf4240970778ffaa4bf2","62e7cf4240970778ffaa4bf3","62e7cf4240970778ffaa4bf4","5e709288878c28a0473976e2","62e7cf4240970778ffaa4bf6","62e7cf4240970778ffaa4bf7","62e7cf4240970778ffaa4bf8","62e7cf4240970778ffaa4bf9","62e7cf4240970778ffaa4bfa","62e7cf4240970778ffaa4bfb","62e7cf4240970778ffaa4bfc","62e7cf4240970778ffaa4bfd","62e7cf4240970778ffaa4bfe"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478eed","mniswId":"14545","title":"MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES","issn":"1755-098x","eissn":"1755-0998","documentHash":"a5f8aa0c-2026-4efc-9434-d2e63e447fbf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62e7cf4240970778ffaa4c00","year":"2022","documentHash":"3d4fcd74-9615-4c7f-aa11-94619255d8ef"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["genome","haplotype","honey bee","population genetics","SNP"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058162220"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"61fa24bb2467f013ba90af0e","name":"Kensuke","lastName":"Miyamoto","documentHash":"6be1ba62-4c04-445c-9cfc-2cc675344b13"},{"objectId":"61fa24bb2467f013ba90af0d","name":"Junichi","lastName":"Ueda","documentHash":"7b436c1f-0ac6-44fe-b521-27ea49ecf078"},{"objectId":"61fa24bb2467f013ba90af0c","name":"Marian","lastName":"Saniewski","documentHash":"9263daf2-c7d9-4401-bdda-2533a242a425"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Marasek-Ciołakowska","uuid":"6FAB3AE6D9EBCFA4FD26AA8B3CD63FA73B99A6498DEF6A1770D2A9643E68A306803F24C467726C9A84745750C9B2D96EDD4F279404023C905B13853E9A49233F","orcidId":"0000-0001-9349-2566","documentHash":"1c86d2dd-6830-448a-8df1-57210e29a74d"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4b5b","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Kowalska","uuid":"532470935FFE12D8B26391F48EA6285EBD2AB2217243563CE7423338BB3BC665CABB0925A6B888B898E0E195F902FC2DCF3DEFB88BBC81865A7A7F5495842717","orcidId":"0000-0003-1806-0493","documentHash":"62007188-3515-4fd4-b767-cf6cc1109c4f"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4af1","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Góraj-Koniarska","uuid":"9FC40A1F1A091811F5417DDDC0A27F9D6E4A7EBB7061A55729BDF382AC1C4764ACC6D5ECDCECC86E5F3AF92A60C7C453705F203CC84916CE364E17F25BA5DC27","orcidId":"0000-0001-7667-0279","documentHash":"2201bd21-407f-41c6-b322-bf2d514266ed"},{"objectId":"5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b85","name":"Michał","lastName":"Dziurka","uuid":"C508B84A3E98AF91D4A7CF2B3F96DCF5CDDD04199D55EC6231120160D35F2346ADF8454B963FAF986327F88BE636B80D8617AF7648BCC065B4DC89242B986449","orcidId":"0000-0002-8265-6243","documentHash":"2fccdaa3-374f-450a-82fb-cb867a75d10a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-28","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"61fa24bb2467f013ba90af09","doi":"10.3390/plants11030360","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/11/3/360","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"A Possible Mode of Action of Methyl Jasmonate to Induce the Secondary Abscission Zone in Stems of <i>Bryophyllum calycinum</i>: Relevance to Plant Hormone Dynamics","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Plants can react to environmental stresses through the abscission of infected, damaged, or senescent organs. A possible mode of action of methyl jasmonate (JA-Me) to induce the formation of the secondary abscission zone (SAZ) in the stems of Bryophyllum calycinum was investigated concerning plant hormone dynamics. Internode segments were prepared mainly from the second or third internode from the top of plants with active elongation. JA-Me applied to the middle of internode segments induced the SAZ formation above and below the treatment after 5–7 days. At 6 to 7 days after JA-Me treatment, the above and below internode pieces adjacent to the SAZ were excised and subjected to comprehensive analyses of plant hormones. The endogenous levels of auxin-related compounds between both sides adjacent to the SAZ were quite different. No differences were observed in the level of jasmonic acid (JA), but the contents of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA), a precursor of JA, and N-jasmonyl-leucine (JA-Leu) substantially decreased on the JA-Me side. Almost no effects of JA-Me on the dynamics of other plant hormones (cytokinins, abscisic acid, and gibberellins) were observed. Similar JA-Me effects on plant hormones and morphology were observed in the last internode of the decapitated growing plants. These suggest that the application of JA-Me induces the SAZ in the internode of B. calycinum by affecting endogenous levels of auxin- and jasmonate-related compounds."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","5e709400878c28a0473b4af1"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"360","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709401878c28a0473b4b5b","61fa24bb2467f013ba90af0c","61fa24bb2467f013ba90af0d","61fa24bb2467f013ba90af0e","5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b85","5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","5e709400878c28a0473b4af1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547e776","mniswId":"25607","title":"Plants","issn":"2223-7747","eissn":"2223-7747","documentHash":"dae8e400-cb70-4c3b-acbe-f4f64f06f071"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e7d6632467f05e2961f3fe","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"d3f788bd-8bc4-46da-a86f-64fc6aa76c38"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["auxin-related compound","Bryophyllum calycinum","indole-3-acetic acid","methyl jasmonate","plant hormone dynamics","secondary abscission"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172290"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a7878c28a0473c1102","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Seliga","uuid":"CACBC0870CB157C461F900A444A42A1003A1358653DCE690FA7817C97D022571577B326BF6A9F98C765F25CF1B1F866F7C72D013982E6B727B35707609E0105C","orcidId":"0000-0002-1687-5499","documentHash":"a328f130-9c53-44ef-83c5-c9f648366336"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Marasek-Ciołakowska","uuid":"6FAB3AE6D9EBCFA4FD26AA8B3CD63FA73B99A6498DEF6A1770D2A9643E68A306803F24C467726C9A84745750C9B2D96EDD4F279404023C905B13853E9A49233F","orcidId":"0000-0001-9349-2566","documentHash":"1c86d2dd-6830-448a-8df1-57210e29a74d"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c23","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Trzewik","uuid":"D90C1CC0E3D83B2B2F1625FA9A565157E627A2F8323223BC45F4856253F9A5C521B1E693EDA380BA27885A8406155EF8FD57CE6A8284BCCC3A80B5B041839784","orcidId":"0000-0003-0378-5440","documentHash":"13bbbab7-04ee-4311-b6f2-c929ad4744a8"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398339","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Podwyszyńska","uuid":"B2F52BE0F8A5B79B13A48C312966FAF67C57B8B98C867157CF8141B8D7208AF78325A4F99008EDCBA6781E8BB00736EC29CC4B6CD7950AC77678B349D9B9CC47","orcidId":"0000-0003-3005-4053","documentHash":"685f5ee6-b147-4b3e-b614-46c6ff16b171"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397dd7","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Kucharska","uuid":"0D8534221F0E905762DB2BCEFE1FCD90BD80EFFFBF0CAB2F3E4ACF5A7915B7391930D4FD47B34F736BFCA6AF9B23690A150677DF595F5413882D2E19B7C93360","orcidId":"0000-0002-9635-967X","documentHash":"99bf01ad-9202-4adc-aaaf-9fc06294d218"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e669","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Pluta","uuid":"A389F119DF07BF98605FE425265C9D7AAFC056C945E0F9E7F5B4B226B0057BD6E8D3D999781461C4DD166DE67E1F1EED446BB62F6F662DA5A98F3DB3747DFCD6","orcidId":"0000-0003-2837-7304","documentHash":"c4cc3f4e-bb2b-4925-be1d-b7e627597a4a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-18","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62970c0d40970702be4dcec1","doi":"10.3390/agronomy12051215","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/5/1215/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"In Vitro Induction and Primary Evaluation of Octoploid Plants in Saskatoon Berry (Amelanchier alnifolia Nutt.)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Polyploids of many species of horticultural plants are widely used in breeding programs since they are characterized by vigorous growth, larger organs, and greater resistance to biotic and abiotic stress. Saskatoon berry (Amelanchier alnifolia Nutt.) is in a form of diploid (2n = 2x = 34) and tetraploid. So far, no reports on induction of polyploidy in this species have been found. The aim of the study was to obtain Saskatoon berry octoploids with the use of in vitro shoot cultures. Shoots of the tetraploid of Canadian cultivars ‘Martin’ and ‘Smoky’ derived from in vitro cultures were used for induction of chromosome doubling. The shoot explants were incubated in a multiplication medium with the addition of one of the following antimitotics: colchicine, trifluralin, oryzalin or amiprophos methyl (APM) for two weeks (six days in the darkness and then eight days under a 16-h photoperiod). Then, the shoots were transferred to the multiplication medium without antimitotics and propagated in vitro by two subcultures. Octoploids were selected based on flow cytometry. Trifluralin showed the most phytotoxic effect. Six octoploids were obtained, four for ‘Martin’ after treatment with 250 mg L−1 of colchicine and two for ‘Smoky’ following the treatment with 5 mg L−1 of APM. All obtained octoploid individuals were multiplied and the level of ploidy was re-examined by flow cytometry and chromosome counting, which confirmed their octoploid genotype (2n = 8x = 136). They are probably the first octoploids of the genus Amelanchier in the world. The newly obtained octoploids were rooted in vitro, acclimatized to ex vitro conditions and grown in a greenhouse. Octoploids grew very slowly and showed a tendency to premature dormancy, which was manifested by inhibition of growth. In octoploid plants, the stomata were significantly larger and the number of stomata per 1 mm2 of leaf area was lower, compared to the tetraploid counterparts."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709401878c28a0473b4c23","5e709200878c28a04738e669","5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","5e7094a7878c28a0473c1102","5e70928e878c28a047397dd7","5e709292878c28a047398339"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"1215","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928e878c28a047397dd7","5e709292878c28a047398339","5e709401878c28a0473b4c23","5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","5e709200878c28a04738e669","5e7094a7878c28a0473c1102"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d9","mniswId":"689","title":"Agronomy","issn":"2073-4395","eissn":"2073-4395","documentHash":"f748c34e-fa45-428e-abf2-7624cc5986fd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62692e65409707015987748f","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"5","documentHash":"994a1483-997c-49d4-8a3f-ea247a0a685a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Amelanchier alnifolia","chromosome doubling","octoploids","colchicine","oryzalin","trifluralin","amiprophos methyl"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172363"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62bea3f7409707383bcc074f","name":"Jacob Dirk","lastName":"Janse","documentHash":"a19772a0-8fc9-466f-b0ac-c1cb9058b69a"},{"objectId":"62bea3f7409707383bcc074e","name":"Ali","lastName":"Rhouma","documentHash":"ef65d301-dfac-4ef6-a991-143a8f6a0157"},{"objectId":"62bea3f7409707383bcc074d","name":"Steve","lastName":"Baeyen","documentHash":"57e43690-6715-40a6-96fb-acc3be8b2124"},{"objectId":"62bea3f7409707383bcc074c","name":"Johan","lastName":"van Vaerenberg","documentHash":"702298a5-3ddb-425c-8311-ea3a064adc81"},{"objectId":"62bea3f7409707383bcc074b","name":"Amira","lastName":"Mougou-Hamdane","documentHash":"afb937fb-7fe4-4474-aaac-86ab6c3a737d"},{"objectId":"62bea3f7409707383bcc074a","name":"Bochra Amina","lastName":"Bahri","documentHash":"a9d3fe1c-156b-4d71-9290-e01442465911"},{"objectId":"62bea3f7409707383bcc0747","name":"Emna","lastName":"Abdellatif","orcidId":"0000-0003-2623-4043","documentHash":"b01658bb-eb6d-4f2a-b152-0bf92ac681a2"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c22","name":"Artur","lastName":"Mikiciński","uuid":"1876B2C9DBBE82492F5579859B3368B35FCDB39BAFBDC22CC1FF09CB6E6FD429437C183C2765036886926F810A26D3AF34A87CC0ADB3A664BB2088A653E40DD3","orcidId":"0000-0002-4047-0918","documentHash":"ae7cc2d7-81b7-45ad-8c4b-eb72d9ccf73b"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4b56","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kałużna","uuid":"58F98B95F7DD869F4F69E7200C83A8BA6B78802F6D4563961BEFA6AF90032FCA3B861AED22C13AD5B9CEE667567987A7219C4CDAFAC80B3D937E557BD56B799A","orcidId":"0000-0002-1745-1444","documentHash":"741f88bb-d4d3-4c10-b1b2-c05d331ef7ad"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2022-05-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62bea3f7409707383bcc0745","doi":"10.1007/s42161-022-01133-y","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42161-022-01133-y.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Promising epiphytic antagonistic Pseudomonas strains from the Citrus phyllosphere in the biocontrol of Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, causing bacterial citrus blast and black pit","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Recent occurrence in Tunisia of Citrus blast and black pit disease, caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (Pss), the few available antibacterial chemicals, and the increasing resistance of Pss to copper sulfate highlighted the need for new antibacterial agents. In vitro analysis of the antagonistic activity of fifty-four native epiphytic bacterial isolates from the Citrus phyllosphere towards pathogenic Pss resulted in the selection of eight potential biocontrol strains according to their various antagonistic activities. Based on analysis of the (partial) 16S rRNA gene sequence and the rpoD housekeeping gene, five isolates were presumptively identified as Pseudomonas atacamensis (strains Y28, Y58 and Y128), P. cremoris (strain Y40), and P. lactis (strain Y21). In vivo test of these antagonistic strains showed no pathogenicity towards plant tissues. Three strains (Y28, Y128 and Y21) exhibited considerable inhibitory activities and significantly reduced disease severity in five Citrus cultivars (Cassar, Eurêka, Maltaise, Washington Navel and Pomelo) on shoots, leaves and fruits. Determination of genes coding for antibiotic production showed the presence of gacA gene in the five strains mentioned above. However, the genes prnD, pltC, pltB, phlD and phzC as well as phzD (and their homologs phzF and phzA), described earlier for Pf-5, were not detected among the tested Tunisian antagonistic Pseudomonas strains. This study presents the first description of P. atacamensis, P. cremoris, and P. lactis as potential biocontrol agents. The characterized bacterial strains may be considered as potential sources of novel bioactive metabolites as well as promising candidates to develop new biocontrol agents for sustainable control of Citrus. blast and black pit disease."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa -

About 3/4 of the networks were developing improved strategies for agronomic practices and about half of them were also involved in different knowledge-transfer activities between their members. Personal contact was the most used method to exchange and disseminate information within the networks as well as to elaborate improved strategies. The findings were analysed in view of the methods and practices commonly used to share both explicit (scientific) and implicit (practical) knowledge among practitioners. It was concluded that knowledge networks play an important role in the development of more resilient organic cropping systems, frequently making organic fruit growers the drivers of innovation. Networking for knowledge exchange was considered a process that encourages the active involvement of farmers in experimentation and innovation applying a method of knowledge sharing that is rooted in the very foundation of organic philosophy. Some recommendations and future research were suggested to further foster the development and functioning of networks for knowledge exchange."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75","5e70936e878c28a0473a95fc","5e70943c878c28a0473b8910"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"2960","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70943c878c28a0473b8910","622717262467f06c17646d47","622717262467f06c17646d48","622717262467f06c17646d49","622717262467f06c17646d4a","622717262467f06c17646d4b","622717262467f06c17646d4c","622717262467f06c17646d4d","622717262467f06c17646d4e","622717262467f06c17646d4f","622717262467f06c17646d50","622717262467f06c17646d51","622717262467f06c17646d52","622717262467f06c17646d53","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75","5e70936e878c28a0473a95fc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"76492123-acbe-4743-a4ae-6a63f3108e24"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pome fruits","stone fruits","citrus","informal knowledge"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058192904"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6220a3912467f004a5a777e0","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Bryk","documentHash":"aea3ca69-ea80-4da7-989d-949cd17711e2"},{"objectId":"5e7094f3878c28a0473c7b63","name":"Hubert","lastName":"Głos","uuid":"45E20D100DE5C1C9D26D61B6105F57BE339E164F0AD736F932937CEE47FC11D1ADACB4B02DE4BDA9F0E3C02807C6AF45DFB328D0CE759EC7386D9516A5864681","documentHash":"da3b9aca-bce0-4f1b-bda5-48d400ad037f"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4bed","name":"Monika","lastName":"Michalecka","uuid":"C4542F748AB90EAAE53D48D32DB2299EE413F85CB8C5165F0CEE9DE33455E3A6284B3B1369D30EDA7787A3F14A81BAC8F80A19C9D321DC7C75C0384BD8A75BD0","orcidId":"0000-0002-9875-4817","documentHash":"6f7a4b4a-295b-461c-98b7-62fae8ca7707"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398341","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Puławska","uuid":"A2F13D21947DD9E5CA8586F26E280B3CE2C9F1E3B7EDE455195E9E313A348C66551979BBD618F4DBE6F5E5EF071DC6DC28BB1E1BD29693C3A50E2DB9BBEFE4EF","orcidId":"0000-0001-5327-1056","documentHash":"3475c8e9-bf80-473e-9268-fbb10a5ccf56"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-05","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6220a3912467f004a5a777dd","doi":"10.3390/agronomy12020399","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/2/399/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The Recent Occurrence of Biotic Postharvest Diseases of Apples in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"For the years 2012–2018, we investigated the occurrence of storage diseases caused by fungi on four cultivars of apples grown in the central part of Poland.

The aim of the research was to assess the breeding value, based on the general combining abilities (GCA), specific combining abilities (SCA) and reciprocal (RE) effects, of six dessert parental forms of blackcurrant for plant growth vigour, plant habit and resistance to fungal diseases: Podosphaera mors-uvae (causal agent of powdery mildew of currant), Drepanopeziza ribis (leaf anthracnose) and Cronartium ribicola (white pine blister rust). The plant material consisted of seedlings of F1 generation obtained by crossing of six blackcurrant genotypes: ‘Bona’, ‘Ceres’, clone D13B/11, ‘Sofiivska’, ‘Vernisazh’ and ‘Big Ben’ in a diallel design according to Griffing’s Method III.It was shown that the cultivars ‘Big Ben’, ‘Sofiivska’ and ‘Vernisazh’ had significantly positive GCA effects for growth vigour and resistance of plants to powdery mildew, whereas ‘Ceres’ – for plant habit, which indicated their high breeding value for these traits. The significantly positive SCA values were estimated for the hybrid family: ‘Big Ben’ × ‘Ceres’ for low susceptibility of plants to powdery mildew and anthracnose. Statistically significant effects for reciprocal crosses (RE) were obtained only for few hybrid families."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928f878c28a047397eaf","5e709200878c28a04738e669","5e7094a7878c28a0473c1102"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"21","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"91-105","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094a7878c28a0473c1102","5e709200878c28a04738e669","5e70928f878c28a047397eaf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e56","mniswId":"322","title":"Acta Scientiarum Polonorum Hortorum Cultus","issn":"1644-0692","eissn":"2545-1405","documentHash":"b52d6e0d-adfb-46ab-ba0a-08c89420b431"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6310763b409707291a601757","year":"2022","volume":"21","number":"4","documentHash":"a3bbac68-dfe9-41dd-b085-641680460029"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["morphological traits","powdery mildew","anthracnose","white pine blister rust","Griffing’s diallel  desing","combining ability"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058203435"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"623a16472467f009d3017f0f","name":"Muhammet Fatih","lastName":"Aslan","orcidId":"0000-0001-7549-0137","documentHash":"b6d36e5f-e144-4672-9092-5a55d4608fc9"},{"objectId":"623a16472467f009d3017f0b","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Nacheva","documentHash":"396a482a-fb60-4aa7-86c7-d34cd93e3f81"},{"objectId":"623a16472467f009d3017f09","name":"Kadir","lastName":"Sabanci","documentHash":"20b8a882-22e8-4045-8309-2d7eb1821bb2"},{"objectId":"623a16472467f009d3017f07","name":"Vanya","lastName":"Slavova","documentHash":"2de1b5a1-6ec1-4c40-8480-3528750d7aad"},{"objectId":"5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ropelewska","uuid":"E3575740307CA373F3BD454AAC58C202E1C2CA28B9FC90C6BC3006DB867893BEE70DFAC85C7D9667CD0ACB7837B8DF63F7D6636679B032F0F1E0E534A3F3CBD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8891-236X","documentHash":"e9d0e369-fc46-40fe-9cb3-5236d6ea38a0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-18","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"623a16472467f009d3017f06","doi":"10.1007/s00217-022-04003-0","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00217-022-04003-0","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"A comparative evaluation of Bayes, functions, trees, meta, rules and lazy machine learning algorithms for the discrimination of different breeding lines and varieties of potato based on spectroscopic data","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The objective of this study was to compare the usefulness of machine learning algorithms for distinguishing the potato lines and varieties based on selected fluorescence spectroscopic data.

This paper focuses on developing and testing some techniques designed to identify automatically such microorganisms. More specifically, the recognition performed here deals with the specific five genera of soil bacteria. Their microscopic images are classified with machine learning methods using shape and image texture descriptors. Feature determination based on shape relies on interpolation and curvature estimation whereas feature recognition based on image texture resorts to the spatial relationships between chrominance and luminance of pixels using co-occurrence matrices. From the variety of modelling methods applied here the best reported result amounts to 97% of accuracy. This outcome is obtained upon incorporating the set of features from both groups and subsequently merging classification and feature selection methods: Extreme Learning Machine - Radial Basis Function with Sparse Multinomial Logistic Regression with Bayesian Regularization and also k-Nearest Neighbors classifier with Fast Correlation Based Filter. The optimal parameters involved in merged classifiers are obtained upon computational testing and simulation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928f878c28a047397ea4","5e709400878c28a0473b4ac0","5e709292878c28a047398362","5e709295878c28a047398696","5e7094a5878c28a0473c0f43","5e709288878c28a04739774c","5e709400878c28a0473b4ad4"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The fruits of the Saskatoon berry are an important source of bioactive compounds, mainly polyphenols, but also macro- and microelements. The fruits of two Canadian cultivars of this species, ‘Honeywood’ and ‘Thiessen’, were used in this study. Physicochemical analysis showed that wheat beers with the addition of non-ozonated fruit were characterised by a higher ethanol content by 7.73% on average. On the other hand, enrichment of the beer product with fruit pulp obtained from the cv. ‘Thiessen’ had a positive effect on the degree of real attenuation and the polyphenol profile. Sensory evaluation of the beer product showed that wheat beers with the addition of ‘Honeywood’ fruit were characterised by the most balanced taste and aroma. On the basis of the conducted research, it can be concluded that fruits of both cvs. ‘Honeywood’ and ‘Thiessen’ can be used in the production of wheat beers, but the fermentation process has to be modified in order to obtain a higher yield of the fruit beer product."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709200878c28a04738e669"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709217878c28a04738fbcf","5e709214878c28a04738fa6b","5e709217878c28a04738fbd6","602cb8d09543c7410626e252"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"27","issue":"14","pagesFromTo":"4544","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62dfc5c14097073fe305dd54","5e709200878c28a04738e669","5e709214878c28a04738fa6b","5e709217878c28a04738fbcf","5e709217878c28a04738fbd6","602cb8d09543c7410626e252"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","issn":"1420-3049","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"85ea3d3d-2670-4384-98ee-1b5b44edab21"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cfc52c409707101fe8e84a","year":"2022","volume":"27","number":"14","doi":"","documentHash":"d0b76346-c170-4bfb-8400-99cd80c83139"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Saskatoon berry fruit","ozonation","wheat beers","quality of fruity wheat beers"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058210624"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4ac2","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Filipczak","uuid":"DF80C8D8C9ED74592E363265B540B7F6688E313F2B526E6A0B1400A2396075F5E7678E22E83DB844F28B3084237514161976A58528C98FD3894685E54323E1B8","orcidId":"0000-0002-7309-8526","documentHash":"4bcc2c59-0a77-4152-8e46-26dd6aaa0346"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a04739870d","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"6CC1C4D799791721CDD4A08073ABD28E696CCEDAADBE7AD17DF429F074E3CABF05F48BE0E47F6E1F7654F1421127740DD32AF05C6E4790E6F1EB6EFF4114903A","orcidId":"0000-0002-2505-2005","documentHash":"ddd623f2-a55c-4ec4-9216-2ffc49570a99"}],"objectId":"62dfde874097073fe30669d1","doi":"10.1080/03650340.2022.2103551","publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03650340.2022.2103551","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The summer sprays of iodine with calcium chloride are successful in biofortifying apples with iodine and improving their storability","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study investigated the impacts of spraying iodine (I) as potassium iodide (KI) and K-iodate (KIO3) with/without calcium chloride (CaCl2) on apple (Malus domestica Borth.) enrichment with I as well as on fruit quality. ‘Idared’ apple trees were sprayed with I: (i) in the summer, five times at a rate of 0.1 kg ha−1 in each treatment with or without CaCl2 and (ii) preharvest (2 weeks before harvest) at a rate of 0.5 kg ha−1.

Research indicates that certain plant bacterial path-ogens  are capable  of  causing  disease in  humans,  and  some  human  bacterial pathogens can  inhabit the plant environment and cause disease in plants. The infection of humans by plant bacteria may occur at direct physical contact with diseased plants and/or via the respiratory tract in mainly immunocompro-mised or otherwise stressed individuals. Indirect transmitters of plant and human microbes can be wind, rain, dust, insects, and animals. Human pathogenic bacteria may contaminate the soil and irrigation water, colonize the rhizosphere, more rarely also the phyllosphere, and can survive as epiphytes. Thus, the plant environment  may  become  a  reservoir  of  human  pathogens.  A  source  of  foodborne  human  pathogenic bacteria  can  be  unprocessed  or  unwashed  fruits  and  vegetables.  Especially  during  the  last  decade,  the processes underlying the cross-kingdom performance of pathogenic bacteria are intensively researched. However, in reality, the risk for human health at infections by plant bacteria and by human bacterial path-ogens surviving in the plant environment is still underestimated. The goal of the current review is to increase the interest in these issues in agricultural and general environments. Some basic strategies for infection and symptoms  of  diseases  caused  by  the  microorganisms  under  consideration  are  described. The  potency  of certain plant bacterial pathogens to surpass barriers towards humans and the interaction of human bacterial pathogens with the plant environment are addressed and the existing information is critically discussed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a0473983a3"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"30","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"11-30","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709292878c28a0473983a3","62dfb3b74097073fe305501c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a045","mniswId":"24079","title":"Journal of Horticultural Research","issn":"2353-3978","eissn":"2300-5009","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"596f1c57-1935-4f15-a7dd-7e110090c068"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62dfb3b74097073fe305501e","year":"2022","volume":"0","number":"0","documentHash":"50c39cbc-6b5a-4ca3-8ebe-9a2127de0877"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bacterial pathogens","crossing kingdom borders","human diseases","plant diseases","primary and secondary hosts"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058211347"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094ba878c28a0473c288a","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Flis","uuid":"78412F047A14A6B2DEA0EF6265D4E28D49F4E9E232E1631E8382327015C014E77DEC304BBE80DA66D98B4EBB04E2405D29F8788536A3D2C28A0451FD20CD08E4","orcidId":"0000-0003-1222-5410","documentHash":"667c971f-e5db-4118-857a-c290e1eec3ea"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b9214","name":"Anita","lastName":"Zapałowska","uuid":"C964795FB4A1F7F38D18098518A272789AFE3C30D093C621FB31B21D3CB77837B33AC6E45945EDCCE6A30E9A5BA9A2EE44E864DA10A90298D30652B90F3880F4","orcidId":"0000-0003-4297-9854","documentHash":"d65460ed-d44b-48df-946c-cb180d677d3c"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047390fc6","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Skwiercz","uuid":"3D6D1165507901F580B3B6D5BE187D2F6B2FB4DB90B7B03E8E5E397AFF8ED61BC2B4D253505139A8C1D0A183E07C152527F686835FEE061A7C13FD513E239939","orcidId":"0000-0002-7008-5674","documentHash":"46dc8107-a99c-4e03-8bf9-83f7764581a4"},{"objectId":"5e709229878c28a047390df7","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Koc-Jurczyk","uuid":"47B89EC3556010AB87739EE1A408D4BC13612644CB0C679E32AFC8E29D4420138C479EEB49B43D2D5D7414EA6D76A3B4ADD13AFB5C7C5414A0531F2B0E9F12BA","orcidId":"0000-0003-0596-4565","documentHash":"8454c984-d320-4e22-832c-27a225a677d1"},{"objectId":"5e709216878c28a04738fbb1","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Jurczyk","uuid":"C2E34CD22F5522E1C8D340CC76A0B741D5C96C7DF41DFC263EF5037980380C69D136EAE304192763F8DB3A77170B8DFFB25D3599DA792A1DD3BD1A71C78BB7FE","orcidId":"0000-0002-9491-6743","documentHash":"99f66ca4-62e1-4d0c-b59a-ec11462e11c0"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738faac","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Litwińczuk","uuid":"59F7F199ABD8CCAB39136B9343E39BAFB00DA150CA75DD67E4377D937CDE99BAC57FF580E2CA4CBA3189E371640FDADC084DA0C772AE10C2BEE9196EC013BC79","orcidId":"0000-0003-3586-467X","documentHash":"1723f868-b821-4e6c-8833-d3da96df65cf"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fa57","name":"Czesław","lastName":"Puchalski","uuid":"48A9D3645E6453E0D88B0B93081E2A47A8EA85C80F394FF00B2FE88C3F07C3AC1597E86C8AD8202506D2B049178D6B759B53F4C378EBDC237D2DED7581E77A34","orcidId":"0000-0001-5916-2678","documentHash":"7a0b2979-4837-40bc-bcb9-1a8ba26edd46"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-07-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63170f36409707488e9fac28","doi":"10.2478/johr-2022-0010","publicUri":"https://sciendo.com/pl/article/10.2478/johr-2022-0010","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Plant Parasitic Nematodes on Paulownia tomentosa in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Short-rotation woody plants of the genus Paulownia are attracting more and more attention as trees that produce biomass and reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

The article presents infor-mation about the PPN inhabiting the root zone of the Paulownia tomentosa plantation in Poland. In this study, the frequency and density of nematode populations in samples from seven plantations in Poland were determined. The extracted nematodes were identified at the species level on the basis of the male and female morphological characteristics according to several available identification resources. A total of 20 nematode species were identified, of which 9 were classified as accessory and 11 as occasional. Among them, Tricho-dorus viruliferus and Longidorus attenuatus belonging to the group of viral messengers were identified."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709214878c28a04738faac","5e709214878c28a04738fa57","5e709216878c28a04738fbb1","5e709442878c28a0473b9214","5e709229878c28a047390df7"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047390fc6"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec7","uid":"b8e-dSrkGa9KdyGzPNRLBaw","uuid":"1fe5fa7e-664f-448f-95c1-a19cc6a7664a","name":"Muzeum i Instytut Zoologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ba878c28a0473c288a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec7","parentUuid":"1fe5fa7e-664f-448f-95c1-a19cc6a7664a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec7","rootUuid":"1fe5fa7e-664f-448f-95c1-a19cc6a7664a","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"30","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"31-40","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922b878c28a047390fc6","5e709442878c28a0473b9214","5e7094ba878c28a0473c288a","5e709229878c28a047390df7","5e709214878c28a04738faac","5e709214878c28a04738fa57","5e709216878c28a04738fbb1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a045","mniswId":"24079","title":"Journal of Horticultural Research","issn":"2353-3978","eissn":"2300-5009","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"596f1c57-1935-4f15-a7dd-7e110090c068"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63171003409707488e9fb62f","year":"2022","volume":"30","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"51869f1f-fdb2-4f57-96cb-7b160d28c149"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["accessory and occasional nematode species","ecto- and endoparasites","virus vectors"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058229522"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"630f25574097071f37acde45","name":"Sergey","lastName":"Ust’ak","documentHash":"c3ffb1f8-9291-4e62-bcac-d05f28a0d029"},{"objectId":"630f25574097071f37acde44","name":"Robert Ato","lastName":"Newton","documentHash":"0665ee4c-ba33-46dc-9c4b-fbc6aa5acbe3"},{"objectId":"630f25574097071f37acde43","name":"Aigerim","lastName":"Mamirova","documentHash":"407e6f82-852d-40d3-8763-86f6177a41b7"},{"objectId":"630f25574097071f37acde42","name":"Oleksandr","lastName":"Zhukov","documentHash":"0448c9b3-bf24-46ed-928d-dde7b34aa3f2"},{"objectId":"630f25574097071f37acde41","name":"Valentina","lastName":"Pidlisnyuk","documentHash":"f3b4c09e-0f84-4efe-a55b-40752ecc7664"},{"objectId":"630f25574097071f37acde40","name":"Tatyana","lastName":"Stefanovska","documentHash":"2204de13-0351-4629-9a9d-007a052eb0d2"},{"objectId":"5e709350878c28a0473a70e9","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Kozacki","uuid":"A71F79FE71E57243D7F0E8913A863DA02E11E2D121CF0F2CA8D6A873C434B09D0905DF48A69167153CAF661C0DE7ED28C72E3EF92316C451EEE92251931C52FF","orcidId":"0000-0003-2847-2758","documentHash":"670d4628-dc31-46ee-a60e-1ab028e886a6"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047390fc6","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Skwiercz","uuid":"3D6D1165507901F580B3B6D5BE187D2F6B2FB4DB90B7B03E8E5E397AFF8ED61BC2B4D253505139A8C1D0A183E07C152527F686835FEE061A7C13FD513E239939","orcidId":"0000-0002-7008-5674","documentHash":"46dc8107-a99c-4e03-8bf9-83f7764581a4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"630f25574097071f37acde3e","doi":"10.3390/agronomy12092063","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/9/2063/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The Short-Term Effects of Amendments on Nematode Communities and Diversity Patterns under the Cultivation of Miscanthus × giganteus on Marginal Land","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The short-term effects of soil amendments on the structure, diversity and function of a nematode community of Miscanthus × giganteus was investigated. Crop was cultivated on marginal, nutrient-poor land amended with biochar in single and double doses (BD1 and BD2), biogas digestate (D), sewage sludge (SS), and hemicellulose waste (HW). Sampling was done after planting, in the middle and end of vegetation; morphology-based approach was used. 28 nematode taxa were identified, including 5 bacterivores genera, 4 fungivores genera, 5 herbivores genera (11 species), 2 omnivores genera, 5 predators genera. The general linear models, correspondence analysis and clustering were applied for evaluation. The total abundance of nematode taxa Filenchus, Dorylaimus, Cephalobus, Panagrolaimus, Aphelenchus, and Ditylenchus was depended on the sampling time and amendments. The incorporation of amendments affected nematode food web and resulted in suppression of plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs). It was revealed that community structure was more mature for SS, less stable for D and had inconclusive effects for BD1, BD2, and HW. Using amendments ensured pest control benefits which is important given concern that PPNs can inflict crop damage during increased cultivation of M × g. Further research is needed to examine amendments which can minimise PPNs without reducing populations of nitrogen-fixing bacterivores and fungivores."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709350878c28a0473a70e9","5e70922b878c28a047390fc6"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"2063","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["630f25574097071f37acde40","5e70922b878c28a047390fc6","630f25574097071f37acde41","630f25574097071f37acde42","5e709350878c28a0473a70e9","630f25574097071f37acde43","630f25574097071f37acde44","630f25574097071f37acde45"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d9","mniswId":"689","title":"Agronomy","issn":"2073-4395","eissn":"2073-4395","documentHash":"f748c34e-fa45-428e-abf2-7624cc5986fd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"630f25574097071f37acde3f","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"9","documentHash":"8b2e0ec7-c488-4c85-92bb-06e9d610a9ed"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["soil amendments","Miscanthus × giganteus","plant-parasitic nematodes","nematode faunal analysis","soil food web","nematode functional diversity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058229833"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ropelewska","uuid":"E3575740307CA373F3BD454AAC58C202E1C2CA28B9FC90C6BC3006DB867893BEE70DFAC85C7D9667CD0ACB7837B8DF63F7D6636679B032F0F1E0E534A3F3CBD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8891-236X","documentHash":"e9d0e369-fc46-40fe-9cb3-5236d6ea38a0"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4a25","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Szwejda-Grzybowska","uuid":"E63ABDF6CE3F6DA4DB877DAFB373AC8EE21CAFC0CDFAAA0BFF10BB63F29FB6F9DBDAEE1496421B5EA36DCA1A7313AA64673821B8C5CD0E767B6D9491422289A1","orcidId":"0000-0002-1260-5897","documentHash":"d87c59fd-a8de-4484-bf37-2aa30009886e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-18","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6329e8564097077b0b490c99","doi":"10.3390/agriculture12091495","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/12/9/1495","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Relationship of Textures from Tomato Fruit Images Acquired Using a Digital Camera and Lycopene Content Determined by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study aimed at correlating image features with the lycopene content of tomato fruit. Tomato cultivars with different fruit colors, such as ‘O˙ zarowski’ (yellow), ‘Marvel Striped’ (yellow-orange-pink), ‘Green Zebra’ (green), Sandoline F1 (red), Cupidissimo F1 (red), and Sacher F1 (brown) were selected for the study. The tomato fruits were imaged using a digital camera. The texture parameters were computed from the images converted to color channels R, G, B, L, a, b, X, Y, and Z based on the histogram, autoregressive model, gradient map, co-occurrence matrix, and run-length matrix. Lycopene content was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Pearson’s correlation coefficients (R), regression equations, and coefficients of determination (R2) were determined. The lycopene content in fruit ranged from 0.31 mg 100 g-1 for ‘Green Zebra’) to 11.83 mg 100 g-1 for Sacher F1. The correlation coefficient (R) between lycopene content and selected image textures reached -0.99 for selected textures from color channels G, b, and Y. The highest positive correlation (R parameter equal to 0.98) was obtained for texture from color channel Y.

To ensure economical and efficient seed processing, knowledge of the cultivars’ composition and physical properties may be necessary. Therefore, the correct identification of the cultivar of the apricot seeds may be very important. The objective of this study was to develop models based on selected textures of apricot seed images to distinguish different cultivars. The images of four cultivars of apricot seeds were acquired using a flatbed scanner. For each seed, approximately 1600 textures from the image, converted to the different color channels R, G, B, L, a, b, X, Y, and Z, were calculated. The models were built separately for the individual color channels; the color spaces Lab, RGB, XYZ; and all color channels combined based on selected texture parameters using different classifiers. The average accuracy of the classification of apricot seeds reached 99% (with an accuracy of 100% for the seeds of the cultivars ‘Early Orange’, ‘Bella’, and ‘Harcot’, and 96% for ‘Taja’) in the case of the set of textures selected from the color space Lab for the model built using the Multilayer Perceptron classifier. The same classifier produced high average accuracies for the color spaces RGB (90%) and XYZ (86%). For the set of textures selected from all color channels, i.e., R, G, B, L, a, b, X, Y, and Z, the average accuracy reached 96% (Multilayer Perceptron and Random Forest classifiers). In the case of individual color channels, the highest average accuracy was up to 91% for the models built based on a set of textures selected from color channel b (Multilayer Perceptron).

Images of four different piles of wheat, two of which were the bread and the remaining durum wheat, were taken and image pre-processing techniques were applied. Small-sized images were cropped from high-resolution images, followed by data augmentation. Then, deep features were extracted from the obtained images using pre-trained seven different CNN models (AlexNet, ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, Inceptionv3, DenseNet201, and Inceptionresnetv2). Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier was used to classify deep features.

The vegetables were analyzed for aerobic mesophilic bacteria, yeasts and moulds, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, coliforms and Escherichia coli number according to Polish standards.\n\nResults:\nThe most microbiologically contaminated vegetables occurred to be parsley, rocket and spinach, and the least contaminated was iceberg lettuce. The presence of total mesophilic bacteria was found in all samples. The highest average number of mesophilic bacteria was found for lamb’s lettuce, rocket, parsley and spinach. Numerous yeasts were presented in almost all leafy green samples while rocket and parsley were the most contaminated with moulds. Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from all samples of parsley. High populations of these bacteria were found in rocket and celery samples. Of the 122 vegetable samples, 95 (78%) were positive for coliforms, especially all samples of parsley were inhabited by these bacteria. 24% of all samples were contaminated by Enterococcus, mainly parsley, spinach and chive. The presence of E. coli was found in only one sample of spinach.\n\nConclusions:\nThe levels of aerobic mesophilic bacteria, yeasts and moulds, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus and coliforms in leafy green vegetables sold in Poland could be classified as moderate or low. The abundant presence of the studied microorganisms may pose a risk for some categories of people consuming leafy green vegetables, mostly immuno-compromised persons."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709295878c28a04739869a","5e70928e878c28a047397d8c"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"238-245","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928e878c28a047397d8c","5e709295878c28a04739869a"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547705a","mniswId":"1204","title":"Annals of Agricultural and Environmental Medicine","issn":"1232-1966","documentHash":"4344fa09-806f-46be-8782-5b910ef17efe"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"628dd331409707762448e9d1","year":"2022","documentHash":"bb4a708f-fe2e-4655-acbc-389d5054b9ca"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bacteria","fungi","prevalence","vegetables","microbiological contamination"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058254119"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6356378e4097076f28bb68db","name":"Anita","lastName":"Sønsteby","documentHash":"796c7140-7aa6-4e4f-bc2d-7e2b66f85dee"},{"objectId":"6356378e4097076f28bb68da","name":"Beatrice","lastName":"Denoyes","documentHash":"e51f1ef5-bacc-4f53-83ee-5680c114cead"},{"objectId":"6356378e4097076f28bb68d9","name":"Aurélie","lastName":"Petit","documentHash":"650792c7-dd3f-4ab6-9321-8777b0d4a1fd"},{"objectId":"6356378e4097076f28bb68d8","name":"Karine","lastName":"Guy","documentHash":"de1caa3c-fbc3-406b-99de-adb6ec913a0e"},{"objectId":"6356378e4097076f28bb68d7","name":"Marino","lastName":"Demene","documentHash":"5e7bd73f-f427-471d-93a7-74268d4759ab"},{"objectId":"6356378e4097076f28bb68d6","name":"Gianluca","lastName":"Savini","documentHash":"7144d14b-6888-4caa-8e71-7dc94096863e"},{"objectId":"6356378e4097076f28bb68d5","name":"Daniela","lastName":"Mott","documentHash":"136537b5-3f7f-4c1f-96c4-99844b039cfa"},{"objectId":"6356378e4097076f28bb68d4","name":"Klaus","lastName":"Eimert","documentHash":"db529d46-47bb-4952-9f5d-21b7ad470975"},{"objectId":"6356378e4097076f28bb68d3","name":"Bastienne","lastName":"Brauksiepe","documentHash":"6dfbdb08-0db1-4a0a-8edf-a726ee54fb03"},{"objectId":"6356378e4097076f28bb68d2","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Sowik","documentHash":"ba613606-275a-4b83-acbf-2ab7b408d692"},{"objectId":"6356378e4097076f28bb68d1","name":"Rodmar","lastName":"Rivero","documentHash":"65d5bc3d-8071-4749-8f3e-8bcdcd39f1c7"},{"objectId":"6356378e4097076f28bb68d0","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kusnierek","documentHash":"b7f24047-44dc-48a9-b915-818c60a62b48"},{"objectId":"6356378e4097076f28bb68cf","name":"Ola M.","lastName":"Heide","documentHash":"caaa7e08-f3f3-47dc-91b2-a6ce78f6894f"},{"objectId":"6356378e4097076f28bb68ce","name":"Tomasz L.","lastName":"Woznicki","documentHash":"ed481dd7-1234-4a12-a49c-863089c3007a"},{"objectId":"6356378e4097076f28bb68cd","name":"Erika","lastName":"Krüger","documentHash":"07ba7df5-d6e0-4a0a-9586-1658e5999454"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397eaf","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Masny","uuid":"1F339AF20AD04B12026C56880F3C3B14CD67FDFBF04C4F0F747194E7FE88D355D5D8CC47EBDFB5327AC47237CF1139F5E348395AE3A6A14D01F3BCA771F5F703","orcidId":"0000-0002-6727-5653","documentHash":"1b781e37-8fe9-473e-8e62-0103934482ee"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6356378e4097076f28bb68cb","doi":"10.3390/horticulturae8100933","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2311-7524/8/10/933/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Flowering Phenology of Six Seasonal-Flowering Strawberry Cultivars in a Coordinated European Study","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The flowering phenology of six genetically distant strawberry cultivars (‘Candonga®’ (ES), ‘Clery’ (IT), ‘Florence’ (UK), ‘Frida’ (NO), ‘Gariguette’ (FR), and ‘Sonata’ (NL)) was studied for 3 years in relation to climatic parameters in open-field cultivation at three locations (Norway, Poland, Germany) and in soil-less cultivation at two locations (Italy, and France), covering a distance of 16 degrees of latitude. This proved to be a useful approach for unravelling the climatic adaptation and plasticity of strawberry genotypes and their suitability both for profitable cultivation and as a breeding pedigree. Despite the intercorrelated character of the climatic variables, the observed results highlight the importance of global radiation as a powerful modifying phenological factor in strawberry. Generally, early flower initiation was associated with elevated temperature and global radiation. ‘Frida’ revealed the highest dependency on global radiation for flower initiation, while ‘Sonata’ was least affected by temperature and radiation. In general, temperature and global radiation in periods both preceding and following flower initiation had a stronger positive effect on the number of flowers than on crowns, especially under open-field conditions.

Nondestructive procedures combining image analysis and machine learning can be used to control the quality of processed foods. This study was aimed at developing an innovative approach to distinguishing fresh and lacto-fermented red bell pepper samples involving selected image textures and machine learning algorithms. Before processing, the pieces of fresh pepper and samples subjected to spontaneous lacto-fermentation were imaged using a digital camera. The texture parameters were extracted from images converted to different color channels L, a, b, R, G, B, X, Y, and Z. The textures after selection were used to build models for the classification of fresh and lacto-fermented samples using algorithms from the groups of Lazy, Functions, Trees, Bayes, Meta, and Rules. The highest average accuracy of classification reached 99% for the models developed based on sets of selected textures for color space Lab using the IBk (instance-based K-nearest learner) algorithm from the group of Lazy, color space RGB using SMO (sequential minimal optimization) from Functions, and color space XYZ and color channel X using IBk (Lazy) and SMO (Functions). The results confirmed the differences in image features of fresh and lacto-fermented red bell pepper and revealed the effectiveness of models built based on textures using machine learning algorithms for the evaluation of the changes in the pepper flesh structure caused by processing."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"19","pagesFromTo":"2956","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","632dd9334097073ab888a1bf","632dd9334097073ab888a1c0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"Foods","eissn":"2304-8158","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"0f59a8f0-a1f9-45c0-ba10-cec780ad3d19"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"632dd9334097073ab888a1bb","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"19","doi":"","documentHash":"6ca08cfc-675e-4fa0-afb2-719b19257ab0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pepper preservation","spontaneous lacto-fermentation","image processing","texture parameters","discrimination","machine learning algorithms"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058261686"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ropelewska","uuid":"E3575740307CA373F3BD454AAC58C202E1C2CA28B9FC90C6BC3006DB867893BEE70DFAC85C7D9667CD0ACB7837B8DF63F7D6636679B032F0F1E0E534A3F3CBD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8891-236X","documentHash":"e9d0e369-fc46-40fe-9cb3-5236d6ea38a0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6353fa994097070bd14dd05d","doi":"10.3390/agriculture12101730","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/12/10/1730","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Assessment of the Influence of Storage Conditions and Time on Red Currants (<i>Ribes rubrum</i> L.)

For more than 50 years, micropropagation methods have been used in Poland whenever vegetative reproduction is necessary.

Various goals have been pursued in the development of regenerative and in vitro propagation systems for each of the aforementioned groups of plants, such as pathogen elimination, reproduction of healthy plants, rapid multiplication of newly obtained valuable breeding lines and cultivars, and breeding to obtain polyploids, haploids, and doubled haploids.

The present review outlines the main modes of action of these microorganisms at their interaction with bacterial and fungal plant pathogens, including antibiosis through production of secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activity, competition for nutrients and space, and/or parasitism. Often some of the beneficial bacteria combine more than one mode of action. In addition to their adverse effect on the pathogens, certain bacterial biocontrol agents show a potential to promote the plant growth and induce plant resistance to infection and other stresses. The modes of action are supported with examples of more recent and some earlier research findings referring primarily to horticultural crops. Described are some commercial preparations based on bacteria, registered for practical use as protectors against bacterial and fungal diseases.

This study is aimed to classify sour cherry pits with different cultivars using modern deep learning-based methods. In this context, four sour cherry cultivars were harvested and the pits extracted from these cherries were used in the study. Cherry pits' images were acquired by bringing the pits of each cultivar together. In the next pre-processing step, each pit was cropped with the help of thresholding to handle each pit in the images separately. The next step was data augmentation, which provided data diversity and robust learning, to increase the cherry pit images. In the last step, cherry pits were classified using four different state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) models: GoogleNet, ResNet18, ResNet50, MobileNetv2.

Hydrogen peroxide stabilized with silver (H2O2-Ag+) and captan, pyraclostrobin + boscalid and methyl thiophanate + tetraconazole were used to treat hyacinth bulbs before planting, in the form of a 20 min soak. The effect of the treatment on the development of fungi on the bulbs and substrate was evaluated during rooting in the refrigerated storerooms and after placement in the greenhouse. Observations were also made on the effect of treatment on hyacinth growth and development. The study showed a significant effect of H2O2-Ag+ and fungicides used for the treatment of hyacinth on reducing the development of fungi on bulbs and substrate during the period of hyacinth rooting. It was found that H2O2-Ag+, at concentrations ranging from 2% to 10%, significantly increased the Chlorophyll Index and Nitrogen Balance Index. In some of the concentrations tested, it also increased petal width, inflorescence width, the number of flowers, leaf length, leaf width, plant quality, fresh weight without inflorescences and the dry weight of plants without inflorescences at some of the concentrations tested. It was shown that, for all fungicides used, flower diameter, inflorescence width, total height, leaf length, leaf width, plant fresh weight without inflorescence and plant dry weight without inflorescence were significantly increased compared to control plants.

Due to the fact that these products are mainly consumed raw and are usually not subjected to processes that reduce their microbiological contamination, they become a source of infection and transmit pathogens causing food poisoning in humans. Salmonella bacteria are a serious treat to human health and remain a serious problem in many parts of the world.\n\nObjective:\nThe aim of this study was to review the current state of knowledge regarding the prevalence of Salmonella bacteria on fresh fruit and vegetables. Attention is also given to the mechanisms by which these bacteria adapt to colonize plants. Methods that can prevent contamination of plant products by the bacteria are also analyzed.\n\nReview methods:\nThe review was based on data obtained from scientific articles published in the Science Direct and Pub Med database between 2007 – 2022, found with the use of the following keywords: Salmonella, fruit, vegetables, food contamination.\n\nBrief description of the state of knowledge:\nData from the literature report that fresh fruit and vegetables are a source of Salmonella contamination through contact with soil, manure, compost, water or staff.\n\nSummary:\nActions targeting salmonellosis prevention should be undertaken by both the public and private sectors. Government regulations and stricter measures put in place can provide a framework that guides both domestic production and international imports. Periodic training of workers dealing with food is also important. Attention should be directed mainly to production control and less to the testing of final products. Education leading to increased awareness of salmonellosis should be indispensable."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397d8c"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"30","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"9-14","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928e878c28a047397d8c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547705a","mniswId":"1204","title":"Annals of Agricultural and Environmental Medicine","issn":"1232-1966","eissn":"1232-1966","documentHash":"b31b4b25-9a38-44f0-af3e-954c16558214"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"628dd331409707762448e9d1","year":"2022","documentHash":"bb4a708f-fe2e-4655-acbc-389d5054b9ca"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["food safety","vegetables","fruit","Salmonella","salmonellosis","food contamination"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058321311"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62dfe2ad4097073fe3069299","name":"Florent","lastName":"Lassalle","documentHash":"c61fc2ff-4b7f-4dc1-a82d-bf962bdcae4d"},{"objectId":"62dfe2ad4097073fe3069298","name":"Kornelia","lastName":"Smalla","documentHash":"9049e02c-75b8-44a6-ad37-3a7433d3a9d9"},{"objectId":"62dfe2ad4097073fe3069297","name":"Susanne","lastName":"Verbarg","documentHash":"66f58a61-09a5-4ec2-a55f-b97faf1810d4"},{"objectId":"62dfe2ad4097073fe3069295","name":"Jörg","lastName":"Overmann","documentHash":"644478f7-c621-4792-9919-b859e0c02122"},{"objectId":"62dfe2ad4097073fe3069294","name":"Enrico","lastName":"Biondi","documentHash":"7762a975-7f97-4aa2-82da-8982054f4f53"},{"objectId":"62dfe2ad4097073fe3069293","name":"Nemanja","lastName":"Kuzmanović","documentHash":"2a13c1e0-8810-4951-a936-b77c18c52056"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398341","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Puławska","uuid":"A2F13D21947DD9E5CA8586F26E280B3CE2C9F1E3B7EDE455195E9E313A348C66551979BBD618F4DBE6F5E5EF071DC6DC28BB1E1BD29693C3A50E2DB9BBEFE4EF","orcidId":"0000-0001-5327-1056","documentHash":"3475c8e9-bf80-473e-9268-fbb10a5ccf56"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62dfe2ad4097073fe3069291","doi":"10.1186/s12864-022-08662-x","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12864-022-08662-x.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Genomic analysis provides novel insights into diversification and taxonomy of Allorhizobium vitis (i.e. Agrobacterium vitis)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background\n\nAllorhizobium vitis (formerly named Agrobacterium vitis or Agrobacterium biovar 3) is the primary causative agent of crown gall disease of grapevine worldwide. We obtained and analyzed whole-genome sequences of diverse All. vitis strains to get insights into their diversification and taxonomy.\nResults\n\nPairwise genome comparisons and phylogenomic analysis of various All. vitis strains clearly indicated that All. vitis is not a single species, but represents a species complex composed of several genomic species. Thus, we emended the description of All. vitis, which now refers to a restricted group of strains within the All. vitis species complex (i.e. All. vitis sensu stricto) and proposed a description of a novel species, All. ampelinum sp. nov. The type strain of All. vitis sensu stricto remains the current type strain of All. vitis, K309T. The type strain of All. ampelinum sp. nov. is S4T. We also identified sets of gene clusters specific to the All. vitis species complex, All. vitis sensu stricto and All. ampelinum, respectively, for which we predicted the biological function and infer the role in ecological diversification of these clades, including some we could experimentally validate. All. vitis species complex-specific genes confer tolerance to different stresses, including exposure to aromatic compounds. Similarly, All. vitis sensu stricto-specific genes confer the ability to degrade 4-hydroxyphenylacetate and a putative compound related to gentisic acid. All. ampelinum-specific genes have putative functions related to polyamine metabolism and nickel assimilation. Congruently with the genome-based classification, All. vitis sensu stricto and All. ampelinum were clearly delineated by MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Moreover, our genome-based analysis indicated that Allorhizobium is clearly separated from other genera of the family Rhizobiaceae.\nConclusions\n\nComparative genomics and phylogenomic analysis provided novel insights into the diversification and taxonomy of Allorhizobium vitis species complex, supporting our redefinition of All. vitis sensu stricto and description of All. ampelinum. Our pan-genome analyses suggest that these species have differentiated ecologies, each relying on specialized nutrient consumption or toxic compound degradation to adapt to their respective niche."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398341"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"462","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62dfe2ad4097073fe3069293","62dfe2ad4097073fe3069294","62dfe2ad4097073fe3069295","5e709292878c28a047398341","62dfe2ad4097073fe3069297","62dfe2ad4097073fe3069298","62dfe2ad4097073fe3069299"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454773cd","mniswId":"2618","title":"BMC GENOMICS","issn":"1471-2164","eissn":"1471-2164","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"4a18f4d6-0134-48a0-a495-8e67736f3761"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6209ffde2467f06a1ed9a273","year":"2022","volume":"23","number":"1","documentHash":"17e14247-534a-4a7f-a6fe-c4f0da8a1a6d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Allorhizobium vitis sensu stricto","Allorhizobium ampelinum","Rhizobiaceae","agrobacteria","grapevine crown gall","taxonomy","plant pathogenic bacteria","clade-specific genes","ecological specialization","pan-genome analysis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058324974"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"62de841640970762378f6525","name":"Sobhi F.","lastName":"Lamlom","orcidId":"0000-0002-5003-9275","documentHash":"f10ef2f7-b330-4335-8a67-95d3dc0eb2ea"},{"objectId":"62de841640970762378f6524","name":"Gawhara A.","lastName":"El-Sorady","documentHash":"b5addc8b-d05c-4a06-9b90-21805c7dc96d"},{"objectId":"62de841640970762378f6522","name":"Hayssam M.","lastName":"Ali","orcidId":"0000-0001-6801-4263","documentHash":"13710a39-be4d-4a1f-bd84-0a2b5e8f92e9"},{"objectId":"62de841640970762378f6521","name":"Asma A.","lastName":"Al-Huqail","documentHash":"06a3bf66-3e87-4a5c-8068-86de6aed1aef"},{"objectId":"62de841640970762378f6520","name":"Muhammad Moaaz","lastName":"Ali","orcidId":"0000-0002-3092-6328","documentHash":"0dca205b-a384-47c8-8695-b50f5aa55697"},{"objectId":"62de841640970762378f651f","name":"Ehab A.

Giza 6). Before planting, the seeds were inoculated with two biofertilizers, mycorrhiza and phosphorine, and were considered the main plot. The subplot contained foliar sprays of nanoparticles, i.e., 200 ppm boron (B), 200 ppm calcium (Ca), their combination (Ca+B), and the control (no spray). The results revealed that mycorrhiza significantly increased 100-seed weight (70.45 g), seed yield (1.9 ton/ha), biological yield (7.5 ton/ha), crop growth rate (CGR) (2.9 g day−1 m−2), branching number (12.5), and protein content (22.96) compared with the control or phosphorine. Among the nanoparticles, Ca+B maximally improved plant height, CGR, 100-seed weight, shelling percentage, seed yield, oil content, and seed protein, while plants treated with B exhibited maximum seed nitrogen, pods per plant, and biological yield compared to other treatments. Overall, plants treated with Ca and B nanoparticles and mycorrhiza exhibited remarkable improvement in their growth, yield, and biochemical attributes, suggesting that nanotechnology and biofertilization are steps toward environmentally friendly, progressive farming. This study laid the basis for further elucidation of the molecular mechanism of plants in response to these nanoparticles and biofertilizers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398362"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"398","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62de841640970762378f651d","62de841640970762378f651e","62de841640970762378f651f","62de841640970762378f6520","62de841640970762378f6521","62de841640970762378f6522","5e709292878c28a047398362","62de841640970762378f6524","62de841640970762378f6525"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d9","mniswId":"689","title":"Agronomy","issn":"2073-4395","eissn":"2073-4395","documentHash":"f748c34e-fa45-428e-abf2-7624cc5986fd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"62026fd82467f069467a364d","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"2","documentHash":"52209a99-1c5b-47da-bd71-0065e154d8d6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["peanut (Arachis hypogea L.)","biofertilization","nanoparticles","phosphorine","crop growth rate","calcium","boron","mycorrhiza"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058325213"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c26","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Uliński","uuid":"70D51C7737F08D2FAB26C056CFD4DAAA7F26B92308CCD857CB6B7A347164B16FA49E42E2750AC0E3EB7C2CB7AFC5540C4B44ED4692C63AEF4BB762936957890C","documentHash":"17e70f30-f74b-4173-bc64-8f99f340a50e"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a0473986a0","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Szumigaj-Tarnowska","uuid":"44BD55B1A827378115ECF94E36B9C5D7CB565EDBC82CCB99CFF17D89AB8B139939220CB544AA4EC0C58E3C379CF89426DD74FF6B4D1C13B3B4D6FF4230885893","orcidId":"0000-0001-6737-2464","documentHash":"99a1c43c-e6b5-49f4-ad3b-5b354eb1da50"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"62e8d1944097075a21d8c937","doi":"10.14199/ppp-2022-019","publicUri":"http://www.progress.plantprotection.pl/download.php?ma_id=4486","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Wpływ ilości wody użytej do nawodnienia okrywy na rozwój chorób bakteryjnych pieczarki","otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"The effect of amount of water used to irrigate casing soil on the development of bacterial diseases of the white button mushrooms"}],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Najczęściej pojawiającymi się chorobami bakteryjnymi pieczarki są plamistość brunatna wywoływana przez Pseudomonas tolaasii i pla-\nmistość imbirowa wywoływana przez Pseudomonas ‘gingeri’.

The aim of this study\nwas to evaluate the efficacy of hygienic behavior in a local population of honey bees in\nreducing Varroa infestation. A bi-directional selection for high and low rates of hygienic\nbehavior was carried out in Israel using either artificially inseminated or naturally mated\nqueens.

Furthermore, we exam-\nined the costs and benefits of the selection, and possible trade-offs, using the above\nmeasurements of colony performance to ensure their productivity. The selection process\nrevealed that the trait is heritable. The maternal phenotype has a significant effect on Varroa\nload, as colonies founded by hygienic daughter queens showed a significantly lower parasite\nload. No major trade-offs were found between the rate of hygienic behavior, honey yield,\nand population size. Measuring the direct benefits of hygienic behavior through colony per-\nformance suggests that breeding for this trait makes bees more resistant to Varroa destruc-\ntor.

During human ontogeny, activational effects of testosterone on body size and strength offers another pathway to physical fitness. We tested these hypotheses by examining the organizational and activational effects of testosterone on vertical jump performance in athletic boys. Using a cross-sectional design, 173 boys (aged 9 to 18 years) were tested for standing height, body mass, body fat, fat-free mass, weekly training activity, training history, salivary testosterone and cortisol, R2D:4D, L2D:4D, and right-left 2D:4D (Dr-1), and vertical height in 3 different countermovement jump (CMJ) tests. A generalized additive model was employed to delineate age-related trajectories and predict CMJ performance. Our models yielded significant non-linear increases (or changes) in body size, current hormone concentration, training outcomes, and CMJ performance with chronological age. All 2D:4D measures were age invariant. The R2D:4D and testosterone were significant non-linear predictors of CMJ height with (R2 = 66.2%) or without (R2 = 54.3%) covariates, whereby a higher current testosterone concentration (up to a certain level) and a lower or higher R2D:4D were linked to better performance. The L2D:4D and Dr-1 had no predictive value. In conclusion, the R2D:4D and testosterone were co-predictors of CMJ height among athletic boys, with non-linear performance effects that differed in timing, tempo, and direction. Our findings confirm that testosterone can regulate a simple measure of boy's physical fitness through both an activational and organizational pathway."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut

particularly at a European Union level, though some general knowledge about pest and disease incidence can be found. Such information is crucial to improve the efficacy of a targeted knowledge transfer to organic fruit growers and advisors aiming at an increased adoption of innovative practices. A survey was thus carried out in seventeen European countries (16 EU member states and Switzerland), within the framework of the EU-funded project BIOFRUITNET, aiming at filling this knowledge gap also in terms of research needs. A questionnaire including a section about general aspects of orchard management (functional biodiversity, fertilization management, varietal/rootstock selection) and a section specifically dedicated to pest and disease occurrence and management in organic orchards was utilized to interview about 250 professionals (farmers and advisors), 155 of which were involved in pome fruits (including apple and pear) production. The analysis of the answers related to plant protection pointed out a varied situation about pest and disease occurrence in apple and pear orchards across Europe, though related to the zonal location of the respondent. However, more than 50% of respondents generally considered just few among the most damaging ones, normally co-occurring in the orchards. Interestingly, regardless of the respondents’ nationality or zonal location, more pests than diseases were indicated as relevant agents threatening organic pome fruits production. Nevertheless, only few measures promoting functional biodiversity in the orchards resulted in being broadly implemented in all regions. The analysis of the data underlines the strong demand for the development of a toolbox of measures that can be integrated successfully into the general orchard management strategy including the successful enhancement of functional or general biodiversity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75","5e70936e878c28a0473a95fc","5e70943c878c28a0473b8910"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"2136","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63a5677240970715e70af43e","63a5677240970715e70af43f","63a5677240970715e70af440","63a5677240970715e70af441","63a5677240970715e70af442","63a5677240970715e70af443","63a5677240970715e70af444","63a5677240970715e70af445","5e70943c878c28a0473b8910","63a5677240970715e70af446","5e70936e878c28a0473a95fc","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d1","mniswId":"675","title":"Agriculture (Switzerland)","issn":"2077-0472","eissn":"2077-0472","documentHash":"f51997b3-f7b4-40a9-9013-a896e341e147"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63848bf640970732086d9aae","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"12","documentHash":"a03ba25c-5ed6-492c-b357-db1a178c5ff8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["functional biodiversity","organic orchard management","disease resistance","research need"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058379574"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398d3c","name":"Jan","lastName":"Piecko","uuid":"D93B845F11898D39288E80412E7144384CBF4B52F99D5F14895BDA9F7728A41E39E4314B1B926B043A2D56FA8BADDB8ECB76C4560A10C660460F7645B8F56A24","orcidId":"0000-0001-6838-9364","documentHash":"d0c8e230-a87d-4417-9539-22b0874746e1"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397ebc","name":"Monika","lastName":"Mieszczakowska-Frąc","uuid":"6900A32F634EF1531D8F8C6ACE07E99EB67DDA525F899A042C0F3631CBD6903E79CD1E6BC74E398C0CD9A37D077102F17EEBAC43BB98995342398DA2B165761C","orcidId":"0000-0001-8786-7990","documentHash":"beeb1f34-0cfd-4aa6-909a-19583be25118"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a0473921fb","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Piotrowski","uuid":"A191821BD54C80F821C268DBE8C5798B13155276F336B86B6EDFCAD4D77CB94DDA5DE8338C1138D59770C2C47E91339BA30701209064C16DF169DBFBC8F8ACCB","orcidId":"0000-0002-1466-8322","documentHash":"dca25bfa-a468-4eea-a5c4-209cb375db6c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2022-12-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63aeba28409707743b2f8719","publicUri":"https://mans.org.pl/download/143/ptps/7684/nr-2-2022.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"EFFECT OF ULTRASOUND ON ThE CONTENT OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS AND SELECTED QUALITY PARAMETERS IN BERRY JUICES","otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"pol","title":"Wpływ ultradźwięków na zawartość związków bioaktywnych oraz wybrane parametry jakościowe w sokach z owoców jagodowych"}],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Aktualne trendy żywieniowe powodują, że konsumenci są\nzainteresowani żywnością oraz napojami, które dostarcza-\nją związków bioaktywnych o działaniu prozdrowotnym.

The fruit images of 'Mejhoul', 'Boufeggous', 'Aziza', 'Assiane', and 'Bousthammi' date varieties, converted to individual color channels, were processed to extract the texture parameters. After performing the attribute selection, the textures were used to build models intended for the discrimination of different varieties of date palm fruit using machine learning algorithms from Functions, Bayes, Lazy, Meta, and Trees groups. Models were developed for combining image textures selected from a set of all color channels and for sets of textures selected for individual color spaces and color channels. The models, including combined textures selected from all color channels, distinguished all five varieties with an average accuracy reaching 98%, and 'Bousthammi' and 'Mejhoul' were completely correctly discriminated for the SMO (Functions) and IBk (Lazy) machine learning algorithms. By reducing the number of varieties, the correctness of the date palm fruit classification increased. The models developed for the three most different date palm fruit varieties 'Boufeggous', 'Bousthammi', and 'Mejhoul' revealed an average discrimination accuracy of 100% for each algorithm used (SMO, Naive Bayes (Bayes), IBk, LogitBoost (Meta), and LMT (Trees)). In the case of individual color spaces and channels, the accuracies were lower, reaching 97.3% for color space RGB and SMO and LMT algorithms for all five varieties and 99.63% for Naive Bayes and IBk for the 'Boufeggous', 'Bousthammi', and 'Mejhoul' date palm fruits. The results can be used in practice to develop vision systems for sorting and distinguishing the varieties of date palm fruit to authenticate the variety of the fruit intended for further processing."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"26","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64e0292840e3ff494b5b6395","5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d1","mniswId":"675","title":"Agriculture-Basel","issn":"2077-0472","eissn":"2077-0472","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"e60fb638-9419-4766-9fd6-0e29d9cbaf0d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63b833d24097077b6bed5e2c","year":"2023","volume":"1","number":"13","doi":"","documentHash":"6287099d-e423-4b5b-86b6-74cfa02540ef"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["date palm","fruit image processing","varietal discrimination","performance metrics"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058415006"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63b82ceb4097077b6becb2ad","name":"Muhammet Fatih","lastName":"Aslan","documentHash":"e14a827a-2448-4bc5-b67a-5115b81287aa"},{"objectId":"63b82ceb4097077b6becb2ac","name":"Kadir","lastName":"Sabanci","documentHash":"b40b68b9-6899-43a7-a7e5-4396ec4bb826"},{"objectId":"5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ropelewska","uuid":"E3575740307CA373F3BD454AAC58C202E1C2CA28B9FC90C6BC3006DB867893BEE70DFAC85C7D9667CD0ACB7837B8DF63F7D6636679B032F0F1E0E534A3F3CBD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8891-236X","documentHash":"e9d0e369-fc46-40fe-9cb3-5236d6ea38a0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63b82ceb4097077b6becb2a7","doi":"10.3390/app13010206","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/app13010206","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The Use of Digital Color Imaging and Machine Learning for the Evaluation of the Effects of Shade Drying and Open-Air Sun Drying on Mint Leaf Quality","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The objective of this study was to reveal the usefulness of image processing and machine learning for the non-destructive evaluation of the changes in mint leaves caused by two natural drying techniques.

Texture parameters were extracted from the digital color images converted to color channels R, G, B, L, a, b, X, Y, and Z. Models based on image features selected for individual color channels were built for distinguishing mint leaves in terms of drying techniques and leaf side using machine learning algorithms from groups of Lazy, Rules, and Trees. In the case of classification of the images of the ventral side of fresh and shade-dried mint leaves, an average accuracy of 100% and values of Precision, Recall, F-Measure, and MCC of 1.000 were obtained for color channels B (KStar and J48 machine learning algorithms), a (KStar and J48), b (KStar), and Y (KStar). The effect of open-air sun drying was greater. Images of the ventral side of fresh and open-air sun-dried mint leaves were completely correctly distinguished (100% correctness) for more color channels and algorithms, such as color channels R and G (J48), B, a and b (KStar, JRip, and J48), and X and Y (KStar). The classification of the images of the dorsal side of fresh and shade-dried mint leaves provided 100% accuracy in the case of color channel B (KStar) and a (KStar, JRip, and J48). The fresh and open-air sun-dried mint leaves imaged on the dorsal side were correctly classified at an accuracy of 100% for selected textures from color channels a (KStar, JRip, J48), b (J48), and Z (J48).

The objective of this study was to characterize date fruits of the ‘Mejhoul’ variety using (i) objective and non-destructive image-analysis features and (ii) measurements of physicochemical parameters. Based on images acquired using a digital camera, more than 1600 texture parameters from the individual color channels L, a, b, R, G, B, X, Y, and Z, and 40 geometric characteristics (including linear dimensions and shape factors for each fruit), were determined. Additionally, pomological features, water content, water activity, color parameters (L*, a*, b*), total soluble solids (TSS), reducing sugars, and total sugars were measured. As a main result, the application of machine vision allowed for the correct detection of ‘Mejhoul’ dates and the determination of the image features. The differences in the values of the histogram’s mean (HMean texture) for individual color channels were determined. The ‘Mejhoul’ date fruit images in color channel a (aHMean equal to 145.88) and color channel b (bHMean: 145.49) were the brightest, and in channel Z they were the darkest (ZHMean: 4.23). Due to the determination of the elliptic shape factor (W1) of 1.000 and the circular shape factor (W2) of 0.110, the elliptical shape of the fruit was confirmed. On the other hand, ‘Mejhoul’ dates were characterized by a length of 47.3 mm, a diameter of 26.4 mm, flesh thickness of 6.25 mm, total soluble solids of 62.1%, water content of 28.0%, water activity of 0.652, hardness of 694 g, reducing sugars of 13.8%, and total sugars of 58.8%. Due to the determination of many image features and other parameters, this paper presents the first comprehensive characterization of ‘Mejhoul’ date fruits using a non-destructive imaging technique linked to some physicochemical quality attributes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"74","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64e0292840e3ff494b5b6395","5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d1","mniswId":"675","title":"Agriculture-Basel","issn":"2077-0472","eissn":"2077-0472","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"e60fb638-9419-4766-9fd6-0e29d9cbaf0d"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["date fruit","‘Mejhoul’ variety","image texture","shape factors","linear dimensions","color","physicochemical properties"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058415218"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63b40ed1409707221445e459","name":"Sonia","lastName":"Osorio","documentHash":"590bd4a1-039a-41d0-ae8c-0ba941dccdb9"},{"objectId":"63b40ed1409707221445e458","name":"Björn","lastName":"Usadel","documentHash":"702a7e9e-8ee9-4498-8292-541add218334"},{"objectId":"63b40ed1409707221445e457","name":"José G.","lastName":"Vallarino","documentHash":"85258aa8-a18a-473b-a105-1bf6b777c592"},{"objectId":"63b40ed1409707221445e456","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Jarret","documentHash":"a30ac167-d852-4114-825c-ab9657addbff"},{"objectId":"63b40ed1409707221445e455","name":"Erika","lastName":"Krüger","documentHash":"498234e2-a1e8-4116-a2cb-e92ff683af7c"},{"objectId":"63b40ed1409707221445e454","name":"Anita","lastName":"Sønsteby","documentHash":"19083898-a158-4c94-83ec-ef21a3e65c89"},{"objectId":"63b40ed1409707221445e453","name":"Rex M.","lastName":"Brennan","documentHash":"33ea4e13-855b-466a-93e8-f713d7104380"},{"objectId":"63b40ed1409707221445e452","name":"Derek","lastName":"Stewart","documentHash":"ebcb56f7-2fa3-4106-a5b5-29366d02061b"},{"objectId":"63b40ed1409707221445e451","name":"Ceri","lastName":"Austin","documentHash":"18f5c759-d7cb-4700-b812-62b08a0a010b"},{"objectId":"63b40ed1409707221445e450","name":"Nikki","lastName":"Jennings","documentHash":"33f90aeb-5dff-4f31-a9cc-f92779121904"},{"objectId":"63b40ed1409707221445e44f","name":"Sandra L.","lastName":"Gordon","documentHash":"4153b8e6-fa77-4f03-9b6c-ec619b361865"},{"objectId":"63b40ed1409707221445e44e","name":"Simon","lastName":"Pont","documentHash":"afe92b9b-0cde-4cc8-9100-0f4e9b887647"},{"objectId":"63b40ed1409707221445e44d","name":"J.

Our results showed that rainfall is a crucial factor associated with accumulation of delphinidin- and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, the two mayor blackcurrant pigments meanwhile temperature affects the main organic acid levels which can be decisive for fruit taste. Sensorial analysis showed that increases in terpenoid and acetate ester volatiles were strongly associated with higher appreciation score, while proacacipetalin, a cyanogenic-glycoside, was positively associated to bitter taste.

The use of biochar also contributes to eliminating the effects of soil fatigue, especially in perennial fruit crops. In our study, biochar was applied in the spring of 2014 in the cultivation of one-year-old peach trees of the cultivar Meredith. Biochar, an organic fertilizer, and microbiologically enriched compost were applied to the arable soil layer. In the experiment, three combinations with biochar were used: (1) biochar at 1.6 kg/tree, (2) biochar at 1.6 kg/tree + microbiologically enriched compost at 0.3 kg/tree, (3) biochar at 1.6 kg/tree + an organic fertilizer at 0.2 kg/tree. In the first growing season, no positive changes were found after the use of biochar. The highest number and yield of fruits in 2015 were obtained from the trees that were treated with microbiologically enriched compost, and the lowest in the combination where biochar + organic fertilizer were used to treat the peach trees. In 2016, the largest number of fruits and their greatest weight were recorded for the trees treated with biochar + organic fertilizer, whereas the control trees produced the lowest yields. The use of biochar with microorganisms and biochar with organic fertilizer improved the vegetative growth of trees compared to the growth of control trees."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398376","5e709292878c28a047398362","5e7094c3878c28a0473c3425"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"21","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"61-69","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c3425","5e709292878c28a047398362","5e709292878c28a047398376"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e56","mniswId":"322","title":"Acta Scientiarum Polonorum-Hortorum Cultus","issn":"1644-0692","eissn":"2545-1405","documentHash":"5794d722-a51c-4026-9add-bfdff6b5fd2f"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"636a5aab4097073ba719d3f9","year":"2022","volume":"21","number":"5","documentHash":"587816f8-c9dd-4323-9e0a-e153a7806466"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biochar","peach","organic matter","organic fertilizer","microorganism"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058438752"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63d23b1140970773d5390e8c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Mikuła","documentHash":"133121c5-6408-476b-b549-3c08433c99ae"},{"objectId":"63d23b1140970773d5390e8b","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Tomaszewicz","documentHash":"089d0106-8238-4833-9436-4f4bafe2fedc"},{"objectId":"63d23b1140970773d5390e8a","name":"Jan","lastName":"J.

Experiments were carried out on the apical dome of C. smithii J. D. Hooker (soft tree fern, Katote) to determine its morphogenic potential using 1/2 strength of Murashige and Skoog medium containing various concentration of thidiazuron [TDZ; 1-phenyl-3-(1,2,3-thiadiazol-5-yl)-urea)] (0.01, 0.1, 1.0, and 5.0 µM) supplemented with naphthalene acetic acid (0.25 µM). The success of the treatments was determined by the number of regenerants per explant, level of regenerant development, and nuclear DNA content in the green mesophyll cells. The highest number of regenerants was achieved in the presence of 5.0 µM TDZ and the lowest at 0.01 µM TDZ. The quality of development of the regenerants was expressed as the number of formed leaves and their growth per individual plantlet. The highest growth and development of regenerants occurred at the lowest concentration of TDZ (0.01 µM), and the lowest growth and development of regenerants occurred at the highest TDZ concentration (5.0 µM); however, the number of regenerants showed the opposite. In gametophytes, the nuclear DNA content ranged from 4.74–4.78 pg representing haploid level, whereas in sporophytes it ranged from 8.45–9.13 pg and was diploid. These results prove the stability of the regenerant genome after TDZ treatment of meristematic cells."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa -

The research was conducted in 2020-2021. The results\nof the studies showed that the largest number of vegetative shoots was formed by the cul-\ntivars 'Howes', 'Black Veil', 'Wilcox', and the lowest by the cultivars 'Corallium' and 'Pro-\nlific'. 'Crowley', 'Norman Le Munyon' and 'Woodman' began flowering the earliest (June\n9), while the cultivar 'Searles' (June 17) was the latest. The earliest, on September 23-24,\nfruits of the cultivars ‘Ben Lear', 'Early Black',' Early Richard’ and ‘Franklin’ and the latest,\non October 25-26, ‘Radacz', 'Red Star', ' Stankavich' obtained harvesting time.

The system (name: AGREUS®\n) includes sensors (soil moisture, salinity,\nweather data), executive modules (valve modules), and an application available on the web portal (accessed through\ncomputers and mobile devices). The studies were performed under laboratory and field conditions. Laboratory tests\nincluded appraisal of the precision of soil moisture and salinity measurements carried out with the soil probe\n(comparison with the results obtained by laboratory methods). Operational tests were conducted in field trials. In these\ntrials, assessment of the possibility of practical control of irrigation and monitoring soil salinity was performed in an\napple orchard. The conducted analyses have shown the usefulness of the system, not only for automatic control of\nirrigation but also for making decisions about the necessity to fertilize plants. The system enables continuous\nmonitoring of changes in soil moisture and salinity, including the migration of minerals across the soil profile (using\na probe with several measuring elements) as a result of the applied irrigation or rainfall. The system allows for\nautomatic application of irrigation or fertigation depending on the adopted soil moisture and salinity thresholds.\nHowever, the tests showed that a salinity index calculated by the system does not directly correspond to the salinity\nvalues determined by laboratory methods. For this reason individual interpretation and determination of optimal\nranges for plants is required."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut

In the field experiment, the effect of thirteen treatments was investigated, where fungal or bacterial inocula and mineral fertilizers at a standard dose and a dose reduced by 40% were applied individually or together. The fungal inoculum contained two species: Aspergillus niger and Purpureocillium lilacinum. The bacterial consortium consisted of three Bacillus strains: Bacillus sp., Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Paenibacillus polymyxa. The weight of weeds and the uptake of macronutrients by weeds in the apple orchard increased significantly more after the application of mineral fertilization than after the application of beneficial organisms. The increased uptake of macronutrients by weeds did not significantly change the mineral nutritional status of apple trees expressed as the content of N, P, K Mg and Ca in apple leaves. After the use of NPK mineral fertilization, also with the addition of beneficial organisms, the uptake of N by both weeds and apple trees increased. P and K were more efficiently absorbed by weeds and they achieved greater benefits from fertilization with these two macroelements than trees."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928f878c28a047397ea6","5e70928f878c28a047397ea4","5e709292878c28a047398362"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"2882","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928f878c28a047397ea6","5e709292878c28a047398362","63e1081640970740cdcbbfdf","5e70928f878c28a047397ea4"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d9","mniswId":"689","title":"Agronomy","issn":"2073-4395","eissn":"2073-4395","documentHash":"f748c34e-fa45-428e-abf2-7624cc5986fd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"636240f44097072c44a91493","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"11","documentHash":"77f4ac65-3232-47b6-a298-db2dfbe8ad0f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["orchard","spontaneous vegetation","competition","macronutrients","nutrient uptake","nutritional status","bacteria","fungi"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058509152"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ropelewska","uuid":"E3575740307CA373F3BD454AAC58C202E1C2CA28B9FC90C6BC3006DB867893BEE70DFAC85C7D9667CD0ACB7837B8DF63F7D6636679B032F0F1E0E534A3F3CBD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8891-236X","documentHash":"e9d0e369-fc46-40fe-9cb3-5236d6ea38a0"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398355","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Rutkowski","uuid":"12FCE51B754CE6013814BA39468E85A4F3081749D4E7D6BA8DCE97B6EDAC01099FEAFA280527E2603316A0DA0A38B5905A42617D78DC34AFA88E994720E65B75","orcidId":"0000-0003-1042-1098","documentHash":"6b92cf9a-54d1-4c20-a699-1dc83d97de38"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63f470694097075e45cbab8c","doi":"10.3390/agriculture13020498","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/13/2/498/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The Classification of Peaches at Different Ripening Stages Using Machine Learning Models Based on Texture Parameters of Flesh Images","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The ripening stage can affect consumer preference and the market value of peaches. This study was aimed at developing an objective, effective, and fast procedure for distinguishing the different stages of ripeness of peaches using image texture parameters and models built using traditional machine learning algorithms. The ripeness classes (distinguished using DA-Meter-based nondestructive VIS/NIR method) 0.1, 0.4, and 0.9 for ‘Redhaven’ peaches and 0.1, 0.4, and 1.0 for ‘Royal Glory’ peaches were considered. Fruit weight, ethylene production, total soluble solids content (SSC), titratable acidity (TA), and fruit firmness (FF) were measured. The slice images for each class were acquired. Selected texture parameters from images in color channels R, G, B, L, a, b, X, Y, and Z were used to develop classification models for distinguishing peach ripening stages in pairs. Models were built for combined textures selected from images in all color channels, individual color spaces, and individual color channels using various machine learning algorithms. The ethylene production and SSC was higher in peaches with a ripeness class of 0.1 than in less ripe fruit. The least ripe fruit of ‘Redhaven’ and ‘Royal Glory’ peaches were characterized by the highest fruit firmness. Furthermore, statistically significant differences in SSC between classes 0.1 and 0.9 of ‘Redhaven’ were observed. For ‘Royal Glory’, statistically significant differences in TA were determined between all classes. These differences may be related to classification performance metrics. In the case of ‘Redhaven’ peaches, two extreme ripeness classes 0.1 (the greatest ripeness) and 0.9 (the least ripeness) were correctly classified with the highest accuracy reaching 100% for models built based on textures selected from all color channels (random forest and Bayes net algorithms) and color space lab (random forest). For individual color channels, the accuracy reached 99% for color channel G (random forest) and color channel a (logistic). The accuracy of classifying ripening stages 0.1 and 0.4 reached 98% for the model built using textures from all color channels and color space lab (Bayes net). The ripening stages 0.4 and 0.9 were distinguished with an accuracy of up to 96% (all color channels, random forest). The classification of ripening stages of ‘Royal Glory’ peaches reached 100% for all pairs, 0.1 vs. 1.0 (all color channels, color spaces RGB, color space lab, color channel G, color channel a), 0.1 vs. 0.4 (all color channels, color space RGB, color space lab), and 0.4 vs. 1.0 (all color channels).

This fungus may survive in woody tissues without displaying symptoms, which makes the diagnostics more challenging. To provide a rapid and ef-ficient diagnostic tool for D. vaccinii, a new and specific TaqMan real-time PCR assay was developed using translation elongation factor 1 gene region. The assay was spe-cific to D. vaccinii and did not cross- react with any other tested Vaccinium pathogens. The sensitivity of the assay was found to be 1 pg of the pathogen DNA in water or in host DNA, which is equivalent to less than 20 hyphal cells. The assay was also used to test infected plant tissues, which determined that the assay can detect the pathogen from symptomatic as well as non-symptomatic material. Furthermore, D. vaccinii was detected  after  mixing  infected  asymptomatic  tissue  with  healthy  stem  tissues  at  a  proportion of 1:10 by weight. To co-amplify the D. vaccinii and the plant cytochrome oxidase gene as internal control in a single reaction, a duplex assay was successfully developed without any reduction in sensitivity.

This is especially important for breeding programs as, for example, when attempting to reinforce traits governing social immunity against pests and diseases. Here, we focused on breeding aiming at enhancing hygienic behavior, a trait that is known to reduce parasite load in honey bee colonies. To evaluate the contribution of drones versus queens to this trait, we conducted a two-step bidirectional selection program. First, we selected colonies with consistent phenotypes for low- or high-hygienic behavior (generation P). From those, we generated two types of daughter colonies (F1). One type originated from queens that had been artificially inseminated with selected drones that originated from queens of either low- or high-hygienic phenotype. The other type of colonies was set from naturally mated queens. We then compared the hygienic performance of the progeny colonies. In the next step, we used the F1 colonies (from either artificially inseminated or naturally mated queens) to produce naturally mated queens, which subsequently generated F2 colonies. These were then examined for the level of hygienic behavior. The results demonstrate the significant contribution of both parents to the phenotype of offspring. In particular, drones had a consistent and significant influence on the hygienic performance of the progeny throughout generations. These findings emphasize the great potential to propagate the hygienic trait in local populations by selecting lines for drones that carry the high-hygienic trait."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa -

The mixture of beneficial fungi contained two species: Aspergillus niger and Purpureocillium lilacinum. The mixture of beneficial bacteria contained three strains of Bacillus (Bacillus sp., Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Paenibacillus polymyxa). The application of beneficial microorganisms (especially bacterial strains) to the soil (without additional mineral fertilization) enhanced the growth of the apple trees. In the third year of the study (2020), the trees grown in the plots inoculated with bacteria bloomed the most intensively. Plant nutritional status (expressed as concentrations of elements in leaves) was not affected by the application of the bacterial strains or filamentous fungi.

Additionally, two combinations of the three mentioned amino acids were also applied: 500 glycine + 500 arginine + 500 glutamic acid (combination 1) and 1000 glycine + 1000 arginine + 1000 glutamic acid (combination 2), and compared with a control (untreated trees). The results indicated that the application of the three amino acids, solely or in combination, was effective at increasing the shoot length, shoot diameter, and leaf chlorophyll. Additionally, the applied treatments also improved markedly the fruit set percentage, fruit yield, fruit firmness, fruit content of total soluble solids (TSS %), vitamin C (VC), and total sugars as well as the leaf mineral content (nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus) compared with untreated trees in 2020 and 2021.

Subsequently, the stepwise regression analysis was employed to analyze the correlation of six epidemiological variables (minimum temperature, maximum temperature, minimum relative humidity, maximum relative humidity, rainfall and wind speed) with disease severity and yield loss (%). Disease predictive models were developed for each cultivar for final leaf rust severity and yield loss prediction. Principally, all epidemiological variables indicated a positive association with leaf rust severity and yield loss (%) except minimum relative humidity. The effectiveness of disease predictive models was estimated using coefficient of determination (R2) values for all models. Then, these predictive models were validated to forecast disease severity and yield loss at another location in Faisalabad. The R2 values of all disease predictive models for each of the tested cultivars were high, evincing that our regression models could be effectively employed to predict leaf rust disease severity and anticipated yield loss. The validation results explained 99% variability, suggesting a highly accurate prediction of the two variables (leaf rust severity and yield loss). The models developed in this research can be used by wheat farmers to forecast disease epidemics and to make disease management decisions accordingly."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398362"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"21","pagesFromTo":"13893","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63f6145a409707158a8a8936","63f6145a409707158a8a8937","63f6145a409707158a8a8938","63f6145a409707158a8a8939","63f6145a409707158a8a893a","63f6145a409707158a8a893b","63f6145a409707158a8a893c","63f6145a409707158a8a893d","63f6145a409707158a8a893e","63f6145a409707158a8a893f","5e709292878c28a047398362"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","eissn":"2071-1050","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"46882d20-8996-4dde-bd15-7d5f8ecc797a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"636258bf4097072c44ab8bbb","year":"2022","volume":"14","number":"21","documentHash":"53001c2a-58c5-4bba-88d8-497eb2d77551"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["leaf rust","regression model","Triticum astivum L.","yield loss","disease forecast"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526344"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63f61ab6409707158a8aed28","name":"Dalia H.","lastName":"Eshra","documentHash":"56accde3-e619-4631-a6b9-3c1b719c9210"},{"objectId":"63f61ab6409707158a8aed27","name":"Abdulwahed M.","lastName":"Aboukarima","documentHash":"0b365c39-02be-46d5-8a0d-85f449d38750"},{"objectId":"63f61ab6409707158a8aed26","name":"Adel M.","lastName":"Al-Saif","documentHash":"8a813070-4a46-4289-9a17-831742dd4707"},{"objectId":"63f61ab6409707158a8aed25","name":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Abdel-Sattar","documentHash":"35d4c081-f82c-4752-ae9c-eb91ffbc2d22"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398362","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Sas-Paszt","uuid":"F65BF0798F03691C5ACA3C2A1EA4E5FD87ED5CB37729DF32BC5DB47710F0EBA374AA8CB082C6E75E322B257742E90231A958EB8FE9204AC6F2B651D5DF6471FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-4076-4032","documentHash":"c4b1b795-a964-4309-87da-3ec6e5c5aacd"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63f61ab6409707158a8aed23","doi":"10.3390/agriculture12091303","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/12/9/1303/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Quality Attributes Prediction of Flame Seedless Grape Clusters Based on Nutritional Status Employing Multiple Linear Regression Technique","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Flame Seedless grape is considered one of the most popular and favorite grapes for consumers, since it ripens early, and has good cluster quality. Flame seedless grape marketing value depends upon its desirable appearance, berry, cluster size, and shape. Therefore, it is imperative that the cluster yield and quality are enhanced to ensure profitability. In this study, the prediction of physical characteristics of clusters and berries’ color attributes of Flame Seedless grape grown under different culture practices, in particular fertilization treatments, was carried out using nutritional status concentration (leaf mineral elements, total chlorophyll content, total carotenoids content) and multiple linear regression (MLR). The method was based on the development of two indices: the first is called index 1 (%) and was formulated by combing the mineral elements of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg concentrations; and the second is called index 2 (ppm) and was formulated by combing the elements of Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn, and B concentrations in leaf petioles. The results indicated that the established MLR models can obtain variation accuracy, based on values of coefficients of determination (R2) using the test set. The R2 values were in the range of 0.9286 to 0.9972 for cluster weight, cluster length, shoulder length, berries’ color attributes (L*, a*, b*, chroma, hue, and color index for red grapes (CIRG)). This study highlighted that during a grown season, leaf mineral elements, total chlorophyll content, and total carotenoids coupled with a MLR model can be used successfully to evaluate the physical characteristics of the cluster and berries’ color attributes of Flame seedless grape. This method is easy, fast and reliable as it retains the physical appearance of the fruits by adjusting the concentration of mineral elements, total chlorophyll content, and total carotenoids in leaves. Moreover, total chlorophyll had the greatest weight of all the predicted quality attributes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398362"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"9","pagesFromTo":"1303","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63f61ab6409707158a8aed25","63f61ab6409707158a8aed26","63f61ab6409707158a8aed27","63f61ab6409707158a8aed28","5e709292878c28a047398362"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d1","mniswId":"675","title":"Agriculture (Switzerland)","issn":"2077-0472","eissn":"2077-0472","documentHash":"f51997b3-f7b4-40a9-9013-a896e341e147"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63f61ab6409707158a8aed24","year":"2022","volume":"12","number":"9","documentHash":"4585f73b-ca8b-412c-9189-9ac6e26cfa90"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["carotenoids","chlorophyll","fertilization","grape","quality","modeling","leaf mineral","nutritional status"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526994"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63f716694097074c8dc1f93e","name":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Abdel-Sattar","documentHash":"9215e833-e6bb-4f42-92de-606884ad4f84"},{"objectId":"63f716694097074c8dc1f93d","name":"Hesham S.","lastName":"Abada","documentHash":"cf61b613-147c-4d2c-ada4-e370cdddec5a"},{"objectId":"63f716694097074c8dc1f93c","name":"Muhammad Moaaz","lastName":"Ali","documentHash":"b1ceb4b1-4e6f-40ff-b8dd-fcfdf2e0b419"},{"objectId":"63f716694097074c8dc1f93b","name":"Abaidalah A.","lastName":"Saleh","documentHash":"28405686-79d3-46ff-a7a7-2eae17963fda"},{"objectId":"63f716694097074c8dc1f93a","name":"Walid F.

Artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models were developed for TSS, acidity, VitC, Tsugar, and Rsugar from fresh citrus fruits by applying different independent variables, namely the dimensions of the fruits (length (FL) and diameter (FD)), fruit weight (FW), yield/tree, and soil electrical conductivity (EC). The results of ANN application showed that a feed-forward back-propagation network type with four input neurons (Yield/tree, FW, FL, and FD) and eight neurons in one hidden layer provided successful modeling efficiencies for TSS, acidity, VitC, Tsugar, and Rsugar. The effect of the EC variable was not significant. The hyperbolic tangent of both the hidden layer and the output layer of the developed ANN model was chosen as the activation function. Based on statistical criteria, the ANN developed in this study performed better than the MLR model in predicting the chemical attributes of fresh citrus fruits. The root mean square error of TSS, acidity, VitC, Tsugar, and Rsugar ranged from 0.064 to 0.453 and 0.068 to 0.634, respectively, for the ANN model, and 0.568 to 4.768 and 0.550 to 4.830, respectively, for the MLR model using training and testing datasets. In addition, the relative errors obtained through the ANN approach provided high model predictability and feasibility. In chemical attribute modeling, the FD and FL variables exhibited high contribution ratios, resulting in a reliable predictive model. The developed ANN model generally showed a good level of accuracy when estimating the chemical attributes of fresh citrus fruit."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398362"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"8","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"1016","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63f713d94097074c8dc1d1a5","63f713d94097074c8dc1d1a6","63f713d94097074c8dc1d1a7","5e709292878c28a047398362","63f713d94097074c8dc1d1a8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547ed47","mniswId":"27373","title":"Horticulturae","issn":"2311-7524","eissn":"2311-7524","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"d9822e24-c608-4514-bb91-1457594f0cb4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63f713d94097074c8dc1d1a4","year":"2022","volume":"8","number":"11","documentHash":"ad4f8ae4-bed5-48b6-be79-7dfc073375d3"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["artificial neural network","multiple linear regression","citrus tree","fruit chemical characteristics"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058527041"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63fb4a374097070abf6a3618","name":"Ahmed M.","lastName":"Rady","documentHash":"14efe3ed-a9d3-46e2-916b-4e6a0ff3f163"},{"objectId":"5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ropelewska","uuid":"E3575740307CA373F3BD454AAC58C202E1C2CA28B9FC90C6BC3006DB867893BEE70DFAC85C7D9667CD0ACB7837B8DF63F7D6636679B032F0F1E0E534A3F3CBD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8891-236X","documentHash":"e9d0e369-fc46-40fe-9cb3-5236d6ea38a0"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398d3d","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Celejewska","uuid":"FDCEEB3A3398B14BA2A79A9E46B12524EF57B8799F2954826CEAF6338AF3CCDB2259D7964948A16AA9BC767315B198FB2DFA532ED4180DCDD48B0493550DC265","orcidId":"0000-0003-3113-3722","documentHash":"ad533844-fc78-4918-9077-788c72f4d6b9"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398355","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Rutkowski","uuid":"12FCE51B754CE6013814BA39468E85A4F3081749D4E7D6BA8DCE97B6EDAC01099FEAFA280527E2603316A0DA0A38B5905A42617D78DC34AFA88E994720E65B75","orcidId":"0000-0003-1042-1098","documentHash":"6b92cf9a-54d1-4c20-a699-1dc83d97de38"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397ebc","name":"Monika","lastName":"Mieszczakowska-Frąc","uuid":"6900A32F634EF1531D8F8C6ACE07E99EB67DDA525F899A042C0F3631CBD6903E79CD1E6BC74E398C0CD9A37D077102F17EEBAC43BB98995342398DA2B165761C","orcidId":"0000-0001-8786-7990","documentHash":"beeb1f34-0cfd-4aa6-909a-19583be25118"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397e8f","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Kruczyńska","uuid":"4590C5A32BCE4E52E286005F898A668B074C4C1091D220F6C34A63EF546555DF0F120F110389C76C3AAFE6E4FDB39337FFC70A341586E583488C9B50DA101D8D","orcidId":"0000-0002-1376-1082","documentHash":"45900a7e-0b14-476a-8924-d1e4c1c151ab"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d79","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Konopacka","uuid":"B86F354E1D172AB3FC07EC420A8D0C595C402A1BC9E7C127CE71483941E67A0E0E10A48F14A1D7C43CF67CB2C1F72A7762DAA4B85BA44FA7556DEC983B617982","orcidId":"0000-0001-8566-3337","documentHash":"b4797e68-8f49-44ed-a833-4b0c27dc3244"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63fb47d24097070abf6a29b6","doi":"10.3390/agriculture13030562","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/13/3/562","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Evaluating the Classification of Freeze-Dried Slices and Cubes of Red-Fleshed Apple Genotypes Using Image Textures, Color Parameters, and Machine Learning","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Dried red-fleshed apples are considered a promising high-quality product from the functional foods category. The objective of this study was to compare the flesh features of freeze-dried red-fleshed apples belonging to the ‘Alex Red’, ‘Trinity’, ‘314’, and ‘602’ genotypes and indicate which parameters and shapes of dried samples are the most useful to distinguish apple genotypes. Apple samples were at the stage of harvest maturity. The average fruit weight, starch index, internal ethylene concentration, flesh firmness, total soluble sugar content, and titratable acidity were determined. One hundred apple slices with a thickness of 4 mm and one hundred cubes with dimensions of 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm of each genotype were subjected to freeze-drying. For each apple sample (slice or cube), 2172 image texture parameters were extracted from images in 12 color channels, and color parameters L*, a*, and b* were determined. The classification models were developed based on a set of selected image textures and a set of combined selected image textures and color parameters of freeze-dried apple slices and cubes using various traditional machine-learning algorithms. Models built based on selected textures of slice images in 11 selected color channels correctly classified freeze-dried red-fleshed apple genotypes with an overall accuracy reaching 90.25% and mean absolute error of 0.0545; by adding selected color parameters (L*, b*) to models, an increase in the overall accuracy to 91.25% and a decrease in the mean absolute error to 0.0486 were observed. The classification of apple cube images using models including selected texture parameters from images in 11 selected color channels was characterized by an overall accuracy of up to 74.74%; adding color parameters (L*, a*, b*) to models resulted in an increase in the overall accuracy to 80.50%. The greatest mixing of cases was observed between ‘Alex Red’ and ‘Trinity’ as well as ‘314’ and ‘602’ apple slices and cubes. The developed models can be used in practice to distinguish freeze-dried redfleshed apples in a non-destructive and objective manner. It can avoid mixing samples belonging to different genotypes with different chemical properties. Further studies can focus on using deep learning in addition to traditional machine learning to build models to distinguish dried red-fleshed 0apple samples. Moreover, other drying techniques can be applied, and image texture parameters and color features can be used to predict the changes in flesh structure and estimate the chemical properties of dried samples."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398355","5e70929a878c28a047398d3d","5e70928e878c28a047397d79","5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","5e70928f878c28a047397ebc","5e70928f878c28a047397e8f"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"562","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","5e70928f878c28a047397e8f","63fb4a374097070abf6a3618","5e709292878c28a047398355","5e70928e878c28a047397d79","5e70929a878c28a047398d3d","5e70928f878c28a047397ebc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d1","mniswId":"675","title":"Agriculture-Basel","issn":"2077-0472","eissn":"2077-0472","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"e60fb638-9419-4766-9fd6-0e29d9cbaf0d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63fb4bb84097070abf6a42a1","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"3ceb921f-226b-420e-aa2a-d053db989ea5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["red-fleshed apples","apple slices","apple cubes","freeze-drying","machine-learning algorithms"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058530202"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6405ae2440970761b8dd7d81","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kiełkowska","documentHash":"4b885c65-eb56-4b52-a9b7-753cb843cc7a"},{"objectId":"5e7093ff878c28a0473b4960","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Kiszczak","uuid":"21E156AC5DF0030496FC5034E60D2A594DB4D8768DF37120D0C8328EF316FACA445B8D6384CA4947C1A16ED2F6DC9ADE4D0B76850E036EFB346AE1343AD554EE","orcidId":"0000-0002-3925-5233","documentHash":"ffa5d5fc-448f-4973-be4f-3eba2d698d43"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6405ae2440970761b8dd7d80","doi":"10.3390/agronomy13030676","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/13/3/676/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"History and Current Status of Haploidization in Carrot (Daucus carota L.)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The induction of haploid cell development into normal plants enables the production of doubled haploid lines, which are homozygous and can be used in breeding programs as an alternative to conventionally derived inbred lines. In this paper, we present the historical background and current status of the attempts of haploid induction in carrot (Daucus carota L.). Economically, carrot is one of the most important vegetables. It is an outcrossing diploid (2n = 2x = 18) species. Nowadays, the seeds of hybrid cultivars constitute the majority of the carrot seeds sold in the world. Hybrid cultivars of carrot are produced using inbred populations. Inbreeding in this species is difficult due to an inbreeding depression and is also time-consuming, as it is a biennial crop. Therefore, the implementation of the haploidization technology into the breeding programs of carrot is of high interest. Androgenesis, gynogenesis and induced parthenogenesis are the methods that have been used for haploid induction, and their potential in haploidization of carrot is discussed. The centromere-specific histone 3 variant (CENH3) and its manipulation in carrot is also acknowledged."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ff878c28a0473b4960"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"676","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6405ae2440970761b8dd7d81","5e7093ff878c28a0473b4960"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d9","mniswId":"689","title":"Agronomy","issn":"2073-4395","eissn":"2073-4395","documentHash":"f748c34e-fa45-428e-abf2-7624cc5986fd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"640060a84097072cdeca7f63","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"3","documentHash":"dba78bcd-40aa-40a7-923f-01e43663db12"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["androgenesis","anther culture","carrot","doubled haploids","haploids","homozygosity","induced parthenogenesis","isolated microspore culture"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058536745"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6405a9f940970761b8dd3efb","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Górecka","documentHash":"21b9c2c8-f552-4326-af69-17cdd0a90e8c"},{"objectId":"6405a9f940970761b8dd3efa","name":"Maria","lastName":"Burian","documentHash":"ca8ecddf-70e3-485b-8870-e6367568509d"},{"objectId":"6405a9f940970761b8dd3ef9","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Kowalska","documentHash":"2f4b7bfd-0934-42a9-8b70-e10a2f2392ee"},{"objectId":"5e7093ff878c28a0473b4960","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Kiszczak","uuid":"21E156AC5DF0030496FC5034E60D2A594DB4D8768DF37120D0C8328EF316FACA445B8D6384CA4947C1A16ED2F6DC9ADE4D0B76850E036EFB346AE1343AD554EE","orcidId":"0000-0002-3925-5233","documentHash":"ffa5d5fc-448f-4973-be4f-3eba2d698d43"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398339","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Podwyszyńska","uuid":"B2F52BE0F8A5B79B13A48C312966FAF67C57B8B98C867157CF8141B8D7208AF78325A4F99008EDCBA6781E8BB00736EC29CC4B6CD7950AC77678B349D9B9CC47","orcidId":"0000-0003-3005-4053","documentHash":"685f5ee6-b147-4b3e-b614-46c6ff16b171"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6405a9f940970761b8dd3ef8","doi":"10.3390/agronomy13020537","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/13/2/537/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Influence of Polyamines on Red Beet (Beta vulgaris L. ssp. vulgaris) Gynogenesis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The influence of polyamines (PAs), putrescine (Put) and spermidine (Spd) on the efficiency of gynogenesis in ovule cultures of red beet (syn. beetroot) (Beta vulgaris L. vulgaris) cultivar “Czerwona Kula” and breeding accessions no. 3/2010 and no. 7/2008 was investigated.

Therefore, enrichment of plants with I and Se using fertilisers containing these micronutrients is commonly recommended. In this study, we examined the impacts of combined spraying of I as iodide or iodate, Se as selenite or selenate, and calcium (Ca) as Ca-chloride on the enrichment of ‘Red Jonaprince’ (Malus domestica Borth.) apples, as well as fruit quality and their storability. Sprays were applied 2 weeks before harvest at rates of 0.5 kg I, 0.25 kg Se and 7 kg Ca per ha. Trees not sprayed with these nutrients served as controls. The tested sprays caused leaf burn, but they did not affect the cold injury of buds and shoots. Those sprays had no effect on yield, fruit size and russeting or skin colouring. At harvest, sprayed apples contained about 50 times more I and Se and 30% more Ca than the control fruit. After storage, compared to the control fruit, sprayed apples were firmer, had more organic acids and were less susceptible to disorders, such as bitter pit, internal breakdown and decay caused by Neofabraea spp. The results indicate that preharvest spraying with I, Se and Ca at high rates can be recommended to effectively enrich apples with I and Se and to simultaneously improve their storability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709295878c28a04739870d"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"18","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"e0282873","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709295878c28a04739870d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792e9","mniswId":"16243","title":"PLoS ONE","issn":"1932-6203","eissn":"1932-6203","documentHash":"fcfcc06e-e7b2-4412-a89f-df94326b9f49"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"640ed6b54097074fd732cf84","year":"2023","volume":"18","number":"3","documentHash":"d0f35699-2a98-4afc-845b-f1ed2d092d8d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["agronomic biofortification","apple orchard","foliar fertilization","iodine","selenium"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058557552"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70942a878c28a0473b7774","name":"ŁUKASZ","lastName":"WOŹNIAK","uuid":"47ED93E0D100DD078C772AC8FFAEE94E3034CAB79570B3AA905E891022F132BF0CA0AB1D447CE72239DC5E1584155772AE99BCB8008720315CDEEC1F37DC70EF","orcidId":"0000-0002-4011-4278","documentHash":"22eae8b3-18ca-4e55-aed5-56804c688b4e"},{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b65ab","name":"Krystian","lastName":"Marszałek","uuid":"88F93A3610E25C643A9BFFEA7A4C0BA623BD8193F4E5FC1CEBAD67725B197D3F7470EF018F43D327D124F9626D81C72DF19FFE99ADCE550CFFDBEA001372ABC3","orcidId":"0000-0003-2121-0704","documentHash":"059df68b-5aba-400a-890a-fe326344f4df"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4ace","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Głowacka","uuid":"67D70CED771A8A9FF44238B473A0B36D8EBDE57FEAC4C694FD4E935A5AB47322B67496D1992FF289DDB745536708B30670D12CD185A4C6C6E35AB2F1BC63E72F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6061-1880","documentHash":"34bb66bd-35b9-4e0d-a4dc-e7e14fadc1c9"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b4639","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Skąpska","uuid":"A6FEE03FBD0D27ACF850651E02501949E4A66585559D7469BF8AD0A859744DFF03383CB46A875EFC4304E6F33927C5517F601B4E3D465EC5A6E943B01BFD7D42","orcidId":"0000-0001-8442-2523","documentHash":"c95d79e9-05ab-47fe-99d8-95c8cbe2cdcb"},{"objectId":"5e7093d5878c28a0473b1860","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szakiel","uuid":"C06A2ED2791B978D938040DDD212E3A19715EF5009653CA74AEEAF5413ACDDF71813FE59E2DA3CF0284D9FFFE86384F0CBE3309EF85559BC44C96CC7DB78C70C","orcidId":"0000-0001-6963-0666","documentHash":"be25af44-a914-49c5-bdca-4f9489d90f3e"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398351","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Rozpara","uuid":"1786131B2AF5AFAF45685292B4C47C98C846FAF4C6025B99DB99B816806597FC9410C499DB5CA2DD6F5437C22DC26B13E85C2A384602B08BA2A33C56FF785B4B","orcidId":"0000-0003-0188-6088","documentHash":"9a9264f0-5c99-46d0-8827-1158b39c7e76"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6418178940970746a3b52be1","doi":"10.3390/molecules28062584","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/28/6/2584/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Triterpenoids of Three Apple Cultivars—Biosynthesis, Antioxidative and Anti-Inflammatory Properties, and Fate during Processing","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Triterpenoids are a group of secondary plant metabolites, with a remarkable pharmacological potential, occurring in the cuticular waxes of the aerial parts of plants.

The identification and quantification of the compounds of interest were conducted using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. The waxes of both matrices contained similar analytes; however, their quantitative patterns varied: triterpenic acids prevailed in the fruits, while higher contents of steroids and esterified forms were observed in the leaves. The total triterpenoid content per unit area was stable during the growing season; the percentage of esters increased in the later phases of growth. Antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties were evaluated with a series of in vitro assays. Triterpenoids were found to be the main anti-inflammatory compounds in the apples, while their impact on antioxidant capacity was minor. The apples were processed on a lab scale to obtain juices and purées. The apple purée and cloudy juice contained only some of the triterpenoids present in the raw fruit, while the clear juices were virtually free of those lipophilic compounds."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398351","5e709400878c28a0473b4ace"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a04738564a","uid":"beGpESG6icEeopJ3VnMkvIw","uuid":"0e8f33a2-7d2c-4765-a697-b104163eb1ac","name":"Instytut Biotechnologii Przemysłu Rolno-Spożywczego im. prof.

Such substances have important advantages over plant protection products (PPPs) and, thus, are often indicated as their alternatives. The main risk indicated in the context of the widespread use of SAR inducers is that of yield reduction that may result from the excessive metabolic imbalance of the treated plant. The general aim of the study presented was to check the effect of using a new active substance, namely N-methoxy-N-methylbenzo(1.2.3)thiadiazole-7-carboxamide (BTHWA), on tulips cultivated in greenhouse conditions. The plant response to BTHWA treatment was also analyzed in terms of the extent to which the growth–immunity phenomena would occur. Surprisingly, the application of BTHWA provided not only efficient protection against fusariosis but also resulted in the stimulation of the growth and development of tomato plants. The results proved very interesting as they stand in contrast to other results on SAR induction. The method of BTHWA application used in this study resulted in SAR induction at a level sufficient to provide effective protection and, at the same time, did not cause disruption to plant metabolism that would result in yield reduction."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709401878c28a0473b4c13","5e709401878c28a0473b4c2a","5e70928b878c28a04739792d"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"853","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928b878c28a04739792d","6438edc74097077a0cc62884","5e709401878c28a0473b4c13","5e709401878c28a0473b4c2a","6438edc74097077a0cc62885","6438edc74097077a0cc62886"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d1","mniswId":"675","title":"Agriculture (Switzerland)","issn":"2077-0472","eissn":"2077-0472","documentHash":"f51997b3-f7b4-40a9-9013-a896e341e147"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"642d26bc40970741c6953ed8","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"4","documentHash":"3e134a1d-114b-4958-8606-ff96fa8504d0"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fungal diseases","fusariosis","systemic acquired resistance (SAR)","plant stimulation","benzothiadiazole","BTHWA"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058579379"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63c7fac24097076eb37d438b","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Manfredini","documentHash":"4fbe7df0-4b68-465c-a73c-49db1a9467e6"},{"objectId":"63c7fac24097076eb37d4389","name":"Loredana","lastName":"Canfora","documentHash":"daf3b118-6db4-4411-8276-3802b58752bb"},{"objectId":"5e70943c878c28a0473b8910","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Tartanus","uuid":"C48F7A279E8EDA4D4DFBE28F3C623A7EAA5380BBBAFDDB1CE8F9164A68B7AEEB3F79910A01C2E86DB12F23C3E9653ACC1C1BCF2B853A8F3EBA141FE39F41E80B","orcidId":"0000-0001-8374-1581","documentHash":"2e2870e8-c34f-47e9-8d68-2ceb836182d1"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75","name":"Eligio","lastName":"Malusa","uuid":"96702563F39315C1D693D3C97550CD6CAC824FFBF4F0B9CDA39B5B31CA25E279C7ADE056365DF1361FAB162C59DECD06A6B181EEEBEDF857A17AA24E3CAEAB00","orcidId":"0000-0002-9802-3379","documentHash":"1678ebd7-0f8e-4fff-b0c1-2a3a11e42d48"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b66b","name":"Anna","lastName":"Majchrowska-Safaryan","uuid":"7E81327988B442BEE70032CFD77210D1247C7E4706DFFDACACFAF9951C31A94777FDEE89761370EDBD17A08D237CE7BA639699FF241E17781823155E622A7BDC","orcidId":"0000-0002-1931-8508","documentHash":"9ed07a7d-8dc2-4d4c-85e1-17f45c946598"},{"objectId":"5e709294878c28a0473984dd","name":"Cezary","lastName":"Tkaczuk","uuid":"EF2551A01405CFFC2FE0BCA1E2735929BCF3E04DE55129CE7D277D075D2C070A5EFB781DB7C3E8F9F702CB5B3646E8A56729894413B072BFCA7686AA3ADBFAED","orcidId":"0000-0002-4096-2154","documentHash":"dcd63a53-6c54-4cff-963d-8bde7c830243"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"63c7fac24097076eb37d4387","doi":"10.3389/fmicb.2022.1073386","publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.1073386/full","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The impact of Beauveria species bioinocula on the soil microbial community structure in organic strawberry plantations","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: The multifunctionality of microorganisms, including entomopathogenic fungi, represents a feature that could be exploited to support the development, marketing, and application of microbial-based products for plant protection. However, it is likely that this feature could affect the composition and dynamics of the resident soil microorganisms, possibly over a longer period. Therefore, the methodology utilized to evaluate such impact is critical for a reliable assessment. The present study was performed to evaluate the impact of strains of Beauveria brongniartii and Beauveria bassiana on soil bacterial and fungal communities using an approach based on the terminal restriction fragment polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis. Materials and methods: Soil samples in the vicinity of the root system were collected during a 3-year period, before and after the bioinocula application, in two organic strawberry plantations. Specific primers were used for the amplification of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the fungal ITS region of the ribosome. Results and discussion: Data of the profile analysis from T-RFLP analysis were used to compare the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) occurrence and intensity in the inoculated soil with the uninoculated control. With regard to the impact on the bacterial community, both Beauveria species were not fully consistently affecting their composition across the seasons and fields tested. Nevertheless, some common patterns were pointed out in each field and, sometimes, also among them when considering the time elapsed from the bioinoculum application. The impact was even more inconsistent when analyzing the fungal community. It is thus concluded that the application of the bioinocula induced only a transient and limited effect on the soil microbial community, even though some changes in the structure dynamic and frequency of soil bacterial and fungal OTUs emerged."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","uid":"bz_6XXECFL3_CFkpms5BsDQ","uuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","name":"Uniwersytet w Siedlcach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b7878c28a04739b66b","5e709294878c28a0473984dd"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","parentUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","rootUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75","5e70943c878c28a0473b8910"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"1073386","pagesFromTo":"1-13","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63c7fac24097076eb37d4389","5e70943c878c28a0473b8910","63c7fac24097076eb37d438b","5e709294878c28a0473984dd","5e7092b7878c28a04739b66b","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d5f","mniswId":"6848","title":"Frontiers in Microbiology","doi":"","issn":"1664-302X","eissn":"1664-302X","websiteLink":"http://www.frontiersin.org/Microbiology","documentHash":"ca62ff85-2e36-4394-8a99-55560ecf796b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c7fac24097076eb37d4388","year":"2023","volume":"13","documentHash":"c5042819-6133-4361-8f2b-8216e5c8da85"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Beauveria bassiana","Beauveria brongniartii","Soil bacteria community","Soil fungal community","T-RFLP"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058602907"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397ebc","name":"Monika","lastName":"Mieszczakowska-Frąc","uuid":"6900A32F634EF1531D8F8C6ACE07E99EB67DDA525F899A042C0F3631CBD6903E79CD1E6BC74E398C0CD9A37D077102F17EEBAC43BB98995342398DA2B165761C","orcidId":"0000-0001-8786-7990","documentHash":"beeb1f34-0cfd-4aa6-909a-19583be25118"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a047397980","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Kaniszewski","uuid":"40B382442323D114A5BADE56702303FCCE4F37CB4A0FDF9D59F4ECE4E7F3F49E4EF5DE0D3113286E9B59A087663E36ABF3EEFABF5B44B31037767B6BEE6570D1","orcidId":"0000-0002-0611-8515","documentHash":"cbde5f0e-0e7e-422f-85bf-cd22d74b947d"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e666","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Matysiak","uuid":"900FBC197657FBB627FF12FF3E79CE37217F63AA052CFCFD3C0D9184DF01E2067A5895FE7B1741E08AE4FFDACAC2713ACAF8948615ADD64B2B13389EC8DD6F38","orcidId":"0000-0002-3892-6429","documentHash":"3fbd23e8-8d5d-4db0-a2c1-591195b7d0fe"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"644a17ba40970736bd66b22c","doi":"10.3390/agriculture13040897","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/13/4/897/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Growth and Quality of Leaf and Romaine Lettuce Grown on a Vertical Farm in an Aquaponics System: Results of Farm Research","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The integration of indoor vertical cultivation with a recirculating aquaculture system into an aquaponic system has the potential to become one of the most effective sustainable production systems for fish and leafy vegetables. In this study, lettuce was produced on rafts in a coupled recirculation aquaponic system in the plant factory under controlled environmental conditions. The aims of this study were to evaluate the yield, mineral status, and health-promoting bioactive compounds of leaf and romaine lettuce cultivars grown in a recirculating aquaponic system. The yield and biometric parameters and quality parameters of lettuce leaves (nitrate, mineral, L-ascorbic acid, carotenoid, phenolic compound, and total polyphenolic contents) were examined. Monitoring of the water in the aquaponic system showed a low concentration of nitrates, phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and magnesium (Mg), but the proportion of mineral nutrients as well as pH were stable throughout the lettuce cultivation period. The heads of romaine lettuce ‘Yakina’, ‘Pivotal’, and ‘Waygo’ reached a fresh weight of 86 g, on average, 23% higher than the leaf lettuce ‘Nordice’ over a three-week cultivation period. Despite the low nutrient concentration in the aquaponic solution, the nutrient status of the romaine lettuces ‘Yakina’ and ‘Pivotal’ was within the optimal range. The concentrations of chlorophyll a and carotenoids in ‘Yakina’ and ‘Pivotal’ were higher than those in ‘Nordice’ and ‘Waygo’. The nitrate, phosphorus, and potassium contents in the leaves of ‘Nordice’ and ‘Waygo’ were below the optimal range; however, their polyphenol concentrations were the highest. Our results indicate that the effectiveness of aquaponic cultivation of lettuce in terms of biomass production and the nutritional and health-promoting value of lettuce depends on the plant genotype."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709200878c28a04738e666","5e70928f878c28a047397ebc","5e70928b878c28a047397980"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"897","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709200878c28a04738e666","5e70928b878c28a047397980","5e70928f878c28a047397ebc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d1","mniswId":"675","title":"Agriculture-Basel","issn":"2077-0472","eissn":"2077-0472","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"e60fb638-9419-4766-9fd6-0e29d9cbaf0d"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["aquaponics","lettuce","plant factories with artificial lighting","plant nutrition","phytochemicals","sustainable agriculture"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058611782"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"644bb5a940970748461c0233","name":"Jorunn","lastName":"Børve","documentHash":"6f27bf57-110a-472a-b0d8-ff96703869af"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4a99","name":"Agata","lastName":"Broniarek-Niemiec","uuid":"EF5D9CDF145AB2C662FB0B8D20CB53869F2B90495E6BA965BD5988C4C90DEF37CED7B95D625B606A0257B8DE4CD37BF653BF841C8C7A9CA88F1A47BE94239757","orcidId":"0000-0001-6035-9734","documentHash":"479eb4b4-64c3-4783-8833-fa58f05a347f"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398341","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Puławska","uuid":"A2F13D21947DD9E5CA8586F26E280B3CE2C9F1E3B7EDE455195E9E313A348C66551979BBD618F4DBE6F5E5EF071DC6DC28BB1E1BD29693C3A50E2DB9BBEFE4EF","orcidId":"0000-0001-5327-1056","documentHash":"3475c8e9-bf80-473e-9268-fbb10a5ccf56"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"644bb5a940970748461c0232","doi":"10.3390/agronomy13041166","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/13/4/1166/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Control of Bacterial Canker in Stone Fruit Trees by Chemical and Biological Products","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Bacterial canker, caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae and pv. morsprunorum, is one of the most important diseases of stone fruit trees (Prunus spp.).

The efficacy of different chemical and biological products for the control of bacterial canker on stone fruit trees was tested in 2018–2021. The experiments were conducted in sour cherry, plum and sweet cherry orchards in central Poland. Foliar application of the tested preparations was performed three times a season. The biological efficacy of the tested products in the control of bacterial canker was evaluated on sour cherry on the basis of infected leaves and fruits and on plum and sweet cherry on the basis of infected leaves. The highest efficacy was observed for products containing various forms of copper—copper oxide, copper oxychloride and copper hydroxide—as well as fertilizers with copper gluconate and the fungicide Luna Care 71.6 WG (fluopyram and fosetyl-Al).

The influence of different disinfection methods, various initial explants and growth regulators, their concentrations, and combinations on the efficiency of micropropagation have been analyzed. The most effective disinfection was the use of 70% ethanol and 0.5% Tween 20. The optimal initial explants were apical and lateral buds cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 0.2 mg L–1 kinetin and 1 mg L–1 indole-3-acetic acid. The most intensive shoot regeneration occurred on MS medium with 1 mg L–1 thidiazuron and 1-naphthylacetic acid. Histological observations demonstrated the strong effect of growth substances on shoot organogenesis from callus tissue. Shoots obtained from in vitro cultures rooted easily on modified MS media with ½ or ¼ concentration of macroelements, 20 g L–1 sucrose and 3 mg L–1 1-naphthylacetic acid. All plants adapted to ex vitro conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df62","uid":"bsq32O8WjxMhkpQii6EvcZw","uuid":"6700d816-d124-4a54-9d44-4f1b7f01494b","name":"Wydział Biologii i Ochrony Środowiska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709373878c28a0473a9f2a"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de19","parentUuid":"5011bcd5-dfb1-41ed-84b0-5bd51ce0832c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de19","rootUuid":"5011bcd5-dfb1-41ed-84b0-5bd51ce0832c","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ff878c28a0473b4960"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"1","issue":"21","pagesFromTo":"131-141","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ff878c28a0473b4960","656db43240970749a862f671","5e7094b8878c28a0473c24e0","5e709373878c28a0473a9f2a","656db43240970749a862f673","656db43240970749a862f674"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e56","mniswId":"322","title":"Acta Scientiarum Polonorum, Hortorum Cultus","issn":"1644-0692","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"23f8064b-bfb0-4086-bd56-6f4298ea904e"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["auksyny","cytokininy","struktura histologiczna","mikroporopagacja","regeneracja","kultura tkankowa"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["auxins","cytokinins","histological structures","micropropagation","regeneration","tissue culture"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058618627"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63d15c414097071d34b9b9be","name":"Beata","lastName":"Sumorok","documentHash":"f1037e1a-68b9-49d2-9675-bf19e1a0d3d1"},{"objectId":"63d15c414097071d34b9b9bd","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Głuszek","documentHash":"a2e6650c-e2de-46af-b9b6-c69e81b82342"},{"objectId":"63d15c414097071d34b9b9bc","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Derkowska","documentHash":"e9042bae-1dac-4762-8959-44a318377d7a"},{"objectId":"63d15c414097071d34b9b9bb","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Górnik","documentHash":"9b5e7a9b-cb8b-489f-b69b-d880d663b37d"},{"objectId":"63d15c414097071d34b9b9ba","name":"Anna","lastName":"Lisek","documentHash":"2e01dda5-f605-4f37-b5e2-a4773a44faad"},{"objectId":"63d15c414097071d34b9b9b9","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Sas-Paszt","documentHash":"b94bd6f1-16d7-4d5b-ab5a-8c80ab0da169"},{"objectId":"63d15c414097071d34b9b9b8","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Trzciński","documentHash":"ba25ca7f-0697-4598-835f-1e09cdfbacdd"},{"objectId":"63d15c414097071d34b9b9b7","name":"Karol","lastName":"Struniawski","documentHash":"a3067d3e-850a-4d95-b05a-670863039770"},{"objectId":"63d15c414097071d34b9b9b6","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Konopka","documentHash":"fe2ec31d-df6f-4fce-991b-6ac810eb1658"},{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b423b","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Frąc","uuid":"DB7317F3078EAE2173CC896E4BA6E90BB0A524CBBF87F4FD301CCE20C9BABA9C9A82075C72E316FC40712199000F8AC2D5940BF7D278C98AA695622BAAE8AE31","orcidId":"0000-0001-9437-3139","documentHash":"9e52e582-5b2c-4d87-af08-89b425ea9091"},{"objectId":"5e7092e6878c28a04739ee2f","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Kozera","uuid":"55FC83C6BB28E2F4EC217DCA0CF58F73CF4068F3AE1834238E413E74803803F76019B7F5D4354BE1A793838B11346174B12118E685C8019B26A3A49E625EDEA5","orcidId":"0000-0002-2907-8632","documentHash":"97c49b7c-ab5c-40a3-8a92-2c40d6d686a6"}],"objectId":"63d15c414097071d34b9b9b5","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-08757-8_23","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-08757-8_23","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Classification of soil bacteria based on machine learning and image processing","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Soil bacteria play a fundamental role in plant growth.

Feature determination based on shape relies on interpolation and curvature estimation whereas feature recognition based on image texture resorts to the spatial relationships between chrominance and luminance of pixels using co-occurrence matrices. From the variety of modelling methods applied here the best reported result amounts to 97% of accuracy. This outcome is obtained upon incorporating the set of features from both groups and subsequently merging classification and feature selection methods: Extreme Learning Machine - Radial Basis Function with Sparse Multinomial Logistic Regression with Bayesian Regularization and also k-Nearest Neighbors classifier with Fast Correlation Based Filter.

Bacterbase is a bacterial preparation containing Bacillus velezensis and Bacillus amyloliqefaciens (Skierniewickie Microorganisms) with antifungal properties that stimulates the growth and yielding of plants. Unrooted microshoots of strawberry ‘Grandarosaʼ and highbush blueberry ‘Chandlerʼ, and rooted in vitro microcuttings of hip rose ‘Konstancinʼ were planted in a peat substrate. Three weeks after planting ex vitro, the plants were treated with the biopreparations. Four times, at two-week intervals, the plants were drenched and simultaneously sprayed with mineral fertilizer 0.2% Hydrovit (control), 0.04% TotalHumus® and 0.03% Bacterbase, which were used separately or in combinations. In hip rose and strawberry, compared to the control, similar or better growth parameters of shoots and roots were observed after the use of TotalHumus® and/or Bacterbase. The plants were characterized by the highest fresh weight, longer shoots/runners and more shoots than in the control (mineral fertilization). In strawberry, root parameters were significantly improved by TotalHumus®, and in rose by Bacterbase.

The knowledge of genetic variation, genotype-by-traits comparison, as well as the relationship among several phenological traits is effective for developing breeding populations by choosing the best allelic combinations and employing selection approaches. Information regarding the genetic variability and inter-relationships among fruit characteristics is facilitating the plant breeders to efficiently exploit the date palm germplasm for the introduction of elite genotypes. The present study was conducted to examine genetic variation among different date palm cultivars -collected from two different research stations in Pakistan as well as the relationship among their phenological and biochemical characteristics. Biplot analysis revealed that the cultivars ‘Dhakki’, ‘Chohara’, and ‘Kupra’ possessed the highest fruit and pulp weights. Moreover, the fruits of the cultivars ‘Champa Kali’ and ‘Shakri’ had the maximum TSS (total soluble solids) and total sugar content. Similar variations were observed in the mean values of the studied phenological and biochemical characteristics as in the biplot analysis. Cluster analysis on the basis of phenological and biochemical characteristics divided 50 cultivars into seven clusters, showing differences in the studied characters. A correlation matrix revealed that pulp weight had a strong relationship with fruit weight, length, and diameter. A strong correlation also existed among antioxidant capacity, antioxidant activity, and total phenolic content.

The quality and quantity of rhubarb crops are significantly dependent on planting material. To obtain high-quality planting material for the value selection of the rhubarb ‘Raspberry’, we evaluated the morphological and physiological responses of micropropagated plantlets to different growth substrates and light quality during early growth ex vitro in the greenhouse. The plantlets were grown in high-EC (GM1) and low-EC (GM2) peat substrates under four light-emitting diodes (LED) light treatments as supplementary lighting (SL) in the wintertime: 100% red (R), 100% blue (B), white light [44.4% green (G), 24.4% B, 28.9% R; 2.2% far red (FR)] and R+B+G+FR (49.4/16.3/10.3/23.8%) light. Compared to the control (natural sunlight), applied LED lighting significantly increased all growth parameters, but only in plantlets grown in GM1 substrate. Among LED treatments, R+B+G+FR light had the most stimulative effect on all growth parameters (length of leaf petioles, leaf area, biomass) and soluble sugar production. Still, it decreased the levels of phenolic compounds in the leaf petioles. Phenolic synthesis, mainly anthocyanins, was the highest under white light (622.8 mg·100 g−1 dry mass), followed by red (601.8 mg·100 g−1), blue (464.4 mg·100 g−1), and R+B+G+FR light (416.4 mg·100 g−1). High anthocyanin accumulation under R-LED light was associated with high antioxidant activity and growth cessation. Hence, for optimal effects related to plant growth and anthocyanin biosynthesis, the use of W-LED lighting is recommended for the early growth ex vitro of micropropagated rhubarb plantlets."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928f878c28a047397f69","5e709295878c28a047398705","5e709200878c28a04738e666","5e709400878c28a0473b4a25","5e70928f878c28a047397ebc"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"890","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709295878c28a047398705","5e709200878c28a04738e666","5e70928f878c28a047397ebc","5e70928f878c28a047397f69","5e709400878c28a0473b4a25"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d1","mniswId":"675","title":"Agriculture (Switzerland)","eissn":"2077-0472","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"fb8db9b6-d4d7-498a-b26c-2119c1ad43da"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["antioxidant activity","anthocyanins","ex vitro growth","LEDs","soluble sugars"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058651856"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c1e","name":"Marek","lastName":"Szymajda","uuid":"9FDF7765FBA01A0940EFE3D842149684D9F84C7430CE9AD5FF8E82D2E71C8A02F41C6DC2E24B7F9B8DAFDBE52AF2F373BD4E7865783AA9D4757AB5522E062743","orcidId":"0000-0001-9734-7016","documentHash":"f46dc0b5-1c16-453c-94dd-7b8d1f4da775"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4a95","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Białkowski","uuid":"B86C2AF38B2D6BE7CF58916049BED121A76A478518801C8AB80E520922EAD63CD8A34E194DBDF2CFD2AD3A3A7395943A6990F08A77EFF27AA0CE172575B8E1F9","orcidId":"0000-0003-2048-8501","documentHash":"6b61a8d7-409e-40da-a243-7d5ebeafc44b"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a4f2","name":"Robert","lastName":"Maciorowski","uuid":"AC09BFD11EA198BCA3586EF3929BD88F014022B949E2B33D3E3AE2792849D1C59A3866CFEBBABDB970DBE5DFC28FB0B59F22E362FD6063C615FAFAB52BCDA78E","orcidId":"0000-0003-1059-4239","documentHash":"5962a78a-f728-43cb-86fa-7d7868467230"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398344","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Rabcewicz","uuid":"46AB26D776DB1B6C2DD373D0B259E9801C89D0DA4A6A2C67C5F780724D7EC90E3C563D6646C16889B1282598D2D875D2380AE37DD570E57A605542CD09542D33","orcidId":"0000-0001-7423-553X","documentHash":"f9174340-0e59-4a8c-b18b-28c1530561fc"},{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a0473976f9","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Buler","uuid":"CC6580B632FD24939F8B679B94B5B7904887E80507B6B280BCC1CBF56A2244D049AA807FEEFE0A132CDFE055DFE2C2C58982798684B917C4B8B00FF69ABF352B","orcidId":"0000-0003-4111-5501","documentHash":"e2a88ca3-b5ca-4580-9769-1f25c8f2628c"}],"objectId":"63ee29e9409707642386f165","doi":"10.1016/j.scienta.2023.111895","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0304423823000705?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Suitability of plum (Prunus domestica L.) cultivars for combine harvesting of the fruit","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Mechanical harvesting allows a significant reduction in both the cost of harvesting plum fruits and the total cost of producing them. For this reason, in the years 2019–2021, during the period of full fruiting, an assessment was made of the suitability of new plum cultivars: ‘Emper’, ‘Kalipso’, ‘Polinka’, and ‘Węgierka Dąbrowicka’, for mechanical harvesting with a continuously moving combine harvester as compared with hand picking. The study examined the effectiveness of fruit harvesting, tree yielding, fractions of the crop collected, and selected fruit quality traits. It was found that the mechanical harvesting of plums had a significant impact on the quality of the obtained crop. The combine harvested fruit met the requirements of the processing industry, but they evidently suffered more mechanical damage, more of them had the stalk attached, and they exhibited a lower post-harvest durability compared with manually harvested fruit. The introduction of combine harvesting did not cause a significant reduction in the productivity of the trees of the tested cultivars and did not negatively affect the weight of the harvested fruit or the soluble solids and vitamin C content in them.\n\nThe research showed a highly significant variation in the suitability of the tested cultivars for combine harvesting of the fruit. Trees of the new cultivar ‘Kalipso’ and the control cultivar ‘Węgierka Dąbrowicka’ proved to be the most suitable for mechanical fruit harvesting with the type of combine harvester used in the experiment. The combine harvesting of ‘Kalipso’ plums was the most effective, with the fruit suffering the least mechanical damage. Using the combine harvester, 91.4% of the total ‘Kalipso’ crop was collected, and 97.5% of the harvested fruit had no visible damage immediately after the harvest."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709400878c28a0473b4a95","5e709292878c28a047398344","5e709288878c28a0473976f9","5e7092ab878c28a04739a4f2","5e709401878c28a0473b4c1e"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"313","pagesFromTo":"111895","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709401878c28a0473b4c1e","5e7092ab878c28a04739a4f2","5e709292878c28a047398344","5e709400878c28a0473b4a95","5e709288878c28a0473976f9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b4","mniswId":"18258","title":"SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE","issn":"0304-4238","eissn":"1879-1018","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"2a554406-91f1-426c-8e10-e67b2e56031a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ecbfd14097072bce774b48","year":"2023","volume":"313","documentHash":"78e05b1b-94fa-47b7-9b3e-c94ac3355a02"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fruit damage","harvesting effectiveness","mechanical harvesting","yielding"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058658229"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e666","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Matysiak","uuid":"900FBC197657FBB627FF12FF3E79CE37217F63AA052CFCFD3C0D9184DF01E2067A5895FE7B1741E08AE4FFDACAC2713ACAF8948615ADD64B2B13389EC8DD6F38","orcidId":"0000-0002-3892-6429","documentHash":"3fbd23e8-8d5d-4db0-a2c1-591195b7d0fe"}],"objectId":"644b6e464097074846169d70","publicUri":"https://archiwumskierniewic.pl/items/5f77f4bc-dfb0-4b12-87e8-8a8132c61dcc","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2022,"title":"Skąd się wzięło ogrodnictwo w Skierniewicach, czyli historia ogrodów arcybiskupów gnieźnieńskich okiem ogrodnika","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Osada pałacowa w Skierniewicach, dawna rezydencja arcybisku-\npów gnieźnieńskich, a obecnie siedziba Instytutu Ogrodnictwa — Państwowego\nInstytutu Badawczego — jest pamiątką dworu prymasowskiego i artystyczną spu-\nścizną wybitnych architektów Efraima Schroegera, Szymona Bogumiła Zuga, Adama\nIdźkowskiego i Ippolito Monighettiego.

One main goal is to release new plant cultivars well adapted to different climatic and soil conditions. Dormant seeds obtained from breeding are serious problems delaying the program. The seeds were directly extracted from fruits after harvest (unstored) or after storage at −18 °C for 6 months (stored) and subjected to modified stratification (3 °C) with KNO3, H2O2, NO, smoke-water (SW) or scarification using sandpaper or H2SO4 for 10, 20, 30, 40 min or treatments with pulsed radio frequency (PRF) or red light. The seeds were also subjected to warm–cool stratification (20/3 °C). Unstored seeds germinated in a higher percentage and with better uniformity (T75–T25) than stored seeds. Stored seeds positively affected the onset of seed germination (T1) and mean germination time (MGT). Dormancy breakage was promoted by stratification with KNO3, SW or scarification with sandpaper, H2SO4 or treatments with PRF. The recommended method for the breeding program of breaking seeds dormancy is when unstored seeds are subjected to stratification in KNO3 (0.2%) or SW (1:100). Depending on the applied methods, the percentage of seeds’ germination increased to 87% compared to untreated (64%) control seeds. The positive effects of the selected methods persisted during seedling development by stimulating their growth and enhancing the chlorophyll content index (SPAD) and effective quantum yield of PSII of chlorophyll in leaves (ΦPSII)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa -

plants and humans. Identifying the genetic components underlying AsA accumulation is crucial for enhancing strawberry nutritional quality. Here, we unravel the genetic architecture of AsA accumulation using an F1 population derived from parental lines ‘Candonga’ and ‘Senga Sengana’, adapted to distinct Southern and Northern European areas. To account for environmental effects, the F1 and parental lines were grown and phenotyped in five locations across Europe (France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain). Fruit AsA content displayed normal distribution typical of quantitative traits and ranged five-fold, with significant differences among genotypes and environments. AsA content in each country and the average in all of them was used in combination with 6,974 markers for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. Environmentally stable QTLs for AsA content were detected in linkage group (LG) 3A, LG 5A, LG 5B, LG 6B and LG 7C. Candidate genes were identified within stable QTL intervals and expression analysis in lines with contrasting AsA content suggested that GDP-L-Galactose Phosphorylase FaGGP(3A), and the chloroplast-located AsA transporter gene FaPHT4;4(7C) might be the underlying genetic factors for QTLs on LG 3A and 7C, respectively. We show that recessive alleles of FaGGP(3A) inherited from both parental lines increase fruit AsA content. Furthermore, expression of FaGGP(3A) was two-fold higher in lines with high AsA. Markers here identified represent a useful resource for efficient selection of new strawberry cultivars with increased AsA content."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928f878c28a047397eaf"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"10","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"uhad006","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64195c584097072d8249abc9","64195c584097072d8249abca","64195c584097072d8249abcb","64195c584097072d8249abcc","64195c584097072d8249abcd","64195c584097072d8249abce","64195c584097072d8249abcf","64195c584097072d8249abd0","64195c584097072d8249abd1","64195c584097072d8249abd2","64195c584097072d8249abd3","5e70928f878c28a047397eaf","64195c584097072d8249abd4","64195c584097072d8249abd5","64195c584097072d8249abd6","64195c584097072d8249abd7","64195c584097072d8249abd8","64195c584097072d8249abd9","64195c584097072d8249abda","64195c584097072d8249abdb","64195c584097072d8249abdc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c2eb","mniswId":"7727","title":"Horticulture Research","issn":"2052-7276","eissn":"2052-7276","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"3e157e9e-1da8-4442-9da5-599cb1850b98"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64195c584097072d8249abc8","year":"2023","volume":"10","number":"3","documentHash":"381509fb-2a67-4309-8ac8-60ec172dba4c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fragaria x ananassa","vitamin C","antioxidant","biparental breeding population","genetic variation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058697969"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c3426","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Golian","uuid":"141889D31819A09F2C92496C42E3023D8764CBA2F83091F958F2A2FF28847C69F46AFE40989E51705467A08AE5D1DE3D52779BA1C8939C3E9AE0A13B412B7BE9","orcidId":"0000-0003-0797-5495","documentHash":"c48ee163-e95d-4b27-a994-addec7826aa3"},{"objectId":"5e7093fb878c28a0473b45dd","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Anyszka","uuid":"49991779EB2BFC0721E85AA0E9CE71A201C76BF394409DAC799F46DB56C813DCA9A2D8D7683BD3FB70780A2DCADDFD38E9CA76F84FE298636B5466F43DB16398","orcidId":"0000-0002-5315-7496","documentHash":"6c73057f-7b95-4269-816b-dadf87e40473"},{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a047397765","name":"Maria","lastName":"Grzegorzewska","uuid":"99665ABAC00F950802E6670F85B681F1AF408CA66FB4950C0CA01608BECACF559B0132EF7266CAD7A7445218E9AF0156227B1E7AFE974836482DA2C088837CE2","orcidId":"0000-0003-4499-6404","documentHash":"50dac121-3170-4a81-b9df-409e6eabbe9f"},{"objectId":"5e709220878c28a047390388","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Kosson","uuid":"7B80AA015C0B7DD3FCF710F4664282321336F09455FBF758100B9F4DE9DEA8F255589E7D1827D7712BC21D53EC2BEC829EE65942C5D7611BC8646F954FB9D92E","documentHash":"df0779e2-2dc3-4d8a-921e-5987f2a25f50"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-03-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"649ecf1d40970725a10a5fc2","doi":"10.24425/jppr.2023.144507","publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/Content/126704/PDF/OA_08_JPPR_63_1_1519_Golian_kor.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The yield and postharvest quality of Chinese cabbage, depending on weed management method","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The studies were conducted from 2012 to 2015 at the National Institute of Horticultural Research in Skierniewice, Poland. The aim of the research was to determine the yield of Chinese cabbage, its storage ability and nutritional value, depending on weed management methods used during cultivation. In the field experiments the following methods were compared: mechanical treatments, mechanical treatments + growth stimulators, soil mulching with black polypropylene, black polyethylene and biodegradable foil and hand weeding. After harvest the Chinese cabbage was stored at 0–2°C for 125–126 days depending on the year and after storage marketable and rotten heads were sorted. The percent of yellowed, rotten leaves in the total mass of the stored heads was also determined, as well as the natural weight loss. The chemical composition of Chinese cabbage was analyzed after harvest and after storage. The analyses included: dry matter, total sugars, vitamin C and soluble phenol content. After harvest the highest yield of Chinese cabbage grown in black polyethylene mulch was obtained. After storage the highest yield of marketable heads from cabbage mechanically weeded with additional application of biostimulator AlfaMax during cultivation was obtained. Chemical analyses showed that after harvest the highest dry matter, total sugars and vitamin C content were found in Chinese cabbage mechanically weeded and soluble phenols were the highest in non-weeded Chinese cabbage.

The weeds number and soil weeds coverage in tree rows were assessed. Regardless of the living mulch species utilized, the soil resulted to be mostly covered by perennial weed species such as: Equisetum arvense and Taraxacum officinale and annual species such as: Lamium purpureum, Stellaria media, Galinsoga parviflora, Capsella bursa-pastoris and Poa annua, which were the most common species also for the natural cover used as control.

Furthermore, very high coefficients of correlation and determination, as well as successful regression equations regardless of the cultivar were determined."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709400878c28a0473b4a25","5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"2123","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","5e709400878c28a0473b4a25"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"Foods","eissn":"2304-8158","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"0f59a8f0-a1f9-45c0-ba10-cec780ad3d19"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6482f9a540970710e38ffb9d","year":"2023","volume":"12","number":"11","doi":"","documentHash":"7f8f0266-2ac9-43ff-b866-d9da00c784fa"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["red pepper","yellow pepper","α-carotene","β-carotene","total carotenoids","total sugars","imageprocessing","regression"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058726640"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6482f71f40970710e38fe3cd","name":"Nicholas J.","lastName":"Watson","documentHash":"00e44211-a6f1-4fcc-8465-78ce9c2ea968"},{"objectId":"6482f71f40970710e38fe3cc","name":"Ahmed M.","lastName":"Rady","documentHash":"42823bc2-1504-4999-aa07-dd72112f6b2b"},{"objectId":"5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ropelewska","uuid":"E3575740307CA373F3BD454AAC58C202E1C2CA28B9FC90C6BC3006DB867893BEE70DFAC85C7D9667CD0ACB7837B8DF63F7D6636679B032F0F1E0E534A3F3CBD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8891-236X","documentHash":"e9d0e369-fc46-40fe-9cb3-5236d6ea38a0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6482f71f40970710e38fe3c8","doi":"10.3390/su15129259","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/su15129259","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Apricot Stone Classification Using Image Analysis and Machine Learning","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Apricot stones have high commercial value and can be used for manufacturing functional foods, cosmetic products, active carbon, and biodiesel. The optimal processing of the stones is dependent on the cultivar and there is a need for methods to sort among different cultivars (which are often mixed in processing facilities). This study investigates the effectiveness of two low-cost colour imaging systems coupled with supervised learning to develop classification models to determine the cultivar of different stones. Apricot stones of the cultivars ‘Bella’, ‘Early Orange’, ‘Harcot’, ‘Skierniewicka Słodka’, and ‘Taja’ were used. The RGB images were acquired using a flatbed scanner or a digital camera; and 2172 image texture features were extracted within the R, G, B; L, a, b; X, Y, Z; U, and V colour coordinates. The most influential features were determined and resulted in 103 and 89 selected features for the digital camera and the flatbed scanner, respectively. Linear and nonlinear classifiers were applied including Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Decision Trees (DT), k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB). The models resulting from the flatbed scanner and using selected features achieved an accuracy of 100% via either quadratic diagonal LDA or kNN classifiers. The models developed using images from the digital camera and all or selected features had an accuracy of up to 96.77% using the SVM classifier. This study presents novel and simple-to-implement at-line (flatbed scanner) and online (digital camera) methodologies for apricot stone sorting. The developed procedure combining colour imaging and machine learning may be used for the authentication of apricot stone cultivars and quality evaluation of apricot from sustainable production."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"9259","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","6482f71f40970710e38fe3cc","6482f71f40970710e38fe3cd"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"76492123-acbe-4743-a4ae-6a63f3108e24"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6482f8d040970710e38feb9e","year":"2023","volume":"","number":"12","doi":"","documentHash":"5476181a-d01e-4023-bdec-3b9416170c38"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["apricot stone sorting","flatbed scanner","digital camera","classification models","machine learning"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058726812"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397ea6","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Lisek","uuid":"BC70832FA007C8F84717B0666AACA0BCDCFA79B9F51DDD03B43539BAD9AFA4A30FC053D80FEACB47035AC029E76E206B988B1C7FE247374C6EC6ACF63D9BFCE3","orcidId":"0000-0002-6374-730X","documentHash":"7a4dee1b-9f18-4329-9870-b8d4a1386927"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-21","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6489bacd40970732284c663f","doi":"10.3390/agronomy13051421","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/13/5/1421/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Diversity of Summer Weed Communities in Response to Different Plum Orchard Floor Management in-Row","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The effect of five methods of in-row weed management on the species composition and diversity of summer weed communities in a plum orchard was evaluated. Different methods of orchard floor management (OFM) were implemented for seven consecutive years from 2009 to 2015. Festuca rubra L. ssp. rubra–rhizomatous perennial grass was sown as a cover crop in the alleys of the orchard, in the tree planting year. In the seventh year of OFM implementation, the treatments were ranked according to the decreasing value of the Shannon–Wiener floristic diversity index as follows: tillage, post-emergence herbicides spraying, mowing, mulch, and weedy control. The highest value of Simpson dominance index was found in the control treatment. In plots with such treatments as control, mowing, tillage, and mulch, the dominant species was F. rubra. This meant that the rhizomatous cover crop from the alleys penetrated and affected the in-row flora. Vegetation of mulched plots was characterized by low value of density and soil cover. The obtained results indicated that the flora developing in the control, sprayed with post-emergence herbicides, tilled and mowed plots had greater potential to provide ecosystem services, than the flora of mulched plots."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928f878c28a047397ea6"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"1421","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928f878c28a047397ea6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d9","mniswId":"689","title":"Agronomy","issn":"2073-4395","eissn":"2073-4395","documentHash":"f748c34e-fa45-428e-abf2-7624cc5986fd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6458b0fa4097077a5e391082","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"5","documentHash":"ca47a2db-d42b-42d7-a38f-e1f9744b4e8a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["spontaneous flora","Shannon–Wiener diversity index","Simpson dominance index","Prunus domestica L.","Festuca rubra L. ssp. rubra"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058730058"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a0473983a3","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Sobiczewski","uuid":"043EDCCAEE224C9E3FB91A4CBD06FF271FA0A2E5027F427C9F4FA028BA6E00DD8CAC0E8AA3EFA8A41F4CBD1D888131A920E51CACABF95AA1113F1783055EA4AA","orcidId":"0000-0001-9925-3611","documentHash":"83c979d7-ef2f-4ba8-85d0-1ef16c219dbf"}],"objectId":"64b687884097072492b44f70","type":"CHAPTER","typeName":"Rozdział","year":2023,"title":"XV.

Therefore, distinguishing cultivars may be important for seed processing and product quality. This study was aimed at revealing the usefulness of innovative models developed based on selected image textures built using traditional machine algorithms for cultivar classification of quince seeds. The quince seeds belonging to four cultivars 'Uspiech', 'Leskovac', 'Bereczki', and 'Kaszczenko' were considered. In total, 1629 image textures from different color channels for each seed were extracted from color images acquired using a flatbed scanner. Texture parameters were used to build models for a combined set of selected textures from all color channels, sets of selected textures from color spaces RGB, Lab, and XYZ, and individual color channels R, G, B, L, a, b, X, Y, and Z using algorithms from different groups. The most successful models were developed using the Logistic (group of Functions), IBk (Lazy), LogitBoost (Meta), LMT (Trees), and naïve Bayes (Bayes). The classification accuracy reached 98.75% in the case of a model based on a combined set of textures selected from images in all color channels developed using the Logistic algorithm. For most models, the greatest misclassification of cases was observed between seeds 'Bereczki' and 'Kaszczenko'. The developed procedure can be used in practice to distinguish quince seeds in terms of a cultivar and avoid mixing seed cultivars with different properties intended for further processing."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","5e70928f878c28a047397ebc","5e70928f878c28a047397e8f"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"1310","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","5e70928f878c28a047397e8f","5e70928f878c28a047397ebc"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d1","mniswId":"675","title":"Agriculture (Switzerland)","eissn":"2077-0472","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"fb8db9b6-d4d7-498a-b26c-2119c1ad43da"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"649a8080409707195f000da4","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"7","doi":"","documentHash":"e72943b7-ce77-47ce-86a7-b77b4507d32e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["quince seeds","color imaging","image processing","texture parameters","cultivar classification"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058742697"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6562071040970749a8ce1a0e","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Bella","documentHash":"2d27c787-9b47-4830-9b2c-427c228b5205"},{"objectId":"6562071040970749a8ce1a0d","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Kalisz","documentHash":"e19b2e26-0a9e-47d5-838e-28a3770aec66"},{"objectId":"6562071040970749a8ce1a0c","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Mirgos","documentHash":"8d234eaf-e852-4abf-be2a-75a8bee2da1c"},{"objectId":"6562071040970749a8ce1a0b","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Wójcik-Gront","documentHash":"f627f2ee-976e-4cb8-b15f-2dd91dd297ad"},{"objectId":"6562071040970749a8ce1a0a","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Przybył","documentHash":"0f0ae869-ebed-4cfc-913d-a9039cf34ec7"},{"objectId":"6562071040970749a8ce1a09","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Łaźny","documentHash":"37b79db5-d858-42d9-aba3-c47827632364"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4bea","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kunka","uuid":"84861EC524B8EFBC25A04C44C98FBD38A2D6FB696844F98D8D20C895391B445BE5947A00E9515DD062C039AD8823A450D64C1785953C0CA8FE06CE36A1B8CBC9","orcidId":"0000-0002-9878-0310","documentHash":"245abf54-db9b-4aa3-befe-595aa3538073"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397f69","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"9E538886BAEC63D822291227462DC5326050A9D565F74EE2E32A6843C2F96B70C99B1D2881EF31E6974EAE0A6A97C1906FBC6D71B47EC440D61916F795BADDB5","orcidId":"0000-0002-5962-936X","documentHash":"95877ed5-692d-4970-9e1d-6384aba950fc"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d85","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"3897AF5C7E4FAAF35F404A9BC0F9A8CC22B535BAEF573567F51A2A1A784D9620935E656E73521A53CD02CED856407343E2833BC3E064485F8738EE7724777E10","orcidId":"0000-0002-1473-9207","documentHash":"93393335-9114-4927-8bda-c788c468a09e"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923b0","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"5E24C8B8B82DF92592988E62BA167E1795C7030CAA13FBF43C8E3E309E47D2B063B2A06E7D1E473EB259EC2EA2D331879136BA5359B07A5F51FFFD5960C5042F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5282-7331","documentHash":"6d722aee-6cf4-4a44-abc1-e7b73aedf070"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a04739235e","name":"Janina","lastName":"Gajc-Wolska","uuid":"0B5E2326A0561B418D8D4A7D2B65BDF17E21FC131E2F6F649B8381CCF8263C0A7A87C0003711CD0A9049BCEDF2DFB6D847C77C725C765F9C251FB130C60F212A","orcidId":"0000-0003-4237-5575","documentHash":"d6286f62-1a01-4ee9-b07d-dfdd41c12ebb"}],"objectId":"64c25f5a4097071bd6b662db","doi":"10.1016/j.scienta.2023.112350","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304423823005198?via%3Dihub","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Effect of lignite substrate and supplementary lighting and packaging type on post-harvest storage quality of cucumber fruit","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cucumber is an economically important vegetable grown all over the world. Consumers demand that high-quality cucumber fruit is available throughout the year. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of growing conditions such as lignite substrates and assimilation lighting in hydroponic cultivation and storage methods on the quality and post-harvest shelf life of greenhouse cucumber fruit. Cucumber fruit quality was analysed from harvest through cold storage and simulated trading conditions.\r\n\r\nPlants were grown in lignite and mineral wool growing mats. Sunlight supplementation was carried out using sodium and LED lamps. Post-harvest fruit were packed in plastic crates, cardboard boxes or plastic bags and stored in a cold store (5 days) and under simulated trading conditions (10 days - 5 days in a cold store and another 5 days at 22 ᵒC). The weight loss of cucumber fruit during storage was determined depending on the combination. After fruit harvest, after fruit storage in the cold store and after 10 days of storage under simulated trading conditions, fruit hardness, dry matter content, TSS, nitrate content of cucumber fruit were studied and sensory evaluation of fruit quality was carried out.\r\n\r\nFruit from plants grown in lignite substrate had lower weight loss during storage and significantly higher TSS (total soluble solids) and dry matter content. They also had a lower nitrate content compared to fruit harvested from plants grown in mineral wool substrate. Furthermore, the best sensory parameters were found in fruit from plants grown in lignite substrate under LED lighting. It was also found that PE film packaging reduced the weight loss of fruit during transport and storage, and that fruit removed from the film and placed in a cardboard box lost weight more slowly compared to the other packaging tested."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397d85","5e70928f878c28a047397f69","5e709401878c28a0473b4bea"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"321","pagesFromTo":"112350","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6562071040970749a8ce1a09","6562071040970749a8ce1a0a","6562071040970749a8ce1a0b","6562071040970749a8ce1a0c","6562071040970749a8ce1a0d","6562071040970749a8ce1a0e","5e70923d878c28a04739235e","5e70928e878c28a047397d85","5e70928f878c28a047397f69","5e709401878c28a0473b4bea","5e70923d878c28a0473923b0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b4","mniswId":"18258","title":"Scientia Horticulturae","issn":"0304-4238","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"f3a1740e-adf4-4540-b7e0-d616a613a90a"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Organic substrate","Hydroponic growing","Post-harvest weight loss","Shelf life Sensory quality"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058750124"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64c9f6c840970741c01018bc","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Furmańczyk-Gnyp","documentHash":"d71a8337-0b88-4d60-9a1d-c576687bbf14"},{"objectId":"64c9f6c840970741c01018bb","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Sobieszek","documentHash":"f8c0f720-1a9e-4121-8cc1-471947c8d26a"},{"objectId":"5e70943c878c28a0473b8910","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Tartanus","uuid":"C48F7A279E8EDA4D4DFBE28F3C623A7EAA5380BBBAFDDB1CE8F9164A68B7AEEB3F79910A01C2E86DB12F23C3E9653ACC1C1BCF2B853A8F3EBA141FE39F41E80B","orcidId":"0000-0001-8374-1581","documentHash":"2e2870e8-c34f-47e9-8d68-2ceb836182d1"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75","name":"Eligio","lastName":"Malusa","uuid":"96702563F39315C1D693D3C97550CD6CAC824FFBF4F0B9CDA39B5B31CA25E279C7ADE056365DF1361FAB162C59DECD06A6B181EEEBEDF857A17AA24E3CAEAB00","orcidId":"0000-0002-9802-3379","documentHash":"1678ebd7-0f8e-4fff-b0c1-2a3a11e42d48"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64c9f6c840970741c01018b9","doi":"10.3390/horticulturae9050604","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2311-7524/9/5/604/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Integrated Control of Scales on Highbush Blueberry in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the past decade, the development of highbush blueberry production in Poland has been followed by the occurrence of new pests in the plantations, including scales. Since both the assessment of the populations of natural enemies present in a territory and the knowledge of the scale species present in the crop are crucial for the correct application of IPM strategies, a study was carried out to address these aspects and evaluate the efficacy of several active substances in controlling Parthenolecanium spp. in several highbush blueberry plantations. Specimens of adult larvae collected on several plantations were phylogenetically closely linked to two species, P. corni and P. fletcheri. However, considering the ecology and behavior of these species, it was concluded that the pest population was more likely to belong to P. corni. Analyzing the scale parasitoids’ community present in the different locations, it emerged that it was quite diversified, including species affecting both the initial and adult biological phases of the scales, with differences also in the population size and diversity, including both general or specialized parasitoids and predators. The different active substances tested in the efficacy trials, which included both synthetic and bio-based compounds, were suitable for controlling the scale infestation. However, the different efficacy observed between them, depending on season and location, could be interpreted taking into consideration the initial level of infestation. It is concluded that applying an IPM strategy that combines agronomical practices with the application of insecticides with different mechanisms of action, attentive to the benefit of protecting natural enemies, can result in satisfactory control of P. corni in highbush blueberry plantations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75","5e70943c878c28a0473b8910"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"604","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70943c878c28a0473b8910","64c9f6c840970741c01018bb","64c9f6c840970741c01018bc","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547ed47","mniswId":"27373","title":"Horticulturae","issn":"2311-7524","eissn":"2311-7524","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"d9822e24-c608-4514-bb91-1457594f0cb4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64c9f6c840970741c01018ba","year":"2023","volume":"9","number":"5","documentHash":"c19ae498-3eea-4431-ae3b-57eea7be41aa"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["IPM","natural enemies","Parthenolecanium spp.","phylogenetic analysis","Vaccinium corymbosum"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058753882"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c3425","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Frąc","uuid":"3A94F63454C49E41B84ACF88E742513FA46784E063FFCDE6A25F6137BE1290AB588E05C3C3923E8293C94AE7CEA79E9131C37FA4E1B4A5088DF875A4D4AB581E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9220-4227","documentHash":"43337914-19d4-42d3-8e7b-12f617ffde90"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398376","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Sitarek","uuid":"81A2618FAEDFB627B48156F62B32026215D11A59AF9B4AD50A23A2139DB87EC15763E2C058FFCFFCBAF8071C101C7814D2CFD0FB8C0FB0C38E7E8336773A30B0","orcidId":"0000-0001-5041-148X","documentHash":"a031375f-fb10-4242-8cbd-1baa5adf5247"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398362","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Sas-Paszt","uuid":"F65BF0798F03691C5ACA3C2A1EA4E5FD87ED5CB37729DF32BC5DB47710F0EBA374AA8CB082C6E75E322B257742E90231A958EB8FE9204AC6F2B651D5DF6471FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-4076-4032","documentHash":"c4b1b795-a964-4309-87da-3ec6e5c5aacd"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"644783694097071b71ea7b6b","doi":"10.3390/agriculture13050933","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/13/5/933/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Macro and Microelements in Leaves of ‘Meredith’ Peach Cultivar Supplied with Biochar, Organic and Beneficial Biofertilizer Combinations","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The content of macro and microelements in the leaves of peach trees treated with biochar, organic fertilization and microorganisms in the field experiment was tested. The experiment was carried out in accordance with the integrated fruit production methods at the NIHR Experimental Orchard in Dąbrowice, from 2015 to 2017. The trees were grafted on P. persica Mandżurska rootstock and planted in the spring of 2013. In 2014, the following products were applied around the trees and mixed into the topsoil: biochar at a dose of 1.6 kg/tree (2000 kg/ha); biochar at a dose of 1.6 kg/tree used together with microorganisms—bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pantoea and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi—Glomus caledonium, Glomus intraradices and Glomus coronatum; biochar at a dose of 1.6 kg/tree applied together with Florovit NPK organic fertilizer at a dose of 0.2 kg/tree; Florovit NPK; microorganisms—bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pantoea and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi—Glomus caledonium, Glomus intraradices and Glomus coronatum; Florovit NPK organic fertilizer with the same microorganisms; and an untreated control. The average results showed that, compared to the control, the biochar increased the nitrogen content in the leaves by 6%. All experimental combinations increased the content of P and K in the leaves. The most effective at increasing the content of phosphorus in leaves—by 48%—was Florovit. The greatest increase in potassium was after the use of biochar with Florovit—by 38%. The magnesium content ranged from 0.49 to 0.59 g/100 g DW. The highest content of Mg was found in the leaves after the application of biochar with Florovit, and the lowest after the use of biochar alone. The leaves of the trees fertilized with the Florovit organic fertilizer had the lowest calcium content, while the highest calcium content was found in combination with trees treated with biochar only. The use of biochar alone did not increase the content of boron in the leaves compared to the control. In all other combinations, a higher amount of boron was found. The highest—18% more than the control of this microelement had leaves where biochar and Florovit were used. Trees treated with biochar and microorganisms accumulated the least copper in the leaves, while the highest content of this element was found in the combination where biochar fertilization was applied together with Florovit. Lower iron concentrations in peach leaves were found as a result of applying microorganisms, microorganisms with the organic fertilizer and biochar, relative to organic fertilization and the control combination. Trees where only microorganisms were applied to the soil had the least manganese and zinc in the leaves. The accumulation of manganese in the leaves was most favored by fertilization with biochar together with microorganisms, and the zinc content was the highest after the use of biochar alone. In general, studies have shown that a small dose of biochar alone or biochar together with organic fertilizer is a very effective method of feeding peach trees. More research is needed on the use of microorganisms and methods of their application with various products used in orchard fertilization."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398376","5e709292878c28a047398362","5e7094c3878c28a0473c3425"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"933","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c3425","5e709292878c28a047398362","5e709292878c28a047398376"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d1","mniswId":"675","title":"Agriculture (Switzerland)","issn":"2077-0472","eissn":"2077-0472","documentHash":"f51997b3-f7b4-40a9-9013-a896e341e147"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"644783694097071b71ea7b6c","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"5","documentHash":"9afc0126-0cf8-4c05-8dcc-ff44b819f7bf"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biochar","peach","organic matter","organic fertilizer","microorganism"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058760161"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64cc99ed4097074f2a26c7eb","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kubik","documentHash":"8ff7f720-193a-49de-b8a5-63c00883ba77"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4bef","name":"Michał","lastName":"Koniarski","uuid":"14FE28C282B58BC31842FE478878BFBFE001BE92CB6953C510C894D12EC29A568D419FBF6F535DE4F08D341C8881E9C07FA3FF61D82819729E7F1A7F1765A2AA","orcidId":"0000-0001-8711-8906","documentHash":"26b8d173-d867-43c9-a0aa-2bf6e60bd2db"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398376","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Sitarek","uuid":"81A2618FAEDFB627B48156F62B32026215D11A59AF9B4AD50A23A2139DB87EC15763E2C058FFCFFCBAF8071C101C7814D2CFD0FB8C0FB0C38E7E8336773A30B0","orcidId":"0000-0001-5041-148X","documentHash":"a031375f-fb10-4242-8cbd-1baa5adf5247"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2023-03-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64cc99ed4097074f2a26c7ea","publicUri":"https://cejsh.icm.edu.pl/cejsh/element/bwmeta1.element.ojs-issn-1232-3578-year-2023-volume-112-issue-2-article-8edc39a4-76b5-3490-93e4-fd1e17b20684","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Wzrost i owocowanie wybranych odmian porzeczki czarnej","otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"Growth and fruiting of selected blackcurrant cultivars"}],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W doświadczeniu polowym założonym jesienią 2020 roku w Sadzie Doświadczal-\nnym IO-PIB w Dąbrowicach oceniano wzrost i owocowanie młodych krzewów trzynastu od-\nmian porzeczki czarnej (Ribes nigrum L.).

On the other hand, plant biostimulants improve nutrients absorption, plant growth, yield and produce quality and are environment-friendly. Therefore, an experiment was conducted during 2021-22 to evaluate the effect of some biostimulants on the performance of the apple cv. Anna, planted in a sandy loam soil at Marsa Matruh governorate, Egypt. Ninety trees were randomly selected and sprayed with 4 or 6% moringa leaf extract (MLE), 0.3 or 0.4% seaweed extract (SWE), 0.1% or 0.2% Fulvic acid (FA), 4% MLE + 0.3% SWE + 0.1% FA (combination 1), or 6% MLE + 0.4% SWE + 0.2% FA (combination 2) before flowering, during full bloom and one month later and compared with a control (untreated trees). The results demonstrated that spraying MLE, SWE or FA or their combinations positively improved the vegetative growth, fruit set %, fruit yield and fruit physical and chemical characteristics as well as leaf nutritional status. The positive effect of MLE, SWE and FA was increased in parallel to an increase in the used concentration of each one of them. The highest increments in the measured parameters were accompanied by the application of combination 2 over the other treatments."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398362","5e709288878c28a04739774c","5e709400878c28a0473b4ad4"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"32","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64afa7cf4097077ac5be6ac5","5e709292878c28a047398362","5e709400878c28a0473b4ad4","5e709288878c28a04739774c","64afa7cf4097077ac5be6ac6","64afa7cf4097077ac5be6ac7","64afa7cf4097077ac5be6ac8","64afa7cf4097077ac5be6ac9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547ed47","mniswId":"27373","title":"Horticulturae","issn":"2311-7524","eissn":"2311-7524","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"d9822e24-c608-4514-bb91-1457594f0cb4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64afa7cf4097077ac5be6ac4","year":"2022","volume":"9","number":"1","documentHash":"5db8d816-5a2a-4baa-acb6-ae82a09e133c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Malus domestica","fulvic acid","moringa leaf extract","seaweed extract"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058773087"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64afafa74097077ac5bec859","name":"Ahmed M.","lastName":"Abdelghany","documentHash":"c22c28c1-0861-4a05-9855-90e038cc6444"},{"objectId":"64afafa74097077ac5bec858","name":"Sobhi F.","lastName":"Lamlom","documentHash":"7233edf1-7e87-4d57-a8c3-172bf99e4da7"},{"objectId":"64afafa74097077ac5bec857","name":"Hayssam M.","lastName":"Ali","documentHash":"7bc6f24c-b44f-44ba-85c4-8d0a137c2329"},{"objectId":"64afafa74097077ac5bec856","name":"Mohamed","lastName":"Hefzy","documentHash":"455e3279-d2c6-4cfe-92f9-355e883e56cc"},{"objectId":"64afafa74097077ac5bec855","name":"Mostafa AbdElaal Sayed","lastName":"AbdElgalil","documentHash":"0735df2f-7fa6-4338-a67b-a76d8545c0fa"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398362","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Sas-Paszt","uuid":"F65BF0798F03691C5ACA3C2A1EA4E5FD87ED5CB37729DF32BC5DB47710F0EBA374AA8CB082C6E75E322B257742E90231A958EB8FE9204AC6F2B651D5DF6471FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-4076-4032","documentHash":"c4b1b795-a964-4309-87da-3ec6e5c5aacd"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64afafa74097077ac5bec853","doi":"10.3390/w15071296","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/15/7/1296/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Unraveling the Influence of Water and Nitrogen Management on Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.)

The present study examines how varying levels of water and nitrogen affect the agronomic and yield traits of quinoa (cv. Q-36) during the two growing seasons of 2020/2021 and 2021/2022. The experiment was a 3 × 4 factorial laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications per treatment during the two seasons of the study, as water regimes were considered the main factor, including 100%, 80%, and 60% ETc, whereas nitrogen levels were considered the sub-plot factor, comprising four levels (75, 150, 225, and 300 kgN ha−1). The analysis of variance indicated that nitrogen level, irrigation regime, and irrigation regime × nitrogen level had highly significant effects (p < 0.001) on all studied traits, including plant height, panicle length, dry weight, seed weight, seed yield, and total yield in the two growing seasons under study. For all traits of study, the combined application of 100% ETc with 300 kgN, followed by 80% ETc with 225 kgN, resulted in the highest value of plant height, panicle length, dry weight, seed weight, seed yield, and total yield, whereas the combination of 60% ETc and 75 kgN applications resulted in the lowest value for all of the aforementioned traits. Furthermore, the water regime impacted water productivity at all nitrogen levels as the highest productivity level was recorded under the 80% ETc (0.58 kg/m3), followed by the 100% ETc (0.54 kg/m3), and the 60% ETc (0.52 kg/m3). The highest water productivity rate was observed at 300 kg/ha of the nitrogen levels for 60% and 80% ETc regimes, where water productivity levels were 0.73 and 0.71 (kg/m3), respectively. The results also indicate that the water productivity of quinoa plants is noticeably affected by both water regime and nitrogen level; as the water regimes decrease from 100% to 60% ETc, water productivity increases for all nitrogen levels. The information obtained from these results can be applied to optimize the methods for cultivating quinoa under conditions of water scarcity and minimal nitrogen availability, thus gaining an insight into the impact of these conditions on quinoa growth and yield."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398362"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"7","pagesFromTo":"1296","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64afafa74097077ac5bec855","64afafa74097077ac5bec856","5e709292878c28a047398362","64afafa74097077ac5bec857","64afafa74097077ac5bec858","64afafa74097077ac5bec859"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff712ad49b31ccec48ac1","title":"WATER","issn":"2073-4441","eissn":"2073-4441","documentHash":"5a566348-ebb8-48c4-af76-1757c4c9e068"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64afafa74097077ac5bec854","year":"2023","volume":"15","number":"7","documentHash":"8c81144c-d2c3-4f3d-85eb-81d0de9edd85"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["crop evapotranspiration","drip irrigation","direct effect","pairwise relationships","seed yield","quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.)"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058773770"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c3425","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Frąc","uuid":"3A94F63454C49E41B84ACF88E742513FA46784E063FFCDE6A25F6137BE1290AB588E05C3C3923E8293C94AE7CEA79E9131C37FA4E1B4A5088DF875A4D4AB581E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9220-4227","documentHash":"43337914-19d4-42d3-8e7b-12f617ffde90"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398376","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Sitarek","uuid":"81A2618FAEDFB627B48156F62B32026215D11A59AF9B4AD50A23A2139DB87EC15763E2C058FFCFFCBAF8071C101C7814D2CFD0FB8C0FB0C38E7E8336773A30B0","orcidId":"0000-0001-5041-148X","documentHash":"a031375f-fb10-4242-8cbd-1baa5adf5247"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398362","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Sas-Paszt","uuid":"F65BF0798F03691C5ACA3C2A1EA4E5FD87ED5CB37729DF32BC5DB47710F0EBA374AA8CB082C6E75E322B257742E90231A958EB8FE9204AC6F2B651D5DF6471FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-4076-4032","documentHash":"c4b1b795-a964-4309-87da-3ec6e5c5aacd"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64af9e124097077ac5bdd259","doi":"10.3390/agriculture13061120","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/13/6/1120/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Changes in the Mineral Content of Soil following the Application of Different Organic Matter Sources","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A study conducted over three consecutive years examined the effects of using biochar, organic fertilizer and microorganisms on soil pH and the concentrations of macro and microelements in the soil.

Therefore, we investigated the capacity of an innovative phosphorus biofertilizer to enhance the activity and diversity of the soil microbiome inhabiting chemically degraded soil (type Abruptic Luvisol). The two-year field experiment comprised a control treatment (FC) devoid of microbial enrichment, an optimal dose of fertilizer containing beneficial microorganisms (FA100) and a dose of fertilizer that was 40 % below this optimal level and contained microorganisms (FA60). Phosphorus biofertilizer increased soil enzymatic activity immediately after application and between the corresponding treatments in subsequent sampling times, it alleviated the effects of metabolic stress, improved phytoavailable phosphorus content and increased maize yield. Identification based on the terminal restriction fragments size revealed the presence of microorganisms important for soil health such as phosphorus solubilizers, nitrogen fixers, biological control agents, entomopathogens, mycorrhizal fungi, bioremediators and plant growth promoters. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) showed that the application of phosphorus biofertilizer changed the relative abundance of different microbial phyla, classes and orders, increased the diversity of soil microorganisms and indicated that the composition of the soil microbiome was also dependent on the sampling time. The prediction of bacterial community function using PICRUSt demonstrated that the application of biofertilizer raised the number of functional sequences associated with metabolism and cell processes, including phosphorus compound pathways. FUNGuild showed that saprotrophic and symbiotrophic fungi were more abundant in microbiologically enriched treatments. Our results proved that the phosphorus biofertilizer used offers a sustainable and promising solution to the problem of reducing traditional mineral fertilizer inputs while ensuring soil microorganism welfare and enhancing land productivity, and, what is more, it can be effectively exploited in regenerative agriculture and as a factor used to enhance resilience to climate change."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Banana slices were either untreated, pretreated by exposure to ultrasound or microwaves, or pretreated by immersion in 5% ascorbic acid or 5% citric acid solution. Samples were then dried in a vacuum dryer at 70 °C and one of three pressures: atmospheric, 200 mmHg of vacuum or 400 mmHg of vacuum. Samples were imaged and classified using a machine learning approach based on 1629 texture parameters in nine color channels. The dried banana samples were classified with high overall accuracies reaching 96.89% for a model including combined selected textures from images in all color channels developed using the Random Forest algorithm from the group of Trees. The confusion matrix revealed the greatest mixing of cases between banana slices dried at 70 °C + gum arabic pretreatment vs. 70 °C + microwave pretreatment and 70 °C+ 200 mmHg + gum arabic pretreatment vs. 70 °C+ 200 mmHg + microwave pretreatment.

In this study, the assessment of nematodes was performed two times during the third growing season in soil contaminated by chemical elements where Miscanthus × giganteus was cultivated in the years 2019–2022. A morphological approach was used to identify the nematode communities that showed sensitivity to the level of soil contamination. In contrast, the value of M × g dry biomass was a more conservative indicator and displayed only a small yield, which decreased (3.6%) at the highest level of soil contamination by lead to 290.5 ± 75.4 µg/g. Principal component analysis revealed four trends associated with the coherent variability of contamination in soil and various organs of M × g. The variability of elements was reflected by the first three principal components and did not affect the nematode community. The variability of lead concentration was associated with principal component 4, which was the largest driver of changes in the nematode community. The trophic structure of the nematode communities was the most sensitive to soil contamination by lead. A decrease in the Structural Index was the general indicator in the transformation of the nematode community structure due to increasing levels of soil contamination."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047390fc6"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"1620","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6492a13b4097075432c67ced","5e70922b878c28a047390fc6","6492a13b4097075432c67cee","6492a13b4097075432c67cef","6492a13b4097075432c67cf0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d9","mniswId":"689","title":"Agronomy","issn":"2073-4395","eissn":"2073-4395","documentHash":"f748c34e-fa45-428e-abf2-7624cc5986fd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"648964f5409707322845f93d","year":"2023","volume":"13","number":"6","documentHash":"d0696edd-8ad7-4b03-a865-d69613b0c9cc"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bioenergy crop","bioindication","Maturity Index","species response","principal component analysis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058814523"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6561043940970749a857540a","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Szymańska","documentHash":"21737b70-dda4-427d-96d2-957b5911dd76"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4ac0","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Derkowska","uuid":"DC2C866AE8A6C089963E14A3845F032DBE76438ED234E2ECFB55841FDA45D276725BB2F275E7B39BC568D8C8887852E3B052F02A216D95BD81DC65C8A9577276","orcidId":"0000-0003-4108-336X","documentHash":"2c421a7d-ba04-4bea-af0d-5cd6b446754d"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a047398696","name":"Beata","lastName":"Sumorok","uuid":"30B3437D3166078ADC8E6F0EEBAF4D410B4D95DED2503F8F9087AAC9CC1CFC9A8E26A851803FE57C8868713678466973797C488003428654AE0EB39EEBF91B79","orcidId":"0000-0001-7688-2570","documentHash":"be7e26f8-c9ed-4720-b742-78865742da19"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398362","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Sas-Paszt","uuid":"F65BF0798F03691C5ACA3C2A1EA4E5FD87ED5CB37729DF32BC5DB47710F0EBA374AA8CB082C6E75E322B257742E90231A958EB8FE9204AC6F2B651D5DF6471FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-4076-4032","documentHash":"c4b1b795-a964-4309-87da-3ec6e5c5aacd"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397ea4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Lisek","uuid":"C38FF7CEE15417AD4CC38A70CE53F9A2560AE5D83DA50BC26F276FAF8784228713271870F15964508BC5C7EBD2E2300F98393D7F45D8360A6B078185F7CB312E","orcidId":"0000-0002-3421-8759","documentHash":"a5bd2572-1af0-4f84-8b9e-d52fcf895ac8"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941d0","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Sujkowska-Rybkowska","uuid":"DED2A876370D93084374C25ADDE169A18A5192EB0020708DF3D285376FDDE7CCCEB67B2CA811EF9C04DDCC1D91FF684B5454B2818A78736A1F307AB9C800A2E3","orcidId":"0000-0002-5234-2008","documentHash":"163ffb8c-d9e8-41c4-8c7a-29316b960861"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64c8dcc54097073b97dc16c2","doi":"10.3390/plants12112092","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/12/11/2092","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi as an Important Factor Enabling the Adaptation of Anthyllis vulneraria L. to Zn-Pb-Polluted Tailings","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The old Zn-Pb-contaminated (calamine) tailings in southern Poland are spontaneously colonized by metal-tolerant Anthyllis vulneraria L. (Fabaceae), which can form simultaneously symbiotic association with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia and phosphorus-acquiring arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). So far, fungal colonization and the AMF diversity of calamine-inhabiting legumes have been poorly studied. Thus, we determined AMF spore density in the substratum and the mycorrhizal status of nodulated A. vulneraria plants occurring on calamine tailings (M) and on a reference non-metallicolous (NM) site. The results indicate the presence of the Arum-type of arbuscular mycorrhiza in the roots of both Anthyllis ecotypes. Despite the presence of AM fungi in M plant roots, the dark septate endophyte (DSE) fungi (hyphae and microsclerotia) were occasionally also detected. Metal ions were accumulated mainly in the nodules and intraradical fungal structures rather than thick plant cell walls. Mycorrhization parameters (frequency of mycorrhization and intensity of root cortex colonization) for M plants were markedly higher and differed in a statistically significant manner from the parameters for NM plants. Heavy metal excess had no negative effect on the number of AMF spores, the amounts of glomalin-related soil proteins and AMF species composition. Molecular identification of AMF using PCR-DGGE analysis based on the 18S rDNA ribosomal gene by nested-PCR with primers AM1/NS31 and NS31-GC/Glo1 revealed similar genera/species of AMF in the roots of both Anthyllis ecotypes: Rhizophagus sp., R. fasciculatus, and R. iranicus. The results of this work indicate the presence of unique fungal symbionts, which may enhance A. vulneraria tolerance to heavy metal stress and plant adaptation to extreme conditions on calamine tailings."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928f878c28a047397ea4","5e709400878c28a0473b4ac0","5e709292878c28a047398362","5e709295878c28a047398696"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"2092","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709259878c28a0473941d0","5e70928f878c28a047397ea4","5e709295878c28a047398696","5e709400878c28a0473b4ac0","6561043940970749a857540a","5e709292878c28a047398362"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547e776","mniswId":"25607","title":"Plants","eissn":"2223-7747","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"b9b5e2d0-7e4e-4b87-9cc1-37b3d46db596"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["symbiosis","arbuscular mycorrhizae","heavy metals","Anthyllis vulneraria"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058825338"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64c8e7114097073b97dcb5e9","name":"Dalia H.","lastName":"Eshra","documentHash":"bdfb4269-8960-444a-92e7-f548780e810d"},{"objectId":"64c8e7114097073b97dcb5e8","name":"Rashid S.","lastName":"Al-Obeed","documentHash":"144a77a0-d4db-4f21-a864-43641289b865"},{"objectId":"64c8e7114097073b97dcb5e7","name":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Abdel-Sattar","documentHash":"e841a5f5-1f9b-4f6a-8152-e7e6b7a38cad"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397ea4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Lisek","uuid":"C38FF7CEE15417AD4CC38A70CE53F9A2560AE5D83DA50BC26F276FAF8784228713271870F15964508BC5C7EBD2E2300F98393D7F45D8360A6B078185F7CB312E","orcidId":"0000-0002-3421-8759","documentHash":"a5bd2572-1af0-4f84-8b9e-d52fcf895ac8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64c8e7114097073b97dcb5e5","doi":"10.3390/horticulturae9070755","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2311-7524/9/7/755/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Enhancing Anna Apples’ Productivity, Physico-Chemical Properties, and Marketability Using Sprays of Naphthalene Acetic Acid and Inhibitors of Ethylene for Alleviating Abiotic Stresses","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In order to improve the resistance of apples to stresses (abiotic stresses) during hot and dry summers to enhance their productivity and marketability, Anna apple trees were treated with aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), 1-methlcyclopropene (1-MCP), and naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), alone, or in combination, in two successive seasons.

Moreover, the increase in parameter values was parallel to the increase in the used concentrations of HA, Brs, or SWE, where 2000 mg/L HA, 2 mg/L Brs, and 3000 mg/L SWE were superior to 1000 mg/L HA, 1 mg/L Brs, and 2000 mg/L SWE, which were better than 500 mg/L HA, 0.5 mg/L Brs, and 1000 mg/L SWE."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398362"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"519","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64afabc84097077ac5be91b6","5e709292878c28a047398362","64afabc84097077ac5be91b7","64afabc84097077ac5be91b8"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547ed47","mniswId":"27373","title":"Horticulturae","issn":"2311-7524","eissn":"2311-7524","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"d9822e24-c608-4514-bb91-1457594f0cb4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64afabc84097077ac5be91b5","year":"2023","volume":"9","number":"4","documentHash":"57813c21-ed6b-4262-b2d0-3fd86c69f339"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biostimulants","fruit quality","fruit yields","leaf nutritional status","Prunus armeniaca"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058836165"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"650806db40970775139e2720","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Kiełkiewicz","documentHash":"ac835899-d2b0-4825-b10c-c739c9cb7e5c"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bdde0","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"97CA3174080827A6B0A0270F12F022527EAC69DEAF9A298A7090DB405A36D9BD3C5300A23E15C79339219E9F5C5A610F383406AAEF43CA7180E096A8773B797B","orcidId":"0000-0001-7802-9733","documentHash":"5b2d0c7c-4406-469f-b682-f04386f8910b"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4a21","name":"Anna","lastName":"Tryngiel-Gać","uuid":"98A77A282439EDFDCA5A17C1FCC501D6ACC64EE0DDE21EC927CAE3EE0F051AFE4F6A667D73E28FFE19E620EEB1194BF4B6A9636A0DD3524FA5494BB0B1F7D3D5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8766-6010","documentHash":"483e9d4e-640a-450f-9733-0cdcfc8af5db"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a0473986e0","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Treder","uuid":"CA809C02520EED47C9A82056AF627806F94D6BB9721D9DB8BB14025A6684CE9FE71CFD1C9D18ECE0B1A2610D5554D573E7368A857C8E508CD75D20E6A051643E","orcidId":"0000-0003-1640-9671","documentHash":"c6034984-8a2c-4af0-ae6a-63868a0ca950"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a0473979a2","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Klamkowski","uuid":"7E450B39DF810DB41FC8F651E1A7E17AD750C7E9A422D49912DC393B84655FBED245B386CD93F921C9DE3C513917FBB447B953F71C4C91C5B479A20AFAD3CB05","orcidId":"0000-0003-0358-3726","documentHash":"cbebff37-3723-4ee6-9d6e-43c807f2539a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-09-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"650806db40970775139e271f","doi":"10.24425/jwld.2023.145357","publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/Content/128397/PDF/2023-03-JWLD-03.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"The evaluation of rootstock and management practices to counteract replant disease in an apple orchard","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the research was to evaluate effects of different rootstocks and management practices to\ncounteracting replant disease in an apple orchard.

Apple trees of the cultivar ‘Ligolina’\nwere planted in autumn of 2013 at spacing of 3.8 × 1.4 m in the rows of an apple orchard that had been grubbed up in\nspring. The following experimental setups were used: (i) two types of rootstocks of different growth vigour (M.9, P14);\n(ii) replacement of soil in rows of trees with virgin soil; (iii) fertigation with ammonium phosphate; (iv) control\n(cultivation in the exhausted soil). Replantation significantly limited the growth of apple trees by reducing the cross-\nsectional area of the tree trunk, and the number and length of annual shoots. Fruit yields of apple trees grown on the\nreplantation site were significantly lower than those of the trees grown in virgin soil. The use of ammonium phosphate\nfertigation had a positive effect on the growth and yield on the replantation site, especially when it was combined with\nthe use of a stronger-growing rootstock (P14). The most effective environmentally friendly method of eliminating the\napple replant disease is the replacement of the exhausted soil with virgin soil, i.e. soil that has not been used for growing\nfruit trees before."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928b878c28a0473979a2","5e709295878c28a0473986e0","5e709479878c28a0473bdde0","5e709400878c28a0473b4a21"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"58","issue":"VII-IX","pagesFromTo":"17–24","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709400878c28a0473b4a21","5e709295878c28a0473986e0","5e70928b878c28a0473979a2","5e709479878c28a0473bdde0","650806db40970775139e2720"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a0a5","mniswId":"24534","title":"Journal of Water and Land Development","issn":"1429-7426","eissn":"2083-4535","websiteLink":"http://www.itp.edu.pl/wydawnictwo/journal","documentHash":"87b40f26-8cfa-4556-ac4a-b2ba8026665e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"644ba35140970748461a95a0","year":"2023","documentHash":"d57f5f6c-ffd3-4be2-b26b-286fea5f4b3d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ammonium phosphate","apple orchard","replantation","soil fatigue","virgin soil"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058840048"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ropelewska","uuid":"E3575740307CA373F3BD454AAC58C202E1C2CA28B9FC90C6BC3006DB867893BEE70DFAC85C7D9667CD0ACB7837B8DF63F7D6636679B032F0F1E0E534A3F3CBD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8891-236X","documentHash":"e9d0e369-fc46-40fe-9cb3-5236d6ea38a0"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4a25","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Szwejda-Grzybowska","uuid":"E63ABDF6CE3F6DA4DB877DAFB373AC8EE21CAFC0CDFAAA0BFF10BB63F29FB6F9DBDAEE1496421B5EA36DCA1A7313AA64673821B8C5CD0E767B6D9491422289A1","orcidId":"0000-0002-1260-5897","documentHash":"d87c59fd-a8de-4484-bf37-2aa30009886e"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398d3d","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Celejewska","uuid":"FDCEEB3A3398B14BA2A79A9E46B12524EF57B8799F2954826CEAF6338AF3CCDB2259D7964948A16AA9BC767315B198FB2DFA532ED4180DCDD48B0493550DC265","orcidId":"0000-0003-3113-3722","documentHash":"ad533844-fc78-4918-9077-788c72f4d6b9"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398355","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Rutkowski","uuid":"12FCE51B754CE6013814BA39468E85A4F3081749D4E7D6BA8DCE97B6EDAC01099FEAFA280527E2603316A0DA0A38B5905A42617D78DC34AFA88E994720E65B75","orcidId":"0000-0003-1042-1098","documentHash":"6b92cf9a-54d1-4c20-a699-1dc83d97de38"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397ebc","name":"Monika","lastName":"Mieszczakowska-Frąc","uuid":"6900A32F634EF1531D8F8C6ACE07E99EB67DDA525F899A042C0F3631CBD6903E79CD1E6BC74E398C0CD9A37D077102F17EEBAC43BB98995342398DA2B165761C","orcidId":"0000-0001-8786-7990","documentHash":"beeb1f34-0cfd-4aa6-909a-19583be25118"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397e8f","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Kruczyńska","uuid":"4590C5A32BCE4E52E286005F898A668B074C4C1091D220F6C34A63EF546555DF0F120F110389C76C3AAFE6E4FDB39337FFC70A341586E583488C9B50DA101D8D","orcidId":"0000-0002-1376-1082","documentHash":"45900a7e-0b14-476a-8924-d1e4c1c151ab"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d79","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Konopacka","uuid":"B86F354E1D172AB3FC07EC420A8D0C595C402A1BC9E7C127CE71483941E67A0E0E10A48F14A1D7C43CF67CB2C1F72A7762DAA4B85BA44FA7556DEC983B617982","orcidId":"0000-0001-8566-3337","documentHash":"b4797e68-8f49-44ed-a833-4b0c27dc3244"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6511b4974097072116399b0e","doi":"10.3390/agronomy13102452","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13102452","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Physicochemical Properties, Image Textures, and Relationships between Parameters of Red-Fleshed Apples Collected on Different Harvest Dates","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The determination of the optimal harvest date is very important to obtain the desired apple quality.

However, although the importance of manuka honey is well documented in the literature, information regarding its physicochemical characteristics remains limited. Moreover, so far, only a few papers address this issue in conjunction with the examination of the pollen composition of manuka honey samples. Therefore, in this study, two parameters crucial for honey quality control—the diastase number (DN) and the hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) content—as well as the melissopalynological analysis of manuka honey, were examined. The research found a large variation in the percentage of Leptospermum scoparium pollen in honeys labeled and sold as manuka honeys. Furthermore, a significant proportion of these honeys was characterized by a low DN. However, since low diastase activity was not associated with low HMF content, manuka honey should not be considered as a honey with naturally low enzymatic activity. Overall, the DN and HMF content results indicate that the quality of commercially available manuka honey is questionable."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6671","5e709295878c28a04739869c"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"12","issue":"15","pagesFromTo":"2930","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a6671","64e3515d4097073a377262cb","5e709295878c28a04739869c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"Foods","issn":"2304-8158","eissn":"2304-8158","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"827d8888-1217-4c9f-a068-b8a2e5756417"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64d098c440970760b68968c2","year":"2023","volume":"12","number":"15","documentHash":"03eb4120-280e-4ee0-b807-28be23a70bdf"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["manuka honey","Leptospermum scoparium","melissopalynology","diastase number (DN)","hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF)"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058864939"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64c8e41f4097073b97dc8667","name":"Muhammad Akbar","lastName":"Anjum","documentHash":"bb351fc5-59a7-4bb4-b183-3fd7a91e99a4"},{"objectId":"64c8e41f4097073b97dc8666","name":"Hayssam M.","lastName":"Ali","documentHash":"c8b0488e-b022-4523-b02b-35845837b409"},{"objectId":"64c8e41f4097073b97dc8665","name":"Sami","lastName":"Ullah","documentHash":"5313f1dd-740f-4486-8a53-cd707c69e0aa"},{"objectId":"64c8e41f4097073b97dc8664","name":"Muhammad Moaaz","lastName":"Ali","documentHash":"b7b800f4-dfda-4388-a6ba-9fabe86786ae"},{"objectId":"64c8e41f4097073b97dc8663","name":"Hasan","lastName":"Sardar","documentHash":"cbcd0cd6-e76c-4cf8-a49c-915acfb16cc3"},{"objectId":"64c8e41f4097073b97dc8662","name":"Sajid","lastName":"Ali","documentHash":"4ee4c963-7a9a-4c16-9af9-d8caf18c1c3a"},{"objectId":"64c8e41f4097073b97dc8661","name":"Walid F.

Therefore, this study was carried out to maintain the quality of stored persimmons by using edible coatings. For this purpose, Aloe vera gel was combined with food hydrocolloids, gum arabic or tragacanth gum, and applied on persimmon fruits that were stored for 20 days at 20 ± 1 °C and 80–85% RH. Biocomposite coatings, compared to control, remarkably reduced weight loss, decay incidence, respiration rate, ethylene production, electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde, H2O2 and superoxide anion content in stored fruits. The use of composite coatings inhibited colour change by reducing the accumulation of total carotenoids, maintained higher antioxidative enzymes activity and suppressed the activity of cell wall degrading enzymes, resultantly preserving cell wall components. Composite coated fruits exhibited the least change in biochemical attributes and higher sensory scores in comparison with non-coated fruits at the end of the storage period. In conclusion, Aloe vera gel/gum arabic was the most effective coating treatment before storing persimmons."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa -

The trees were trained in the shape of the letter ‘Y’, with the shoots raised at an angle of 20° or 30° to the horizontal, intended for mechanical harvesting of dessert fruit with a harvester attached to a tractor. The two tree canopy formation systems at both shoot inclination angles were compared with the standard spindle crown with a vertical leader, from which the fruit was picked by hand. After 3 years of training the trees, mechanical harvesting of dessert fruit began with a harvester designed at the Institute of Horticulture in Skierniewice. The trees formed in the shape of the letter ‘Y’ produced comparable yields, and also higher and lower yields, depending on the cultivar, in comparison with the trees trained to a spindle crown."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709400878c28a0473b4a95","5e709288878c28a0473976f9"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"35-46","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709288878c28a0473976f9","64fee80f4097070dd41f4c9c","5e709400878c28a0473b4a95"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e56","mniswId":"322","title":"Acta Scientiarum Polonorum Hortorum Cultus","issn":"1644-0692","eissn":"2545-1405","documentHash":"b52d6e0d-adfb-46ab-ba0a-08c89420b431"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64f6c9c040970732fea2b59c","year":"2023","volume":"22","number":"4","documentHash":"7f97edd1-c49a-4493-9cea-b75873a55a10"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["stone fruit","canopy form","way of harvesting","tree efficiency"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058887959"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bdde0","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"97CA3174080827A6B0A0270F12F022527EAC69DEAF9A298A7090DB405A36D9BD3C5300A23E15C79339219E9F5C5A610F383406AAEF43CA7180E096A8773B797B","orcidId":"0000-0001-7802-9733","documentHash":"5b2d0c7c-4406-469f-b682-f04386f8910b"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4a21","name":"Anna","lastName":"Tryngiel-Gać","uuid":"98A77A282439EDFDCA5A17C1FCC501D6ACC64EE0DDE21EC927CAE3EE0F051AFE4F6A667D73E28FFE19E620EEB1194BF4B6A9636A0DD3524FA5494BB0B1F7D3D5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8766-6010","documentHash":"483e9d4e-640a-450f-9733-0cdcfc8af5db"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a0473986e0","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Treder","uuid":"CA809C02520EED47C9A82056AF627806F94D6BB9721D9DB8BB14025A6684CE9FE71CFD1C9D18ECE0B1A2610D5554D573E7368A857C8E508CD75D20E6A051643E","orcidId":"0000-0003-1640-9671","documentHash":"c6034984-8a2c-4af0-ae6a-63868a0ca950"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a0473979a2","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Klamkowski","uuid":"7E450B39DF810DB41FC8F651E1A7E17AD750C7E9A422D49912DC393B84655FBED245B386CD93F921C9DE3C513917FBB447B953F71C4C91C5B479A20AFAD3CB05","orcidId":"0000-0003-0358-3726","documentHash":"cbebff37-3723-4ee6-9d6e-43c807f2539a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-09-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"650828834097077513a0540f","doi":"10.24425/jwld.2023.145358","publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/Content/128399/PDF/2023-03-JWLD-04.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Machine learning for supporting irrigation decisions based on climatic water balance","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A machine learning model was developed to support irrigation decisions.

In vitro, the growth of the mycelium of pathogens was reduced by 41.21% to 53.64%, and spore germination was inhibited by 58.39% to 71.22%. Both yeast strains produced the enzymes chitinase, β-1,3-glucanase, and amylase, and A. pullulans PP3 additionally produced protease and cellulase. This yeast strain also had the ability to grow over a wide range of temperature (4–30 °C), salinity (0–12%) and pH (4–11) conditions. No growth of the yeast was observed at 37 °C, nor any biogenic amines or hydrogen sulfide production.

Most organic amendments, such as crop residues and farmyard manure, are short lived because of rapid decomposition. Incubation and pot studies were conducted to assess the impact of wheat straw biochar (produced at 350 °C) on temporal changes in soil microbial biomass and fertility status and to evaluate the efficacy of biochar for maize production in the top layer of Typic calciargid. The incubation study compared four levels of biochar (control, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0% on a w/w basis of soil) and two fertilizer rates, i.e., unfertilized (no NPK fertilizer) and fertilized (nitrogen, P2O5 and K2O with rates of 125, 80 and 52.5 mg kg−1 soil, respectively). After incubation, the 2.0% biochar significantly improved the soil cation exchange capacity, organic carbon and microbial biomass carbon by up to 35, 59 and 26%, respectively, while decreasing the soil pH by up to 1.5% compared to that of the control treatment. When fertilized, the 2.0% biochar improved the soil’s available phosphorous, extractable potassium and total nitrogen by up to 59, 39 and 28%, respectively, compared to those of the control. The results from the pot experiment showed that using the 1% biochar with fertilizer significantly increased the maize dry biomass and grain yield by up to 57 and 72%, respectively, compared to those of the control. Additionally, the nitrogen and phosphorus recoveries from the mineral fertilizers improved significantly (up to 26 and 38%, respectively) when using the 1.0% biochar compared to those of the control. Conclusively, the addition of 1.0% biochar significantly improved maize growth and yield by enhancing nutrient recovery from mineral fertilizer and improving soil properties."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398362"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"9488","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["653796a4409707399eebdb61","653796a4409707399eebdb62","653796a4409707399eebdb63","653796a4409707399eebdb64","653796a4409707399eebdb65","653796a4409707399eebdb66","653796a4409707399eebdb67","653796a4409707399eebdb68","653796a4409707399eebdb69","653796a4409707399eebdb6a","5e709292878c28a047398362","653796a4409707399eebdb6b","653796a4409707399eebdb6c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","eissn":"2071-1050","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"46882d20-8996-4dde-bd15-7d5f8ecc797a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"648c2bea4097077564c49b83","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"15","number":"12","documentHash":"38c25c70-a244-482f-b455-66865c3af353"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["wheat straw biochar","alkaline calcareous soil","microbial biomass carbon","nutrient recovery","soil organic carbon"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058940266"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64ede7c94097076b0962e61b","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Jóźwiak","documentHash":"4bdb39f5-7582-4bba-a2c5-d9ea78845f9e"},{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b79e7","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Pieczywek","uuid":"98FC6DB58918B7F176C72186B441AAB63D8F58B17FE78E63BDEAC6435BF4D4B07ED4FB94BEA505A5E65FA58483442D63F2CD945B594EAD0084FED0A08899D273","orcidId":"0000-0002-3986-3802","documentHash":"db9edfb1-e6a6-4896-9bf3-c90ee48fa1ce"},{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b4239","name":"Artur","lastName":"Zdunek","uuid":"8A390218FDC6DEFCED763C9DA2909C4BE0BCA53DCEF103AD738A8E9BCC2FE5E26E2CE0660EC1D20063043207FBC4CFB8552FB5E17D5080A325C6E2310E88A97E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9395-1486","documentHash":"95d0547b-dd21-439a-be25-1616f7d1c9ec"},{"objectId":"5e709349878c28a0473a66ae","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Cybulska","uuid":"7AC1CC65DB27BF80DFBBB188220BAC5413329A7D19ABE1D8B16BC81769D592170CD381D291E423C82D077833DE95280A42FC448F999AE82C18A83A4F98D7B494","orcidId":"0000-0003-3323-4535","documentHash":"0e90ea03-6325-45b4-9199-db4f54f21b09"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6657","name":"Agata","lastName":"Leszczuk","uuid":"904FF541B3F71D3D7AE68AAF5E220458F527553B0A25EE35C9B8A1A62470A7CC725163B93E21A6B37207181D707E48D522147C1B581EF9BF757185D4781807A8","orcidId":"0000-0002-8876-8377","documentHash":"586a5433-d942-433e-b712-2c06074c04e1"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ada1","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kurzyna - Szklarek","uuid":"CDBC16A578944DB354B9D5F2AE71B327C03EF72286653CD564F1C7165DE723C4E7106DC69C8CF7205977EA10ED1123117D9E12EC041AA3FADBF9FDB626C7E0D9","orcidId":"0000-0002-6258-6153","documentHash":"9c3d3999-5381-455b-8400-5cff35dce831"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398355","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Rutkowski","uuid":"12FCE51B754CE6013814BA39468E85A4F3081749D4E7D6BA8DCE97B6EDAC01099FEAFA280527E2603316A0DA0A38B5905A42617D78DC34AFA88E994720E65B75","orcidId":"0000-0003-1042-1098","documentHash":"6b92cf9a-54d1-4c20-a699-1dc83d97de38"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64ede7c94097076b0962e616","doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-40782-6","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-40782-6.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Apple metabolism under oxidative stress affects plant cell wall structure and mechanical properties","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Several studies have shown beneficial effects of short exposure to oxidative stress on stored fruit, such as better preservation, increased firmness, preservation of polyphenolic compounds, and reduced risk of postharvest disorders such as bitter pit and superficial scald in apples. In this study the effect of short-term oxidative stress conditions on the physiology of apple fruit was investigated. Apple fruit of three cultivars were exposed to hypoxic storage conditions of various lengths to induce anaerobiosis. The response of apple fruit to short-term oxidative stress was evaluated by means of cell wall immunolabeling and atomic force microscopy. In addition, the antioxidant capacity and antioxidative activity of apple peels was assessed. Through various techniques, it was shown that short-term oxidative stress conditions promote specific enzymatic activity that induces changes in the cell wall of apple fruit cells. Exposure to short-term stress resulted in the remodeling of cell wall pectic polysaccharides, observed as an increase in the size and complexity of extracted oxalate pectin. Structural changes in the cell wall were followed by an increase in Young’s modulus (compressive stiffness of a solid material, expressed as the relationship between stress and axial strain) of the cell wall material. The data presented in this paper show in a novel way how storage under short-term oxidative stress modifies the cell wall of apple fruit at the molecular level."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398355"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

In the research, nematode populations were monitored within six simultaneously operating composting processes. These processes involved varying proportions of feedstock materials. The primary objective was to evaluate the consistency of nematode community succession patterns across the composting processes over a time of 3 months. During the study, samples were taken every month to isolate nematodes, determine the population density of the five trophic groups (per genus) and determine the dominant nematode species. It was shown that the bacterial-feeding community maintained dominance, while the fungus-feeding nematodes gradually increased in dominance as the maturation process progressed. The presence of predatory nematodes Mononchoides which were initially absent, along with the total absence of parasitic nematodes in the late stages of waste stabilization, serves as strong evidence for the reliable evaluation of the biodegradable waste processing level. Based on the obtained results, it is evident that the succession of nematode communities holds promise as a reliable method for evaluating compost maturity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa -

The research was conducted in an experimental orchard and a greenhouse of the National Institute of Horticultural Research in Skierniewice, Poland, in 2017–2019 (2 cycles of obtaining planting material and growing plants). The tray plants (rooted tips) were grown in the natural field conditions until they were transferred in batches to a cold store (–2°C) on five different dates: 12 Oct., 30 Oct., 20 Nov., 11 Dec., and 3 Jan. (of the following year). The number of accumulated chilling hours less than 7°C was recorded for each transfer date, and the roots were analysed for starch content at the time of transfer. After the end of cold storage (3 months, standardised for all treatments), the plants were planted in pots and transferred to a greenhouse to assess growth and plant yielding. The obtained results indicate that chilling induces changes in the extent of starch accumulation. The highest starch accumulation in ‘Sonata’ roots was recorded when the plants received about 500 h of chilling (under Polish conditions accumulated in November/December). In the ‘Albion’ strawberry case, the maximum was found at the lower chilling level – about 300 h (middle of November). The highest fruit yields were produced by ‘Sonata’ plants, for which the number of chilling hours (0–7°C) was 500–800 h. In the case of ‘Albion’, the values were 2–3 times lower. A more extended period of keeping tray plants in field conditions (over 1000 h of chilling) resulted in a deterioration in fruit yield."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928f878c28a047397eaf","5e70928b878c28a0473979a2","5e709295878c28a0473986e0","5e709479878c28a0473bdde0","5e709400878c28a0473b4a21"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"41-51","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709479878c28a0473bdde0","5e70928b878c28a0473979a2","5e709295878c28a0473986e0","5e70928f878c28a047397eaf","5e709400878c28a0473b4a21"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e56","mniswId":"322","title":"Acta Scientiarum Polonorum Hortorum Cultus","issn":"1644-0692","eissn":"2545-1405","documentHash":"b52d6e0d-adfb-46ab-ba0a-08c89420b431"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"64f9b74240970774bae18931","year":"2023","volume":"22","number":"3","documentHash":"efb64e1c-6280-47f1-9561-ba7dff3c01fe"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fragaria × ananassa","chilling requirements","cold storage","protected cultivation","photoperiod"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058967712"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4ce3","name":"Marek","lastName":"Hryniewicz","uuid":"22D9D8369F0323A971788051A48C68D014691DA508BC7713996907AD1699FD752AE5D66E54E5C625FA5590CCA825FE5A9E2507FAF70B05D3361E2A01666A6B3F","orcidId":"0000-0001-9926-699X","documentHash":"d1a3f67f-764e-41e5-be54-8b42ebbc0324"},{"objectId":"5e709350878c28a0473a70e9","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Kozacki","uuid":"A71F79FE71E57243D7F0E8913A863DA02E11E2D121CF0F2CA8D6A873C434B09D0905DF48A69167153CAF661C0DE7ED28C72E3EF92316C451EEE92251931C52FF","orcidId":"0000-0003-2847-2758","documentHash":"670d4628-dc31-46ee-a60e-1ab028e886a6"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b113","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Makulec","uuid":"42D9E5AEEFC604F4A7586EC6C56F905A0930D9474B96EAB7377B195E143DEF7EC82C9D9FA0400D15E9ABC18974D06D2A1923B3E22ED8EA06F04CB3A6EC08F5F5","documentHash":"0cdabfc2-09d6-4f75-acd5-7d6bc746de0a"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b06a","name":"Krassimira","lastName":"Ilieva-Makulec","uuid":"9B331930385D10175E0D6F41460E0DCECBBFB5F17C54AF3C55BA8FA5C7C585F2F7A457F3B2C5CBFDB958C43B7CC60167BD9365904CF325AE5FE12B6614B67637","orcidId":"0000-0002-7570-3822","documentHash":"6b2a98e9-205f-4c8b-9128-2877c2d65cd8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-09-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65093cf94097077d0972fce9","doi":"10.24425/jwld.2023.146600","publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/Content/128411/PDF/2023-03-JWLD-10.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Soil conditions under great cormorant and grey heron colonies in a wetland: Effect on soil nematode abundance and trophic structure","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study aimed to investigate how great cormorants and grey herons affect the density and trophic diversity of soil nematodes under breeding colonies located in Stawy Raszyńskie Nature Reserve (central Poland). Soil samples from the colonies were compared to control samples from adjacent areas unaffected by birds. Samples were taken at each site (two colonies and two relevant control sites) to a depth of 20 cm, and the soil cores were split into topsoil (0–10 cm) and subsoil (10–20 cm). A modified Baermann method was used to extract nematodes from the soil. The soil under nests supported more abundant nematode communities, but with a lower trophic diversity compared to the control sites. The cormorants had a greater impact on nematodes than the herons. We found that the external nitrogen input, the higher organic matter content and abundance of ammonifying bacteria, as well as the lower soil pH under the colonies than in the control sites, affected the nematode trophic groups in different ways. Compared to the control sites, there were significantly more bacterivorous nematodes but fewer herbivorous nematodes under the colonies. No predatory nematodes were found under the bird colonies and, in the case of the cormorant colony, no omnivorous nematodes. No significant differences in the abundance of fungivorous nematodes between the impact and the control plots were noticed. The results indicate that allochthonous input under bird colonies promotes microbial activity and the most opportunistic trophic group of nematodes, which may at least temporarily enhance decomposition and mineralisation processes and consequently affect nutrient cycling in the wetland soil."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709350878c28a0473a70e9"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"58","issue":"VII-IX","pagesFromTo":"79-88","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709350878c28a0473a70e9","5e7092b4878c28a04739b06a","5e709401878c28a0473b4ce3","5e7092b4878c28a04739b113"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a0a5","mniswId":"24534","title":"Journal of Water and Land Development","issn":"1429-7426","eissn":"2083-4535","websiteLink":"http://www.itp.edu.pl/wydawnictwo/journal","documentHash":"32118440-45d0-4449-88f7-e2303ab01546"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"644ba35140970748461a95a0","year":"2023","documentHash":"d57f5f6c-ffd3-4be2-b26b-286fea5f4b3d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bird excreta","great cormorant","grey heron","nematodes","nitrogen"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747058981537"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6511b4974097072116399b0d","name":"Kadir","lastName":"Sabanci","documentHash":"0a896cd7-bad1-4447-aacc-2f47be71dd44"},{"objectId":"6511b4974097072116399b0c","name":"Muhammet Fatih","lastName":"Aslan","documentHash":"483b2603-cf46-4092-82dd-a7d1af72d604"},{"objectId":"6511b4974097072116399b0b","name":"Leyla","lastName":"Nazari","documentHash":"ff21ceb3-4a2e-4b03-b34e-89f27f12006d"},{"objectId":"5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ropelewska","uuid":"E3575740307CA373F3BD454AAC58C202E1C2CA28B9FC90C6BC3006DB867893BEE70DFAC85C7D9667CD0ACB7837B8DF63F7D6636679B032F0F1E0E534A3F3CBD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8891-236X","documentHash":"e9d0e369-fc46-40fe-9cb3-5236d6ea38a0"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-23","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6511b4974097072116399b06","doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-42984-4","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-42984-4","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Integrated transcriptomic meta-analysis and comparative artificial intelligence models in maize under biotic stress","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Biotic stress imposed by pathogens, including fungal, bacterial, and viral, can cause heavy damage leading to yield reduction in maize. Therefore, the identification of resistant genes paves the way to the development of disease-resistant cultivars and is essential for reliable production in maize. Identifying different gene expression patterns can deepen our perception of maize resistance to disease. This study includes machine learning and deep learning-based application for classifying genes expressed under normal and biotic stress in maize. Machine learning algorithms used are Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Ensemble, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree (DT). A Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) based network with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture is proposed for gene classification with deep learning.

Currently, there are no PCR assays to distinguish Xac from all other pathovars of X. arboricola. A comparative genomics approach with publicly available genomes of Xac was used to identify unique sequences, conserved across the genomes of the pathogen. We identified a 2,440 bp genomic region that was unique to Xac and designed identification and detection systems for conventional PCR, qPCR (SYBR® Green and TaqMan™), and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). All PCR assays performed on genomic DNA isolated from eight X. arboricola pathovars and closely related bacterial species confirmed the specificity of designed primers. These new multi-platform molecular diagnostic tools may be used by plant clinics and researchers to detect and identify Xac in pure cultures and hazelnut tissues rapidly and accurately."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa -

The impact of hydro-alcoholic extracts of Calendula officinalis, Salvia officinalis, Tagetes sp., and Taraxacum officinale on growth and root development of plants of five strawberry cultivars (‘Albion’, ‘Florence’, ‘Magnum’, ‘Rumba’, and ‘San Andreas’) grown in semi-field controlled conditions was tested in the present study. The vigor and growth of the five strawberry genotypes were significantly affected by the extracts, with cv.

However, the C. officinalis flower extract consistently improved the root architecture, increasing the value of five out of six parameters compared to the control. The genotype-related response points to the strong influence of the “variety factor” on the possible effect of plant extracts considered for biostimulation, plant protection purposes, or both, prompting the need for additional work to unravel the bottlenecks in using botanicals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75","5e70936e878c28a0473a95fc","5e70943c878c28a0473b8910"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"43-54","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70936e878c28a0473a95fc","5e70943c878c28a0473b8910","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e56","mniswId":"322","title":"Acta Scientiarum Polonorum Hortorum Cultus","issn":"1644-0692","eissn":"2545-1405","documentHash":"b52d6e0d-adfb-46ab-ba0a-08c89420b431"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6557750b4097077c67940d34","year":"2023","volume":"22","number":"5","documentHash":"36a06513-2ef3-4a41-b42f-c4a9838c177e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fragaria × ananassa","biostimulant","organic farming","root architecture"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059021303"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092db878c28a04739e38c","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Keller-Przybyłkowicz","uuid":"F74E523D181773B9760663C0AB0B2E52602C676EAE3122C10C4624C429A96088D72B252BE68A6CE52BDD357BD119F8BF1FE743493F5F14897B6A4F7CDF06670E","orcidId":"0000-0002-3473-9706","documentHash":"360d8a0a-fb76-4750-995f-ba5c35e30686"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a0473983a3","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Sobiczewski","uuid":"043EDCCAEE224C9E3FB91A4CBD06FF271FA0A2E5027F427C9F4FA028BA6E00DD8CAC0E8AA3EFA8A41F4CBD1D888131A920E51CACABF95AA1113F1783055EA4AA","orcidId":"0000-0001-9925-3611","documentHash":"83c979d7-ef2f-4ba8-85d0-1ef16c219dbf"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397ea0","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Lewandowski","uuid":"FF9CB12B6F29964A550A5E57E5FD89260B52352595E70F20C435F3D419C03232071E90EF786DD9DE8845ACEF45C58EFA629D010F430B68BF6C31B8E066171866","orcidId":"0000-0002-4852-5514","documentHash":"a75b54d4-0935-425b-ad8e-156f972f1c3e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65449c4b40970708f941399b","doi":"10.14199/ppp-2023-017","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.14199/ppp-2023-017","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Postępy w hodowli odpornościowej jabłoni na zarazę ogniową","otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"Progress in apple breeding for resistance to fire blight"}],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W pracy przedstawiono najważniejsze zagadnienia dotyczące hodowli odpornościowej jabłoni na zarazę ogniową stwarzającej ogromne możliwości zwiększenia efektywności produkcji jabłek bez użycia innych metod ochrony, w tym metody chemicznej.

The phenotypic assessment of susceptibility of apple genotypes to the disease is based on observations on the occurrence of symptoms in field and/or closed facilities, e.g. in the greenhouse. Molecular biology methods, including identification of resistance markers, and biotechnology are valuable tools to accelerate the breeding process. Breeding programs conducted in various research centers around the world use wild species of the genus Malus and commercial cultivars of apple. Apple rootstocks with very high resistance to fire blight (USA) and a number of scab-resistant cultivars, also showing high resistance to the disease (Germany, Switzerland) have already been bred. In recent years cultivar Early Szampion and clone No. 69 (J-2003-05) have been bred in Poland. Both genotypes are characterized by a very high resistance, and produce attractive tasty fruit.

Plant biostimulants are substances defined by their ability, when applied to plants or the rhizosphere, to enhance root development, resulting in heightened vigor. They facilitate the more effective uptake and translocation of nutrients and water throughout the growing season. Additionally, these biostimulants contribute to improved plant health and quality by supplying essential nutrients that stimulate overall growth and metabolic processes. Therefore, this study was performed to examine the impact of some biostimulants on the possibility of improving vegetative growth, yield, fruit quality, and the leaf mineral content of mango cv. Keitt. Mango trees were sprayed with Putrescine at 25, 50, and 100 mg/L; Brassinosteroids at 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/L; and Chitosan at 500, 1000, and 1500 mg/L four times starting from mid-April, with three-week intervals during the seasons of 2021 and 2022. The results showed that the foliar application of these three biostimulants improved the growth, yield, and fruit quality of mango trees as opposed to untreated trees during two study seasons. The results also showed that the foliar application of 1500 mg/L of Chit, 2 mg/L of Brs, and 100 mg/L of Put gave the highest increments for inducing the number, length, and thickness of shoots, leaf area, and leaf chlorophyll over the other applied treatments.

Today’s supply chain as a whole needs quick and easy methods for evaluating fruit quality. Thus, the objective of this study was to estimate the quality attributes of Flame Seedless grape berries cultivated under various agronomical management and other practices using color space coordinates (berry L*, berry a*, and berry b*) as inputs in an artificial neural network (ANN) model with the best topology of (3-20-11). Satisfactory predictions based on the R2 range, which was 0.9817 to 0.9983, were obtained for physical properties (i.e., berry weight, berry length, and berry diameter as well as berry adherence strength) and chemical properties (i.e., anthocyanin, total soluble solids (TSS), TSS/titratable acidity, total sugars, titratable acidity, reducing sugars, and non-reducing sugars). Meanwhile, we also performed a contribution analysis to analyze the relative importance of CIELab colorimeter parameters of berries L*, a*, and b* to determine the main fruit quality. In terms of relative contribution, berry b* contributed relatively largely to berry weight, berry adherence strength, TSS, TSS/titratable acidity, titratable acidity, total sugars, reducing sugars, and non-reducing sugars and a* contributed relatively largely to anthocyanin, berry length, and berry diameter. The developed ANN prediction model can aid growers in enhancing the quality of Flame Seedless grape berries by selecting suitable agronomical management and other practices to avoid potential quality issues that could affect consumers of them. This research demonstrated how color space coordinates and ANN model may well be utilized to evaluate the Flame seedless grape berries’ quality."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709288878c28a04739774c"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"18","pagesFromTo":"2766","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["657c2f474097072a4164e956","657c2f474097072a4164e957","657c2f474097072a4164e958","657c2f474097072a4164e959","5e709288878c28a04739774c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"Foods","issn":"2304-8158","eissn":"2304-8158","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"827d8888-1217-4c9f-a068-b8a2e5756417"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"632c2e054097076d6d3ffa6e","year":"2022","volume":"11","number":"18","documentHash":"d0e7d773-08a4-4909-bc76-e2bd1041aaf5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["agricultural practices","chemical properties","grape","quality","machine learning","modeling","physical properties"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059143672"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b81d2","name":"Anna","lastName":"Poniatowska","uuid":"A17A92D95A720067A1787631B3CBF85469A19DD11F3376C16B2C0A76A3EE2CF7B588530C89DA7E960C00DF7712F6079057AF56FC4296B5A0E078DBF317C5C79F","orcidId":"0000-0002-5689-431X","documentHash":"8ebfbf1c-bb08-4b97-9019-1390fc779b24"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4bed","name":"Monika","lastName":"Michalecka","uuid":"C4542F748AB90EAAE53D48D32DB2299EE413F85CB8C5165F0CEE9DE33455E3A6284B3B1369D30EDA7787A3F14A81BAC8F80A19C9D321DC7C75C0384BD8A75BD0","orcidId":"0000-0002-9875-4817","documentHash":"6f7a4b4a-295b-461c-98b7-62fae8ca7707"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398341","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Puławska","uuid":"A2F13D21947DD9E5CA8586F26E280B3CE2C9F1E3B7EDE455195E9E313A348C66551979BBD618F4DBE6F5E5EF071DC6DC28BB1E1BD29693C3A50E2DB9BBEFE4EF","orcidId":"0000-0001-5327-1056","documentHash":"3475c8e9-bf80-473e-9268-fbb10a5ccf56"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"NOVEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"6571ad4640970741e5c09145","doi":"10.1111/ppa.13820","publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ppa.13820","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"LAMP‐based detection of <i>Monilinia fructigena</i>, <i>Monilinia polystroma</i> and <i>Monilinia fructicola</i> in latently infected apple fruit","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Brown rot in apples is caused by fungi belonging to the genus Monilinia and occurs an-nually in orchards with varying severity. The symptoms of the disease on apple fruits may occur during harvest and can also develop much later in storage. Therefore, from a practical point of view, it is very important to be able to test a sample of asymptomatic apples before putting them in storage or sending them to distant markets. Thus, there is a need to develop a quick and sensitive method of detecting disease causal agents in asymptomatically infected fruit. For this purpose, a procedure for DNA isolation from the skin of apples was developed, and a set of primers for the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) reaction was designed based on a fragment of the hsp60 gene en-coding heat shock protein 60 of Monilinia fungi that are pathogenic to apple: M. fructi-gena, M. fructicola and M. polystroma. The method was validated by reactions with DNA from infected apple fruit exhibiting brown rot symptoms and DNA from infected apple fruit without visible brown rot symptoms (latent infection). To increase the sensitivity of detection before the LAMP reaction, preamplification of the target DNA was carried out. The sensitivity of detection in the LAMP assay for the DNA of all three tested spe-cies of fungi was 2 pg. The DNA preamplification significantly increased the sensitiv-ity  of  Monilinia DNA detection to 0.1 pg.

Genotypes with a high content of Vitis amurensis genes, such as 'Agat Doń-\nski' and 'Kristaly', were most often damaged by spring frosts, but they had high regenerative\nabilities. ‘Swenson Red’ was most susceptible to downy mildew and powdery mildew, while\n‘Reliance’ and ‘Einset’ were most susceptible to gray mold."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398376"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"113","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"68-87","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65a4e6b44097071df01c27ec","5e709292878c28a047398376","65a4e6b44097071df01c27ed"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9ac0fad204581b62ebb4d","mniswId":"201256","title":"Zagadnienia Doradztwa Rolniczego","issn":"1232-3578","documentHash":"3c3ae9fb-2720-46fc-b087-5e5739bd2e99"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["winorośl","mieszańce międzygatunkowe","wytrzymałość na mróz","zdrowotność"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["grape plants","interspecific hybrids","frost resistance","health status"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059245613"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a0473976fc","name":"Mirosława","lastName":"Cieślińska","uuid":"B12B546E5CA747E64AC0CFB0E277FEC5D62BE62D8E8D34AF198A5D6F3F1F8E22F12C51EC458367CCB5EF39EB5240C52C67B2D043B451344A82A2B2B392B35DFD","orcidId":"0000-0001-6023-9070","documentHash":"aaeaf870-d5d2-443a-a9f9-e54e99d567a1"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65a5324d4097071df024601f","doi":"10.2478/johr-2023-0036","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/johr-2023-0036","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Detection and Molecular Characterization of Peach Latent Mosaic Viroid Isolates Infecting Stone Fruit Trees in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Field surveys were carried out to assess the incidence of peach latent mosaic viroid in nine orchards\nof stone fruit trees in four growing regions of Poland. Forty of 119 peaches, six of 37 apricots, five of\neight nectarines and one of four plums trees tested positive by RT-PCR for this viroid. Most of the infected\nstone fruit trees did not show any symptoms. Leaf yellow mosaic was only noticed on ‘Maycrest’ peach\nand ‘Saturn’ nectarine trees, and additional symptoms of cracked fruits with corky sutures and enlarged\npits were observed on one ‘Maycrest’ tree. One or two isolates from each orchard and each species of\ninfected tree were selected, and together, 11 isolates of peach latent mosaic viroid were used for genetic\nanalyses. The nucleotide sequence similarity of selected isolates found in Poland was 93.6–100%. They\nshared 82.0–98.8% similarity with the viroid strains from different hosts and geographical regions. The\nphylogenetic analysis led to the clustering of all isolates detected during this study in the most numerous\nrepresented subgroup II-A, composed of peach latent mosaic viroid strains originating from different ge-\nographic regions and host plants. Although Polish isolates were clustered in the same subgroup, some\ndiffered in length and nucleotide sequences.

The traditional machine learning\nalgorithms, such as PART, Logistic, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, IBk, and Filtered Classifier were applied. All three classes\nwere distinguished with an average accuracy of up to 93.33% for models built using IBk and Filtered Classifier. In the case\nof each model, Starozagorski kamush variety was completely different (accuracy of 100%, precision, and F-measure, MCC\n(Matthews correlation coefficient), and ROC (receiver operating characteristic) area of 1.000) from breeding lines, and the\nmixing of cases was observed between breeding line 4 and breeding line 39.

So far, it has been detected in almost all areas of pome fruit cultivation and in some regions it causes economic damage every year. Plant protection against fire blight is aimed at both preventing their infection and controlling the disease. However, the protection of plants against bacteriosis is generally difficult due to the small range of plant protection products and the growing doubts about their safety for the environment. Limitations related to their use have resulted in an increased interest in alternative methods, including the method of biological protection using various microorganisms. The first research on biological control agents was conducted in the USA about 100 years ago. Currently, it is also carried out in other countries, especially where fire blight causes economic losses. Commercial products whose active ingredients are mainly bacteria have already been developed. This work is a review of the studies and achievements in this field from its beginnings focusing on the Gram-negative bacteria and bacteriophages as a biocontrol agents."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa -

Meteorological variables (mean and maximum air temperature, average air humid-\nity, average level of solar radiation, vapor pressure deficit, extraterrestrial solar radiation, and day number of\nthe year) were used as input. The simulation used two calculation scenarios: data with and without average\nsolar radiation. The performance of the different machine learning models was evaluated using the mean\nsquare error, root mean square error, coefficient of determination, and slope of regression forced through the\norigin between the measured and simulated ETo. The results demonstrated that the applied models were able\nto describe nonlinear relationships between weather parameters and evapotranspiration. The accuracy of evap-\notranspiration estimation depended on the type of input variables and the machine learning model used. The\nhighest level of evapotranspiration prediction was obtained using the artificial neural networks model. Includ-\ning solar radiation data in the calculations improved the quality of evapotranspiration prediction in all four\nmodels. In the absence of data on the actual solar radiation reaching the Earth’s surface, it is advisable to\nsupplement the input data with data on extraterrestrial solar radiation and the day number of the year.

Treating seeds\nwith these methods had a positive effect on health, germination and emergence, initial plant growth and gas\nexchange in greenhouse and field conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928b878c28a047397912","5e70928b878c28a047397929"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","pagesFromTo":"157-171","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928b878c28a047397929","5e70928b878c28a047397912","65a796974097071e0b86ec1e","65a796974097071e0b86ec1f"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"65a795524097071e0b86dc5d","title":"Osiągnięcia i perspektywy badawcze z zakresu nauk przyrodniczych","year":2023,"isbn":"978-83-67881-32-6","url":"https://bc.wydawnictwo-tygiel.pl/publikacja/DCB6A7ED-ABD6-535E-AA3A-2E10705988DE","translation":false,"documentHash":"32d859bc-da81-4bea-92bd-6b483dc5da7b","publisher":{"objectId":"610809959543c70b144e702c","mniswId":"85900","name":"Wydawnictwo Naukowe TYGIEL Sp. z o. o.","documentHash":"0d57bd73-1897-49e3-a7d9-d36929fd7806"},"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2023-12-21","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"PUBLISHER_WEBSITE"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["marchew","uszlachetnianie nasion","zdrowotność","kiełkowanie","wzrost"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["carrots","seed improvement","health","germination","growth"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059269559"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65a930fa40970706a45631ad","name":"Giovanna","lastName":"Gilardi","documentHash":"4f73665a-7e0d-42ec-a74e-fbb785ad3ed8"},{"objectId":"65a930fa40970706a45631ac","name":"Flavia","lastName":"Pinzari","documentHash":"608bdb17-6b04-42e2-bae9-42ca19476809"},{"objectId":"65a930fa40970706a45631ab","name":"Massimo","lastName":"Pugliese","documentHash":"9fb45c0f-0345-4de1-883c-8bd8f70b6d0d"},{"objectId":"65a930fa40970706a45631aa","name":"Loredana","lastName":"Canfora","documentHash":"8a98dbb3-79f2-4c1d-866b-771f018da029"},{"objectId":"5e7094a5878c28a0473c0f43","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Trzciński","uuid":"1B08C5745BBED0DD2FA6FC7FE765081039817AF55DC1966754B0DE57E0E12A703A4C86A0543480A443BEF70D758B4A7D0A02070D72D9249897FB8DAEA4264074","orcidId":"0000-0003-4568-6504","documentHash":"f5b9cc24-31a2-45ba-ad71-30588d171d96"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75","name":"Eligio","lastName":"Malusa","uuid":"96702563F39315C1D693D3C97550CD6CAC824FFBF4F0B9CDA39B5B31CA25E279C7ADE056365DF1361FAB162C59DECD06A6B181EEEBEDF857A17AA24E3CAEAB00","orcidId":"0000-0002-9802-3379","documentHash":"1678ebd7-0f8e-4fff-b0c1-2a3a11e42d48"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c13","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Ptaszek","uuid":"5B63BF2BE2D5FB0A5D5BF07037094A2231E514D60855E376D32CB3D7334C27D097EC5234960FBFE777A69EDA39E43EE689CC907869E3ACF350DD308525656C64","orcidId":"0000-0002-4738-3681","documentHash":"b00f2e93-6e25-42ae-b151-8becc6791b90"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65a930fa40970706a45631a9","doi":"10.3390/microorganisms11010224","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/11/1/224/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Microbial-Based Products to Control Soil-Borne Pathogens: Methods to Improve Efficacy and to Assess Impacts on Microbiome","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Microbial-based products (either as biopesticide or biofertilizers) have a long history of application, though their use is still limited, mainly due to a perceived low and inconsistent efficacy under field conditions. However, their efficacy has always been compared to chemical products, which have a completely different mechanism of action and production process, following the chemical paradigm of agricultural production. This paradigm has also been applied to regulatory processes, particularly for biopesticides, making the marketing of microbial-based formulations difficult. Increased knowledge about bioinocula behavior after application to the soil and their impact on soil microbiome should foster better exploitation of microbial-based products in a complex environment such as the soil. Moreover, the multifunctional capacity of microbial strains with regard to plant growth promotion and protection should also be considered in this respect. Therefore, the methods utilized for these studies are key to improving the knowledge and understanding of microbial-based product activity and improving their efficacy, which, from farmers’ point of view, is the parameter to assess the usefulness of a treatment. In this review, we are thus addressing aspects related to the production and formulation process, highlighting the methods that can be used to evaluate the functioning and impact of microbial-based products on soil microbiome, as tools supporting their use and marketing."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709401878c28a0473b4c13","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75","5e7094a5878c28a0473c0f43"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"11","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"224","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709401878c28a0473b4c13","65a930fa40970706a45631aa","65a930fa40970706a45631ab","65a930fa40970706a45631ac","65a930fa40970706a45631ad","5e7094a5878c28a0473c0f43","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547ccb4","mniswId":"14352","title":"Microorganisms","issn":"2076-2607","eissn":"2076-2607","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"1acb9682-3059-4777-960d-c292bad20179"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65083c8040970739aadcb563","year":"2023","volume":"11","number":"1","documentHash":"b898a2a3-8d3a-4c55-a4fc-155709e02adc"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biocontrol","mycorrhiza","phenotypic arrays","analytical methods","formulation strategies"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059277001"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4bef","name":"Michał","lastName":"Koniarski","uuid":"14FE28C282B58BC31842FE478878BFBFE001BE92CB6953C510C894D12EC29A568D419FBF6F535DE4F08D341C8881E9C07FA3FF61D82819729E7F1A7F1765A2AA","orcidId":"0000-0001-8711-8906","documentHash":"26b8d173-d867-43c9-a0aa-2bf6e60bd2db"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398376","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Sitarek","uuid":"81A2618FAEDFB627B48156F62B32026215D11A59AF9B4AD50A23A2139DB87EC15763E2C058FFCFFCBAF8071C101C7814D2CFD0FB8C0FB0C38E7E8336773A30B0","orcidId":"0000-0001-5041-148X","documentHash":"a031375f-fb10-4242-8cbd-1baa5adf5247"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2023-08-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65a4fb414097071df01d6ce4","publicUri":"https://journals.indexcopernicus.com/api/file/viewByFileId/1871767","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Ocena wzrostu, kwitnienia, dojrzewania oraz jakości owoców odmian porzeczki czerwonej (Ribes rubrum L.) oraz białej (Ribes niveum L.)","otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"Assesment of growth, flowering maturing and fruit quality of red currant (Ribes rubrum L.) and white currant (Ribes niveum L.) cultivars"}],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W pracy przedstawiono wyniki dotyczące intensywności wzrostu, kwitnienia, ter-\nminu dojrzałości zbiorczej owoców, długości gron, średniej masy owoców oraz poziomu eks-\ntraktu w owocach dwudziestu czterech odmian porzeczki czerwonej (Ribes rubrum L.) oraz\npięciu taksonów porzeczki białej (Ribes niveum L.).

The effect of prestorage treatment with seven\nessential oils (EOs) of rosemary, peppermint, basil, thyme, marjoram, lemon, and oregano on the quality of\ncut lettuce was evaluated. The lettuce was fumigated with EOs for two hours in airtight containers. Two con-\ncentrations of EOs were used: 16.7 μL·L-1 and 33.3 μL·L-1. Fumigation with rosemary and thyme EOs low-\nered the browning of fresh-cut iceberg lettuce and thus the deterioration of its appearance during six days of\nstorage. Lettuce fumigated with thyme EO scored relatively high in sensory quality and consumer acceptabil-\nity. Lettuce fumigated with rosemary EO was characterized by high intensity of aroma and herbal flavor,\nsignificantly lowering its sensory rating. Marjoram EO at a dose of 16.7 μL·L-1 resulted in the fastest browning\nof lettuce cut surface and relatively reduced the market value during storage.

Such task can be automated with the aid of machine learning and digital image processing techniques. The best results for soil microorganism identification usually rely on extracting features based on color. However, accommodating in the latter an extra impact of lighting conditions or sample’s preparation on classification accuracy is often omitted. In contrast, this research examines features which are insensitive to the above two factors by focusing rather on bacteria shape and their specific group dispersion. In doing so, the calculation of layout features resorts to <jats:italic>k</jats:italic>-means and mean shift methods. Additionally, the dependencies between specific distances determined from bacteria cells and the curvature of interpolated bacteria boundary are computed to extract vital geometric shape information. The proposed bacteria recognition tool involves testing four different classification methods for which the parameters are iteratively adjusted. The results obtained here for five selected soil bacteria genera: <jats:italic>Enterobacter</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Rhizobium</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Pantoea</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Bradyrhizobium</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Pseudomonas</jats:italic> reach 85.14% classification accuracy upon combining both geometric and dispersion features. The latter forms a promising result as a substitutive tool for color-based feature classification.</jats:p>"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy

presence of free palmitic acid modulates the effects of lutein on structural and dynamic properties of lipid membranes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Free fatty acids, like palmitic acid (PA), and xanthophyll pigments, like lutein (LUT) are the natural membrane compounds in plants. To study the effect of PA on LUT and their organization, a model membrane of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) enriched with 2 mol% PA and 1 mol% LUT was formed. Molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between these two compounds were examined with application of molecular spectroscopy techniques, e.g., visible spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance and Fourier transform infrared. We determined the monomeric/dimeric organization of LUT in the membrane. We proved that the presence of PA in the lipid phase facilitated and stabilized the formation of LUT structures in the membrane. Lutein with PA did not form strong molecular aggregates like H- and J-structures. We presented the simplified model membrane that could be a suitable representation of the physiological process of de-esterification of PA from LUT appearing in natural biomembranes in humans."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709315878c28a0473a281e","5e70946f878c28a0473bcecd"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6671"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"752","issue":"109883","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709460878c28a0473bba63","5e709347878c28a0473a6671","5e7092f5878c28a04739ffa3","5e7092f5878c28a04739feff","5e709315878c28a0473a281e","5e70946f878c28a0473bcecd","65e63eaf4097076263e369d0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477189","mniswId":"1646","title":"Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics","issn":"0003-9861","eissn":"1096-0384","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"20d38fd1-db66-4cf3-ab47-d4f2e7c20190"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["electron paramagnetic resonance","spectroscopy","liposomes","palmitic acid","spinach all-trans lutein"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059307595"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65b0c8b94097073c3f9fdf47","name":"Kensuke","lastName":"Miyamoto","documentHash":"ca36cbf6-b9f9-4d4e-a222-e9fba8305333"},{"objectId":"65b0c8b94097073c3f9fdf46","name":"Junichi","lastName":"Ueda","documentHash":"816ac2e3-4121-4f89-8ce7-dd1ab8dc5eea"},{"objectId":"65b0c8b94097073c3f9fdf45","name":"Marian","lastName":"Saniewski","documentHash":"a84219db-1126-405f-9345-39f5c07c561d"},{"objectId":"65b0c8b94097073c3f9fdf44","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Kowalska","documentHash":"acc7d78a-a01d-49bb-b8ea-b5532c153fff"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Marasek-Ciołakowska","uuid":"6FAB3AE6D9EBCFA4FD26AA8B3CD63FA73B99A6498DEF6A1770D2A9643E68A306803F24C467726C9A84745750C9B2D96EDD4F279404023C905B13853E9A49233F","orcidId":"0000-0001-9349-2566","documentHash":"1c86d2dd-6830-448a-8df1-57210e29a74d"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4af1","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Góraj-Koniarska","uuid":"9FC40A1F1A091811F5417DDDC0A27F9D6E4A7EBB7061A55729BDF382AC1C4764ACC6D5ECDCECC86E5F3AF92A60C7C453705F203CC84916CE364E17F25BA5DC27","orcidId":"0000-0001-7667-0279","documentHash":"2201bd21-407f-41c6-b322-bf2d514266ed"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2023-02-14","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65b0c8b94097073c3f9fdf42","doi":"10.1016/j.flora.2023.152242","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0367253023000324?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Sprout formation in epiphyllous plantlets from detached Bryophyllum calycinum leaves: Relevance for the senescence of mother leaves under drought stress","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Epiphyllous plantlets / vegetative propagules of Bryophyllum calycinum have been well known to develop only on\ndetached leaves but not in leaves of intact plants. In the present study we have found a morphogenesis that the\nintact epiphyllous plantlets induce sprouts, but not epiphyllous buds, in plantlet leaves when the mother leaves\nalmost completely senesced under drought stress. Anatomical studies of sprouts showed the presence of vascular\nconnection between sprouts and plantlet leaves. After re-watering isolated plantlets, the growth of existing\nsprouts was inhibited and most of the primordia of buds in plantlet leaves were little differentiated, they\nappeared to be dormant and further formation of plantlets was suppressed. The sprouts were not formed when\nplantlets were connected with green parts of mother leaves. Removal of primordia on the one side of detached\nmother leaves caused loss of chlorophyll in leaves, and the appearance of plantlets on the other side delayed\nchlorophyll degradation. These results suggest that development of sprouts from epiphyllous plantlets on de-\ntached mother leaves is closely related to leaf senescence induced by severe drought stress. The role of the total\nsenescence of the mother leaves under drought conditions in the induction of sprouts is discussed with respect to\nhormonal balance and signaling networks."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut

osiągnięć badawczych w zakresie sygnalizacji zagrożenia upraw jabłoni przez parcha jabłoni – najbardziej szkodliwej choroby tego gatunku. Pierwsze kryteria pozwalające wyznaczyć warunki i termin infekcji liści przez Ven­turia inaequalis opracowano w Stanach Zjednoczonych. Kryteria te były następnie weryfikowane i udoskonalane dla najważniejszych re­jonów uprawy jabłoni na świecie. Opracowano różne systemy i modele prognostyczne, których wskazania są pomocne w podejmowaniu decyzji dotyczących prowadzenia ochrony jabłoni przed parchem. Uzyskiwane dane nie zawsze jednak dokładnie wskazują potencjalne zagrożenie i dlatego konieczne jest sprawdzenie przydatności modeli w konkretnych warunkach, a w razie konieczności i możliwości – ich udoskonalenie. Z punktu widzenia praktyki sadowniczej zasadnicze znaczenie ma ustalenie terminów rozpoczęcia i zakończenia wysie­wów zarodników workowych sprawcy choroby, określenie okresów krytycznych oraz terminowe wykonanie zabiegów ochronnych.

The first criteria for determining the conditions and timing of leaf infection by Venturia inaequalis were developed in the United States. These criteria were then verified and improved for the most important apple growing regions in the world. Various systems and prognostic models have been developed, the indications of which are helpful in making decisions regard­ing the protection of apple trees against scab. However, the data obtained does not always accurately indicate the potential threat, and therefore it is necessary to check the suitability of the models in specific conditions, and if necessary and possible – to improve them. From the point of view of fruit-growing practice, it is essential to set the dates for the start and end of release of ascospores of the dis­ease causing agent, to define infection risk and to perform protective treatments on time. Noteworthy is the Italian model A-scab, some parameters of which should be calibrated taking into account its usefulness in Polish conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709401878c28a0473b4b5a","5e709292878c28a0473983a3"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"63","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"233-245","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709401878c28a0473b4b5a","5e709292878c28a0473983a3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a352","mniswId":"200101","title":"Progress in Plant Protection","issn":"1427-4337","eissn":"2084-4883","websiteLink":"http://www.progress.plantprotection.pl","documentHash":"59ba68a6-6ed2-4dcf-b6bf-1297a145d37e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65a8cbe340970706a44c8e89","year":"2023","volume":"63","number":"4","documentHash":"eeca010a-384d-45d7-9a32-29289f578b8b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Venturia inaequalis","modele prognostyczne","wysiewy askospor","ryzyko infekcji"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["forecasting models","ascospore release","infection risk","Venturia inaequalis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059387157"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65d5ac6e4097076bd549ccef","name":"Assel","lastName":"Molzhigitova","documentHash":"ecfb46da-f8fd-474c-8688-e0f6b23b997a"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c22","name":"Artur","lastName":"Mikiciński","uuid":"1876B2C9DBBE82492F5579859B3368B35FCDB39BAFBDC22CC1FF09CB6E6FD429437C183C2765036886926F810A26D3AF34A87CC0ADB3A664BB2088A653E40DD3","orcidId":"0000-0002-4047-0918","documentHash":"ae7cc2d7-81b7-45ad-8c4b-eb72d9ccf73b"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a0473983a3","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Sobiczewski","uuid":"043EDCCAEE224C9E3FB91A4CBD06FF271FA0A2E5027F427C9F4FA028BA6E00DD8CAC0E8AA3EFA8A41F4CBD1D888131A920E51CACABF95AA1113F1783055EA4AA","orcidId":"0000-0001-9925-3611","documentHash":"83c979d7-ef2f-4ba8-85d0-1ef16c219dbf"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398341","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Puławska","uuid":"A2F13D21947DD9E5CA8586F26E280B3CE2C9F1E3B7EDE455195E9E313A348C66551979BBD618F4DBE6F5E5EF071DC6DC28BB1E1BD29693C3A50E2DB9BBEFE4EF","orcidId":"0000-0001-5327-1056","documentHash":"3475c8e9-bf80-473e-9268-fbb10a5ccf56"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-02-12","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65d5ac6e4097076bd549cced","doi":"10.1007/s42161-024-01601-7","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42161-024-01601-7.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Evaluation of antagonistic mechanisms of bacterial species for their biocontrol activity against fire blight (Erwinia amylovora)","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper presents an attempt to explain the potential mechanisms related to the biocontrol capacity of the four strains representing bacterial species in which this activity was observed for the first time (Pseudomonas vancouverensis L16, Pseudomonas chlororaphis subsp. aureofaciens 3M, Enterobacter ludwigii 43M and Pseudomonas protegens 59M).

Also, all strains except E. ludwigii 43M, produced siderophores and P. vancouverensis L16 was able to produce biosurfactant, salicylic acid and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) while the E. ludwigii 43M and P. chlororaphis subsp. aureofaciens 3M strains produced IAA and homoserine lactones (AHL), respectively. A study on the detection of genes encoding antibiotics characteristic of pseudomonads showed the presence of prnD in the P. chlororaphis subsp. aureofaciens 3M strain and phlD, pltC, pltB and pltC in P. protegens 59M, which suggested that the latter strain had the largest number of antibiotic-coding genes among all the strains tested. The regulatory gene gacA was also present in P. protegens 59M and P. chlororaphis subsp. aureofaciens 3M strains. However, none of the genes sought were detected in the L16 strain. It was assumed that the ability of strain P. protegens 59M to completely protect slices of pear fruitlet against E. amylovora infection is related to the production of antibiotics and possibly also to the other detected mechanisms of antagonism, such as siderophore, IAA and HCN production."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709401878c28a0473b4c22","5e709292878c28a047398341","5e709292878c28a0473983a3"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"106","pagesFromTo":"913-923","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709401878c28a0473b4c22","5e709292878c28a047398341","65d5ac6e4097076bd549ccef","5e709292878c28a0473983a3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789c3","mniswId":"12323","title":"Journal of Plant Pathology","issn":"1125-4653","eissn":"2239-7264","documentHash":"d73ae16b-4d09-47bf-ac5b-8f3500333d50"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65d5ac6e4097076bd549ccee","year":"2024","documentHash":"de4d01f3-9627-4845-8d2e-bdfaeef83b6a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biocontrol","antagonistic bacteria","efficacy","mechanisms of action"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059392808"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b9214","name":"Anita","lastName":"Zapałowska","uuid":"C964795FB4A1F7F38D18098518A272789AFE3C30D093C621FB31B21D3CB77837B33AC6E45945EDCCE6A30E9A5BA9A2EE44E864DA10A90298D30652B90F3880F4","orcidId":"0000-0003-4297-9854","documentHash":"d65460ed-d44b-48df-946c-cb180d677d3c"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5b33","name":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Malewski","uuid":"18047D7AA28E9DCA334B695001A679068C32C4166061B9F15AD7B46F89763BB82B1261F56C2F07A1357E9A2D9BCE9D3BC4F1809535163CE2E3ECCC08EB410C96","orcidId":"0000-0001-8061-435X","documentHash":"082cbcfb-26a2-4548-bf05-f415d3c17b35"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047390fc6","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Skwiercz","uuid":"3D6D1165507901F580B3B6D5BE187D2F6B2FB4DB90B7B03E8E5E397AFF8ED61BC2B4D253505139A8C1D0A183E07C152527F686835FEE061A7C13FD513E239939","orcidId":"0000-0002-7008-5674","documentHash":"46dc8107-a99c-4e03-8bf9-83f7764581a4"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fa57","name":"Czesław","lastName":"Puchalski","uuid":"48A9D3645E6453E0D88B0B93081E2A47A8EA85C80F394FF00B2FE88C3F07C3AC1597E86C8AD8202506D2B049178D6B759B53F4C378EBDC237D2DED7581E77A34","orcidId":"0000-0001-5916-2678","documentHash":"7a0b2979-4837-40bc-bcb9-1a8ba26edd46"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-02-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65d5b0334097076bd54aa289","doi":"10.3390/app14041576","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/4/1576/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Influence of Eisenia fetida on the Nematode Populations during Vermicomposting Process","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Vermicomposting stands as a sustainable and environmentally friendly waste management practice, leveraging the metabolic prowess of earthworms to facilitate the decomposition of organic matter into nutrient-rich compost. The aim of this experiment was to study the influence of Eisenia fetida on the density and the tropic structure of a nematode community during the vermicomposting process over a period of 3 months. Sewage sludge and green waste served as composting substrates. Overall, six compost variants were prepared consisting of three variants incorporating E. fetida and three control variants lacking E. fetida. Throughout the investigation, samples were gathered on a monthly basis, with each variant undergoing three repetitions. The aim was to isolate nematodes, determine the population density of the five trophic groups, and identify the dominant community. The anaysis was conducted employing both microscopic examination and molecular metabarcoding (NGS). It was shown that the bacterial-feeding community maintained dominance. The introduction of E. fetida into the compost led to a significant rise in the abundance of Diplogasteridae. In the variant without E. fetida, the amount of Diplodasteridae exceeded 0.1% only after the 30th (C3) or the 60th (C1, C2) day of composting, while in the compost with E. fetida, they were present in large amounts (ranging from 11.0% to 28.0%) already on the 30th day of composting. The introduction of Eisenia fetida also led to a notable reduction in H. gingivalis with significant implications for mitigating the risk of halicephalobiosis. The introduction of E. fetida resulted in reducing H. gingivalis to levels below 0.1% in all compost variants."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa -

The present experiment was conducted during the 2021–2022 seasons to study the effect of the foliar of yeast extract (YE), fulvic acid (FA), moringa leaf extract (MLE), seaweed extract (SWE), and nano-potassium (K NPs) alone or after combining each one of them individually with K NPs on the yield and fruit physical and chemical characteristics of date palm cv.

The results show that the application of 0.2% YE + 0.02% K NPs led to the highest results in yield, bunch weight, fruit weight, flesh weight, fruit content from soluble solids, total and reduced sugars, VC, total chlorophyll, and carotene.

Największą liczbę pędów wegetatywnych w pierwszym roku po posadzeniu wytworzyły krzewy odmian ‘Ben Lomond’, ‘Tisel’ oraz ‘Gofert’. Najmniej pędów stwierdzono u krzewów odmian: ‘Ruben’, ‘Titania’ i ‘Bona’. Najdłuższe pędy miały krzewy odmian ‘Polben’ i ‘Tiben’, zaś najkrótsze – ‘Ores’, ‘Öjebyn’, ‘Polonus’ i ‘Ruben’. Najdłuższymi gronami cechowały się odmiany ‘Tisel’ i ‘Gofert’. Najkrótsze grona miały odmiany ‘Bona’, ‘Ruben’ oraz ‘Ben Lomond’.

The largest number of vegetative shoots in the first year after planting was produced by bushes of the cultivars 'Ben Lomond', 'Tisel' and 'Gofert'. The fewest shoots were found in the cultivars: 'Ruben', 'Titania' and 'Bona'. The longest shoots were found in the cultivars 'Polben' and 'Tiben', and the shortest – 'Ores', 'Öjebyn', 'Polonus' and 'Ruben'. The cultivars 'Tisel' and 'Gofert' had the longest cluster length. The shortest clusters were found in 'Bona', 'Ruben' and 'Ben Lomond'. The highest yield in the second year after planting was obtained from the 'Ben Lomond', 'Tihope', 'Tiben', 'Polben', 'Tisel', 'Gofert' cultivars. The lowest yields had 'Titania', 'Öjebyn', 'Ores' and 'Polonus'. The largest fruit, weighing more than 2 g, was produced by the 'Bona' cultivar, while the smallest fruit was produced by the 'Polonus' (0.9 g) and 'Öjebyn' (1 g) cultivars. The highest content of soluble solids was found in the 'Gofert' fruits, while the lowest was found in the fruit of the 'Ores' and 'Polben' cultivars. Measurements of the intensity of the green color of leaves (SPAD) showed the highest value of this parameter in the cultivar 'Tines', and the lowest - in the cultivars 'Gofert' and 'Tisel'."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut

major role in reducing the impact of agricultural practices on the environment. Soil is considered a major component of the organic production process, and organic practices aim at increasing its health and fertility. However, the control of soil-borne pests, particularly plant-parasitic nematodes, can be difficult in organic horticultural crops due to the rules allowed in this farming system. Applying a holistic approach that fosters and exploits the activity of the soil microbiome to control plant-parasitic nematodes has been at the basis of the analysis of the available scientific knowledge carried out for this review article. This review thus focuses on the multifunctional capacity of microorganisms, including that of bacteria and fungi not normally considered biocontrol agents, and the need to also better understand their relations with the plant and other environmental and agronomic factors. The implementation of the “multi-biotics” concept, applying prebiotics, probiotics and postbiotics, which supports an integrated agroecological strategy for the protection of organic horticultural crops, is proposed as an efficient practice that should be further studied to be adapted under different crops and pedo-climatic conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75","5e70936e878c28a0473a95fc"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"920","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70936e878c28a0473a95fc","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547ed47","mniswId":"27373","title":"Horticulturae","issn":"2311-7524","eissn":"2311-7524","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"d9822e24-c608-4514-bb91-1457594f0cb4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65d8694c4097071e54621734","year":"2023","volume":"9","number":"8","documentHash":"cd6b0859-1c6e-45f3-a506-12af8d63558a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biological control","entomopathogenic nematodes","microbial inocula","organic farming","plant-parasitic nematodes"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059431273"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4bef","name":"Michał","lastName":"Koniarski","uuid":"14FE28C282B58BC31842FE478878BFBFE001BE92CB6953C510C894D12EC29A568D419FBF6F535DE4F08D341C8881E9C07FA3FF61D82819729E7F1A7F1765A2AA","orcidId":"0000-0001-8711-8906","documentHash":"26b8d173-d867-43c9-a0aa-2bf6e60bd2db"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398376","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Sitarek","uuid":"81A2618FAEDFB627B48156F62B32026215D11A59AF9B4AD50A23A2139DB87EC15763E2C058FFCFFCBAF8071C101C7814D2CFD0FB8C0FB0C38E7E8336773A30B0","orcidId":"0000-0001-5041-148X","documentHash":"a031375f-fb10-4242-8cbd-1baa5adf5247"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"NOVEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"65d32f914097072e0d1d3936","publicUri":"https://www.cdr.gov.pl/images/ZDR/2023/ZDR-2023-3.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Ocena wzrostu, kwitnienia, dojrzewania oraz jakości owoców odmian porzeczki czerwonej (ribes rubrum L.) oraz białej (ribes niveum L.)","otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"Assessment of growth, flowering, maturing and fruit quality of red currant (ribes rubrum L.) and white currant (ribes niveum L.) cultivars"}],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W pracy przedstawiono wyniki dotyczące intensywności wzrostu, kwitnienia, terminu dojrzałości zbiorczej owoców, długości gron, średniej masy owoców oraz poziomu ekstraktu w owocach dwudziestu czterech odmian porzeczki czerwonej (Ribes rubrum L.) oraz pięciu taksonów porzeczki białej (Ribes niveum L.).

One of these weather factors is drought, which negatively influences multiple physiological processes in plants. It increases the transpiration rate and decreases the cell turgidity, stomatal regulation, osmoregulation, water utilization efficiency, and the development of the deep root system; consequently, it decreases the final production and fruit quality. Therefore, the present study was performed in the 2022–2023 seasons to study the role of the spraying of Selenium (Se), Titanium (Ti), and Silicon (Si) nanoparticles on the growth parameters, yielding, fruit physical and chemical characteristics, and leaf mineral composition of mango cv. Keitt. Mango trees were sprayed during the vegetative season 2022–2023 three times, starting in April with three weeks intervals, by 5, 10, and 20 mg/L Se; 40, 60, and 80 mg/L Ti; and 50, 100, and 150 mg/L Si. The results showed that the extern spray of nanoparticles from these micronutrients improved the growth attributes, yielding and fruit quality of mango trees by reducing the effect of undesirable stressful conditions. The results also indicated that the extern implementation of 150 mg/L Si, 60 mg/L Ti and 20 mg/L Se gave the best increments in the shoot number, length, thickness, leaf area, and leaf chlorophyll contrasted to the else sprayed treatments. Besides, they also improved the fruit set percentages, fruit yields, fruit physical and chemical characteristics and nutritional status of mango trees in both tested seasons."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709288878c28a04739774c"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"9","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"1231","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65d85afc4097071e545dfbfb","5e709288878c28a04739774c","65d85afc4097071e545dfbfc","65d85afc4097071e545dfbfd","65d85afc4097071e545dfbfe","65d85afc4097071e545dfbff"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547ed47","mniswId":"27373","title":"Horticulturae","issn":"2311-7524","eissn":"2311-7524","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"d9822e24-c608-4514-bb91-1457594f0cb4"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65d85afc4097071e545dfbfa","year":"2023","volume":"9","number":"11","documentHash":"a6e4cfa4-19ba-4c44-8ef3-c116d7016e8a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["nutrition","mango","quality","yield","nano fertilizers"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059431650"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65d32e754097072e0d1ce507","name":"Anna","lastName":"Stań","documentHash":"f636c337-445f-4026-aa4f-d530a366562a"},{"objectId":"5ebed87b752340254fc40ff6","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Wojciechowska","uuid":"C49C133744ABEAE39FE2B0D3A949AE68552927E33672616AD9F73F39C30AF59516E2733127773B6CE83559896DD0892F1249CBF75FA62C9A9C6B268A7E44449A","documentHash":"8c4d090e-d8fa-4640-894a-07bec6ff308a"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398376","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Sitarek","uuid":"81A2618FAEDFB627B48156F62B32026215D11A59AF9B4AD50A23A2139DB87EC15763E2C058FFCFFCBAF8071C101C7814D2CFD0FB8C0FB0C38E7E8336773A30B0","orcidId":"0000-0001-5041-148X","documentHash":"a031375f-fb10-4242-8cbd-1baa5adf5247"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"NOVEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023},"objectId":"65d32e754097072e0d1ce506","publicUri":"https://www.cdr.gov.pl/images/ZDR/2023/ZDR-2023-3.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Ocena agronomiczna wybranych odmian winorośli deserowej w warunkach glebowo-klimatycznych Polski Centralnej","otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"Agronomic assessment of chosen table grape cultivars in the soil and climate conditions of Central Poland"}],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Uprawa winorośli w Polsce w ostatnich latach zyskuje na znaczeniu, a asortyment dostępnych na rynku odmian deserowych jest coraz szerszy.

However, not all genotypes perform equally well in cultivation in the cool climate of Poland.

To meet these expectations, in the vineyard established in the Experimental Orchard in Dąbrowice (The National Institute of Horticultural Research in Skierniewice), winter hardiness, frost resistance, susceptibility to spring frost and health status of 15 table grape genotypes in the soil and climate conditions of central Poland were assessed. Detailed observations were made in 2019-2021 on plants planted in 2004. It was found that the most winter-hardy and frost-resistant genotypes were 'Alwood', 'New York Muscat', 'Boskoop Glory', 'Einset', and 'Reliance', which are hybrids of Vitis vinifera with Vitis labrusca. The least resistant to low winter temperatures were the cultivars 'Frumoasa Albae', 'Muskat Letni' and 'Palatina' created in the multi-stage interspecific cross-breeding. Genotypes with a high content of Vitis amurensis genes, such as 'Agat Doński' and 'Kristaly', were most often damaged by spring frosts, but they had high regenerative abilities. ‘Swenson Red’ was most susceptible to downy mildew and powdery mildew, while ‘Reliance’ and ‘Einset’ were most susceptible to gray mold."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398376","65d32e754097072e0d1ce507","5ebed87b752340254fc40ff6"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"113","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"68-87","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5ebed87b752340254fc40ff6","5e709292878c28a047398376","65d32e754097072e0d1ce507"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9ac0fad204581b62ebb4d","mniswId":"201256","title":"Zagadnienia Doradztwa Rolniczego","issn":"1232-3578","eissn":"2719-8901","metadataSource":"MINISTRY","documentHash":"26109775-af19-46c2-90df-0a0cfa4043d6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65d319da4097072e0d194b46","year":"2023","volume":"113","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"262872af-0965-49af-88b0-665b28c3fbf9"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["winorośl","mieszańce międzygatunkowe","wytrzymałość na mróz","zdrowotność"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["grape plants","interspecific hybrids","frost resistance","health status"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059431676"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"65d85fda4097071e545f66c8","name":"Dalia H.","lastName":"Eshra","documentHash":"7cb1d9ef-8b25-4596-a4e4-49713d9b1ef4"},{"objectId":"65d85fda4097071e545f66c7","name":"Abdulwahed M.","lastName":"Aboukarima","documentHash":"419b15aa-6c3f-4b69-84d1-8490e58c5575"},{"objectId":"65d85fda4097071e545f66c6","name":"Rashid S.","lastName":"Al-Obeed","documentHash":"9a61cf95-6ddc-443f-98c0-cac66775f5b4"},{"objectId":"65d85fda4097071e545f66c5","name":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Abdel-Sattar","documentHash":"506c3912-1588-4cf2-88d6-ec9c307a6e6e"},{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a04739774c","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Górnik","uuid":"19AD443F777649DA4F15E704C3941EEF104D6A04AFF5BDD504891FF22EAEDDB9D1AFA2A3756E511232FFA08C6F55B87394C1AC7473173212E5961083E7CE3B34","orcidId":"0000-0002-6612-6779","documentHash":"76a1c56b-5e2d-4e68-b4f3-93eae65930b6"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-02","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65d85fda4097071e545f66c3","doi":"10.3390/horticulturae9020195","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2311-7524/9/2/195/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Improvement of the Physico-Chemical Properties, Nutritional, and Antioxidant Compounds of Pomegranate Fruit cv. ‘Wonderful’ Using Integrated Fertilization","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study comprised of five different integrated fertilizers of calcium nitrate Ca(NO3)2 with ammonium sulphate (NH4)2SO4 ratios (0%:100%, 10%:90%, 20%:80%, 30%:70%, and 40%:60%) to enhance the physico-chemical properties, and the antioxidant and nutritional compounds of pomegranate fruits cv. ‘Wonderful’.

The‘Arable Weeds and Management in Europe’(AWME) database is a collection of 36 ofthese surveys and the associated management data. Here, we review the challengesassociated with combining disparate datasets and explore some of the opportunities forfuture research that present themselves thanks to the AWME database. We present three case studies repeating previously published national scale analyses with data froma larger spatial extent. The case studies, originally done in France, Germany and the UK,explore various aspects of weed ecology (community composition, management andenvironmental effects and within-field distributions) and use a range of statistical tech-niques (canonical correspondence analysis, redundancy analysis and generalised linearmixed models) to demonstrate the utility and versatility of the AWME database. Wedemonstrate that (i) the standardisation of abundance data to a common measure,before the analysis of the combined dataset, has little impact on the outcome of the ana-lyses, (ii) the increased extent of environmental or management gradients allows forgreater confidence in conclusions and (iii) the main conclusions of analyses done at dif-ferent spatial scales remain consistent. These case studies demonstrate the utility of aEurope-wide weed survey database, for clarifying or extending results obtained fromstudies at smaller scales. This Europe-widedatacollectionoffers many more opportuni-ties for analysis that could not be addressed in smaller datasets; including questionsabout the effects of climate change, macro-ecological and biogeographical issues relatedto weed diversity as well as the dominance or rarity of specific weeds in Europe."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709404878c28a0473b4e18"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"63","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"1-11","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65f2ad8040970775cd2e1d84","65f2ad8040970775cd2e1d85","65f2ad8040970775cd2e1d86","65f2ad8040970775cd2e1d87","65f2ad8040970775cd2e1d88","5e709404878c28a0473b4e18","65f2ad8040970775cd2e1d89","65f2ad8040970775cd2e1d8a","65f2ad8040970775cd2e1d8b","65f2ad8040970775cd2e1d8c","65f2ad8040970775cd2e1d8d","65f2ad8040970775cd2e1d8e","65f2ad8040970775cd2e1d8f","65f2ad8040970775cd2e1d90","65f2ad8040970775cd2e1d91","65f2ad8040970775cd2e1d92","65f2ad8040970775cd2e1d93","65f2ad8040970775cd2e1d94","65f2ad8040970775cd2e1d95"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479ab1","mniswId":"20257","title":"Weed Research","issn":"0043-1737","eissn":"1365-3180","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"0787e5b0-d96a-40fc-a572-cfcbe81bf42f"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65f2ad8040970775cd2e1d83","year":"2022","volume":"63","number":"1","documentHash":"46fcf749-e4f6-439d-9cf0-4b9d25fa1e43"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["abundance measures","arable plants","cover estimates","data collection","management","nomenclature","plot size","sampling bias","weed community","weeds"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747059470237"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c20","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Świechowski","uuid":"FF0BA4E7784FA80ED758B37EA60C2771D0C1A05E84BAED2D460AD6B64F789422BD95CAEB10B7280C48E75748451E27123B7055AB22D32419017BE9B76459955A","orcidId":"0000-0003-2318-6488","documentHash":"7974fb82-c16a-42d8-b614-0316e4bccb82"},{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a04739772e","name":"Artur","lastName":"Godyń","uuid":"E76A7FC2A22F096380F4D9C269B2CF14F2EA0C795154738137EF35963C57F0BA3B2FDE3269333F7432DEDA3FBE028D7ED1019FCC93168D8B48D0E29EC7EFDAF4","orcidId":"0000-0002-4479-0644","documentHash":"cd8e2a10-eb51-4b98-b27a-2fbb5027fa17"},{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a047397700","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Doruchowski","uuid":"5C41E9774906423BA3BDA3B4F54FFF2954E573AD13C5018F46302DAECDF954F40147C2728F5987A34BF47ED727634E01C68270F4509F60E3E044941DC69D32DC","orcidId":"0000-0002-4413-6474","documentHash":"cd1292fb-721f-40bb-bae1-b4331eb10742"},{"objectId":"5e70926c878c28a047395631","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Hołownicki","uuid":"5178226ECB732E150695E77E5E38BD97149D53FE69C272696A8EC2031F35A946FE9DF845A4A75ACB16BFBDEE29486AEF20876C90549749E408FD634596A7DD1D","orcidId":"0000-0001-8002-8959","documentHash":"ccc28972-c9b0-43fb-8825-de1082f8f10c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2023-12-29","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"PUBLISHER_WEBSITE"},"objectId":"660fd708409707210bc42fff","publicUri":"https://www.agrofagi.com.pl/105,technika-ochrony-roslin?nobreakup#plik_3818","type":"BOOK","typeName":"Książka","year":2023,"title":"DOBRA PRAKTYKA.

Moreover, the content of phenolic com-\npounds, sterols and triterpenoids was determined in leaves of plants treated with spirodi-\nclofen, orange oil and silicone polymers.

technology for detecting Bacillus subtilis in soil","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The uncertainty associated with the impact of a bioinoculant on soil microbial community and, as a consequence, on soil\nquality, as well as the need to define its persistence, has prompted the demand for an accurate detection and tracking of the\npresence and the quantification of a target microbial inoculant in soil. Although DNA or RNA-based molecular detection are\nwell established and commonly applied in this regard, alternative ligands such as DNA-aptamers have several advantages over\nthem, such as low cost, ease of modification, ease of immobilisation on lab-on-chip or nanosensors, high stability and not\nthermolability. In this study, we used a toggle-cell SELEX method to isolate, select and characterise ssDNA (single-strand\nDNA) aptamers to detect a Bacillus subtilis strain which is being tested as a plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR)\nformulation. Two ssDNA aptamers (patenting application n.102022000022590) showed strong affinity and specificity for\nB. subtilis strains, with values of the kinetic parameters Kd (dissociation constant) in the nanomolar range and Bmax (maxi-\nmum intensity of binding) around 1. Validation of the suitability of the aptamers was validated on three inoculated soils\ncharacterised by different chemical-physical features and in soil from a field trial with the formulated B. subtilis PCM/B\n00105 strain.

These crops are generally characterized by high needs for protection. Soil-borne pests and pathogens are in fact among the most difficult to deal with, due to the complex nature of the soil communities and the relationships among their components. Plant parasitic nematodes are soil pests that can enormously and directly reduce the productivity of horticultural crops and, indirectly, act as vectors of important viruses. The control practices allowed in organic farming are somewhat limited by organic production rules, thus requiring a holistic approach for their management. This chapter describes different practices applied in horticultural organic farming systems and their efficacy in controlling plant-parasitic nematodes. We underline the need to integrate other agronomic practices and technical means to achieve acceptable control effectiveness in organic crop protection."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75","5e709350878c28a0473a70e9","5e70922b878c28a047390fc6","5e709292878c28a0473983ae"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","pagesFromTo":"3-31","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709350878c28a0473a70e9","5e709292878c28a0473983ae","5e70922b878c28a047390fc6","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75"]},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"book":{"objectId":"6694ef9efdbe830e86423974","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-52557-5","title":"Sustainable Management of Nematodes in Agriculture, Vol.2: Role of Microbes-Assisted Strategies","year":2024,"isbn":"9783031525568","issn":"2567-9805","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-52557-5.pdf","translation":false,"documentHash":"0c087c89-0978-4cf5-9bca-c348e39d7a93","publisher":{"objectId":"5e710c8046e0fb0001bafbe8","name":"Springer International Publishing","documentHash":"bcd412d9-722f-42f3-88eb-d55ae67fed10"},"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false}},"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059679515"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"669515c1fdbe830e864464d2","name":"Olexander","lastName":"Zhukov","documentHash":"d7cb440a-061b-47fb-8600-60ec66da4758"},{"objectId":"669515c1fdbe830e864464d1","name":"Artem","lastName":"Medkow","documentHash":"b0491e75-0d9a-479d-91ca-7a3b1842037d"},{"objectId":"669515c1fdbe830e864464d0","name":"Vira","lastName":"Boroday","documentHash":"0f78d439-cce7-459d-8517-daef5dcf52f4"},{"objectId":"669515c1fdbe830e864464cf","name":"Valentina","lastName":"Pidlisnyuk","documentHash":"75f84e5d-a5fb-43e9-84db-20c121a781c4"},{"objectId":"669515c1fdbe830e864464ce","name":"Tatyana","lastName":"Stefanovska","documentHash":"486c9b42-a880-468a-82db-8fe8a3855dcc"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047390fc6","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Skwiercz","uuid":"3D6D1165507901F580B3B6D5BE187D2F6B2FB4DB90B7B03E8E5E397AFF8ED61BC2B4D253505139A8C1D0A183E07C152527F686835FEE061A7C13FD513E239939","orcidId":"0000-0002-7008-5674","documentHash":"46dc8107-a99c-4e03-8bf9-83f7764581a4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-05-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"669515c1fdbe830e864464cd","doi":"10.2478/johr-2024-0003","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/johr-2024-0003","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Effect of the Biostimulants of Microbiological Origin on the Entomopathogenic and Plant Parasitic Nematodes from <i>Miscanthus</i> × <i>Giganteus</i> Plantations","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study aimed to evaluate the effect of biostimulants derived from Streptomyces avermitilis metabo-\nlites on entomopathogenic nematodes: Steinernema carpocapsae, Steinernema feltiae, and Heterorhabditis\nbacteriophora, obtained from the soil of several Miscanthus × giganteus plantations in 2020–2023. The nem-\natodes were isolated, identified, and cultured using live insects (the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella).\nThree preparations containing biostimulants – Charkor, Stimpo, and Regoplant, were tested for compatibility\nwith entomopathogenic and plant parasitic nematodes. Their effect on nematode survival was evaluated using\nthe Petri dish test. The study showed that the effect of biostimulants on the survival of nematodes depended\non the concentration of aversectin contained in the evaluated preparations. Stimpo and Regoplant had an ad-\nverse effect on plant parasitic nematodes. The highest G. mellonella mortality was observed at the higher dose\nof Charkor (0.4%), and the lowest at the lower dose of Regoplant (1.22%). The study showed that the viru-\nlence of the nematodes decreased after 48 hours of incubation in Regoplant and Stimpo solutions containing\naversectin. The degree of interaction between nematodes depended on the nematode species, trophic prefer-\nences, and the concentration of active ingredients in the preparations.

The source material for the analyses were air temperature measurements from 1923 to 2022 obtained from the meteorological station in the Experimental Field of the Warsaw University of Life Sciences and the station in the Experimental Orchard of the National Institute of Horticultural Research. The study presents average annual, minimum, and maximum air temperatures along with an assessment of the trend of their multi-year variability. The features of changes in the average air temperature in Skierniewice presented in the study based on a 100-year series of meteorological measurements are characterized by high temporal variability with a clear upward trend. The average warming rate over 100 years was 0.17 °C per 10 years, but in the last 60 years it has already reached 0.38 °C per 10 years. In the case of the average annual air temperature since 1981, there has been a sequence of years warmer than average throughout the measurement period. The number of summer days (>25 °C) and hot days, when the maximum temperature exceeds 30 °C, is also increasing. In the analyzed period, the decade 2013–2022 was the warmest."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa -

Their role was to improve crop plant growth and stress resistance. Moreover, the effect of the soil application of Trichoderma microbial preparations on tomato growth parameters and yield, in combination with companion plants, was studied. Ligno-cellulose multi-layer microcapsules with Trichoderma atroviride TRS14 spores (MIC14) and the commercial preparation Trianum G (TG) were used as microbial preparations. This experiment was carried out in a certified organic field. Tomato plants were intercropped with thyme or basil in the arrangement of two tomato rows alternating with one herbal row. In all intercropping arrangements and in the control (tomato plants grown without herbs), subplots were sectioned. The soil in the subplots was amended with the MIC14 and TG preparations used at a concentration of 104 spores g−1 of the soil and planted with tomato transplants. No control measures were applied during tomato growing, and the plants were naturally infected with late blight. Tomato plant growth parameters and yield were assessed, and late blight severity was monitored. The degree of soil colonization by Trichoderma fungi and the effect of these applications on soil microbial activity and biodiversity (dehydrogenases activity, EcoPlates AWCD, and Shannon index) were evaluated. The results clearly showed a significant influence of thyme and basil on tomato growth and yield in organic production. The cultivation of thyme adjacent to tomatoes had a beneficial effect on the development of the root system and the number of flowers and fruits on the crop plants. Basil, on the other hand, clearly decreased tomato yield and adversely affected the effect of Trichoderma applications by reducing root system development. Moreover, basil as a companion plant increased late blight symptoms. Both Trichoderma strains colonized soil, but they had no significant effect on the microbial activity or metabolic potential measured on the EcoPlates with the use of the BIOLOG system. However, a decrease in dehydrogenases activity was noted. In organic cultivation, the Trichoderma preparations used had no significant effect on tomato yield, opposite to its increase in integrated tomato production."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa -

Low-processed horticulture products are expected to appear in more and more convenient form, ready to eat and completely safe. The application of edible surface films contributes to the extension of shelf life while maintaining strict hygiene standards. Properly selected coating components are not only able to slow down the decomposition processes but also inhibit microbial growth, thus preventing quality losses and eliminating any potential threats to health. The additional use of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) can significantly increase the shelf life of fruit and vegetables both fresh and minimally processed. However, single treatments (edible coatings and MAP) are limited in maintaining the quality and shelf life of fresh and fresh-cut fruit and vegetables. Little is known about the synergistic effect of MAP and edible coatings, and more research is necessary.

The experiment was conducted with two tomato varieties, Conchita and Sweetelle, under three nutritional treatments: standard, nutrient solution with 20% increased salts and nitrogen and supplementation with the biostimulant Bio-algeen S-90. Bacterial communities in the root substrate were influenced by both the tomato variety and the nutritional regime. Sweetelle exhibited more pronounced shifts in bacterial communities compared to Conchita. An overall increase in bacterial populations with time was observed (+0.38 Log). Specifically, the 20% enhanced nutrient solution had varying effects on bacterial counts in the two tomato varieties, while the biostimulant promoted an increase in ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (+0.4 Log). Microbial community analysis highlighted the distinct impact of each nutritional regime on nitrogen-cycling bacteria, which correlated with differences in quality parameters such as the L-ascorbic acid and lycopene contents. In the first case, a decrease (25–30%) was observed, while the lycopene content decreased after harvest (−51% in Conchita variety) but was more stable in the postharvest phase (66–70% lycopene retained, only 44% in the control). This study highlights how increased sources of nutrients and the differential responses of microbial communities to nutritional regimes do not necessarily increase the crop quality and that tailored approaches are required for different tomato varieties."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709200878c28a04738e64f"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"2254","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["675bf5befdbe834a82299b45","675bf5befdbe834a82299b46","5e709200878c28a04738e64f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff51cad49b31ccec20409","title":"Agriculture-Basel.","issn":"2077-0472","eissn":"2077-0472","documentHash":"e83729bb-2c7e-4d10-bf08-89803637073b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"675bf5befdbe834a82299b44","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"12","documentHash":"58a097f4-6fe9-48c5-a8fe-c1431b254f87"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["soilless systems","tomato","root microbiome","nitrogen cycle","lycopene"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060117430"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6777b0b2fdbe833ec1c8d82a","name":"Carine","lastName":"Le Bourvellec","documentHash":"5332fd8e-0f3b-4082-8e8d-60e2b65e4e74"},{"objectId":"6777b0b2fdbe833ec1c8d829","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Rembiałkowska","documentHash":"a1f55d4b-41c1-414d-9977-6baf245ade04"},{"objectId":"6777b0b2fdbe833ec1c8d828","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Średnicka-Tober","documentHash":"278ae7e1-0a1b-48ff-be17-4eb41cd6075b"},{"objectId":"6777b0b2fdbe833ec1c8d827","name":"Renata","lastName":"Kazimierczak","documentHash":"7aa151c3-49a8-4883-a3ce-2a530d5aa1de"},{"objectId":"6777b0b2fdbe833ec1c8d826","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Hallmann","documentHash":"268ac1eb-29bc-402e-85df-3808a8b873da"},{"objectId":"6777b0b2fdbe833ec1c8d825","name":"Caroline","lastName":"Garcia","documentHash":"c924ab58-aaae-4961-8814-a636a5957f91"},{"objectId":"6777b0b2fdbe833ec1c8d824","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Gouble","documentHash":"8d21a09a-fc2b-4fc0-8357-103b2e2a48d8"},{"objectId":"6777b0b2fdbe833ec1c8d823","name":"Alexandre","lastName":"Leca","documentHash":"293eb34c-b97e-4f26-bd3f-2c411e079a06"},{"objectId":"6777b0b2fdbe833ec1c8d822","name":"Sylvie","lastName":"Bureau","documentHash":"a8b7b983-ceda-496d-8131-4112f4a3f33e"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4aa5","name":"Witold","lastName":"Danelski","uuid":"2D52E347C5814C79C9C409B8EAA40B5859D664B8895F554EC10EADD6DF637CB93C0241E1E0950A8F0816C9DA447F67182E2415AC67939C41743782E78D27884A","orcidId":"0000-0002-5451-423X","documentHash":"f4aaf04b-120d-4e73-924b-946a53a806cf"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-12-04","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6777b0b2fdbe833ec1c8d820","doi":"10.1016/j.foodchem.2024.142346","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0308814624039967?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Impact of conventional and innovative processing conditions on organoleptic and nutritional properties of applesauce from organic and conventional production systems","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The impact of cultivar and production system was studied over two years on organoleptic and nutritional characteristics of apple fruits and then, on purees processed with both conventional convection cooking under vacuum and fast innovative microwave cooking.

Regarding processing, the fast innovative microwave cooking led to puree with a higher viscosity but with a lower polyphenol content compared to the convection cooking. Microwave cooking seemed to better preserve fibre but limit the diffusion of minor phenolic components, coming from skin and pips to puree and increase polyphenols degradation due to excessively high temperature spot.

April frosts that followed a very early and warm spring in 2024 caused massive damage to young shoots and primary buds after budburst. This study was conducted on vines of fifty cultivars belonging to Vitis vinifera, interspecific hybrids, and inter-intra- or intra-interspecific hybrids (classified by some sources as V. vinifera), which were obtained via field collection. The aim of this study was to obtain primary results regarding the fertility of secondary, basal, and latent buds. The presence of inflorescences in these buds determines the ability to compensate for yield, i.e., produce a crop after damage to the primary buds. The tested cultivars, which were within the three groups mentioned above, differed significantly in their ability to compensate for yield. The majority of the analyzed V. vinifera cultivars were characterized by lower fertility in their secondary, basal, and latent buds and a reduced ability to compensate for yield after post-budburst freeze damage compared to interspecific hybrids and inter-intra- or intra-interspecific hybrids. Future research, with more comprehensive data collected over a longer period, will provide stronger suggestions for suitable cultivars in regions at risk of spring frost damage."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928f878c28a047397ea6"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"108","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928f878c28a047397ea6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d1","mniswId":"675","title":"Agriculture (Switzerland)","issn":"2077-0472","eissn":"2077-0472","documentHash":"f51997b3-f7b4-40a9-9013-a896e341e147"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677d2bbdfdbe833088ae2e27","year":"2025","volume":"15","number":"1","documentHash":"271d4215-c9dd-4867-9378-7dc835f09987"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Vitis spp.","collection","secondary buds","basal buds","latent buds","compensatory yielding","Poland"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060339288"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4aa5","name":"Witold","lastName":"Danelski","uuid":"2D52E347C5814C79C9C409B8EAA40B5859D664B8895F554EC10EADD6DF637CB93C0241E1E0950A8F0816C9DA447F67182E2415AC67939C41743782E78D27884A","orcidId":"0000-0002-5451-423X","documentHash":"f4aaf04b-120d-4e73-924b-946a53a806cf"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"6788f3bdfdbe83734562fe38","publicUri":"https://www.cdr.gov.pl/images/ZDR/2024/ZDR-2024-4.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"OGRANICZANIE LICZEBNOŚCI NASIONNICY TRZEŚNIÓWKI (Rhagoletis cerasi L.)

Improved selected non-chemical methods and their possible connection with the\nuse of plant infusions and extracts can increase the effectiveness of the protection of sweet\ncherries in organic farming."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709400878c28a0473b4aa5"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"pol","mainLanguageName":"polski","volume":"4","issue":"118","pagesFromTo":"80-94","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709400878c28a0473b4aa5"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9ac0fad204581b62ebb4d","mniswId":"201256","title":"Zagadnienia Doradztwa Rolniczego","issn":"1232-3578","eissn":"2719-8901","metadataSource":"MINISTRY","documentHash":"26109775-af19-46c2-90df-0a0cfa4043d6"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["nasionnica trześniówka","Rhagoletis cerasi","ograniczanie liczebności","wybrane metody niechemiczne","ekologiczna uprawa czereśni"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cherry fruits fly","Rhagoletis cerasi","reduction of numbers","selected non- chemical methods","organic cherry cultivation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060361338"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677d2604fdbe833088ad944c","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Chałańska","documentHash":"cfc441d9-ba26-4727-8d1a-915011a3861e"},{"objectId":"677d2604fdbe833088ad944b","name":"Renata","lastName":"Dobosz","documentHash":"b6dc3c78-6b1a-48c3-b423-da794a40fde0"},{"objectId":"5ebee666752340254fc44e67","name":"Anna","lastName":"Wawrzyniak ","uuid":"01EBC55E315FD7174E4F08EF0164D1DE8BE5B3C37DB69A24FF5F90EECD9714ED0C7E5C3DB28FAF21FD4BC69B0CAFCB03858E946C550998A46D8C808037FBEB8B","documentHash":"c3a3cfef-964c-4a95-94e0-9111f359a1d4"},{"objectId":"5e7094ba878c28a0473c288a","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Flis","uuid":"78412F047A14A6B2DEA0EF6265D4E28D49F4E9E232E1631E8382327015C014E77DEC304BBE80DA66D98B4EBB04E2405D29F8788536A3D2C28A0451FD20CD08E4","orcidId":"0000-0003-1222-5410","documentHash":"667c971f-e5db-4118-857a-c290e1eec3ea"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b9214","name":"Anita","lastName":"Zapałowska","uuid":"C964795FB4A1F7F38D18098518A272789AFE3C30D093C621FB31B21D3CB77837B33AC6E45945EDCCE6A30E9A5BA9A2EE44E864DA10A90298D30652B90F3880F4","orcidId":"0000-0003-4297-9854","documentHash":"d65460ed-d44b-48df-946c-cb180d677d3c"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047390fc6","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Skwiercz","uuid":"3D6D1165507901F580B3B6D5BE187D2F6B2FB4DB90B7B03E8E5E397AFF8ED61BC2B4D253505139A8C1D0A183E07C152527F686835FEE061A7C13FD513E239939","orcidId":"0000-0002-7008-5674","documentHash":"46dc8107-a99c-4e03-8bf9-83f7764581a4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-12-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"677d2604fdbe833088ad9448","doi":"10.24326/asphc.2024.5435","publicUri":"https://czasopisma.up.lublin.pl/asphc/article/download/5435/3659","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"First report of Robustodorus subtenuis on garlic plants in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"During the observation of a garlic plantation, a sample consisting of plants with symptoms of growth inhi-bition and the soil surrounding the roots was collected. Phytophagous nematodes were isolated from the soil sample as well as the garlic plant shoots, with an average density of 75 individuals per 100 mL. Microscope slides were prepared from adult individuals and subjected to morphological and morphometric analysis, as well as DNA examination. It was demonstrated that the examined nematodes belong to the species Robust-odorus  subtenuis. Both the female and male nematodes differed from individuals previously found in the cultivation of Narcissus and Gladiolus. On average, R. subtenuis females have shorter bodies and longer tails, with the averages calculated for the nematode population from the soil being slightly lower than the average values for nematodes from the garlic shoots. Additionally, the females found in the soil had a shorter distance from the lip region to the vulva and a shorter post-vulval sac, the length of which constituted 32 to 45% of the distance from the vulva to the anus. On average, the male bodies were shorter and had longer tails. They were also wider at the level of the anus. The average body length of males isolated from the soil, like that of the females, was lower than the average for individuals isolated from the garlic shoots. Variations in the influ-ence of the host plant on the morphometry of the parasitic nematodes were observed. This is the first report of R. subtenuis colonizing garlic plants in Poland."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047390fc6","5ebee666752340254fc44e67"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709442878c28a0473b9214"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec7","uid":"b8e-dSrkGa9KdyGzPNRLBaw","uuid":"1fe5fa7e-664f-448f-95c1-a19cc6a7664a","name":"Muzeum i Instytut Zoologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ba878c28a0473c288a"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec7","parentUuid":"1fe5fa7e-664f-448f-95c1-a19cc6a7664a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec7","rootUuid":"1fe5fa7e-664f-448f-95c1-a19cc6a7664a","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"6","pagesFromTo":"49-56","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094ba878c28a0473c288a","677d2604fdbe833088ad944b","677d2604fdbe833088ad944c","5ebee666752340254fc44e67","5e709442878c28a0473b9214","5e70922b878c28a047390fc6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e56","mniswId":"322","title":"Acta Scientiarum Polonorum Hortorum Cultus","issn":"1644-0692","eissn":"2545-1405","documentHash":"b52d6e0d-adfb-46ab-ba0a-08c89420b431"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677d2604fdbe833088ad9449","year":"2024","volume":"23","number":"6","documentHash":"99815c84-2d69-4de9-865a-df9c349ebe9a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["foliar nematodes","Allium sativum","morphological characteristics","molecular identification"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060378777"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a5878c28a0473c0f43","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Trzciński","uuid":"1B08C5745BBED0DD2FA6FC7FE765081039817AF55DC1966754B0DE57E0E12A703A4C86A0543480A443BEF70D758B4A7D0A02070D72D9249897FB8DAEA4264074","orcidId":"0000-0003-4568-6504","documentHash":"f5b9cc24-31a2-45ba-ad71-30588d171d96"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398376","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Sitarek","uuid":"81A2618FAEDFB627B48156F62B32026215D11A59AF9B4AD50A23A2139DB87EC15763E2C058FFCFFCBAF8071C101C7814D2CFD0FB8C0FB0C38E7E8336773A30B0","orcidId":"0000-0001-5041-148X","documentHash":"a031375f-fb10-4242-8cbd-1baa5adf5247"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398362","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Sas-Paszt","uuid":"F65BF0798F03691C5ACA3C2A1EA4E5FD87ED5CB37729DF32BC5DB47710F0EBA374AA8CB082C6E75E322B257742E90231A958EB8FE9204AC6F2B651D5DF6471FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-4076-4032","documentHash":"c4b1b795-a964-4309-87da-3ec6e5c5aacd"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397ea4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Lisek","uuid":"C38FF7CEE15417AD4CC38A70CE53F9A2560AE5D83DA50BC26F276FAF8784228713271870F15964508BC5C7EBD2E2300F98393D7F45D8360A6B078185F7CB312E","orcidId":"0000-0002-3421-8759","documentHash":"a5bd2572-1af0-4f84-8b9e-d52fcf895ac8"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a047397929","name":"Regina","lastName":"Janas","uuid":"5EF36592ABC78BA9ED665FC5CC9762B935444E05A64CBB9C31B803658684B3BDECE94C960A1E7722C85109CD0F3B4A0FBE0B72ACE7B975AACFFA081749BD64C9","orcidId":"0000-0002-1066-8456","documentHash":"ba1cab55-fc41-4801-bc37-885594af9ad4"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-01-20","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"678e463bfdbe8352f86854f6","doi":"10.31545/intagr/196646","publicUri":"http://www.international-agrophysics.org/pdf-196646-120561","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Innovative methods of seed refinement and increasing onion plant health and productivity by using microbiological consortiums enriched with natural compounds","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The biggest problems limiting organic production is the heavy contamination of seeds by phytopathogens, which then spread to plants and cause a reduction in their yield or death.

Organic farming using natural preparations is aimed to produce healthy food, rich in nutrients that is unmodified and uncontaminated. Pepper fruit is characterized by its valuable chemical composition and dietary and taste values. The available information on the influence of natural preparations on pepper fruit is insufficient. Therefore, this study was aimed at evaluating the influence of the natural preparations and plant extracts, such as organic fertilizer - Bio-algeen S90, growth and development stimulator - Natural Crop® SL, nettle extract (fertilizer with a killing and nutritional effect) on the chemical composition, structure (image texture), and sensory quality of Devito F1 and Sprinter F1 pepper fruit in organic greenhouse cultivation under the conditions for organic farming. The combination of measurements of chemical properties, flesh image features, and sensory analysis for assessing the quality of pepper treated with these preparations is a great novelty of this study. The obtained results showed that the use of Bio-algeen S90 and Natural Crop® SL had an impact on the increase in the total yield compared to the control samples. Furthermore, the application of Bio-algeen S90 and Natural Crop® SL increased the content of nutrients and health-promoting compounds, such as total sugars, l-ascorbic acid, total polyphenols, and carotenoids for both pepper cultivars Devito F1 and Sprinter F1. The applied natural preparations had an impact on the flesh structure, which was greater for pepper Devito F1. The selected image textures allowed for distinguishing pepper slices in terms of natural preparations with higher accuracies for Devito F1 than Sprinter F1.

Grape bunches were stored for 4 weeks using 3 storage methods ( – 18 °C, + 4 °C, and room temperature) and then were subjected subsequently to image acquisition using a flatbed scanner and image processing. The models for the classification of fresh and stored grapes were built based on selected image textures using traditional machine learning algorithms. The fresh grapes and stored fruit samples (for 4 weeks) in the freezer, in the refrigerator and in the room were classified with an overall accuracy reaching 96% for a model based on selected texture parameters from images in color channels R, G, B, L, a, and b built using Random Forest algorithm. Among the individual color channels, the carried-out classification for the R color channel produced the highest overall accuracies of up to 92.5% for Random Forest.

These preparations can promote nutrient cycling and soil fertility, ultimately supporting healthy plant growth and increasing agricultural productivity. However, the development and commercialization of biopreparations poses unique challenges. Producers of biopreparations struggle to develop highly effective preparations, which then face regulatory hurdles and must win market acceptance. This literature review provides up-to-date data on microbial preparations available commercially on the European market, along with information on current relevant regulations. Challenges for the development and commercialization of new biopreparations are also discussed. The development and commercialization of biopreparations require a comprehensive approach that addresses the complex interplay of microbial and environmental factors. The need for more specific regulations on biopreparations for decomposing crop residues, clearer instructions on their use, and further research on the overall impact of biopreparations on the soil metabolome and optimal conditions for their application were indicated. Moreover, manufacturers should prioritize the development of high-quality products that meet the needs of farmers and address concerns about environmental impact and public acceptance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6541c63a40e3ff4ef3f30503","5e709466878c28a0473bc270","5e709269878c28a0473953d5"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928b878c28a047397929"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"e14534","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6541c63a40e3ff4ef3f30503","5e709269878c28a0473953d5","5e709466878c28a0473bc270","5e70928b878c28a047397929"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478e66","mniswId":"14323","title":"Microbial Biotechnology","issn":"1751-7907","eissn":"1751-7915","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"640d0985-de0e-4254-9b9d-362180b456d7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66c59116fdbe831880e819f2","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"documentHash":"454962df-b886-4fb3-a737-ce66367a4fe8"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biopreparations","decomposition","crop residues","corn"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060392729"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66a8c304fdbe8345dee8a3e7","name":"Walid","lastName":"Mosa","documentHash":"e257db14-2beb-41d4-9aac-1653c3f1ba29"},{"objectId":"66a8c304fdbe8345dee8a3e6","name":"Adel","lastName":"Al-Saif","documentHash":"c39c1f6c-cfee-47ae-994c-b2a251def9f4"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398362","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Sas-Paszt","uuid":"F65BF0798F03691C5ACA3C2A1EA4E5FD87ED5CB37729DF32BC5DB47710F0EBA374AA8CB082C6E75E322B257742E90231A958EB8FE9204AC6F2B651D5DF6471FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-4076-4032","documentHash":"c4b1b795-a964-4309-87da-3ec6e5c5aacd"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"OTHER","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-03-19","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66a8c304fdbe8345dee8a3e4","doi":"10.3390/horticulturae10030295","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2311-7524/10/3/295/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Olive Performance under the Soil Application of Humic Acid and the Spraying of Titanium and Zinc Nanoparticles under Soil Salinity Stress","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Salinity is a major social, economic, and environmental menace in climates with low rainfall and high evapotranspiration, and it influences plant growth and causes restriction to crop production in the world. Additionally, under salinity stress, numerous physiological processes such as photosynthesis, biomass accumulation, and photosynthate transfer are also harshly lessened, and it also limits the absorption of adequate water by plants and leads to a dimension in plant water status. Therefore, the current study was conducted to investigate the soil application of humic acid (HA) at 0, 0.5, 1 and 2 kg/tree alone or in combination with the foliar spraying of 0 mg ZnO2 + 0 mg TiO2, 200 mg ZnO2 + 60 mg TiO2 and/or 300 mg ZnO2 + 80 mg TiO2 through the two successive seasons 2022 and 2023.

Before scanning, date samples were dried using convective drying at 60 °C and infrared drying at 60 °C with a frequency of 50 Hz, and then they were scanned. The scanning trials were performed for two hundred date palm fruit in fresh, convective-dried, and infrared-dried forms of each cultivar using a flatbed scanner. The image-texture parameters of date fruit were extracted from images converted to individual color channels in RGB, Lab, XYZ, and UVS color models. The models to classify fresh and dried samples were developed based on selected image textures using machine learning algorithms belonging to the groups of Bayes, Trees, Lazy, Functions, and Meta. For both the ‘Mejhoul’ and ‘Boufeggous’ cultivars, models built using Random Forest from the group of Trees turned out to be accurate and successful. The average classification accuracy for fresh, convective-dried, and infrared-dried ‘Mejhoul’ reached 99.33%, whereas fresh, convective-dried, and infrared-dried samples of ‘Boufeggous’ were distinguished with an average accuracy of 94.33%. In the case of both cultivars and each model, the higher correctness of discrimination was between fresh and infrared-dried samples, whereas the highest number of misclassified cases occurred between fresh and convective-dried fruit. Thus, the developed procedure may be considered an innovative approach to the non-destructive assessment of drying impact on the external quality characteristics of date palm fruit."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","64e0292840e3ff494b5b6395"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"1602","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64e0292840e3ff494b5b6395","5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"Foods","issn":"2304-8158","eissn":"2304-8158","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"827d8888-1217-4c9f-a068-b8a2e5756417"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6655ccd540970762c87e1e8e","year":"2024","volume":"13","number":"11","documentHash":"f51efad4-ffe6-4062-857d-c875809c4cf7"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Phoenix dactylifera L.","image features","flatbed scanner","artificial intelligence","classification models"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060403216"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e62","name":"Ralph","lastName":"Büchler","documentHash":"5536fcc8-79af-4e57-90e5-fd37f7e2a3c7"},{"objectId":"66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e61","name":"Ursula","lastName":"Wirtz","documentHash":"cb61d516-3207-4b99-a0a0-21989c7b5208"},{"objectId":"66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e60","name":"Fani","lastName":"Hatjina","documentHash":"a5362334-1e3b-4b94-aad9-c2d612135a01"},{"objectId":"66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e5f","name":"Leonidas","lastName":"Charistos","documentHash":"1dc4cf1e-159b-4697-aa4d-33e069dcc232"},{"objectId":"66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e5e","name":"Raffaele","lastName":"Dall’Olio","documentHash":"19f92f5c-9226-48ba-ba15-a08d26945d3a"},{"objectId":"66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e5d","name":"Benjamin","lastName":"Basso","documentHash":"9c198158-5230-4371-b833-daa636ac8911"},{"objectId":"66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e5c","name":"Norman L.","lastName":"Carreck","documentHash":"2cd08ff0-d889-4120-a185-3fbe22623815"},{"objectId":"66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e5b","name":"Marin","lastName":"Kovačić","documentHash":"c2b277f9-a836-4511-b731-5527d2af726e"},{"objectId":"66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e5a","name":"Fanny","lastName":"Mondet","documentHash":"d956cddc-2f8c-4373-80dc-4e0237ca6bcb"},{"objectId":"66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e59","name":"Yves","lastName":"Le Conte","documentHash":"cd0e7b74-e71c-42ef-83aa-c6ae5bdffb88"},{"objectId":"66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e58","name":"Marina D.","lastName":"Meixner","documentHash":"6af70499-5de4-4dba-992d-9b4df2df053f"},{"objectId":"66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e57","name":"Cecilia","lastName":"Costa","documentHash":"0e8c9145-5446-48b2-86f3-d6b6133a1c74"},{"objectId":"66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e56","name":"Sreten","lastName":"Andonov","documentHash":"94df05d9-0be4-48bc-9716-8a45d453ebf8"},{"objectId":"66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e55","name":"Aleksandar","lastName":"Uzunov","documentHash":"3d54f6af-0c82-4c6e-8979-1b7deaf1e657"},{"objectId":"66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e54","name":"Lazo","lastName":"Dimitrov","documentHash":"301883cf-15d3-4908-aee9-c0288fac0cdb"},{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a0473976e2","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Bieńkowska","uuid":"957F2F92D9F973645A7D9624204583C654584C9384B6002771BA8D3151CABA0416BF0CBDE81844B31500D619BCB9D49EF19A922FBB075DCF3EEFBF71BF5FD8CE","orcidId":"0000-0001-6297-0254","documentHash":"8be4b906-4464-4555-a865-0d20d4f4c733"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-06-14","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e52","doi":"10.1080/00218839.2024.2361944","publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00218839.2024.2361944","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Economic aspects of honey bee queen breeding: insights from a European study","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In 2017, the European Commission initiated the EurBeST study to explore the possibilities of using selective breeding of honey bees to increase Varroa resistance traits. One of the specific aims of the study was to assess the process of honey bee queen breeding through an economic analysis. The methodology for calculating the costs of queen production (queen rearing and mating), colony evaluation and expenses for estimating breeding values is based on the Cost of Production (CoP). Cost data were collected via tailor-made questionnaires and interviews performed in five European countries (France, Germany, Greece, Italy, and Poland). The sample population consisted of 20 queen producers and 20 performance testers who participated in the study. The results showed that the average costs for queen production amounted to 22.58 € per queen, ranging from 8.22 € in Poland to 37.30 € in France. The difference between the selling price and the production cost was on average 3.08 € per queen, ranging from 15.86 € in Germany to −12.30 € in France. On average, the colony evaluation costs were 193.40 € per colony. The average cost for breeding value estimation per queen was 8.09 €. Thus, the average total cost per selected queen was 224 €. The selective breeding of honey bees is an efficient way to increase productivity, reduce colony losses, improve bee health and enable profitable operations, but it is expensive, is usually promoted, practiced and implemented by scientists and researchers, and in most cases is financed by external sources."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709288878c28a0473976e2"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"63","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"813-821","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e54","66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e55","66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e56","66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e57","66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e58","66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e59","66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e5a","66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e5b","66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e5c","66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e5d","66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e5e","66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e5f","66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e60","66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e61","66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e62","5e709288878c28a0473976e2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478466","mniswId":"10130","title":"Journal of Apicultural Research","issn":"0021-8839","eissn":"2078-6913","documentHash":"6065bf6d-e6f3-4d9c-9a0a-f44ad4f26796"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66a8dcb9fdbe8345deea2e53","year":"2024","volume":"63","number":"4","documentHash":"c429cca6-9704-40ed-83d0-b383216012e6"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cost of production","queens","breeding","Varroa resistance","honey bee","beekeeping"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060413731"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"678638cffdbe834d98d8fbe0","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Korzeniewska","documentHash":"21eff8c4-e23a-419d-970e-33a40d182ae1"},{"objectId":"678638cffdbe834d98d8fbdf","name":"Anna","lastName":"Bakalarska","documentHash":"5819e618-791a-4e06-99c2-42f49e281ec8"},{"objectId":"5e709404878c28a0473b4e18","name":"Denise","lastName":"Fu Dostatny","uuid":"FB75E28DF45C07346AE8BD51651821C7EAE8D28553D74DD499E5F79CD7ADF7C06E8BDE019D9C4E18CA6D4F3A135CD0CE5007B3A6A98282E92EA563E1756D43C4","orcidId":"0000-0002-6544-1531","documentHash":"2f8ccc15-6d66-49b0-a65e-f628896cbbd6"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923a6","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Bartoszewski","uuid":"E07C76FACC8B4B9246E46D84EFCFC8031B384E5EA7DFFF790CEB794863183C004A59823F429282691D44BAE3BAB565C0F4D9A5C5BF8BCB15D5296C976FEA38E2","orcidId":"0000-0002-6197-770X","documentHash":"c5417dc6-62d0-4f08-a4e3-80bf246ac37b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-12-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"678638cffdbe834d98d8fbde","doi":"10.3390/agronomy14122992","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/14/12/2992/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Changes in Plant Genetic Resources in the Southeast Region of Poland from the 1980s to 2023","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents data from sixteen collecting missions conducted over three decades (2000–2023) in the Lubelskie Voivodeship, located in Southeastern Poland.

These materials were compared with those collected during six expeditions in two earlier decades (1980–1999), which resulted in the collection of 665 genotypes. The samples were primarily obtained from local farmers or gathered directly from fields. This study aims to summarise and compare the results of the collecting missions across decades. The analysis indicates that the Lubelskie region remains a place where old varieties of annual vegetable plants, rare weed species (on a national scale), crop wild relatives, and old varieties of fruit trees can still be found. However, old cereal varieties have nearly disappeared. The collected materials were characterised and stored as a base collection under long-term storage conditions at the Plant Breeding and Acclimatization Institute—National Research Institute. Vegetable plant materials were deposited in the active collection at the National Institute of Horticultural Research (INHORT). Fruit tree collections were also deposited at INHORT, as well as in the Botanical Garden of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Poland."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709404878c28a0473b4e18"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"12","pagesFromTo":"2992","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709404878c28a0473b4e18","678638cffdbe834d98d8fbdf","678638cffdbe834d98d8fbe0","5e70923d878c28a0473923a6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d9","mniswId":"689","title":"Agronomy","issn":"2073-4395","eissn":"2073-4395","documentHash":"f748c34e-fa45-428e-abf2-7624cc5986fd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6749fefafdbe8325166c7536","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"12","documentHash":"74662348-a78b-4da3-b52d-3a02f353d1f4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["collecting missions","Poland","plant genetic resources","preservation","genetic erosion"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060420926"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6797630dfdbe8349c0805342","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Gąbka","documentHash":"55b94e98-9f52-4066-9fe1-5bea379d3702"},{"objectId":"6797630dfdbe8349c0805341","name":"Kornelia","lastName":"Kucharska","documentHash":"e38ffaa9-8c5a-473c-b1ad-69f25d5bb77b"},{"objectId":"6797630dfdbe8349c0805340","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Zajdel","documentHash":"48981a09-600f-4976-96e4-b7b7be16053b"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0eee","name":"Mikołaj","lastName":"Borański","uuid":"84C8D45F87D69F5C4C237DD08498AA03C9B8CD4E54F938724A58E30EA467D49586E303E32243AEC001F93DC0B3C7E2F45177F0C60461F727787491F5834CB62A","orcidId":"0000-0002-5462-7998","documentHash":"e0f48428-ee64-4d2f-b837-b5453f1d71c3"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-12-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6797630dfdbe8349c080533f","doi":"10.3390/ani14243600","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/14/24/3600/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The Population Development of the Red Mason Bee, Osmia bicornis L., for Different Types of Nesting Materials","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Osmia bicornis L. is a widespread and valued pollinator species. It is considered to be easy to breed, provided that the nesting material in which the bees build their nests is of sufficient quality and quantity. The aim of this study was to test several different types of nesting materials: reeds and commercial structures, including wood, MDF (Medium Density Fibreboard), plastic, paper or polystyrene. The highest levels of nest cavity occupancy were found in reeds (90%) and grooved MDF (over 80%). We have shown that maintaining mason bee colonies in polystyrene leads to reproductive losses (occupancy only 2% of nesting holes). Mason bees built the most cells in MDF (8.02 cells/hole) and wood (7.34 cells/hole), slightly fewer in plastic (6.83 cells/hole) and reeds (6.74 cells/hole), and the fewest in paper (3.67 cells/hole). The most cocoons per nest were obtained from reed (average 5.47), MDF (4.84) and plastic (4.74). We observed the highest mortality in plastic (2 larvae/hole), and the lowest in reeds (0.92 larvae/hole). In nests made of wood, MDF and paper, large nesting losses were caused by the migration of Ch. osmiae mites along and through the nest holes. The most hygienic nesting material turned out to be reed and plastic forms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0eee"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"24","pagesFromTo":"3600","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6797630dfdbe8349c0805340","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0eee","6797630dfdbe8349c0805341","6797630dfdbe8349c0805342"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","issn":"2076-2615","eissn":"2076-2615","documentHash":"3a493594-5fb6-4f5f-9a88-e87d49e3df95"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"675beb5cfdbe834a82291aef","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"24","documentHash":"ef4f0144-6b48-4f49-9cfa-c58aa9effd08"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Osmia bicornis","nest materials","develop population","parasites"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060434080"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"667fda54fdbe83464ace4787","name":"Norbert","lastName":"Kowara","documentHash":"fa14049b-f59a-4600-ac80-f0eb2e603220"},{"objectId":"667fda54fdbe83464ace4786","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Walencik","documentHash":"adf4004d-356c-49a0-8041-461413a5f2ae"},{"objectId":"667fda54fdbe83464ace4784","name":"Xiaoyun","lastName":"Du","documentHash":"2e0242b7-a891-4aa7-8f31-e7a101c60a74"},{"objectId":"667fda54fdbe83464ace4783","name":"Lingling","lastName":"Zhao","documentHash":"5b5017da-9719-40e7-968f-0bb16c51764c"},{"objectId":"667fda54fdbe83464ace4782","name":"Laiqing","lastName":"Song","documentHash":"e8fb22b9-e4a5-41ab-b1af-0e9c4d7fe965"},{"objectId":"667fda54fdbe83464ace4781","name":"Xueqing","lastName":"Liu","documentHash":"f117b095-4989-4243-a354-c4f6502a48a5"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c0d","name":"Michał","lastName":"Oskiera","uuid":"2DB7F413923D3506027D4A35876A9ECECD075E36268373E354BC767ABCE2D672554A5C3DB115324D4239A804F6CCF5E611DAA2724538E8CCC5219A074CED41E4","orcidId":"0000-0003-0696-3505","documentHash":"97683739-5a42-410c-be3c-f3e052fc56ea"},{"objectId":"5e7092db878c28a04739e38c","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Keller-Przybyłkowicz","uuid":"F74E523D181773B9760663C0AB0B2E52602C676EAE3122C10C4624C429A96088D72B252BE68A6CE52BDD357BD119F8BF1FE743493F5F14897B6A4F7CDF06670E","orcidId":"0000-0002-3473-9706","documentHash":"360d8a0a-fb76-4750-995f-ba5c35e30686"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397e8f","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Kruczyńska","uuid":"4590C5A32BCE4E52E286005F898A668B074C4C1091D220F6C34A63EF546555DF0F120F110389C76C3AAFE6E4FDB39337FFC70A341586E583488C9B50DA101D8D","orcidId":"0000-0002-1376-1082","documentHash":"45900a7e-0b14-476a-8924-d1e4c1c151ab"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923a6","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Bartoszewski","uuid":"E07C76FACC8B4B9246E46D84EFCFC8031B384E5EA7DFFF790CEB794863183C004A59823F429282691D44BAE3BAB565C0F4D9A5C5BF8BCB15D5296C976FEA38E2","orcidId":"0000-0002-6197-770X","documentHash":"c5417dc6-62d0-4f08-a4e3-80bf246ac37b"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-02-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65d854b14097071e545d0699","doi":"10.3390/ijms25031778","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/3/1778","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Transcriptome Analysis of White- and Red-Fleshed Apple Fruits Uncovered Novel Genes Related to the Regulation of Anthocyanin Biosynthesis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The red flesh coloration of apples is a result of a biochemical pathway involved in the biosynthesis of anthocyanins and anthocyanidins. Based on apple genome analysis, a high number of regulatory genes, mainly transcription factors such as MYB, which are components of regulatory complex MYB-bHLH-WD40, and several structural genes (PAL, 4CL, CHS, CHI, F3H, DFR, ANS, UFGT) involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis, have been identified. In this study, we investigated novel genes related to the red-flesh apple phenotype. These genes could be deemed molecular markers for the early selection of new apple cultivars. Based on a comparative transcriptome analysis of apples with different fruit-flesh coloration, we successfully identified and characterized ten potential genes from the plant hormone transduction pathway of auxin (GH3); cytokinins (B-ARR); gibberellins (DELLA); abscisic acid (SnRK2 and ABF); brassinosteroids (BRI1, BZR1 and TCH4); jasmonic acid (MYC2); and salicylic acid (NPR1). An analysis of expression profiles was performed in immature and ripe fruits of red-fleshed cultivars. We have uncovered genes mediating the regulation of abscisic acid, salicylic acid, cytokinin, and jasmonic acid signaling and described their role in anthocyanin biosynthesis, accumulation, and degradation. The presented results underline the relationship between genes from the hormone signal transduction pathway and UFGT genes, which are directly responsible for anthocyanin color transformation as well as anthocyanin accumulation during apple-fruit ripening."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092db878c28a04739e38c","5e709401878c28a0473b4c0d","5e70928f878c28a047397e8f"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"25","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1778","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092db878c28a04739e38c","5e709401878c28a0473b4c0d","667fda54fdbe83464ace4781","667fda54fdbe83464ace4782","667fda54fdbe83464ace4783","667fda54fdbe83464ace4784","5e70928f878c28a047397e8f","667fda54fdbe83464ace4786","667fda54fdbe83464ace4787","5e70923d878c28a0473923a6"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"850accc5-0c0e-4f6c-9a84-eaa108a84f20"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["apple","expression profiling","KEGG","red-flesh fruits","RNA-seq","RT-qPCR","transcriptome"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060443914"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6703bfedfdbe835ef8a432c3","name":"Sabina","lastName":"Lachowicz-Wiśniewska","documentHash":"2866d292-58e3-408d-b8f0-6a9510d6a9c9"},{"objectId":"5e7094a7878c28a0473c1102","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Seliga","uuid":"CACBC0870CB157C461F900A444A42A1003A1358653DCE690FA7817C97D022571577B326BF6A9F98C765F25CF1B1F866F7C72D013982E6B727B35707609E0105C","orcidId":"0000-0002-1687-5499","documentHash":"a328f130-9c53-44ef-83c5-c9f648366336"},{"objectId":"5e7093a1878c28a0473ae11a","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Żurek","uuid":"209FF17B2564284CB688D17503DB2A844AA45F8BB8A2EBAA91888CB11000252117F486A3412A623EF07C1280586DCF4BCE6A8669F74F4A58F4404CF20DAD71BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-4002-0335","documentHash":"8feb5ec1-1ced-4af8-bfce-466f0aa4b25b"},{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fbcf","name":"Ireneusz","lastName":"Kapusta","uuid":"6DAB645BDC2EBEE02DD000181F5F143BD9D7E0423ACCC8A800CA763AD09A0FEA916CE715E99056C761B940E21E587089ED03A23C4A9765611BE7A70B5ED64E47","orcidId":"0000-0002-1197-2361","documentHash":"a4c18afe-c217-4921-96ed-6e1885929b72"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e669","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Pluta","uuid":"A389F119DF07BF98605FE425265C9D7AAFC056C945E0F9E7F5B4B226B0057BD6E8D3D999781461C4DD166DE67E1F1EED446BB62F6F662DA5A98F3DB3747DFCD6","orcidId":"0000-0003-2837-7304","documentHash":"c4cc3f4e-bb2b-4925-be1d-b7e627597a4a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-10-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6703bfedfdbe835ef8a432c0","doi":"10.3390/agriculture14101734","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/14/10/1734/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Comparative Evaluation of the Phytochemical Composition of Fruits of Ten Haskap Berry (Lonicera caerulea var. kamtschatica Sevast.)

Most of the selected cultivars had not previously been analyzed for these properties. A total of 19 polyphenolic compounds were identified in the fruits of the tested genotypes, with a quantitative range of 2166.3–3597.0 µg/g. The polyphenol profile was dominated by anthocyanins (90.0–92.4%), and the remaining classes occurred in the following order: phenolic acids > flavonols > flavan-3-ols. The highest concentrations of these polyphenol groups were found in the cultivars ‘Honeybee’, ‘Sinij Uties’ and ‘Usłada’. The fruits of these cultivars were also characterized by the highest antioxidant activity (546.6–683.5 µg/mL for O2˙− and 541.2–652.1 µg/mL for OH˙) and cytotoxic activity (103.6–649.2 µg/mL).

The research was conducted in 2021-2023 in the Experimental Orchard\nin Dąbrowice on shrubs from the collection established in 2009 and 2016. The greatest\ngrowth of shrubs was observed in the cultivars ‘Atlantic’, ‘Berkeley’, ‘Bluecrop’, ‘Elizabeth’,\n‘Lateblue’, ‘Nelson’, ‘Olympia’ and ‘Reka’, while the lowest in the cultivar ‘Weymouth’. The\ncultivars 'Patriot' and 'Weymouth' started flowering the earliest (3 May), while 'Lateblue'\nand 'Ozarkblue' flowered the latest (15 May). The fruits of the 'Weymouth', 'Earliblue',\n'Chanticleer', 'Duke' and 'Draper' cultivars reached the earliest harvest maturity (July 14-\n17), while the latest 'Lateblue' (August 18) and 'Aurora' (August 25). The smallest fruits\nwere produced by plants of the 'Pemberton' cultivar, while the largest fruits were produced\nby bushes of the 'Chandler' cultivar. The highest content of soluble solids was found in the\nin the 'Earliblue' fruits, while the lowest was found in the fruits of the ‘Aurora’ cultivar.\nThe cultivars that were characterized by both high content of soluble solids in fruits and\nalso large fruits were: ‘Augusta’, ‘Concord’, ‘Liberty’, ‘Spartan’ and ‘Sunrise’, as well as ‘Ber-\nkeley’, ‘Darrow’, ‘Elizabeth’, ‘Duke’ and ‘Lateblue’. Considering the date of harvest maturity\namong the listed cultivars, ‘Duke’ is an early cultivar, ‘Concord’, ‘Spartan’, ‘Sunrise’ are\nmedium-early cultivars, ‘Berkeley’ has a medium ripening date, ‘Augusta’, ‘Darrow’, ‘Eliza-\nbeth’ and ‘Liberty’ are late cultivars, and ‘Lateblue’ is very late.

Most of the cultivars in this research have been first presented in this paper. Phytochemical profiling of the tested highbush blueberry fruit revealed 75 bioactive compounds, including 5 macroelements, 7 microelements, 7 monophosphate nucleotides, 15 anthocyanins, 1 phenolic acid, 14 flavonols, 11 essential amino acids, 8 non-essential amino acids, 2 sugars, 7 organic acids. The PCA showed that the profile and contents of the analyzed compounds as well as their anti-bacterial, antioxidant, anti-diabetic, and anti-obesity potentials depended significantly on the tested cultivars.

To address these challenges, amild and scalable encapsulation method forTrichodermaspores isintroduced, employing a layer-by-layer (LbL) approach using biobased ligninderivatives. It is demonstrated that the LbL encapsulation techniquesignificantly improved spore stability relative to naked spores, even underadverse conditions including extreme temperatures and prolonged exposureto Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation.

In the current study, a survey of general microbiological contamination (mesophilic bacteria, yeasts, molds, Enterobacteriaceae, coli bacteria, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, and Escherichia coli) of fresh-cut vegetable salads and berry-packed fruits available in Polish supermarket was undertaken.\nIn ready-to-eat salads, the high number of mesophilic bacteria ranged from 6.43 to 8.56 log10 cfu g–1, and also Enterobacteriaceae with mean value from 3.45 to 4.08 log10 cfu g–1 was detected. Mesophilic bacteria, yeast, and Enterobacteriaceae were detected in all salad samples. The molds were detected in 45% of salad samples, and their mean number ranged from 0.63 log10 cfu g–1 in salads with carrot or beetroot to 1.80 log10 cfu g–1 in salads with rocket.\nBerry fruit was also heavily microbiologically contaminated. In particular, the means of mesophilic bacteria, molds, and yeasts were high. The number of molds detected in fruit samples, especially in raspberry samples, could be alarming.

Binary classification is important because it ensures that the quality characteristics of the seeds are very similar\nto each other. The pumpkin seed varieties of Develi, Sena Hanım, Türkmen, and Mertbey were discriminated in pairs. Five\nmachine learning algorithms (Naïve Bayes, NB; support vector machine, SVM; random forest, RF; multilayer perceptron,\nMLP; and kNN, k-nearest neighbors) were applied to assess the classification performance. In all pairs, the pumpkin seed\nvarieties of Develi and Mertbey were discriminated with the highest accuracies of 85.00% for the MLP model and 84.50%\nfor the SVM model and 83.50% for the RF. In the MLP algorithm, TP rate reached to 0.790 for Develi and 0.910 for Mert-\nbey, Precision to 0.898 for Develi and 0.813 for Mertbey, F-measure to 0.840 for Develi and 0.858 for Mertbey, PRC area\nto 0.894 for Develi and 0.896 for Mertbey, and ROC area to 0.907 for both varieties. Variety of pairs was followed by Sena\nHanım and Türkmen (84.50%, MLP) and Türkmen and Mertbey (82.50%, SVM). For the selected input attributes, the high-\nest mass (0.23 g), length (22.08 for Mertbey, 21.43 for Sena Hanım), and geometric mean diameter (8.79 mm) values were\nobtained from Sena Hanım variety, while shape index (3.40) from Mertbey variety. Multivariate statistical results showed\nthat differences in attributes were significant (p < 0.01). Wilks’ lambda statistics found that the portion of the unexplained\ndifference between groups was 46.60%. Develi and Sena Hanım varieties with the lowest Mahalanobis distance values had\nsimilar characteristics.

In addition, it helps consumers to access quality products. This study aimed to discriminate dried carrot samples subjected to 12 different combinations of drying and pretreatment by using innovative techniques based on chromatic attributes. The drying procedure consists of three different microwave powers (100, 200, 300 W), and pretreatments include 5% gum arabic solution, 5% gum sucrose solution, ultrasound application, and a control (no-pretreatment). The R, G, B, L, a, b, H, S, and V color channels were extracted from dried carrot images, and the exploration of classification models from selected color channels was an innovative aspect of the study. In all color channels, high overall accuracies were obtained with the values of 96.33, 96.50, and 97.00% for the logistic model tree, k-nearest neighbor, and random forest, respectively. The confusion matrix showed the lowest mixing among carrots dried at H-US (300 W + ultrasound) vs. H-C (300 W + control), H-S (300 W + sucrose) vs. H-C (300 W + control), and M-S (200 W + sucrose) vs. H-S (300 W + sucrose). The highest L, a, and b color values for the dried carrot slices were obtained as M-S (75.26), H-GA (30.93), and M-GA (44.75), respectively. In addition, hue values varied between 17.26 and 13.27, whereas saturation values varied between 50.93 and 59.90.

The use of vegetation indices and machine learning for yield prediction is rapid, practical, and accurate and contributes to the development of digital agriculture. Although many studies have been carried out on yield estimation, the number of studies on sugar beet and irrigation applications is limited. To solve this problem, in this study yield prediction of sugar beet under different irrigation treatments was carried out using spectral reflection-based vegetation indices obtained by proximal measurements and developed machine learning models. The multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), k-nearest (kNN), bagging (BAG), support vector regression (SVR), gaussian processes (GP), and CustomNet (CN) predictors were used in yield prediction. The irrigation treatments included I100 (application of irrigation to increase the available moisture to field capacity by around 45–50% of the water holding capacity at the root depth), I75 (75% of the water applied in the control group), I50 (50% of the water applied in the control group), and I125 (25% of the water applied in the control group). The combinations of vegetation indices were determined using Pearson correlation and principal component analysis. OSAVI, SAVI, and NDVI had the most significant influence on the yield prediction of sugar beet. Among the combinations used, the kNN1 model (including all attributes as input) showed high R2 values of 0.99 for training and 0.64 for testing. In addition, the kNN3 model (including Treatment, NDVI, NWI, and OSAVI as inputs) had R2 values of 0.97 for training and 0.65 for testing, indicating successful outcomes. However, the MLP1 and SVR1 models had lower results with test R2 values of 0.53 and 0.56, respectively. The results demonstrate the successful application of machine learning and vegetation indices for yield prediction. The proposed approaches could encourage agricultural experts and researchers in future work for yield mapping and identification."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"221","pagesFromTo":"109019","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66b0cf70fdbe8305357315e9","5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","66b0cf70fdbe8305357315ea"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454777b6","mniswId":"4270","title":"COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE","issn":"0168-1699","documentHash":"bddf9792-328b-4c55-ac0d-c3b1cf15725e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66b0cf70fdbe8305357315e8","year":"2024","volume":"221","documentHash":"24e817a0-3071-43b1-b923-2ce2602aa63e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["proximal sensing","vegetation indices","machine learning","vis-NIR","yield prediction"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060467331"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"677fb945fdbe831a91d4258b","name":"Ragheb M.","lastName":"Eladly","documentHash":"df5e5d14-c1e7-4708-a281-5b02b364b4d1"},{"objectId":"677fb945fdbe831a91d4258a","name":"Adel M.","lastName":"Al-Saif","documentHash":"75ba3232-6377-4807-89f9-12955fb821fd"},{"objectId":"677fb945fdbe831a91d42589","name":"Walid F.

This richness generates complex, long, and tedious work at the scale of farm as well as in handling, processing, and storage facilities to prepare standardized, and homogenous final products that deal with consumer preferences and needs. To alleviate this, an increased importance and particular trend were observed recently for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and computer vision technology since they are considered as accurate, objective, non-destructive, fast, and efficient emerging technologies. In this context, this manuscript provides comprehensive insights into key applications of AI techniques and computer vision technology, using different classification models and algorithms developed on the basis (for example) of neural network classifiers, such as convolutional and artificial neural network, on harvest and postharvest assessment of date fruit. Thus, the importance of date fruit dataset used in the AI domain was discussed with link to all accessible datasets in the field of date palm. In addition, available and relevant AI tools and approaches applied to the postharvest of date fruit from maturity distinguishing until storage through other key handling operations, sorting, grading, etc., were detailed in the five sections of this paper.

During Frozen Storage Using Digital Camera and Flatbed Scanner","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The emergence of new technologies focusing on “computer vision” has contributed significantly to the assessment of fruit quality. In this study, an innovative approach based on image analysis was used to assess the external quality of fresh and frozen ‘Mejhoul’ and ‘Boufeggous’ date palm cultivars stored for 6 months at −10 °C and −18 °C. Their quality was evaluated, in a non-destructive manner, based on texture features extracted from images acquired using a digital camera and flatbed scanner. The whole process of image processing was carried out using MATLAB R2024a and Q-MAZDA 23.10 software. Then, extracted features were used as inputs for pre-established algorithms–groups within WEKA 3.9 software to classify frozen date fruit samples after 0, 2, 4, and 6 months of storage. Among 599 features, only 5 to 36 attributes were selected as powerful predictors to build desired classification models based on the “Functions-Logistic” classifier. The general architecture exhibited clear differences in classification accuracy depending mainly on the frozen storage period and imaging device. Accordingly, confusion matrices showed high classification accuracy (CA), which could reach 0.84 at M0 for both cultivars at the two frozen storage temperatures. This CA indicated a remarkable decrease at M2 and M4 before re-increasing by M6, confirming slight changes in external quality before the end of storage. Moreover, the developed models on the basis of flatbed scanner use allowed us to obtain a high correctness rate that could attain 97.7% in comparison to the digital camera, which did not exceed 85.5%. In perspectives, physicochemical attributes can be added to developed models to establish correlation with image features and predict the behavior of date fruit under storage."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398355","5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","64e0292840e3ff494b5b6395"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"24","issue":"23","pagesFromTo":"7560","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64e0292840e3ff494b5b6395","5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","674daa95fdbe8324c66ac220","5e709292878c28a047398355"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796fd","mniswId":"18383","title":"SENSORS","issn":"1424-8220","eissn":"1424-8220","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"91062cb9-24b0-4df6-9558-eaa12e105cea"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"674daa95fdbe8324c66ac21f","year":"2024","volume":"24","number":"23","documentHash":"8ced48ea-b011-4ece-b795-a443f9544144"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["‘Mejhoul’","date cultivar","image processing","machine learning","prediction","classification"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060474705"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6678843e4097074fa1037a65","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Kowalczyk","documentHash":"e3cad2fa-658e-4c5f-b0fc-589ede5d881a"},{"objectId":"6678843e4097074fa1037a64","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Bella","documentHash":"9204754c-27ab-4b3b-b071-b96769dfdf09"},{"objectId":"6678843e4097074fa1037a63","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Wójcik-Gront","documentHash":"cb3b2fc9-19c2-43e7-a164-540c126a9154"},{"objectId":"6678843e4097074fa1037a62","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Mirgos","documentHash":"9b75b9d5-b473-4c2c-8784-909e7b6ec7c7"},{"objectId":"6678843e4097074fa1037a61","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Łaźny","documentHash":"e41b4233-471d-44de-8605-439740136713"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4bea","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kunka","uuid":"84861EC524B8EFBC25A04C44C98FBD38A2D6FB696844F98D8D20C895391B445BE5947A00E9515DD062C039AD8823A450D64C1785953C0CA8FE06CE36A1B8CBC9","orcidId":"0000-0002-9878-0310","documentHash":"245abf54-db9b-4aa3-befe-595aa3538073"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397f69","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"9E538886BAEC63D822291227462DC5326050A9D565F74EE2E32A6843C2F96B70C99B1D2881EF31E6974EAE0A6A97C1906FBC6D71B47EC440D61916F795BADDB5","orcidId":"0000-0002-5962-936X","documentHash":"95877ed5-692d-4970-9e1d-6384aba950fc"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923b0","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"5E24C8B8B82DF92592988E62BA167E1795C7030CAA13FBF43C8E3E309E47D2B063B2A06E7D1E473EB259EC2EA2D331879136BA5359B07A5F51FFFD5960C5042F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5282-7331","documentHash":"6d722aee-6cf4-4a44-abc1-e7b73aedf070"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a047392360","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Przybył","uuid":"916B830365DBE2ACC0F901844157A461A9EC440885E084CEC646E87D58AB1DDE59E325561362273D6B2B01F78E259A5B0FF966BA0A733A2DEEFA1B6D70E8068A","orcidId":"0000-0003-0959-184X","documentHash":"172369e8-7957-4c4b-ba60-e93aa185365a"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a04739235e","name":"Janina","lastName":"Gajc-Wolska","uuid":"0B5E2326A0561B418D8D4A7D2B65BDF17E21FC131E2F6F649B8381CCF8263C0A7A87C0003711CD0A9049BCEDF2DFB6D847C77C725C765F9C251FB130C60F212A","orcidId":"0000-0003-4237-5575","documentHash":"d6286f62-1a01-4ee9-b07d-dfdd41c12ebb"}],"objectId":"65c340174097074c89d6c711","doi":"10.1016/j.scienta.2023.112839","publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304423823010075?via%3Dihub","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Effect of lignite substrate compared to mineral wool and supplementary lighting with HPS and LED on growth, plant photosynthetic activity, yield and fruit quality of greenhouse cucumber","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The substrate in hydroponic cultivation is one of the basic factors for proper plant growth, and current environmental trends suggest replacing the previously used mineral wool with organic substrates.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of lignite substrate and LED supplementary lighting on morphological and physiological parameters as well as quality and yield of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) in hydroponic cultivation compared to the cultivation in mineral wool substrate. Lignite mats applied in cultivation with LED supplementary lighting had a beneficial effect on cucumber plant growth and development and plant nutrition in Fe, K, P, Ca, Mg and Zn compared to cultivation in mineral substrate and HPS supplementary lighting. The combination of LED lighting and lignite mats also improved the physiological parameters of the cucumber plants, as well as fruit hardness. Fruits harvested from plants grown in lignite substrate and supplemented with LEDs had the lowest nitrate content and increased TSS value, as well as increased fruit firmness."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928f878c28a047397f69","5e709401878c28a0473b4bea","6678843e4097074fa1037a65"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"327","pagesFromTo":"1-10","contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6678843e4097074fa1037a61","6678843e4097074fa1037a62","5e70923d878c28a047392360","6678843e4097074fa1037a63","6678843e4097074fa1037a64","5e70923d878c28a04739235e","6678843e4097074fa1037a65","5e709401878c28a0473b4bea","5e70923d878c28a0473923b0","5e70928f878c28a047397f69"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b4","mniswId":"18258","title":"Scientia Horticulturae","issn":"0304-4238","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"f3a1740e-adf4-4540-b7e0-d616a613a90a"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["organic substrate","hydroponic growing","light quality","chlorophyll fluorescence","bioactive compounds"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060490225"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c12","name":"Wioletta","lastName":"Popińska","uuid":"FE36F49A132509B4DFC467B5E9A6AE32B9D7752F6A4D542686509D603B42040CB9E8A25C06F5438C7557CCDCB6F99AA9F20FC9ABD20AB9B9522B771EE41C9858","orcidId":"0000-0002-8146-7723","documentHash":"f1377c0d-2758-4483-9a73-082d9b98177e"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398d3c","name":"Jan","lastName":"Piecko","uuid":"D93B845F11898D39288E80412E7144384CBF4B52F99D5F14895BDA9F7728A41E39E4314B1B926B043A2D56FA8BADDB8ECB76C4560A10C660460F7645B8F56A24","orcidId":"0000-0001-6838-9364","documentHash":"d0c8e230-a87d-4417-9539-22b0874746e1"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397ebc","name":"Monika","lastName":"Mieszczakowska-Frąc","uuid":"6900A32F634EF1531D8F8C6ACE07E99EB67DDA525F899A042C0F3631CBD6903E79CD1E6BC74E398C0CD9A37D077102F17EEBAC43BB98995342398DA2B165761C","orcidId":"0000-0001-8786-7990","documentHash":"beeb1f34-0cfd-4aa6-909a-19583be25118"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397e8f","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Kruczyńska","uuid":"4590C5A32BCE4E52E286005F898A668B074C4C1091D220F6C34A63EF546555DF0F120F110389C76C3AAFE6E4FDB39337FFC70A341586E583488C9B50DA101D8D","orcidId":"0000-0002-1376-1082","documentHash":"45900a7e-0b14-476a-8924-d1e4c1c151ab"}],"objectId":"66b31051fdbe83743f88727e","doi":"10.15199/64.2024.1.3","publicUri":"https://sigma-not.pl/publikacja-147567-2024-1.html","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Profil składników mineralnych, metali ciężkich w owocach  i przecierze z pigwy","otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"Profile of minerals, heavy metals in fruit and quince puree"}],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Właściwe odżywianie, uwzględniające m.in. spożycie owoców i warzyw, może wpłynąć na poprawę jakości życia człowieka.

Whole apples, apple slices, seeds, and leaves belonging to ‘Free Redstar’, clone 118, ‘Ligolina’, ‘Pink Braeburn’, and ‘Pinokio’ were imaged using a digital camera. The texture parameters were extracted from images in color channels L, a, b, R, G, B, X, Y, Z, U, V, and S. The classification models were built using traditional machine learning algorithms. Models developed using selected image seed textures allowed the classification of apple cultivars and a clone with the highest average accuracy of up to 97.4%. The apple seeds ‘Free Redstar’ were distinguished with the highest accuracy, equal to 100%. Machine learning models built based on the textures of apple skin allowed for the clone and cultivar classification with slightly lower correctness, reaching 94%. Meanwhile, the average accuracies for models involving selected flesh and leave textures reached 86.4% and 88.8%, respectively. All the most efficient models for classifying individual apple fruit parts and leaves were developed using Multilayer Perceptron. However, models combining selected image textures of apple skin, slices (flesh), seeds, and leaves produced the highest average accuracy of up to 99.6% in the case of Bayes Net. Thus, it was found that including features of different parts of apple fruit and apple leaves in one model can allow for the correct distinguishing of apples in terms of cultivar and clone."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","5e70928f878c28a047397ea0"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"79-92","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","5e70928f878c28a047397ea0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e56","mniswId":"322","title":"Acta Scientiarum Polonorum Hortorum Cultus","issn":"1644-0692","eissn":"2545-1405","documentHash":"b52d6e0d-adfb-46ab-ba0a-08c89420b431"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6694f8dcfdbe830e8642e0e4","year":"2024","volume":"23","number":"2","documentHash":"bd27974a-989c-4f3a-9763-d0ec12bb3665"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["apple skin","flesh","seeds","leaves","image processing","machine learning","classification"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060504262"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ropelewska","uuid":"E3575740307CA373F3BD454AAC58C202E1C2CA28B9FC90C6BC3006DB867893BEE70DFAC85C7D9667CD0ACB7837B8DF63F7D6636679B032F0F1E0E534A3F3CBD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8891-236X","documentHash":"e9d0e369-fc46-40fe-9cb3-5236d6ea38a0"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397ea0","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Lewandowski","uuid":"FF9CB12B6F29964A550A5E57E5FD89260B52352595E70F20C435F3D419C03232071E90EF786DD9DE8845ACEF45C58EFA629D010F430B68BF6C31B8E066171866","orcidId":"0000-0002-4852-5514","documentHash":"a75b54d4-0935-425b-ad8e-156f972f1c3e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-11-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"675803a6fdbe835dc1630c12","doi":"10.3390/foods13233784","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/13/23/3784/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The Changes in Color and Image Parameters and Sensory Attributes of Freeze-Dried Clones and a Cultivar of Red-Fleshed Apples","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The target of breeding red-fleshed apples is to increase their potential health benefits related to red flesh coloration and consumer acceptance. The objective of this study was to determine the usefulness of four clones (90, 120, 156, and 158) of red-fleshed apples for freeze-drying compared to the cultivar ‘Trinity’. Red-fleshed apples were dried in the form of slices using a laboratory freeze-dryer. The changes in color features and image texture parameters after drying and the sensory quality of freeze-dried samples were assessed. Trends of increase in the value of the L* parameter and decrease in the a* and b* parameters after freeze-drying were observed. Furthermore, freeze-drying caused statistically significant changes in analyzed image textures named XHMean, RHMean, SHMean, VHMean, LHMean, and UHMean. Machine learning models developed based on the color parameters L*, a*, and b* distinguished raw and freeze-dried red-fleshed apples with an average accuracy of 84% for clone 90 up to 99.0% for clone 156, and models based on twenty selected image textures exhibited an accuracy of 98.5% for clone 156 to 100% for clones 90 and 158 and the cultivar ‘Trinity’. The very attractive external appearance, medium-intense fruity smell, crunchiness, and intense fruity taste of all the apple slices were revealed. The innovative aspect of this study included the comparison of the drying behavior and sensory quality of the new clones and a standard cultivar of red-fleshed apples. Moreover, innovative methods and results were used to determine the effect of freeze-drying on red-fleshed apple quality, considering novel models involving thousands of image textures and machine learning algorithms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","5e70928f878c28a047397ea0"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"23","pagesFromTo":"3784","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","5e70928f878c28a047397ea0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"Foods","issn":"2304-8158","eissn":"2304-8158","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"827d8888-1217-4c9f-a068-b8a2e5756417"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"674d9299fdbe83571718092e","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"13","number":"23","documentHash":"2d6dfab7-bdce-44d4-8f51-3395f954bfdd"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["red-fleshed apple clones","red-fleshed apple cultivar","freeze-drying","color features","computer vision","image parameters","sensory attributes"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060504277"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b9214","name":"Anita","lastName":"Zapałowska","uuid":"C964795FB4A1F7F38D18098518A272789AFE3C30D093C621FB31B21D3CB77837B33AC6E45945EDCCE6A30E9A5BA9A2EE44E864DA10A90298D30652B90F3880F4","orcidId":"0000-0003-4297-9854","documentHash":"d65460ed-d44b-48df-946c-cb180d677d3c"},{"objectId":"5e709350878c28a0473a70e9","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Kozacki","uuid":"A71F79FE71E57243D7F0E8913A863DA02E11E2D121CF0F2CA8D6A873C434B09D0905DF48A69167153CAF661C0DE7ED28C72E3EF92316C451EEE92251931C52FF","orcidId":"0000-0003-2847-2758","documentHash":"670d4628-dc31-46ee-a60e-1ab028e886a6"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047390fc6","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Skwiercz","uuid":"3D6D1165507901F580B3B6D5BE187D2F6B2FB4DB90B7B03E8E5E397AFF8ED61BC2B4D253505139A8C1D0A183E07C152527F686835FEE061A7C13FD513E239939","orcidId":"0000-0002-7008-5674","documentHash":"46dc8107-a99c-4e03-8bf9-83f7764581a4"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fa57","name":"Czesław","lastName":"Puchalski","uuid":"48A9D3645E6453E0D88B0B93081E2A47A8EA85C80F394FF00B2FE88C3F07C3AC1597E86C8AD8202506D2B049178D6B759B53F4C378EBDC237D2DED7581E77A34","orcidId":"0000-0001-5916-2678","documentHash":"7a0b2979-4837-40bc-bcb9-1a8ba26edd46"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-05-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66504b414097072d8656a35a","doi":"10.3390/su16103936","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/10/3936/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Employing Plant Parasitic Nematodes as an Indicator for Assessing Advancements in Landfill Remediation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This research concentrated on the soil nematode communities inhabiting a reclaimed municipal waste landfill situated in Giedlarowa, southeastern Poland. The landfill, which was layered with natural soil in 2008 and cultivated with grass, served as the primary focus of the study. Samples for analysis were taken four times (October 2020 (Pf1), March 2021 (Pf2), October 2021 (Pf3), and March 2022 (Pf4)), with each time comprising three repetitions. The analysis was conducted employing microscopic examination, which enabled the identification of up to five trophic groups and species of plant-parasitic nematodes. During the assessment of nematode activity in the initial and subsequent growing seasons, it was found that Pratylenchus crenatus emerged as the predominant species among herbivorous nematodes in the plant-parasitic nematode (PPNs) community. Criconemoides informis, another nematode species, held a significant rank as well; their population during the third growing season formed the most substantial group among the PPN organisms dwelling in the soil. Nevertheless, interesting results were also obtained by populations of nematodes of the genus Hemicyclophora and Loofia, which were characterized by high densities. The analyzed soil environment showcased a C:N ratio spanning from 0.69 to 3.13.

Phenotypic characteristics such as colony appearance, mycelium texture, and pigmentation were studied on four different agar media, i.e., potato dextrose agar (PDA), malt extract agar (MEA), Czapek-Dox yeast agar (CYA), and Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA), after eight days of incubation. Additionally, the growth rate of the tested isolates was studied depending on the pH of the medium. Fungal isolates showed the highest mycelial growth on MEA and SDA at pH 6.0. However, on CYA at pH 7.0, the mycelium exhibited the worst growth. Isolate identification and genetic relationship analysis were carried out using internal transcribed spacer region sequencing and the random amplified polymorphic DNA method. The research confirmed that all Polish isolates belong to the species H. perniciosus, and the genetic diversity is relatively low. Phylogenetic analyses revealed three subgroups of H. perniciosus isolates. The first group included three genetically distinct isolates with a similarity coefficient in the range of 0.76–0.85 to isolates CBS 815.73 and CBS 322.52. The second group was divided into two subgroups and included 16 isolates with a genetic similarity range of 0.91 to 1.0 to CBS 815.73 and CBS 322.52 isolates. Furthermore, the eight genetically similar isolates exhibited the greatest pathogenicity towards A. bisporus."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709295878c28a0473986a0","5e7094a5878c28a0473c0f41"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"32","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"79-88","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709295878c28a0473986a0","5e7094a5878c28a0473c0f41"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a045","mniswId":"24079","title":"Journal of Horticultural Research","issn":"2353-3978","eissn":"2300-5009","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"596f1c57-1935-4f15-a7dd-7e110090c068"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66950cbefdbe830e8643ea16","year":"2024","volume":"32","number":"1","documentHash":"27197df7-2cf1-4c50-8857-5e9ce54e800a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["RAPD analysis","Agaricus bisporus","wet bubble disease","fungal pathogen"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060514866"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b81d1","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Piotrowski","uuid":"4CFDB7878201C665E62723AE273DB828D5780884F21F676F1E9A000D9B74869B68981C7B8CAFBF8D67F9435C8D91D9C696ABD9A8D910A2F5A21C92B3CBF7B9D8","orcidId":"0000-0001-5787-9472","documentHash":"bc7bbf90-8fd1-4d1b-91b3-feb33cf56202"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c20","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Świechowski","uuid":"FF0BA4E7784FA80ED758B37EA60C2771D0C1A05E84BAED2D460AD6B64F789422BD95CAEB10B7280C48E75748451E27123B7055AB22D32419017BE9B76459955A","orcidId":"0000-0003-2318-6488","documentHash":"7974fb82-c16a-42d8-b614-0316e4bccb82"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4bed","name":"Monika","lastName":"Michalecka","uuid":"C4542F748AB90EAAE53D48D32DB2299EE413F85CB8C5165F0CEE9DE33455E3A6284B3B1369D30EDA7787A3F14A81BAC8F80A19C9D321DC7C75C0384BD8A75BD0","orcidId":"0000-0002-9875-4817","documentHash":"6f7a4b4a-295b-461c-98b7-62fae8ca7707"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397eaf","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Masny","uuid":"1F339AF20AD04B12026C56880F3C3B14CD67FDFBF04C4F0F747194E7FE88D355D5D8CC47EBDFB5327AC47237CF1139F5E348395AE3A6A14D01F3BCA771F5F703","orcidId":"0000-0002-6727-5653","documentHash":"1b781e37-8fe9-473e-8e62-0103934482ee"},{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a04739772e","name":"Artur","lastName":"Godyń","uuid":"E76A7FC2A22F096380F4D9C269B2CF14F2EA0C795154738137EF35963C57F0BA3B2FDE3269333F7432DEDA3FBE028D7ED1019FCC93168D8B48D0E29EC7EFDAF4","orcidId":"0000-0002-4479-0644","documentHash":"cd8e2a10-eb51-4b98-b27a-2fbb5027fa17"},{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a047397700","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Doruchowski","uuid":"5C41E9774906423BA3BDA3B4F54FFF2954E573AD13C5018F46302DAECDF954F40147C2728F5987A34BF47ED727634E01C68270F4509F60E3E044941DC69D32DC","orcidId":"0000-0002-4413-6474","documentHash":"cd1292fb-721f-40bb-bae1-b4331eb10742"},{"objectId":"5e70926c878c28a047395631","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Hołownicki","uuid":"5178226ECB732E150695E77E5E38BD97149D53FE69C272696A8EC2031F35A946FE9DF845A4A75ACB16BFBDEE29486AEF20876C90549749E408FD634596A7DD1D","orcidId":"0000-0001-8002-8959","documentHash":"ccc28972-c9b0-43fb-8825-de1082f8f10c"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-11-17","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"679a101dfdbe831aedcab173","doi":"10.2478/agriceng-2024-0018","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/agriceng-2024-0018","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The Effect of the Tunnel Spraying Technique and Nozzle Type on the Spray Deposit and Drift During Spray Application in Strawberries in Ground Cultivation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The measurements of spray deposit on filter paper samples attached to strawberry leaves and spray drift to the ground up to the distance of 7.5 m from the sprayed strawberry plants were performed. A multitunnel type tunnel sprayer (Klip Klap, Denmark) and an AGROLA mounted field crop sprayer with a 10 m boom were used. Four types of nozzles were used representing single- or double-jet flat-fan nozzles. The tracer (BSF) deposit on the upper leaves surfaces was generally higher for the field crop sprayer (14,775.0–23,205.5) than for the tunnel sprayer (6,189.4–12,417.7 ng·cm−2). The deposit on the lower surfaces of leaves was 1.9 to 18.0 times lower than on the upper surfaces and ranged from 540.6–1599.4 ng·cm−2 for the tunnel sprayer to 893.9–3007.1 ng·cm−2 for field crop sprayer.

However, selecting the appropriate proportions of both materials is crucial for each plant species. This study investigates the effects of different ratios of compost and peat mixtures on the growth and development of pepper seedlings. The compost mixtures used in the study included the following combinations: sewage sludge with sawdust (A), sewage sludge with sawdust and biodegradable garden/park waste (B), and biodegradable garden/park waste with sawdust (C). The final substrates used for seedling production were composed of composts (A, B, C) and peat (O) as a structural additive, mixed in different proportions by mass: I-O 25%, II-O 50%, and III-O 75%. Seedlings grown in these substrates were assessed using biometric and physiological measurements. Nematode species present in substrates were identified by metabarcoding analysis. The results revealed that substrate productivity depended not only on nutrient content but also on structural properties, which were significantly influenced by the peat proportion. Among the tested compost mixtures, variant A I emerged as the most effective substrate, promoting optimal seedling growth. Molecular nematode analysis revealed significant nematode contamination in substrates with higher peat proportions (C II and C III), including Meloidogyne sp. Lichtenburg (26%), Meloidogyne hispanica (5%), Meloidogyne sp. Mi_c1 (3%), Meloidogyne ethiopica (2%), and Meloidogyne thailandica (1%). The findings underscore the critical importance of achieving an optimal balance between nutrient content and structural properties in substrates to support the healthy growth and development of pepper seedlings. To further enhance crop performance and reduce the risk of pest-related damage, it is essential to prioritize the improvement of substrate selection strategies. Monitoring for nematode contamination is crucial to prevent potential compromises in seedling quality and overall productivity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047390fc6"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"26","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"442","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["677e3267fdbe8372a5e7f6ab","677e3267fdbe8372a5e7f6ac","5e70922b878c28a047390fc6","677e3267fdbe8372a5e7f6ad"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","issn":"1422-0067","eissn":"1422-0067","documentHash":"30236fd5-adc3-4b09-b2c8-6a106b437fa9"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"677e3267fdbe8372a5e7f6aa","year":"2025","volume":"26","number":"2","documentHash":"a9be0ad3-321c-4e19-b56d-a45c00588dda"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["horticultural substrates","chlorophyll content","plant biometrics","nematodes","Capsicum annuum"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060520256"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a04739869a","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Szczech","uuid":"A3F6BA8CCC15248DC0D39E88AC62E5BF02FF173D54AB3F56CB53E2A84AB45E49F99342A0D76261929DE63C9861320AC59AD73DF9EC0962B3C143340174D2A913","orcidId":"0000-0001-8408-6937","documentHash":"e56d9e6b-0823-4c77-8a93-856484628550"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397ea4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Lisek","uuid":"C38FF7CEE15417AD4CC38A70CE53F9A2560AE5D83DA50BC26F276FAF8784228713271870F15964508BC5C7EBD2E2300F98393D7F45D8360A6B078185F7CB312E","orcidId":"0000-0002-3421-8759","documentHash":"a5bd2572-1af0-4f84-8b9e-d52fcf895ac8"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d8c","name":"Beata","lastName":"Kowalska","uuid":"AC268809E10F36C97E1190B39B02F92242C2D71A3B251DFEA13F92C537FCCB250E08CF2F4A4484AFA01B2FF37B25F103BDF993379B9ED345177E4FFFF7B24C91","orcidId":"0000-0001-7067-3233","documentHash":"90f21013-2e89-4e8b-aaa1-2eb8a13faf5f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-07-25","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66b48294fdbe83691bc89665","doi":"10.3390/agriculture14081228","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/14/8/1228/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Inhibition of Botrytis cinerea and Escherichia coli by Lactic Acid Bacteria on Leafy Vegetables","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The evaluation of the potentiality of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains isolated from fermented products to inhibit Botrytis cinerea and Escherichia coli O157:H7 growth on spinach and lettuce was conducted.

Varied responses to climate change of species with different environmental preferences can be used to monitor different aspects of the environment. Since 2000, we have observed contrasting changes in the numbers of two related forest bird species, Goldcrest and Firecrest, monitored during autumn migration (14 August–1 November) over 1976–2024 by mist netting at 2 bird ringing stations on the Polish coast of the Baltic Sea. At both stations of the Operation Baltic project (Bukowo-Kopań and Mierzeja Wiślana), located ca 200 km apart, we observed a long-term decline in the number of Goldcrest since the 1980s but an increase in the number of Firecrest since the year 2000. These two species with ranges overlapping in Europe slightly differ in their preferences for breeding habitat and migration strategies. We found that in both species, the changes in migrating bird abundance in autumn at both stations were correlated with the Pan-European breeding population trends from the Pan-European Common Bird Monitoring Scheme (PECBMS) over 1982–2022. These correlations suggest that some Europe-wide factors underly these changes. Thus, we analyzed the effects of seven climate factors: the European Temperature Anomaly and the North Atlantic Oscillation Index in spring (March–April), summer (May–July) and autumn (October), and the Eurasian Snow Cover in October, on bird abundance indexes during breeding and autumn migration, using multiple regression models. Both species were more abundant during breeding and migration after warm springs, which conduce their early breeding and two broods per season, thus improving their breeding success. But with warm summers, Goldcrest were less abundant during breeding in Europe and on migration at Bukowo-Kopań. We attribute that pattern to Goldcrest’s tendency to overwinter in Scandinavia after warm summers. We suggest that this strategy became an ecological trap, as the climate change in Europe involves the increase of summer temperatures by 2 °C over the last 42 years but also earlier snow in October, which impedes Goldcrest’s feeding. These factors, combined with the decreasing proportion of coniferous forests in Scandinavia, which are Goldcrest’s main breeding habitat, assumably caused the species’ decline, which we expect to continue. Firecrest showed a weaker response to snow in October, but their autumn migration at both stations shifted earlier since the late 1980s, alleviating any effect of early winters. Warm spring and summers favor Firecrest abundance during breeding and migration. Firecrest also benefit from more broadleaf trees in Fennoscandia, thus we expect this species to expand its breeding range farther northeast and to continue the population increase. The change in forest management policy in Scandinavia by planting more broadleaf trees aims at increasing biodiversity and might considerably influence the forest environment. Thus, it is imperative to identify the methods suited for early detection of such changes. We showed that monitoring the numbers of migrating birds provides good indicators of the effects of short- and long-term environmental changes on bird populations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67aafd9bfdbe837dc7592dcc"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1243","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67aafd9bfdbe837dc7592dcc","67aafd9bfdbe837dc7592dcd"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff3f8ad49b31ccec0f80e","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","eissn":"2071-1050","documentHash":"4055bfb8-4fdb-408c-b314-7aa556a417fb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67aafd9bfdbe837dc7592dcb","year":"2025","volume":"17","number":"3","documentHash":"d2c4c82a-e491-4eb9-a70d-79cfe221a75e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["autumn migration","passerine birds","population size","migrating birds abundance index","breeding population","climate change","Baltic region"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060523618"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ropelewska","uuid":"E3575740307CA373F3BD454AAC58C202E1C2CA28B9FC90C6BC3006DB867893BEE70DFAC85C7D9667CD0ACB7837B8DF63F7D6636679B032F0F1E0E534A3F3CBD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8891-236X","documentHash":"e9d0e369-fc46-40fe-9cb3-5236d6ea38a0"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398d3c","name":"Jan","lastName":"Piecko","uuid":"D93B845F11898D39288E80412E7144384CBF4B52F99D5F14895BDA9F7728A41E39E4314B1B926B043A2D56FA8BADDB8ECB76C4560A10C660460F7645B8F56A24","orcidId":"0000-0001-6838-9364","documentHash":"d0c8e230-a87d-4417-9539-22b0874746e1"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d79","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Konopacka","uuid":"B86F354E1D172AB3FC07EC420A8D0C595C402A1BC9E7C127CE71483941E67A0E0E10A48F14A1D7C43CF67CB2C1F72A7762DAA4B85BA44FA7556DEC983B617982","orcidId":"0000-0001-8566-3337","documentHash":"b4797e68-8f49-44ed-a833-4b0c27dc3244"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65942c55409707394630945e","doi":"10.3390/agriculture14010054","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture14010054","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The Quality Assessment of Sour Cherries Dried Using an Innovative Simultaneous Osmotic–Microwave–Vacuum Approach Based on Image Textures, Color Parameters, and Sensory Attributes","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Sour cherries are a perishable raw material, and their preservation is needed to extend their availability to consumers.

Three sour cherry cultivars, ‘Nefris’, ‘Debreceni Botermo’, and ‘Łutówka’, were used in the experiment. Sour cherries were subjected to freezing and pit removal before drying. The simultaneous osmotic–microwave–vacuum drying was carried out in one process lasting an hour and combining osmotic dehydration using a 40 °Bx sucrose solution and microwave–vacuum drying at microwave powers of 100 W for 900 s, 300 W for 900 s, 250 W for 900 s, and 0 W for stabilization for 900 s and a pressure of 30 ± 2 hPa. After drying, the quality assessment of products was performed using non-destructive image analysis and color measurements, as well as sensory analysis, including non-destructively and destructively assessed attributes. The highest changes in textures occurred for the GHMean (histogram’s mean for color channel G) (from 30.69 to 22.64) and LHMean (histogram’s mean for color channel L) (from 66.93 to 59.07) of images of the cultivar ‘Łutówka’, and the smallest changes were found for the cultivar ‘Nefris’. Drying had a statistically significant effect on the color parameters of the ‘Debreceni Botermo’ and ‘Łutówka’ sour cherries. The value of ΔE was the highest (10.44) for ‘Debreceni Botermo’ and the smallest (1.98) for ‘Nefris’. All cultivars of dried sour cherries had very high values of overall quality, reaching 8.9 for ‘Nefris’ and ‘Debreceni Botermo’ and 8.8 for ‘Łutówka’. The ‘Nefris’ sour cherry was characterized by the highest value of flavor of 9.0. All dried samples were attractive in terms of their external appearance. The sensory parameters related to taste, texture, and crunchiness were also satisfactory. Innovative simultaneous osmotic–microwave–vacuum drying allowed for the obtainment of dried sour cherries with a high quality, including acceptable sensory attributes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929a878c28a047398d3c","5e70928e878c28a047397d79","5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"54","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","5e70928e878c28a047397d79","5e70929a878c28a047398d3c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d1","mniswId":"675","title":"Agriculture (Switzerland)","eissn":"2077-0472","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"fb8db9b6-d4d7-498a-b26c-2119c1ad43da"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6595624f40970740be90c508","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"1","documentHash":"4057d66d-4bd7-4775-86a9-754008a96140"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dried sour cherry","osmotic dehydration","microwave–vacuum drying","image analysis","color measurement","sensory analysis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060523948"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c23","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Trzewik","uuid":"D90C1CC0E3D83B2B2F1625FA9A565157E627A2F8323223BC45F4856253F9A5C521B1E693EDA380BA27885A8406155EF8FD57CE6A8284BCCC3A80B5B041839784","orcidId":"0000-0003-0378-5440","documentHash":"13bbbab7-04ee-4311-b6f2-c929ad4744a8"},{"objectId":"5e709291878c28a04739807d","name":"Teresa","lastName":"Orlikowska","uuid":"E3321DF347F156BD99D7393D81E9629713F1D205581788E63E901E0C5173ACB7C2C50005D08096CB24BF2B0FB226746A763D09FF4F633AE252E559D3D2B51A6E","orcidId":"0000-0002-0712-3690","documentHash":"a1c8c7df-8d79-47f8-b63c-96e8517cdb8a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-01-03","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"678e0d20fdbe8352f8606987","doi":"10.3390/f16010068","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/16/1/68/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Diagnostic Sensitivity of Phytophthora ×alni from Environmental Samples Using Conventional and Real-Time PCR","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The study aims to compare the sensitivity of conventional and real-time PCR in detecting Phytophthora ×alni DNA in plants, peat substrate, and water.

Plants","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A growing trend in plant protection is replacing chemical preparations with environmentally friendly biological compositions. Chitosan, due to its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and bioactivity, is an effective agent against plant diseases. The purpose of the study was to evaluate chitosan as a potential biopesticide for potato plants. Three variants of chitosan were tested: high (310–375 kDa, >75% deacetylated), medium (190–310 kDa, 75–85% deacetylated), and low (50–190 kDa, 75–85% deacetylated) molecular weight. The chitosan variants were dissolved in lactic and succinic acids and tested for antibacterial and antifungal properties against eight strains of mould and two strains of bacteria responsible for potato diseases. The possible cytotoxicity of chitosan was evaluated against different cell lines: insect Sf-9, human keratinocyte HaCaT, and human colon carcinoma Caco-2. The bioprotective activities of the chitosan were also evaluated in situ on potato tubers. Chitosan inhibited the growth of almost all the selected phytopathogens. The most active was medium molecular chitosan in lactic acid. This formula was characterized by low toxicity towards human cells and high toxicity towards Sf-9 cells. It was also found to have positive effects on the growth of stems and roots, gas exchange, and chlorophyll index in potato plants. Selected chitosan formulation was proposed as a functional biopesticide for potato protection against phytopathogens."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709269878c28a0473953d8","5e709269878c28a0473953d5","5e709334878c28a0473a4db8","5e709334878c28a0473a4d80"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928b878c28a047397912","5e70928b878c28a047397929"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","issue":"14","pagesFromTo":"3313","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709334878c28a0473a4db8","5e709269878c28a0473953d8","5e709334878c28a0473a4d80","5e709269878c28a0473953d5","6733360dfdbe8303499ba6ae","5e70928b878c28a047397929","5e70928b878c28a047397912"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","issn":"1420-3049","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"85ea3d3d-2670-4384-98ee-1b5b44edab21"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6697b7fafdbe83188068810c","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"19","number":"14","documentHash":"54c8e7b7-eb26-4e01-bfb9-ace46155c820"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["chitosan","potato,","biological contro","cytotoxicity"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060527361"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66b0c928fdbe83053572d063","name":"Seda","lastName":"Günaydın","documentHash":"1ae67d84-f1d3-446e-b7f8-5d0e4085e4cd"},{"objectId":"66b0c928fdbe83053572d062","name":"Necati","lastName":"Çetin","documentHash":"c8cf1c7c-7544-4bbc-b7a1-83a219e2e99b"},{"objectId":"64e0292840e3ff494b5b6395","name":"Younes","lastName":"NOUTFIA","uuid":"9422894A1FB76390BE453986DE472D41DDBF6D0423B404938A639BDCBE564E0D79B9884CF5463CFE1C63039683F6BAEF009A10493D98A400A8575E107EEEDCEC","orcidId":"0000-0003-3310-3260","documentHash":"10da4ab7-4fd1-4c2b-bff6-aaee587865c2"},{"objectId":"5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ropelewska","uuid":"E3575740307CA373F3BD454AAC58C202E1C2CA28B9FC90C6BC3006DB867893BEE70DFAC85C7D9667CD0ACB7837B8DF63F7D6636679B032F0F1E0E534A3F3CBD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8891-236X","documentHash":"e9d0e369-fc46-40fe-9cb3-5236d6ea38a0"}],"objectId":"66b0c928fdbe83053572d060","doi":"10.1016/j.foodcont.2024.110488","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0956713524002056?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Recognition performance of different artificial neural networks for distinguishing banana slices subjected to different combinations of pretreatment and microwave drying","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study was aimed at assessing the effect of microwave drying at 100, 200, or 300 W on the quality of Cavendish banana slices without pretreatment and with pretreatment using 5% ascorbic acid solution, 5% citric acid solution, 5% gum arabic solution, and ultrasound.

The classification models were developed based on image texture parameters selected from a big dataset of 2172 textures of images in different color channels using artificial neural networks. Wide Neural Network, Bilayered Neural Network, Medium Neural Network and three classifiers from the group of function, such as RBF (Radial basis function) Network, Multilayer Perceptron, and WiSARD were applied. Banana slices belonging to 15 classes with different combinations of pretreatment and microwave drying were distinguished with an average accuracy of up to 97.2% for a model built using Multilayer Perceptron.

The presence of fifteen derivatives of cyanidin, petunidin, and delphinidin was found. Changes in the content of each anthocyanin in the leaves before and after exposure to light on the abaxial (naturally upper) and adaxial (naturally lower) sides of the leaves were compared. When the adaxial side was exposed to light, the anthocyanin contents of the leaves did not change. In contrast, when the abaxial side of detached leaves was exposed to light, there was enhanced accumulation of delphinidin-rhamnoside-glucoside, cyanidin-rhamnoside-glucoside, cyanidin-glucoside-glucoside, and two unknown derivatives of petunidin and delphinidin. Application of methyl jasmonate (JA-Me) on the abaxial side exposed to light inhibited the accumulation of these anthocyanins. This effect could probably be due to the presence of these anthocyanins in the epidermal cells of K. blossfeldiana leaves and was visible in the microscopic view of its cross-section. These anthocyanins were directly exposed to JA-Me, leading to inhibition of their formation and/or accumulation. The lack of significant effects of JA-Me on anthocyanin mono- and tri-glycosides may indicate that they are mainly present in the mesophyll tissue of the

of soil microbiota to various soil management practices in 100-year-old agriculture field and identification of potential bacterial ecological indicator","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The study aimed to comprehensively investigate the structural dynamics of a soil microbial community within a 100-year agricultural field experiment. The experimental design encompasses three distinct soil management practices, namely monoculture, five–year rotation, and random rotation, each with or without the incorporation of legumes and manure. Soil microbial communities were determined by the Next-Generation Sequencing (Illumina MiSeq analysis) of both the V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene for bacteria and Archaea, as well as ITS1 for fungi. In all soils, dominant bacterial phyla were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Chloroflexi, and dominant orders were Actinomycetales, Rhizobiales, Acidimicrobiales, and Sphingomonadales. However, dominant fungal phyla were Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Zygomycota, and dominant fungal orders were Pleosporales, Eurotiales, Hypocreales, or Mortierellales. Compared to fallow land, agricultural soil management affected the microbial community of the soil, reducing the ratio of oligotrophs (e.g. Acidobacteria and Armatimonadetes) to copiotrophs (Actinobacteria or Gemmatimonadetes). Moreover, agricultural soil management contributed to an increased number of plant growth-promoting bacterial groups (PGPB), antagonistic to many fungal (e.g., Fusarium spp.) and bacterial pathogens (e.g., Bukholderiales, Xanthomonadales). However, generally in the study, there were no significant differences in microbial communities between monoculture and crop rotations. Moreover, two taxa can be considered as potential indicators of “healthy soil”: the nitrifying bacteria Nitrospira spp. whose abundance was strongly dependent on nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus, organic carbon, and soil pH, and the PGP fungi of the genus Mortierellla which depended mainly on nitrogen and pH. Finally, the genus Mortierellla was generally the most abundant in agricultural soils, especially in the five–year rotation with legumes, while fallow soils did not favour these microorganisms. In conclusion, various soil management practices strongly affect the soil microbiota and thus their ability to support land productivity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928f878c28a047397ea4","5e709292878c28a047398362"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918f878c28a04737e654","uid":"bcsJzMlD16IRLv2gmePak8w","uuid":"3ebee00c-2f73-43d5-bcbd-13c2d4d74ba4","name":"Instytut Ochrony Środowiska - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709259878c28a0473941b4"],"parentId":"5e70918f878c28a04737e654","parentUuid":"3ebee00c-2f73-43d5-bcbd-13c2d4d74ba4","rootId":"5e70918f878c28a04737e654","rootUuid":"3ebee00c-2f73-43d5-bcbd-13c2d4d74ba4","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"158","pagesFromTo":"111545","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659ff75040970707a130cf50","659ff75040970707a130cf51","659ff75040970707a130cf52","659ff75040970707a130cf53","5e709259878c28a0473941b4","659ff75040970707a130cf55","5e709292878c28a047398362","659ff75040970707a130cf56","5e70928f878c28a047397ea4","659ff75040970707a130cf57","659ff75040970707a130cf58","659ff75040970707a130cf59"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779f6","mniswId":"5322","title":"Ecological Indicators","issn":"1470-160X","eissn":"1470-160X","documentHash":"807f288a-7088-4fdc-9c91-78a88af56bcf"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"657024ca4097072aa090cce5","year":"2024","volume":"158","documentHash":"496b3ea5-7a57-4495-a076-ab36b147749c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["long-term soil use","microbial soil community","microbial indicators"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060533716"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6661a8d64097074fa1bd2bee","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Mikiciuk","documentHash":"d72ac2a2-8cee-450c-a292-897e9fea84bd"},{"objectId":"6661a8d64097074fa1bd2bed","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Tomaszewicz","documentHash":"952c0a9f-efb2-45fb-bd87-fe3aa97db203"},{"objectId":"6661a8d64097074fa1bd2bec","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Chudecka","documentHash":"0babf9bb-59cf-4e4a-be37-4ba20ab721cc"},{"objectId":"6661a8d64097074fa1bd2beb","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Mikiciuk","documentHash":"9b481265-7e09-4f52-b589-787135ea6a30"},{"objectId":"6661a8d64097074fa1bd2bea","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Paliwoda","documentHash":"3b1c8043-edca-4f9b-9f98-802dc707aaef"},{"objectId":"5e709413878c28a0473b5d23","name":"ANNA","lastName":"KISIEL","uuid":"0EB9A511C50ADEE7DFA6219959E780CCD75E53A3F216899399194A1282D0821A15CE63D620A3465CD1AF9C3749348F61DA56255BAE1CE3700837537CB45DB44D","orcidId":"0000-0002-1486-1093","documentHash":"89ed7aec-80f9-4516-afc8-454942d29a10"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b52b","name":"TYMOTEUSZ","lastName":"MILLER","uuid":"3E38728F3395592D39A2D5B4026A9FA7DAC2CF742021DB5E9C0101478AF272D682275107576EC79EAE12586C2EA5A6D54CE302DB924E47323F928FC3779B1F92","orcidId":"0000-0002-5962-5334","documentHash":"1a8f4cd1-f13e-40cb-801d-544fe08dd0ae"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398362","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Sas-Paszt","uuid":"F65BF0798F03691C5ACA3C2A1EA4E5FD87ED5CB37729DF32BC5DB47710F0EBA374AA8CB082C6E75E322B257742E90231A958EB8FE9204AC6F2B651D5DF6471FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-4076-4032","documentHash":"c4b1b795-a964-4309-87da-3ec6e5c5aacd"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"65980d0540970755be647374","doi":"10.3390/agriculture14010046","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/14/1/46/htm","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Effects of Inoculation with Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria on Chemical Composition of the Substrate and Nutrient Content in Strawberry Plants Growing in Different Water Conditions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Drought presents a critical challenge to global crop production, exacerbated by the effects of global warming. This study explores the role of rhizospheric bacteria (Bacillus, Pantoea, and Pseudomonas) in enhancing the drought resistance and nutrient absorption of strawberry plants. The experimental approach involved inoculating plant roots with various strains of rhizobacteria and assessing their impact under different water potential conditions in two substrates: optimal moisture and water deficit. The results showed significant changes in the nutrient content of strawberry plants, influenced by the type of bacterial strain and moisture conditions. Phosphorus and potassium content in the leaves varied considerably, with the highest levels observed in plants inoculated with specific bacterial strains under both optimal and water-deficit conditions. Similarly, calcium and magnesium content in the leaves also changed notably, depending on the bacterial strain and moisture level. The water deficit cluster, featuring the PJ1.1, DKB63, and DKB65 strains, showed PGPR’s role in maintaining nutrient availability and plant resilience. The study demonstrates that inoculation with PGPR can markedly influence the nutrient profile of strawberry plants. These findings underscore the potential of using rhizobacteria to enhance crop resilience and nutritional status, especially in the context of increasing drought conditions due to climate change."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f902","uid":"bk_n03ydqnhCQzeW0cj586g","uuid":"dae78b8a-6bdd-4a4c-aeba-e3409b15c413","name":"Instytut Nauk o Morzu i

fruit quality. One of the methods of maintaining high-quality fruit is using ecological preparations defined as biostimulants, which also eliminate the usage of pesticides and support a sustainable agriculture approach. The effectiveness of microbial preparations used as biostimulants was studied in our experiment. The use of preparations containing Bacillus subtilis and Paenibacillus polymyxa strains and bioactive substances (K4, K5 and K6) delayed the ripening processes of the Honeoye and Rumba strawberry, which resulted in a brighter colour of the skin as compared to the control (K1 I, K1 II). After applying the biopreparations, the taste was improved and the nutritional value of the strawberries increased. An average of a 14 % increase in the soluble solid content (SSC) content was observed for Honeoye strawberries treated with K4 and K6 and also the Vibrant variety treated with K6, compared to the control samples (K1 I, K1 II). The antioxidant capacity, which was determined in terms of the DPPH level in the three cultivars of the strawberries (Honeoye, Rumba and Vibrant) treated with the tested preparations, was similar and ranged between 83 and 90 %. The greatest differences in the content of antioxidants were found for anthocyanins, whose content increased by an average of 27 % in the Vibrant (K5, K6) and Rumba (K3, K5, K6) strawberries.

In addition, drought creates osmotic stress, affects the relationship between plants and water, reduces the amount of water in shoots, and prevents plant cell development and expansion. It is very important to search for a solution to minimize the effect of drought stress; therefore, the present study has investigated the effect of the application of humic acid (HA) at 0, 1 and 2 kg per tree and spraying of seaweed extract (SWE) at 0.2, 0.3 and 4% in combination with moringa leaf extract (MLE) at 2, 4 and 6%, respectively, on the productivity, fruit quality and nutritional status of navel orange cv. Washington during the 2022 and 2023 seasons. The results proved that the application of the biostimulants individually or in combination significantly positively changed the vegetative growth, productivity, fruit quality parameters and leaf mineral content of macro- and micronutrients of the treated trees compared to untreated trees. The superior treatments which gave the best results were 2 kg HA + 0.4% SWE + 6% MLE followed by 2 kg HA + 0.3% SWE + 4% MLE over the rest of the applied treatments."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398362"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"16","issue":"16","pagesFromTo":"7131","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66decc39fdbe832ef89c9367","5e709292878c28a047398362","66decc39fdbe832ef89c9368"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","eissn":"2071-1050","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"46882d20-8996-4dde-bd15-7d5f8ecc797a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66b46d8ffdbe83691bc75015","year":"2024","volume":"16","number":"16","documentHash":"bec63d20-1aab-4e9b-869d-7e0fa37f9c03"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Moringa oleifera","seaweed extract","fruit drop","nutritional status"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060538041"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66a23b69fdbe8372157739e0","name":"Walid F.

The examined genera are: Fusarium, Trichoderma, Verticillium, Purpureolicillium and Phytophthora. The proposed pipeline deals with unprocessed microscopic images, avoiding additional sample marking or coloration. The methodology includes several stages: image preprocessing, segmenting images to isolate microorganisms from the background, calculating features related to image color and texture for classification. Using an extensive dataset of 2866 images from the National Institute of Horticultural Research in Skierniewice the Extreme Learning Machine model was trained and validated. The model showcases high accuracy and computational efficiency compared to other Machine Learning state-of-the art methods e.g. CatBoost, Random Forest or Convolutional Neural Networks. Statistical techniques, including Multivariate Analysis of Variance were employed to confirm significant differences among the datasets, enhancing the model’s robustness. Nevertheless, Shapley Additive Explanations values provided transparency into the model’s decision-making process. This approach has the potential to improve early detection and management of soil pathogens, promoting sustainable agriculture and demonstrating machine learning’s potential in environmental monitoring, microbial ecology or industrial microbiology."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut

oral toxicity protocol for adult solitary bees (Osmia bicornis L.): Reduced survival under long-term exposure to a “bee-safe” insecticide","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Pollinators are essential for crop productivity. Yet, in agricultural areas, they may be threatened by pesticide exposure. Current pesticide risk assessments predominantly focus on honey bees, with a lack of standardized protocols for solitary bees. This study addresses this gap by developing a long-term oral exposure protocol tailored for O. bicornis. We conducted initial trials to determine optimal container sizes and feeding methods, ensuring high survival rates and accurate syrup consumption measurements. A validation test involving five laboratories was then conducted with the insecticide Flupyradifurone (FPF). Control mortality thresholds were set at ≤ 15% at 10 days. Three laboratories achieved ≤10%, demonstrating the protocol's effectiveness in maintaining healthy test populations. The seasonal timing of experiments influenced control mortality, underscoring the importance of aligning tests with the natural flight period of the population used. Our findings revealed dose-dependent effects of FPF on syrup consumption, showing stimulatory effects at lower concentrations and inhibitory effects at higher ones. The 10-day median lethal daily dose (LDD50) of FPF for O. bicornis (531.92 ng/bee/day) was 3.4-fold lower than that reported for Apis mellifera (1830 ng/bee/day), indicating Osmia's higher susceptibility. Unlike other insecticides, FPF did not exhibit time-reinforced toxicity. This study introduces a robust protocol for chronic pesticide exposure in solitary bees, addressing a critical gap in current risk assessment. Based on its low risk to honey bees and bumblebees, FPF is approved for application during flowering. However, our results suggest that it may threaten Osmia populations under realistic field conditions. Our findings underscore the need for comparative toxicity studies to ensure comprehensive protection of all pollinators and the importance of accounting for long term exposure scenarios in risk assessment. By enhancing our understanding of chronic pesticide effects in solitary bees, our study should contribute to the development of more effective conservation strategies and sustainable agricultural practices."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0eee","5eec31f47523404d1000ea2e","5e7092b1878c28a04739ada4"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"363","pagesFromTo":"125129","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6735ee51fdbe832943b1ece8","6735ee51fdbe832943b1ece9","6735ee51fdbe832943b1ecea","6735ee51fdbe832943b1eceb","6735ee51fdbe832943b1ecec","6735ee51fdbe832943b1eced","6735ee51fdbe832943b1ecee","6735ee51fdbe832943b1ecef","6735ee51fdbe832943b1ecf0","6735ee51fdbe832943b1ecf1","5e7092b1878c28a04739ada4","6735ee51fdbe832943b1ecf2","6735ee51fdbe832943b1ecf3","5eec31f47523404d1000ea2e","6735ee51fdbe832943b1ecf4","6735ee51fdbe832943b1ecf5","6735ee51fdbe832943b1ecf6","6735ee51fdbe832943b1ecf7","6735ee51fdbe832943b1ecf8","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0eee"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b0e","mniswId":"5835","title":"ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION","issn":"0269-7491","eissn":"1873-6424","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"feb1bcde-6ec7-4b98-9624-ea2e81646922"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"671f764bfdbe83222c578ac8","year":"2024","volume":"363","documentHash":"7a31d45a-c678-42ef-8e3c-f501185a4a88"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["chronic test flupyradifurone","syrup consumption","time-reinforced toxicity (TRT)"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060541677"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ropelewska","uuid":"E3575740307CA373F3BD454AAC58C202E1C2CA28B9FC90C6BC3006DB867893BEE70DFAC85C7D9667CD0ACB7837B8DF63F7D6636679B032F0F1E0E534A3F3CBD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8891-236X","documentHash":"e9d0e369-fc46-40fe-9cb3-5236d6ea38a0"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c2c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Wrzodak","uuid":"DD0902EC722F650D2557905DC36078794A03753014017DFA37805D32092EF1907648778A1814F55ABC2B1B2D4FE4EAE0B2D82D20ED3B546C9BDD9309E2D00A80","orcidId":"0000-0001-5472-888X","documentHash":"4ffe1343-e9dd-4148-8301-038630a669bd"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4a25","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Szwejda-Grzybowska","uuid":"E63ABDF6CE3F6DA4DB877DAFB373AC8EE21CAFC0CDFAAA0BFF10BB63F29FB6F9DBDAEE1496421B5EA36DCA1A7313AA64673821B8C5CD0E767B6D9491422289A1","orcidId":"0000-0002-1260-5897","documentHash":"d87c59fd-a8de-4484-bf37-2aa30009886e"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397ebc","name":"Monika","lastName":"Mieszczakowska-Frąc","uuid":"6900A32F634EF1531D8F8C6ACE07E99EB67DDA525F899A042C0F3631CBD6903E79CD1E6BC74E398C0CD9A37D077102F17EEBAC43BB98995342398DA2B165761C","orcidId":"0000-0001-8786-7990","documentHash":"beeb1f34-0cfd-4aa6-909a-19583be25118"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2025-02-15","releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":2,"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67bc7a1cfdbe833d4376bcb9","doi":"10.2478/aucft-2024-0012","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/aucft-2024-0012","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Determination of the Correlation Between Image Parameters and Chemical Properties of Red Sweet Bell Pepper During Fermentation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The objective of this study was to analyse the image textures and chemical characteristics of red sweet bell pepper samples during the lacto-fermentation process to determine the correlation between these parameters.

Ultrasound-assisted convective drying (CVUS) exhibited a 10% reduction in drying time and a distinct “heating effect”. Convective–microwave processes (CVMW1 and CVMW2) significantly reduced drying times (47% and 66%, respectively, compared to CV), raising concerns about potential deteriorative processes due to elevated temperatures. Numerical analysis, using the Midilli–Kucuk model, highlighted its robust fit and emphasized the influence of microwave and ultrasound on the effective diffusion coefficient. Quality assessment indicated enhancements in polyphenolic compounds, particularly in convective–microwave processes. The convective–microwave process at higher power (CVMW2) emerged as a balanced option, displaying improved kinetics, energy efficiency, and product quality. The findings underscore the potential of judiciously applying microwave and ultrasound technologies for significant energy reduction and process enhancement, with a recommendation for further exploration of new parameters.

The composition and diversity of the bacterial communities were differentially modified by living mulches. The activity of the bacterial microbiome associated with F. vesca was higher and utilized more C sources in comparison to other treatments. The combined analysis of the core bacterial microbiome and metabolic activity pointed to a potential effect of F. vesca on different levels of the soil’s trophic network. The living mulches did not affect the overall number of nematodes, but in some cases, they modified the structure of the population: F. vesca induced the highest share of bacteria feeders and the lowest number of herbivores and fungal feeders. The living mulches modified the availability of some nutrients and the pH. Multivariate analysis of the whole dataset showed several potential inter-dependencies between the assessed parameters that are worthy of further study. In conclusion, the introduction of multifunctional living mulches based on officinal plants induced changes to the soil’s genetic and functional biodiversity and chemical properties. These modifications could deliver ecosystem services particularly relevant to organic apple orchards."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709350878c28a0473a70e9","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75","5e70936e878c28a0473a95fc","5e70943c878c28a0473b8910"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"293","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70936e878c28a0473a95fc","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75","5e709350878c28a0473a70e9","5e70943c878c28a0473b8910"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d1","mniswId":"675","title":"Agriculture (Switzerland)","issn":"2077-0472","eissn":"2077-0472","documentHash":"f51997b3-f7b4-40a9-9013-a896e341e147"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"65ba0ed74097075661bd4ebb","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"2","documentHash":"7970d6bf-b83a-4593-be6b-2dba6440878b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Alchemilla vulgaris","Fragaria vesca","Mentha x piperita","soil bacteria","nematodes"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060569513"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6164f32875234017e0524937","name":"Oskar","lastName":"Basara","uuid":"F28776C5396E4C8DD8CFF8503C6193854679D7369890A8E371F6D0DFD947CCCC7F8EC3316C535018A640A6B76AD8A9E600776AD1AC7DC73E6B3186DD31B5FB1F","documentHash":"4a3ab3f7-b626-4417-9f8e-a4738a32ef20"},{"objectId":"602cb8d09543c7410626e252","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Belcar","uuid":"D5AC78AC0A3F3ADC421ACAA96100F5238CC58BC191ED65F55CAFEBB6F4786449BBD60F67B5B128D8D22794BBD6C84AAF2753D40BC57DB3D618F246DED583B2DC","documentHash":"849a9a87-3ef7-4297-bd2f-d6aeaebb9dec"},{"objectId":"5e7094a7878c28a0473c1102","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Seliga","uuid":"CACBC0870CB157C461F900A444A42A1003A1358653DCE690FA7817C97D022571577B326BF6A9F98C765F25CF1B1F866F7C72D013982E6B727B35707609E0105C","orcidId":"0000-0002-1687-5499","documentHash":"a328f130-9c53-44ef-83c5-c9f648366336"},{"objectId":"5e70946d878c28a0473bcd1c","name":"Miłosz","lastName":"Zardzewiały","uuid":"378F7F2E15AACBA514A5E7782EBE10624F771191C15ED8961B395C16D6111637A1DFD82B99B7B94ACAB81F764E38D15ADCEFC8336912DCE370BFE77AFC554B31","orcidId":"0000-0002-8843-2814","documentHash":"b6c709f0-7c11-495f-8af7-af3ef7bdec7e"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fb0d","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kuźniar","uuid":"5310745FF135420CBBBA3DC3DC0A9B461876DC47FE8FFB7E7E33EEDF1F950700D0447E6B67466B2CED8B4D7A56D7CBB776D02F65B1839B4F74E65D387474EC2F","orcidId":"0000-0002-6607-6636","documentHash":"86026043-b58b-44fa-a750-734bb1a01048"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fa6b","name":"Józef","lastName":"Gorzelany","uuid":"01AA9F188746F416312B40F1C61903D0DB1C4144CC8069253446F7F2341E4B3F345DAE0168357303756732B094D322130D378DF3447DFA99AB9A93B0B44ED399","orcidId":"0000-0002-1028-097X","documentHash":"8b812766-eba4-4169-880a-e829b2876f5f"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e669","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Pluta","uuid":"A389F119DF07BF98605FE425265C9D7AAFC056C945E0F9E7F5B4B226B0057BD6E8D3D999781461C4DD166DE67E1F1EED446BB62F6F662DA5A98F3DB3747DFCD6","orcidId":"0000-0003-2837-7304","documentHash":"c4cc3f4e-bb2b-4925-be1d-b7e627597a4a"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-09-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6703b9b5fdbe835ef8a3e40b","doi":"10.2478/aucft-2024-0002","publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/aucft-2024-0002","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The Influence of Gaseous Ozone Fumigation on the Chemical and Mechanical Properties of Highbush Blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.)

Fruits of highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) have strong antioxidant properties, they are recognised as one of the most valuable sources of health-promoting bioactive compounds. In the present study, changes in total acidity and pH of highbush blueberry fruit depended on ozonation and storage time and genotype. The total acidity of fresh blueberries of tested genotypes ranged from 0.59 - 0,90 g·100 g−1. The highest total acidity was recorded for clone ‘21’, which was ozonated for 15 min. It was found that the application of ozone gas during storage of V. corymbosum fruit had mainly positive effect on the content of analysed bioactive compounds. Results of our study showed that ascorbic acid content varied depending on genotype, storage time and ozonation. The average content of this antioxidant in the non-ozonated fresh fruit was 22.32 mg.100 g−1, and slightly decreased with ozonated 15 min and 30 min - 21.87 mg.100 g−1 and 21.95 mg.100 g−1, respectively. Average content of total phenolic in fruits subjected to ozonation for 30 min. and stored for 15 days was higher by 10.3% in a comparison to control sample (fresh fruits). The antioxidant values of DPPH and FRAP in fruits subjected to storage and ozonation for 30 min. increased by 22.6% and 15.5%, respectively. Using ozone had a minor positive effect on the measured mechanical properties of the fruits. Throughout the different storage periods of blueberry fruits, there was a decrease in destructive energy and an increase in force."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa -

To this end, we used a bi-parental segregating population grown for\n2 years at widely divergent latitudes (five European countries) and combined climatic variables with genomic data\n(Affymetrix SNP array). Examination, using different phenological models, of the response of FT to photoperiod, tem-\nperature, and global radiation indicated that temperature is the main driver of FT in strawberry. We next characterized\nin the segregating population the phenotypic plasticity of FT by using three statistical approaches that generated\nplasticity parameters including reaction norm parameters. We detected 25 FT QTLs summarized as 10 unique QTLs.\nMean values and plasticity parameter QTLs were co-localized in three of them, including the major 6D_M QTL whose\neffect is strongly modulated by temperature. The design and validation of a genetic marker for the 6D_M QTL offers\ngreat potential for breeding programs, for example selecting early-flowering strawberry varieties well adapted to dif-\nferent environmental conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928f878c28a047397eaf","5e70928b878c28a0473979a2"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66d58ff4fdbe8351d923e925","66d58ff4fdbe8351d923e926","66d58ff4fdbe8351d923e927","66d58ff4fdbe8351d923e928","66d58ff4fdbe8351d923e929","5e70928f878c28a047397eaf","66d58ff4fdbe8351d923e92a","66d58ff4fdbe8351d923e92b","66d58ff4fdbe8351d923e92c","5e70928b878c28a0473979a2","66d58ff4fdbe8351d923e92d","66d58ff4fdbe8351d923e92e","66d58ff4fdbe8351d923e92f","66d58ff4fdbe8351d923e930","66d58ff4fdbe8351d923e931"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454786b6","mniswId":"11049","title":"Journal of Experimental Botany","issn":"0022-0957","documentHash":"c6edaaf3-e526-4409-b0c3-e02642b9516d"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66b4b86afdbe83691bcd3b1d","year":"2024","documentHash":"980b3edd-50f8-411c-9dfc-a48a66d53bbc"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Genotype×environment interaction (G×E)","flowering time","phenotypic plasticity","QTL-by-environment interaction (QEI)","quantitative trait locus (QTL)","strawberry"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060573065"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67a460e5fdbe83300e87fdd4","name":"Sara","lastName":"Olszak","documentHash":"869323d2-8245-4118-9a7c-10c5108e5830"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0f26","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Jaśkiewicz","uuid":"C0D9549780CD069CC4F2CE17EE65809F8F48CF1B322DCD8DEFF88CEC6A30F799BCD760DA709D236F43B84E25DF4CDEDBF164EB982D05E7D7297368BD8297E7B7","orcidId":"0000-0002-4494-1991","documentHash":"c4ac94cf-1ec5-4e20-baf1-1228b9568799"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6671","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Sęk","uuid":"CCAE960E4B5A3A69DDEE2F39635DF15F9EF579E13343742110EB49EAF0414AAADC38748A3C9431284072BF860E5C797DE1A9E163F66130E93A074EF6DB262D73","orcidId":"0000-0002-6407-264X","documentHash":"ee047230-b858-4fad-9e82-bab447c123a5"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a04739869c","name":"Teresa","lastName":"Szczęsna","uuid":"300E2F3737F076AF1E9B69A4F7BDD295142517EB5353B60597E30DA6C97A72FA7EEA3D4A9E11F76E8721A2F7110D15A3B6072BE17AE36E76403021F09AD3589B","orcidId":"0000-0002-0161-0287","documentHash":"a9d2d9c6-07e5-4c84-b99a-f83bcc69e906"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-01-10","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67a460e5fdbe83300e87fdd3","doi":"10.3390/molecules30020256","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/2/256/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Preliminary Research on the Health-Promoting Value of Honeydew Honey Enriched with Bee Bread","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Since the imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body plays a significant role in the physiology of common, often dangerous diseases, an emphasis is placed on enriching the daily diet with compounds characterized by antioxidant activity. Good sources of natural antioxidants are bee products such as honey, bee pollen, bee bread and propolis, and the best path for introducing the latter products into the diet is mixing them with honey. However, the characteristics of bee product mixtures are not yet fully understood. Therefore, the aim of this study is to verify the health-promoting properties of a mixture of honeydew honey and multifloral bee bread. The profile of phenolic compounds, radical scavenging activity, total phenolic content, diastase number, and also proline and HMF content were determined. The obtained results indicated the improved health-promoting value of this mixture, as increases in radical scavenging activity (from 82.7 to 88.4%), in the total content of phenolic compounds (from 74.6 to 118.8 mg·100 g−1), and also in the proline content (from 64.0 to 95.5 mg·100 g−1) and diastase activity (from 22.6 to 38.8 Schade units) were observed when 5% of bee bread (w/w) was added. Moreover, the bee bread addition provided two important flavonoids to the honeydew honey, i.e., rutin and kaempferol."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6671","5e709295878c28a04739869c","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0f26"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"30","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"256","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a6671","67a460e5fdbe83300e87fdd4","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0f26","5e709295878c28a04739869c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":"10.3390/molecules","issn":"1420-3049","eissn":"1420-3049","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules","documentHash":"184d7608-03fd-4b64-ac86-b4321a9365f0"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"678a0841fdbe836e84907676","year":"2025","volume":"30","number":"2","documentHash":"1dd4dee5-ad72-44ad-adf7-71bdd0b0a27e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["honey","perga","bee product mixtures","oxidative stress","antioxidants","phenolic compounds"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060579417"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5eec31f47523404d1000ea2e","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Jachuła","uuid":"53D9EC0B80F8CE39263F5F1EE2D8B339894DC4A3233245366D89476CC68C59970463D9A9CE67166CB85C07A89102DBC41B63EB898B47A87BA6C5C3774403BD53","orcidId":"0000-0001-8949-776X","documentHash":"44c1042c-286f-4525-b681-c1fe501b4a57"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0f26","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Jaśkiewicz","uuid":"C0D9549780CD069CC4F2CE17EE65809F8F48CF1B322DCD8DEFF88CEC6A30F799BCD760DA709D236F43B84E25DF4CDEDBF164EB982D05E7D7297368BD8297E7B7","orcidId":"0000-0002-4494-1991","documentHash":"c4ac94cf-1ec5-4e20-baf1-1228b9568799"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a04739869c","name":"Teresa","lastName":"Szczęsna","uuid":"300E2F3737F076AF1E9B69A4F7BDD295142517EB5353B60597E30DA6C97A72FA7EEA3D4A9E11F76E8721A2F7110D15A3B6072BE17AE36E76403021F09AD3589B","orcidId":"0000-0002-0161-0287","documentHash":"a9d2d9c6-07e5-4c84-b99a-f83bcc69e906"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-01-17","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"678e2b6efdbe8352f865c70e","doi":"10.3390/molecules30020360","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/30/2/360/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"How Phenolic Compounds Profile and Antioxidant Activity Depend on Botanical Origin of Honey—A Case of Polish Varietal Honeys","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Honey contains natural biologically active compounds, and its preventive and healing properties are primarily linked to its antioxidant activity. The antioxidant properties of honey can be related to the botanical origin and content of phenolic compounds. We tested 84 honey samples from Poland, representing eight honey varieties: acacia, phacelia, buckwheat, linden, rapeseed, heather, goldenrod, and honeydew. High-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode-array detection (HPLC-DAD) was used to determine the phenolic compound composition of honey extracts. Total phenolic compounds (TPC) and DPPH radical-scavenging activity were also evaluated. We detected vanillin aldehyde, vanillic acid, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, and trans-ferulic acid, as well as flavonoid pinocembrin, in all honey varieties. The results of our study showed that honeys with high antioxidant activity were characterized by significantly higher total phenolic compounds content. Neither clustering method nor principal component analysis (PCA) showed clear separation of each honey variety, possibly due to high intra-variety diversities. We suppose that the variability of qualitative and quantitative phenolic compound composition within honey varieties may result from the region of origin, secondary nectar sources, and the time of harvest."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa -

Overall, results showed dissimilar effects of drying on the assessed quality attributes for each cultivar. COND increased significantly total polyphenols and flavonoid content as compared to fresh fruit and seems to have a stronger and nuanced effect on ‘Boufeggous’ than on ‘Mejhoul’ for the whole polyphenol profile. Whereas, INRD induced small changes. Additionally, the two drying techniques affected slightly and differently the content of glucose and fructose with a significant decrease of total sugars and glucose in infrared dried ‘Boufeggous’. Furthermore, a significant increase was observed for total soluble solids while water activity decreased significantly in the two cultivars upon convective and infrared drying. Acidity, pH, ash, and hardness seem to be more influenced by COND than INRD. For skin color, the browning index changed significantly and in an opposite manner for the two cultivars after drying. In contrast, the behavior of these cultivars under COND and INRD was complex with more influence of INRD on chroma, a∗ and b∗ features for both cultivars. The image features indicated the highest correctness level of discrimination between fresh and infrared dried fruit samples. X-ray images of fresh, convective-dried, and infrared-dried dates showed that the flesh structure/density depends on the cultivar and drying technique. Taken together, our findings highlight INRD and COND as promising drying techniques that can be employed in the processing and postharvest storage of date and food products."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398355","5e70928e878c28a047397d79","5e709400878c28a0473b4a25","5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","5e70928f878c28a047397ebc","64e0292840e3ff494b5b6395"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"218","pagesFromTo":"117502","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64e0292840e3ff494b5b6395","5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","5e709400878c28a0473b4a25","5e70928f878c28a047397ebc","67b5a966fdbe835419dd90c3","5e709292878c28a047398355","5e70928e878c28a047397d79"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d21","mniswId":"13782","title":"LWT Food Science and Technology","issn":"0023-6438","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/lwt-food-science-and-technology/","documentHash":"5be47d69-654c-44f4-86d7-97089df7c5db"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Phoenix dactylifera L.","Food preservation","Reducing sugars","X-ray","Color","Image processing"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060600810"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67bc7870fdbe833d4376a5b2","name":"Walid F.

Therefore, this study investigated the soil application of biochar individually or in combination with the spraying of boron, silicon, and molybdenum relative to the growth attributes, fruit drop percentages, yield, and fruit quality of Le Conte pear trees grown under drought stress. The trees were fertilized by biochar at 0, 1, and 2 kg per tree individually or in combination with the foliar spraying with 0 mg B2O3 + 0 mg SiO2 + 0 mg MoO2, 10 mg B2O3 + 25 mg SiO2 + 25 mg MoO2, 20 mg B2O3 + 50 mg SiO2 + 50 mg MoO2 and 30 mg B2O3 + 75 mg SiO2 + 75 mg MoO2 at start of February, start of March and start of April, compared to untreated trees (control). The results showed that the soil addition of biochar or spraying of nano fertilizers individually or in combinations improved the vegetive growth, productivity and fruit quality, and leaf mineral content, meanwhile they reduced the fruit drop. The best results were obtained by the application of 2 kg biochar combined with 30 mg B2O3 + 75 mg SiO2 + 75 mg MoO2, which was superior to other applied treatments in the two seasons."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709288878c28a04739774c"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"19","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"9131-9157","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67bc7870fdbe833d4376a5b0","5e709288878c28a04739774c","67bc7870fdbe833d4376a5b1","67bc7870fdbe833d4376a5b2"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477389","mniswId":"2528","title":"BioResources","issn":"1930-2126","eissn":"1930-2126","documentHash":"cc8ee234-9ca9-4942-ad81-227eb20b84af"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67bc7870fdbe833d4376a5af","year":"2024","volume":"19","number":"4","documentHash":"0ce999b5-f548-4c54-a2d8-32f320b330a4"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fruit drop","fruit quality","nutritional status","Pyrus communis"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060600972"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ropelewska","uuid":"E3575740307CA373F3BD454AAC58C202E1C2CA28B9FC90C6BC3006DB867893BEE70DFAC85C7D9667CD0ACB7837B8DF63F7D6636679B032F0F1E0E534A3F3CBD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8891-236X","documentHash":"e9d0e369-fc46-40fe-9cb3-5236d6ea38a0"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c2c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Wrzodak","uuid":"DD0902EC722F650D2557905DC36078794A03753014017DFA37805D32092EF1907648778A1814F55ABC2B1B2D4FE4EAE0B2D82D20ED3B546C9BDD9309E2D00A80","orcidId":"0000-0001-5472-888X","documentHash":"4ffe1343-e9dd-4148-8301-038630a669bd"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4a25","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Szwejda-Grzybowska","uuid":"E63ABDF6CE3F6DA4DB877DAFB373AC8EE21CAFC0CDFAAA0BFF10BB63F29FB6F9DBDAEE1496421B5EA36DCA1A7313AA64673821B8C5CD0E767B6D9491422289A1","orcidId":"0000-0002-1260-5897","documentHash":"d87c59fd-a8de-4484-bf37-2aa30009886e"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397ebc","name":"Monika","lastName":"Mieszczakowska-Frąc","uuid":"6900A32F634EF1531D8F8C6ACE07E99EB67DDA525F899A042C0F3631CBD6903E79CD1E6BC74E398C0CD9A37D077102F17EEBAC43BB98995342398DA2B165761C","orcidId":"0000-0001-8786-7990","documentHash":"beeb1f34-0cfd-4aa6-909a-19583be25118"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-10-22","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6729d4cafdbe837837670ddd","doi":"10.3390/agriculture14111855","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/14/11/1855/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Non-Destructive Monitoring of Sweet Pepper Samples After Selected Periods of Lacto-Fermentation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Fermented food is characterized by positive health-promoting properties.

The greatest losses in quantity and quality occur during storage, transport, and sale. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of irradiation on the quality and storability of the tomato ‘Tomimaru Muchoo’. Fruit harvested at the turning ripening stage were illuminated for the first two weeks at 15 °C with four visible LED light spectra, with different percentages of blue, green, and red light (BGR). The illumination times were 4 and 8 h per day (hpd). After illumination, the tomatoes were stored at 20 °C in the dark for 4 weeks. Immediately after 14 d of illumination, all tomatoes were fully ripe, although they showed varying red color intensity. In addition, all fruit retained very good quality and freshness. During further storage at 20 °C, there was a gradual decrease in tomato quality. However, LED lighting helped delay softening, reduce rotting, and thus maintain better tomato quality. Longer daily irradiation (8 h) delayed tomato senescence to a greater extent than shorter irradiation (4 hpd). Comparing the spectra, the greatest reduction in softening and rotting occurred in tomatoes illuminated with the spectrum containing the highest amount of blue light (56%). These tomatoes also maintained the lowest color index (a*/b*) throughout storage at 20 °C, which was especially evident in tomatoes that had been illuminated for 8 hpd. The light treatment influenced the maintenance of higher levels of ascorbic acid and antioxidant activity in tomatoes. However, irradiation did not increase the polyphenol content of tomatoes or reduce the lycopene levels in the fruit. Overall, the results showed that LED irradiation during storage improves storability and affects the health-promoting components of tomato fruit. It is a promising tool for reducing losses of horticultural produce."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709200878c28a04738e666","5e709400878c28a0473b4a25","5e70928f878c28a047397ebc","5e709288878c28a047397765"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"11","pagesFromTo":"2727","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709288878c28a047397765","5e709400878c28a0473b4a25","5e70928f878c28a047397ebc","5e709200878c28a04738e666"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d9","mniswId":"689","title":"Agronomy","issn":"2073-4395","eissn":"2073-4395","documentHash":"f748c34e-fa45-428e-abf2-7624cc5986fd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"672b04cffdbe83748a7780c9","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"11","documentHash":"47f02442-213d-4708-8340-1116a2689e68"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["light spectrum","illumination time","storage ability","color","nutritive value"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060603997"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4a25","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Szwejda-Grzybowska","uuid":"E63ABDF6CE3F6DA4DB877DAFB373AC8EE21CAFC0CDFAAA0BFF10BB63F29FB6F9DBDAEE1496421B5EA36DCA1A7313AA64673821B8C5CD0E767B6D9491422289A1","orcidId":"0000-0002-1260-5897","documentHash":"d87c59fd-a8de-4484-bf37-2aa30009886e"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398d3d","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Celejewska","uuid":"FDCEEB3A3398B14BA2A79A9E46B12524EF57B8799F2954826CEAF6338AF3CCDB2259D7964948A16AA9BC767315B198FB2DFA532ED4180DCDD48B0493550DC265","orcidId":"0000-0003-3113-3722","documentHash":"ad533844-fc78-4918-9077-788c72f4d6b9"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398d3c","name":"Jan","lastName":"Piecko","uuid":"D93B845F11898D39288E80412E7144384CBF4B52F99D5F14895BDA9F7728A41E39E4314B1B926B043A2D56FA8BADDB8ECB76C4560A10C660460F7645B8F56A24","orcidId":"0000-0001-6838-9364","documentHash":"d0c8e230-a87d-4417-9539-22b0874746e1"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397ebc","name":"Monika","lastName":"Mieszczakowska-Frąc","uuid":"6900A32F634EF1531D8F8C6ACE07E99EB67DDA525F899A042C0F3631CBD6903E79CD1E6BC74E398C0CD9A37D077102F17EEBAC43BB98995342398DA2B165761C","orcidId":"0000-0001-8786-7990","documentHash":"beeb1f34-0cfd-4aa6-909a-19583be25118"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-04-17","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"668500ccfdbe83043b5a36c1","doi":"10.3390/foods13081231","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/13/8/1231/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Impact of Ultrasound Pretreatment on Juice Yield and Bioactive Content in Juice Produced from Selected Berries Fruit","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the work was to investigate the effect of ultrasound application during juice pressing. The impact on pressing yield and extraction of bioactive compounds during production of juice from strawberry, blackcurrant and raspberry was evaluated. Juice pressing was carried out after four kinds of mash pretreatment. The tested objects were heated to 55 °C, treated by ultrasound, and/or macerated with an enzyme. The obtained juices were analyzed for the content of bioactive compounds and compared to the ‘Control’ sample, which was the juice pressed without any pretreatment. Although the results presented here do not conclusively show that enzymatic maceration can be completely replaced by the use of ultrasound, in the case of strawberry and raspberry fruit, juice yield after ultrasound treatment increased almost as much as after enzymatic maceration. Additionally, in the case of raspberry fruit, the antioxidant activity of the juice samples was definitely improved when ultrasound was used. The results from this experiment also showed that it is possible to separate the effect of temperature from the effect of mechanical and chemical actions in ultrasound treatment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929a878c28a047398d3d","5e709400878c28a0473b4a25","5e70928f878c28a047397ebc"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"13","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"1231","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929a878c28a047398d3c","5e70928f878c28a047397ebc","5e70929a878c28a047398d3d","5e709400878c28a0473b4a25"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"Foods","issn":"2304-8158","eissn":"2304-8158","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"827d8888-1217-4c9f-a068-b8a2e5756417"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"668500ccfdbe83043b5a36c2","year":"2024","volume":"13","number":"8","documentHash":"4bff2e3c-1649-42bd-ac3c-3e22efa25830"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ultrasound","strawberry","blackcurrant","raspberry","juice"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060604137"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"66b498b7fdbe83691bca6bfb","name":"Teresa","lastName":"Sabat","documentHash":"6c744e7e-cdf0-4ef3-960e-3b279fd7cd13"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c2c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Wrzodak","uuid":"DD0902EC722F650D2557905DC36078794A03753014017DFA37805D32092EF1907648778A1814F55ABC2B1B2D4FE4EAE0B2D82D20ED3B546C9BDD9309E2D00A80","orcidId":"0000-0001-5472-888X","documentHash":"4ffe1343-e9dd-4148-8301-038630a669bd"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a04739869a","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Szczech","uuid":"A3F6BA8CCC15248DC0D39E88AC62E5BF02FF173D54AB3F56CB53E2A84AB45E49F99342A0D76261929DE63C9861320AC59AD73DF9EC0962B3C143340174D2A913","orcidId":"0000-0001-8408-6937","documentHash":"e56d9e6b-0823-4c77-8a93-856484628550"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397ebc","name":"Monika","lastName":"Mieszczakowska-Frąc","uuid":"6900A32F634EF1531D8F8C6ACE07E99EB67DDA525F899A042C0F3631CBD6903E79CD1E6BC74E398C0CD9A37D077102F17EEBAC43BB98995342398DA2B165761C","orcidId":"0000-0001-8786-7990","documentHash":"beeb1f34-0cfd-4aa6-909a-19583be25118"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d8c","name":"Beata","lastName":"Kowalska","uuid":"AC268809E10F36C97E1190B39B02F92242C2D71A3B251DFEA13F92C537FCCB250E08CF2F4A4484AFA01B2FF37B25F103BDF993379B9ED345177E4FFFF7B24C91","orcidId":"0000-0001-7067-3233","documentHash":"90f21013-2e89-4e8b-aaa1-2eb8a13faf5f"},{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a047397765","name":"Maria","lastName":"Grzegorzewska","uuid":"99665ABAC00F950802E6670F85B681F1AF408CA66FB4950C0CA01608BECACF559B0132EF7266CAD7A7445218E9AF0156227B1E7AFE974836482DA2C088837CE2","orcidId":"0000-0003-4499-6404","documentHash":"50dac121-3170-4a81-b9df-409e6eabbe9f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-08-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66b498b7fdbe83691bca6bf9","doi":"10.3390/agriculture14081266","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/14/8/1266/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Addition of Fresh Herbs to Fresh-Cut Iceberg Lettuce: Impact on Quality and Storability","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this study was to develop ready-to-eat vegetable–herb mixes with high nutritional and sensory values as well as good storability. In this regard, the suitability of fresh herbs (peppermint, oregano, green basil, red basil, and parsley) was tested for their use in mixes with fresh-cut iceberg lettuce. Lettuce–herb mixtures were stored for 6 days at 5 °C. The reason for the decrease in the appearance of the salads was the browning of the cut surface of the lettuce, as well as discoloration on the cut herbs. Comparing the storage abilities of the cut herbs, red basil and parsley retained the best appearance for 6 d at 5 °C. A small addition of herbs to fresh-cut iceberg lettuce caused a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the contents of pro-health ingredients such as chlorophyll, carotenoids, L-ascorbic acid, and polyphenols in the mixes. There were large discrepancies in the sensory quality of the mixes, but the highest quality and consumer acceptance were found for salads with parsley (5% and 10%) and red basil (5%). After harvest, the fresh herbs were more contaminated by molds than the iceberg lettuce. Bacterial, yeast, and mold contamination increased during storage, but the rate of mold growth was much lower in the mixes with parsley compared to lettuce alone. In conclusion, the addition of parsley and mint contributed the most to the health-promoting and microbiological properties of iceberg lettuce salads. However, according to sensory evaluation, parsley and red basil contributed the most to improving the acceptability of the product in terms of best taste and shelf life."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709401878c28a0473b4c2c","5e709295878c28a04739869a","5e70928f878c28a047397ebc","5e709288878c28a047397765","5e70928e878c28a047397d8c"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"14","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"1266","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709288878c28a047397765","5e709295878c28a04739869a","5e70928e878c28a047397d8c","5e709401878c28a0473b4c2c","5e70928f878c28a047397ebc","66b498b7fdbe83691bca6bfb"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff51cad49b31ccec20409","title":"Agriculture-Basel.","issn":"2077-0472","eissn":"2077-0472","documentHash":"e83729bb-2c7e-4d10-bf08-89803637073b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66b498b7fdbe83691bca6bfa","year":"2024","volume":"14","number":"8","documentHash":"06dcfae0-d776-4970-94f5-750e12f09b9e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fresh-cut vegetables","fresh-cut herbs","nutritional value","storage ability","sensory quality","microbiological contamination"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060604445"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4a25","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Szwejda-Grzybowska","uuid":"E63ABDF6CE3F6DA4DB877DAFB373AC8EE21CAFC0CDFAAA0BFF10BB63F29FB6F9DBDAEE1496421B5EA36DCA1A7313AA64673821B8C5CD0E767B6D9491422289A1","orcidId":"0000-0002-1260-5897","documentHash":"d87c59fd-a8de-4484-bf37-2aa30009886e"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398d3d","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Celejewska","uuid":"FDCEEB3A3398B14BA2A79A9E46B12524EF57B8799F2954826CEAF6338AF3CCDB2259D7964948A16AA9BC767315B198FB2DFA532ED4180DCDD48B0493550DC265","orcidId":"0000-0003-3113-3722","documentHash":"ad533844-fc78-4918-9077-788c72f4d6b9"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398d3c","name":"Jan","lastName":"Piecko","uuid":"D93B845F11898D39288E80412E7144384CBF4B52F99D5F14895BDA9F7728A41E39E4314B1B926B043A2D56FA8BADDB8ECB76C4560A10C660460F7645B8F56A24","orcidId":"0000-0001-6838-9364","documentHash":"d0c8e230-a87d-4417-9539-22b0874746e1"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397ebc","name":"Monika","lastName":"Mieszczakowska-Frąc","uuid":"6900A32F634EF1531D8F8C6ACE07E99EB67DDA525F899A042C0F3631CBD6903E79CD1E6BC74E398C0CD9A37D077102F17EEBAC43BB98995342398DA2B165761C","orcidId":"0000-0001-8786-7990","documentHash":"beeb1f34-0cfd-4aa6-909a-19583be25118"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"OCTOBER","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"67a36bf2fdbe833baf148908","doi":"10.15193/zntj/2024/140/517","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.15193/zntj/2024/140/517","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"WPŁYW RODZAJU HOMOGENIZACJI NA WŁAŚCIWOŚCI REOLOGICZNE I ZAWARTOŚĆ ZWIĄZKÓW BIOAKTYWNYCH W MĘTNYM SOKU Z TRUSKAWEK","otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"THEEFFECT OFHOMOGENIZATION TYPE ON RHEOLOGICAL PROPERTIES AND CONTENT OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS IN CLOUDY STRAWBERRY JUICE"}],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Wprowadzenie.

Although both species accumulate PM, scientific interest has primarily focused on A. mellifera as a pollution indicator. This study directly compared the efficacy of honeybees and bumblebees as indicators of PM and its associated trace elements (TEs). Insects were collected from ecological and conventional apple orchards and underwent quantitative analysis of total PM, PM size fractions, and TEs. To establish an environmental context, plant samples and bee products were obtained from both plantations, and screened for PM and/or TEs. Bombus terrestris accumulated 191.3 μg total PM per individual, whereas A. mellifera accumulated 64 μg. Particular PM size fractions were also significantly more abundant on bumblebees. Accumulation patterns of total and large PM on bumblebees differed between the ecological and conventional orchards. Total PM accumulated by both species combined correlated strongly with the total PM covering apple tree foliage in the ecological orchard (r = 0.836) and with grass in the conventional orchard (r = 0.851). The amount of total PM accumulated by B. terrestris strongly correlated with the concentrations of Fe (r = 0.927) and Mn (r = 0.91) in this species. Accumulation of Fe by A. mellifera correlated with the content of this metal in pollen (r = 0.912) and bee bread (r = 0.91), whereas the reverse trend was found for Mo in bee bread (r = –0.912). The results indicate that B. terrestris is a more accurate pollution indicator, with potentially greater efficacy in more polluted areas. The observed differences are most likely attributed to the distinct morphology and behavior of the species."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0eee","5eec31f47523404d1000ea2e","5e7092b1878c28a04739ada4"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"vgae020","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["678e5870fdbe8352f869c91e","678e5870fdbe8352f869c91f","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0eee","5e7092b1878c28a04739ada4","5eec31f47523404d1000ea2e","678e5870fdbe8352f869c920"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b1b","mniswId":"5854","title":"ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY","issn":"0730-7268","metadataSource":"IMPORT","documentHash":"6e8f1bdf-4d22-4f6a-ab81-f91d2b7e3020"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"678e5870fdbe8352f869c91d","year":"2025","documentHash":"a39863ee-6045-447e-88a3-e7093dde7911"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ecological risk assessment","trace metals","terrestrial invertebrate toxicology","fate and transport","bioaccumulation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060618264"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a04739870d","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"6CC1C4D799791721CDD4A08073ABD28E696CCEDAADBE7AD17DF429F074E3CABF05F48BE0E47F6E1F7654F1421127740DD32AF05C6E4790E6F1EB6EFF4114903A","orcidId":"0000-0002-2505-2005","documentHash":"ddd623f2-a55c-4ec4-9216-2ffc49570a99"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2024-11-07","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"672de52dfdbe835022298e66","doi":"10.1007/s42729-024-02119-8","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42729-024-02119-8.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Responses of ‘Burlat’ Sweet Cherry Trees to Selenium Fertilisation under Low Soil Selenium Conditions","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Selenium (Se) malnutrition in humans primarily results from low soil Se availability. In this study, we examined the effects of soil application and preharvest Se sprays on the vegetative growth, yield response, Se nutrition, and fruit quality of ‘Burlat’ sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.) trees. Selenium was applied through (i) soil application at a rate of 250 g ha− 1 or 500 g ha− 1 in each season and in the first year of the study, respectively, and (ii) four preharvest sprays per season at a rate of 15 g ha− 1 spray− 1. Se sprays were applied with or without calcium chloride (CaCl2). Leaves from Se-fertilised trees contained more Se and had enhanced SPAD readings. However, the Se treatments did not affect tree growth and fruit yield. Compared to the control fruit, Se concentrations in fruit from trees sprayed with Se and CaCl2, trees sprayed with Se alone, and trees supplied with Se to the soil were increased 15-, 12-, and 8-fold, respectively. None of the Se treatments affected fruit size, and acidity and the soluble solids concentration (SSC) of the fruit. Only the combined sprays of Se and CaCl2 decreased the incidence of rain-induced fruit cracking. None of the tested Se treatments resulted in leaf injuries. In sweet cherry orchards, at least for the ‘Burlat’ variety, grown in low Se soils, preharvest Se sprays with or without CaCl2 can be recommended to biofortify the fruit with Se and increase SSC in the fruit."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa -

Embryogenic cell suspensions may provide both raw material for secondary metabolite extraction and somatic embryos (SE), protoplasts, and cells for plant biotechnology. Their cultures can be maintained for a long time with cryopreservation. Encapsulation-dehydration has been reported as a reliable technique for preserving the viability and recovery of embryogenic cells. Nonetheless, the elevated sucrose concentrations in the culture medium during preculture and dehydration may alter the embryogenic competence of cells, their genetic stability and metabolite biosynthesis. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of sucrose concentrations in the medium and cryopreservation on the growth kinetics, embryogenic potential and secondary metabolite production of cotyledon-derived cell suspensions of Gentiana capitata and Gentiana decumbens. The growth kinetics, the number of SE regenerated, and the 2 C DNA content were assessed for cell suspensions cultured on liquid Murashige and Skoog medium with 3% and 6% sucrose, either encapsulated in calcium alginate or non-encapsulated, either cryopreserved via encapsulation-dehydration or non-cryopreserved. The secondary metabolites were analyzed using UHPLC-DAD-IT-MS/MS. The biomass growth rate was always higher on medium with 3% sucrose than on medium with 6% sucrose irrespective of the gentian species, with the maximum growth rate of 146 ±7% for G. capitata and 116 ±22% for G. decumbens at 4 weeks. The growth rate of suspension culture from cryopreserved plant material was always lower and after 4 weeks being 28±5% and 33±3% for G. capitata and G. decumbens, respectively. Prior to encapsulation the SE productivity of G. capitata cell suspension was on average 7.5 times greater than that of G. decumbens for cultures from medium with 3% of sucrose and on average 4.6 times greater for cultures from medium with 6% sucrose. In both species cell suspensions cultured on medium with 6% of sucrose produced more somatic embryos (3.7±0.6 and 0.8±0.2 per 50 mg of cell suspension of G. capitata and G. decumbens, respectively) than those from MS3 medium (3.0±0.7 and 0.4±0.2 per 50 mg cell suspension of G. capitata and G. decumbens, respectively). Variation in the 2C DNA content was detected in G. decumbens tissues treated with higher sucrose concentrations. The secondary metabolite composition in cell suspensions differed from that in plants grown in vitro. Cell aggregate extracts did not include secoiridoids typical of Gentianaceae, but some benzophenone and isovitexin derivatives (flavonoids) previously undetected in these species."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398339"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","uid":"bmfkTgrYux51kKuOA70Q27Q","uuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","name":"Instytut Hodowli i Aklimatyzacji Roślin - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af851"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","parentUuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","rootUuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"212","pagesFromTo":"118349","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6603cfb74097072a77fa1811","6603cfb74097072a77fa1812","5e7093b5878c28a0473af851","6603cfb74097072a77fa1814","6603cfb74097072a77fa1815","5e709292878c28a047398339","6603cfb74097072a77fa1816"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780a6","mniswId":"8251","title":"Industrial Crops and Products","issn":"0926-6690","eissn":"0926-6690","documentHash":"d6fc1395-6854-49a3-a8b6-440ec66188ee"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6603cfb74097072a77fa1810","year":"2024","volume":"212","documentHash":"3fa1f53f-4cee-4f42-9631-d973c5691a43"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["benzophenone-3 derivative","DNA content","embryogenic potential","embryogenic","somatic embryo","secondary metabolite","qualitative fingerprint"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060659218"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67bc72c6fdbe833d437633f3","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Nowicki","documentHash":"d0c666a7-1c93-4418-ac8f-290974575367"},{"objectId":"5e7094a5878c28a0473c0f41","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Szczechura","uuid":"48D797CC6B4AD1EF5CEF54ABFC93FBE58FF68C34EE25D286A435374B99F644D480D84D0D12C6590FB895089AF44697FD3D64ECD1684D2BAAD97E086380D66A4C","orcidId":"0000-0002-9184-1790","documentHash":"b4f14a05-722c-473a-ac55-da90bff017c9"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c2e","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"A2B49DD05D2FC4275519F9F1E9891DE97310FF25C96A971233122CEFCED42F5071913FEAE6767BD75780A65CFF3912F6DB744ADA7E8EE2D3434D23CEA0FD2520","orcidId":"0000-0002-6079-9745","documentHash":"810a5685-6b49-4740-b70c-1a87eac9bde9"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c07","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Nowakowska","uuid":"F00630A48446DD9BE883474C571859E8745EA9A04E6EE9DDDB7C85E9AC275BD31BAA13149867462BD059A29A909A3ED931DF8DF10E3B5A614E8D2F579D349864","orcidId":"0000-0002-6825-7756","documentHash":"ca996a74-794d-4ada-b146-eb8433549979"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a047397975","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kamiński","uuid":"E9F44EC1380F12AD1DE04ECB73794FF24275BC44AD3C6BF4680147EB45EF8116C31A19B53EBB4F957595F3EB7E997B4461AD0DD5ED77A6B4C1E265925A237CC3","orcidId":"0000-0002-6954-6197","documentHash":"c53c2a2c-1797-4d68-826c-ea9a403e3051"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-02-07","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67bc72c6fdbe833d437633f2","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0318753","publicUri":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318753","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Seed priming and abiotic stress tolerance in carrot: Unraveling the mechanisms of improved germination","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Climate change necessitates the development of improved crops capable of withstanding future weather patterns. Carrots (Daucus carota L.), a crucial vegetable crop of global importance, face unique challenges in seed germination and seedling development due to their complex pollination biology and outcrossing reproduction mode with severe inbreeding depression if selfed. This study investigated the effects of salinity and drought stress on carrot seed germination and seedling development, with focus on the roles of seed priming, cellular processes inhibitors, and biochemical responses. Seed priming agents were hypothesized to enhance stress tolerance by modulating specific cellular and biochemical pathways, such as improving osmotic balance, enhancing antioxidant defense mechanisms, and activating stress-responsive genes. We also hypothesized that specific cellular processes and biochemical pathways influence the germination and early seedling growth of carrot seeds under salinity or drought stress. To test that hypothesis, we evaluated the effects of seed priming with various agents (e.g., water, NaCl, PEG, GA3) on germination rates and seedling vigor. Additionally, we investigated the impact of inhibitors (actinomycin D—inhibitor of transcription, cycloheximide—inhibitor of translation, hydroxyurea—inhibitor of DNA synthesis, cytochalasin—inhibitor of actin polymerization) on seed germination under stress conditions. Biochemical responses, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and antioxidant enzyme activities, were analyzed to identify genotype-specific adaptations indicative of stress tolerance. Our results revealed significant variability in germination rates and seedling growth among the studied carrot experimental lines and commercial cultivars under salinity or drought stress Seed priming enhanced germination and seedling vigor by up to 35% under salinity stress and 28% under drought stress, with notable differences observed across the priming agents. The application of inhibitors highlighted the involvement of specific cellular processes in regulation of seed germination under stress. For instance, actinomycin D reduced germination by 40% under salinity stress. Biochemical analyses indicated genotype-specific responses, with variations in ROS levels and antioxidant enzyme activities such as superoxide dismutase and peroxidase. ROS levels increased by 50% under drought stress, whereas antioxidant enzyme activities varied substantially among genotypes. These findings underscored the importance of genotype-specific adaptations in conferring salinity or drought tolerance in carrot seedlings. Future research integrating omics approaches (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) will provide deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate stress tolerance, to aid in the development of more resilient carrot varieties suitable for cultivation under adverse environmental conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928b878c28a047397975","5e709401878c28a0473b4c07","5e7094a5878c28a0473c0f41"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"20","issue":"2","pagesFromTo":"e0318753","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67bc72c6fdbe833d437633f3","5e709401878c28a0473b4c07","5e7094a5878c28a0473c0f41","5e70928b878c28a047397975","5e709401878c28a0473b4c2e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792e9","mniswId":"16243","title":"PLoS ONE","issn":"1932-6203","eissn":"1932-6203","documentHash":"fcfcc06e-e7b2-4412-a89f-df94326b9f49"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67ac8433fdbe8304dc017a60","year":"2025","volume":"20","number":"2","documentHash":"2d02854b-90f5-4484-8415-bf7b712d9c66"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060678710"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c2c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Wrzodak","uuid":"DD0902EC722F650D2557905DC36078794A03753014017DFA37805D32092EF1907648778A1814F55ABC2B1B2D4FE4EAE0B2D82D20ED3B546C9BDD9309E2D00A80","orcidId":"0000-0001-5472-888X","documentHash":"4ffe1343-e9dd-4148-8301-038630a669bd"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d8c","name":"Beata","lastName":"Kowalska","uuid":"AC268809E10F36C97E1190B39B02F92242C2D71A3B251DFEA13F92C537FCCB250E08CF2F4A4484AFA01B2FF37B25F103BDF993379B9ED345177E4FFFF7B24C91","orcidId":"0000-0001-7067-3233","documentHash":"90f21013-2e89-4e8b-aaa1-2eb8a13faf5f"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-02-08","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67bc7ceefdbe833d43771d10","doi":"10.3390/su17041385","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/4/1385/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Application Potential of Lactic Acid Bacteria in Horticultural Production","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are found on the surface of some plants, forming their natural microbiome, and are especially common in fermented plant products. They are microorganisms capable of performing lactic fermentation, during which they utilize carbohydrates and produce lactic acid. They are considered probiotic microorganisms. LAB are characterized by strong antagonistic activity against other microorganisms. The mechanism of action of these bacteria is mainly based on the production of substances with strong antimicrobial activity. Some strains of LAB also inhibit the secretion of mycotoxins by mold fungi or have the ability to eliminate them from the environment. With the changing climate and the need for plants to adapt to new, often stressful climatic conditions, the use of LAB in crops may offer a promising solution. These bacteria stimulate plant resistance to abiotic factors, i.e., drought and extreme temperatures. Research has also shown the ability of LAB to extend the storage life of fruits and vegetables. These bacteria reduce the number of unfavorable microorganisms that contaminate plant products and cause their spoilage. They also have a negative effect on human pathogenic bacteria, which can contaminate plant products and cause food poisoning in humans. When applied as an edible coating on leaves or fruits, LAB protect vegetables and fruits from microbial contamination; moreover, these vegetables and fruits can be served as carriers of probiotic bacteria that benefit human health. The presented properties of LAB predispose them to practical use, especially as components of biological plant protection products, growth biostimulants, and microbial fertilizer products. They have great potential to replace some agrochemicals and can be used as a safe component of biofertilizers and plant protection formulations for increasing plant resilience, crop productivity, and quality. The use of LAB is in line with the aims and objectives of sustainable horticulture. However, there are some limitations and gaps which should be considered before application, particularly regarding efficient and effective formulations and transfer of antibiotic resistance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709401878c28a0473b4c2c","5e70928e878c28a047397d8c"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"1385","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928e878c28a047397d8c","5e709401878c28a0473b4c2c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff3f8ad49b31ccec0f80e","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","eissn":"2071-1050","documentHash":"4055bfb8-4fdb-408c-b314-7aa556a417fb"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67bc7ceefdbe833d43771d11","year":"2025","volume":"17","number":"4","documentHash":"26d19c16-4e75-41d3-ae68-9b6960f992ab"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biocontrol","biostimulants","edible coating","waste degradation","antibiotic resistance"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060712202"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c29","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Węgrzynowicz","uuid":"F0EC0A33FC1089F8BC24079E4F8F63D5FA3E2A41F88FB1EA2D89786942798FB734761AD2A497EF3D2ED06947FA7A326C052129FC542E7EF75A7E8131F9F741A4","orcidId":"0000-0002-5596-1410","documentHash":"780ef193-9e2b-4211-9629-1473dda002a3"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d71","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Kołtowski","uuid":"D0E8C81FCEB52113248EFE7E87761ED50E9447DECDF333C0325E472F733FD4E2B7DD3BE6236031ED1CD0E350BDEE3DD2B02A4C6280D198BA6EA28BF0E4EAF5EF","orcidId":"0000-0002-7186-0310","documentHash":"fd4648b7-9ed9-428b-ac5a-fe93e2a1fda6"},{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a047397728","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Gerula","uuid":"4ABABC7D59C8C69802D542E9A6DCE42CCD5DECB8EFADC592B66593D2EE137FB68AAAF4D54DF5C1D25D0C438CF65BF35EF1051FE4CC68E16B52B0B697896B0467","orcidId":"0000-0003-3875-2657","documentHash":"3c4b5471-6a84-43e3-862c-b355d7c5d16e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-02-24","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67c82560fdbe83551ec07b7f","doi":"10.3390/app15052431","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/15/5/2431/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Comparative Analysis of Urban and Rural Ecosystems in the Context of Suitability for Honeybees","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The present study set out to compare the performance of honeybees maintained in urban and agricultural environments across various regions in Poland. A range of measurements and observations were used to assess overwintering, development, strength, swarming behaviour, honey yield, and Varroa destructor infestation in bee colonies in five towns and five surrounding villages. The rural apiaries were located 4.5–39.5 km away from the urban apiaries. The colonies were kept in wooden Dadant hives and were led by Apis mellifera carnica queens. The brood count and colony strength were assessed based on the Liebefeld method, while Varroa destructor infestation levels in the colonies were determined using icing sugar at the end of July. The urban apiaries exhibited significantly higher brood-rearing dynamics. Consequently, an increase in brood count in spring resulted in a significant increase in Varroa infestation levels in summer. In certain regions, urban apiaries exhibited higher honey production, though this was influenced by geographic location and the availability of bee forage. The significant variation in most traits, including honey production, was observed depending on the region. Variations between years in the study were observed in bee colonies overwintering, brood numbers in the pre-spring period, and bee population in summer. This may suggest the presence of differing weather conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709288878c28a047397728","5e709401878c28a0473b4c29","5e70928e878c28a047397d71"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"5","pagesFromTo":"2431","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709288878c28a047397728","5e709401878c28a0473b4c29","5e70928e878c28a047397d71"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff33dad49b31ccec0104f","title":"Applied Sciences","issn":"2076-3417","eissn":"2076-3417","documentHash":"96f827ef-c2c8-4b76-ab17-c7357fffee4e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67c58a9cfdbe8365657e85eb","year":"2025","volume":"15","number":"5","documentHash":"ff045d6b-214f-4e94-b6d3-02c4b42aaeae"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["urban beekeeping","rural beekeeping","environmental impact","Apis mellifera carnica","honey yield","brood growth dynamics","Varroa infestation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060725620"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"674716c5fdbe832bc28da4ad","name":"Marian","lastName":"Saniewski","documentHash":"807f4e0e-b7d7-4b4c-9b85-26ee456ed318"},{"objectId":"60c33d8b9543c7233654421a","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Kaszubski","uuid":"169C019E6F6F43FB8B61DCDDB101012621DCF799A0973369D4B843DD31EA6B979E0EE627E47807600128A6A855B3B8831FC90F4F969A80354AFBBA4D329CCA76","documentHash":"2536c670-b0a9-437c-8a3a-f9442dcba29b"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Marasek-Ciołakowska","uuid":"6FAB3AE6D9EBCFA4FD26AA8B3CD63FA73B99A6498DEF6A1770D2A9643E68A306803F24C467726C9A84745750C9B2D96EDD4F279404023C905B13853E9A49233F","orcidId":"0000-0001-9349-2566","documentHash":"1c86d2dd-6830-448a-8df1-57210e29a74d"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7db9","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Wiczkowski","uuid":"A445B60E2C80F5319C08EF716E136CD876DC26A2A64B90215992326CEC3E88C747A494DD05BCE2A7CEB5F7E02C4FB6FA78E34EA5D616429F09576334B9B3ED03","documentHash":"5674033e-a108-4b65-93d8-84a69c4a35e7"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c25","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Szawara-Nowak","uuid":"B0BD2E293A5F29396A1B3C26F7CF06A1AF7F116A444CB00806BCC84D03C9337F9C81DF1004642415E197D4EEE378DC5D7D366F60A88301E6B0C2BBC16D3348F4","documentHash":"ea32c4ef-c83e-4530-be19-08fd152a473f"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4af1","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Góraj-Koniarska","uuid":"9FC40A1F1A091811F5417DDDC0A27F9D6E4A7EBB7061A55729BDF382AC1C4764ACC6D5ECDCECC86E5F3AF92A60C7C453705F203CC84916CE364E17F25BA5DC27","orcidId":"0000-0001-7667-0279","documentHash":"2201bd21-407f-41c6-b322-bf2d514266ed"},{"objectId":"5e709294878c28a047398513","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Mitrus","uuid":"730316746E06CF1084C65ACE6B8C9133C06A987324A7E1B14927EFB1BD40DAA4C4A9757BA0750D2B58F1A9AFD3E4E065D71246755B2AB007F7F169478E2B0B0C","orcidId":"0000-0001-8000-5167","documentHash":"51ad3f4c-fdf0-4231-9c63-7a6e01d896ec"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390822","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Horbowicz","uuid":"607EF236052A333800DE056FB5A49C78E0BD32EA3C4E508F9FB7ED235589344FC6C4F33BB9310E91A5B461AF27BB59D282084C55F508C78931D9721F2D7A9019","orcidId":"0000-0002-1789-4034","documentHash":"49a74256-9b3b-4181-8fc7-f7c0367507c3"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-11-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"674716c5fdbe832bc28da4a7","doi":"10.3390/molecules29225410","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/29/22/5410","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Effect of Fluridone on Roots and Leaf Buds Development in Stem Cuttings of Salix babylonica (L.) ‘Tortuosa’ and Related Metabolic and Physiological Traits","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The herbicide fluridone (1-methyl-3-phenyl-5-[3-trifluoromethyl (phenyl)]-4(1H)-pyridone) interferes with carotenoid biosynthesis in plants by inhibiting the conversion of phytoene to phytofluene. Fluridone also indirectly inhibits the biosynthesis of abscisic acid and strigolactones, and therefore, our study indirectly addresses the effect of reduced ABA on the roots and leaf buds development in stem cuttings of Salix babylonica L. ‘Tortuosa’. The stem cuttings were kept in distilled water (control) or in a solution of fluridone (10 mg/L) in natural greenhouse light and temperature conditions. During the experiments, morphological observations were carried out on developing roots and leaf buds, as well as their appearance and growth. After three weeks of continuous treatments, adventitious roots and leaf buds were collected and analysed. Identification and analysis of anthocyanins were carried out using micro-HPLC-MS/MS-TOF, while HPLC-MS/MS was used to analyse phenolic acids, flavonoids and salicinoids. The fluridone applied significantly inhibited root growth, but the number or density of roots was higher compared to the control. Contents of salicortin and salicin were several dozen times higher in leaf buds than in roots of willow. Fluridone increased the content of salicortin in roots and leaf buds and declined the level of salicin in buds. Fluridone also declined the content of most anthocyanins in roots but enhanced their content in buds, especially cyanidin glucoside, cyanidin galactoside and cyanidin rutinoside. Besides, fluridone markedly decreased the level of chlorophylls and carotenoids in the leaf buds. The results indicate that applied fluridone solution reduced root growth, caused bleaching of leaf buds, and markedly affected the content of secondary metabolites in the adventitious roots and leaf buds of S. babylonica stem cuttings. The paper presents and discusses in detail the significance of fluridone’s effects on physiological processes and secondary metabolism."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","uid":"bz_6XXECFL3_CFkpms5BsDQ","uuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","name":"Uniwersytet w Siedlcach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709294878c28a047398513"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","parentUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","rootUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709224878c28a047390822"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709430878c28a0473b7db9","60c33d8b9543c7233654421a","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c25"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa -

NPA substantially induced stem swelling at and above the application site and sti-mulated vascular cambium activity around the area of its application. The cambial zone in the swelling part of the stem was twice as wide as that treated with lanolin only (control). The proliferation of cambial cells increased xylem production and, consequently, vascular bundle thickness. A significant enlargement of parenchymatous pith cells and an increased diameter of the pith were also observed. Comprehensive phytohormone analyses revealed that NPA increased the content of indole-3-propionic acid, indole-3-acetic acid, and indole-3-acetyl-aspartic acid in the swelling part of the stem, as well as trans-zeatin riboside. These results suggest that NPA-induced stem swelling depends on the dynamics of changes in aux-in and cytokinin metabolites. Furthermore, the contents of monosaccharides (glucose, fructose and galactose) as well as malic, succinic, fumaric acids, cyclitols and quinic acid derivatives increased markedly in the swelling stem. This may indicate that the site of NPA-induced stem swel-ling is a physiological sink for polar metabolites needed for the growth of this tissue. Thus, it seems that auxins, in interaction with cytokinins, regulate the strength of the sink, controlling the transport of polar metabolites into the swelling part of S. canadensis stem."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ee98cd57523404d1000e9f7","5e709224878c28a047390822"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","uid":"bDLTdHpVtaG-qqbFfKZt8ug","uuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","name":"Instytut Rozrodu Zwierząt i Badań Żywności Polskiej Akademii Nauk","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709430878c28a0473b7db9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","parentUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec1","rootUuid":"22a50212-2f2b-4a34-a406-34bdb34ab8bb","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","5e709400878c28a0473b4af1"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"23","issue":"4","pagesFromTo":"25-40","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","6703d540fdbe835ef8a60e8f","5e709400878c28a0473b4af1","5e709401878c28a0473b4b5b","5ee98cd57523404d1000e9f7","5e709224878c28a047390822","5e709430878c28a0473b7db9","6703d540fdbe835ef8a60e93","6703d540fdbe835ef8a60e94","6703d540fdbe835ef8a60e95"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e56","mniswId":"322","title":"Acta Scientiarum Polonorum Hortorum Cultus","issn":"1644-0692","eissn":"2545-1405","documentHash":"b52d6e0d-adfb-46ab-ba0a-08c89420b431"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66fc1273fdbe837a1e1f26bb","year":"2024","volume":"23","number":"4","documentHash":"74c41f48-cd63-4222-929e-1813ffcc5340"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["auxin transport inhibitor","Canadian goldenrod","secondary growth","stem swelling","vascular cambium","N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060732156"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"659fa60340970707a127d612","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Sykłowska-Baranek","documentHash":"bd2a312d-cf37-433b-aa3a-7f82ab548df5"},{"objectId":"659fa60340970707a127d611","name":"Anna","lastName":"Mikuła","documentHash":"f0701560-a03f-490b-85ca-8a88d4aa811d"},{"objectId":"659fa60340970707a127d610","name":"Joanna M.","lastName":"Zieleźnicka","documentHash":"562a1e2e-f421-4759-a6fb-9a71f29b1417"},{"objectId":"659fa60340970707a127d60f","name":"Rafał M.","lastName":"Kiełkiewicz","documentHash":"c51ef371-4385-4c11-8909-9baf5399622c"},{"objectId":"659fa60340970707a127d60e","name":"Beata","lastName":"Wileńska","documentHash":"1abed17d-86ca-43b8-9e88-27e958e8ff14"},{"objectId":"659fa60340970707a127d60d","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Obrębski","documentHash":"823fef7a-d8de-416a-8963-acc990c8015a"},{"objectId":"659fa60340970707a127d60b","name":"Anita A.","lastName":"Śliwińska","documentHash":"f81a3334-f369-4a2e-af2c-e760166d8516"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af851","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Tomiczak","uuid":"0ABED599A63A3B9EA5A63E3A474E9358563C3D6CF7753A461A705EF37EC15D626337EBCFABDE777F52C2B428E42F9A9E1B38A45A39B287B2D17AF4787D876D2E","orcidId":"0000-0002-4529-5581","documentHash":"5305cad9-9d03-4168-9635-1ca15b0769cb"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398339","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Podwyszyńska","uuid":"B2F52BE0F8A5B79B13A48C312966FAF67C57B8B98C867157CF8141B8D7208AF78325A4F99008EDCBA6781E8BB00736EC29CC4B6CD7950AC77678B349D9B9CC47","orcidId":"0000-0003-3005-4053","documentHash":"685f5ee6-b147-4b3e-b614-46c6ff16b171"}],"objectId":"659fa60340970707a127d609","doi":"10.1016/j.indcrop.2023.117845","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0926669023016102?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"An effective cryobanking approach preserving the genetic, physiological and phytochemical stability of Polyscias filicifolia Bailey hairy roots","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cryopreservation procedures can affect the physiological and genetic stability of stored samples, as well as their biosynthetic potential, which is particularly important for medicinal plants; as such, it is necessary to refine a number of factors to ensure the effective long-term storage of plant cells. The article describes an effective method of cryopreservation of Polyscias filicifolia hairy roots. Briefly, hairy roots were subjected to osmotic dehydration (OD) with or without subsequent air dehydration (AD; for three to six hours) for cryobanking in liquid nitrogen. After regeneration, genetic stability was assessed using Inter Simple Sequence Repeats (ISSRs) and Start Codon Targeted (SCoT) markers, together with nuclear DNA content, survival rate and biomass growth. In addition, chlorogenic (CGA) and oleanolic acid (OA) yields were determined using HPLC-UV-Vis, and the extract profiled by HPLC-PDA-ESI-HRMS, and the antioxidant potential of the treated root extracts was assessed. OD alone was found to be insufficient for cryopreservation; it was necessary to precede it with AD. The highest survival (93%), and biomass growth (up to 3-fold), were noted for roots subjected to OD preceded by six-hour AD; however, AD had a detrimental effect on the genetic stability of roots when applied for five or six hours. Longer dehydration times correlated with greater CGA biosynthesis. Further, CGA content was enhanced to 2.6 mg g−1 dry weight (DW) at six months post regeneration and 2.2 mg g−1 at 12 months. OA yield was not affected by the cryopreservation conditions. HPLC-PDA-ESI-HRMS analysis confirmed that the main component was CGA, accompanied by ferulic acid derivatives, 3,5-O-dicaffeoylquinic acid (isochlorogenic acid A) and 5-p-coumaroylquinic acid. Interestingly, the profile of biosynthesized compounds in the roots did not change during cultivation for up to 12 months. The highest antioxidant activity, determined by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay, was noted for the extract from the OD variant, which also demonstrated the highest total phenolic content.

The luminous intensity of the upper shelves was 200 µmol m−2 s−1, and that of the bottom was 160 µmol m−2 s−1. The plants were exposed to light for 16 h each day. Seven cultivars from two groups were cultivated in this study. There were four cultivars from the midi subtype (‘Casual,’ ‘Pivotal,’ ‘Delcaso,’ and ‘Airton’) and three from the mini subtype (‘Xiomara,’ ‘Coventry,’ and ‘Elizium’). The growth period of lettuce in the hydroponic chamber was 30 days. Immediately after harvest, lettuce was evaluated for plant morphological parameters and for the content of macro- and microelements and metabolites with health-promoting properties. Additionally, sensory evaluation was performed and leaf color parameters were measured.\n\nThe genotype of romaine lettuce had a major impact on its extrinsic and intrinsic properties. The mini cultivars produced lower fresh mass but contained higher amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, copper, and boron than varieties from the midi group. The contents of bioactive compounds were higher for midi romaine lettuce than for the mini type. In terms of nitrate, there were significant differences, and lower nitrate levels occurred in the mini group, except in ‘Coventry.’ The results obtained in this study did not allow us to single out any cultivar from the midi group as the best or the worst in terms of chemical composition. Among the mini cultivars, ‘Elizium’ shown the tendency to accumulate a relatively small amount of nitrate and a relatively large amount of chlorophyll, carotenoid, polyphenol and flavonoid. ‘Coventry’ with the lowest chlorophyll, carotenoid, and flavonoid contents was found to be the poorest in bioactive compounds. The sensory evaluation indicated the good quality of all mini and two midi cultivars, while ‘Delcaso’ (midi cultivar) received the worst marks, because of poor smell and crispness and a bitter aftertaste. The higher light intensity (200 µmol m−2 s−1) used for plant illumination did not unequivocally increase the content of health-promoting components or improve other characteristics of romaine lettuce compared to the light 160 µmol m−2 s−1."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397d85","5e709401878c28a0473b4c2c","5e7094a7878c28a0473c106d","5e709200878c28a04738e666","5e709400878c28a0473b4a25","5e709288878c28a047397765","5e70928b878c28a047397980","5e7094a7878c28a0473c1071"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"313","pagesFromTo":"111913","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709288878c28a047397765","5e7094a7878c28a0473c106d","5e709200878c28a04738e666","5e70928b878c28a047397980","5e7094a7878c28a0473c1071","5e70928e878c28a047397d85","5e709401878c28a0473b4c2c","5e709400878c28a0473b4a25"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b4","mniswId":"18258","title":"SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE","issn":"0304-4238","eissn":"1879-1018","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"2a554406-91f1-426c-8e10-e67b2e56031a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ecbfd14097072bce774b48","year":"2023","volume":"313","documentHash":"78e05b1b-94fa-47b7-9b3e-c94ac3355a02"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Macronutrients","Micronutrients","Biochemicals","Sensory value","Color value"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060759860"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709378878c28a0473aa75c","name":"Zdzisława","lastName":"Romanowska-Duda","uuid":"8E3670686EBF26D9E877D822E791B7D787CF55A3CF4706C685C6A49426EEEFF0B2DA00D7E0331D14E737B25491E04F879E645D51C31C256D8CBBCE55B137548C","orcidId":"0000-0003-1666-9991","documentHash":"f0565252-5908-44a0-9e83-453fa47f7dc7"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a047397929","name":"Regina","lastName":"Janas","uuid":"5EF36592ABC78BA9ED665FC5CC9762B935444E05A64CBB9C31B803658684B3BDECE94C960A1E7722C85109CD0F3B4A0FBE0B72ACE7B975AACFFA081749BD64C9","orcidId":"0000-0002-1066-8456","documentHash":"ba1cab55-fc41-4801-bc37-885594af9ad4"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a047397912","name":"Mieczysław","lastName":"Grzesik","uuid":"06B879722B79F7262AB639FDD45ADADE17B8DBB63A0274C4EB047454D8AD4D597183060233D4C8CB37162E8A42E654D08F0ECD5ACEBE5379332E7D9590336FE2","orcidId":"0000-0001-8538-5971","documentHash":"57d1e069-18fe-4dda-b1ac-b62542e62c47"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-16","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66e95bacfdbe8369ae9ca40c","doi":"10.3390/molecules29184397","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29184397","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Increasing Fertilization Efficiency of Biomass Ash by the Synergistically Acting Digestate and Extract from Water Plants Sequestering CO2 in Sorghum Crops","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The utilization of biomass ash in sustainable agriculture and increasing its fertilizing efficiency by biological agents, potentially sequestering CO2, have become important issues for the global economy. The aim of this paper was to investigate the effects of ash from sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) and Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.) biomass, a biogas plant digestate, and a Spirodela polyrhiza extract, acting alone or synergistically, on soil fertility and the development, health and physiological properties of sorghum plants. The results show novel information concerning differences in the composition and impact of ash, depending on its origin, soil properties and sorghum plant development. Sorghum ash was more effective than that from Jerusalem artichoke. Ash used alone and preferably acting synergistically with the digestate and Spirodela polyrhiza extract greatly increased soil fertility and the growth, biomass yield and health of sorghum plants. These improvements were associated with an increased chlorophyll content in leaves, better gas exchange (photosynthesis, transpiration, stomatal conductance), greater enzyme activity (acid and alkaline phosphatase, RNase, and total dehydrogenase), and a higher biomass energy value. The developed treatments improved environmental conditions by replacing synthetic fertilizers, increasing the sequestration of CO2, solving the ash storage problem, reducing the need for pesticides, and enabling a closed circulation of nutrients between plant and soil, maintaining high soil fertility."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928b878c28a047397912","5e70928b878c28a047397929"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"29","issue":"18","pagesFromTo":"4397","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709378878c28a0473aa75c","5e70928b878c28a047397929","5e70928b878c28a047397912"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","issn":"1420-3049","eissn":"1420-3049","documentHash":"9836cc11-0695-4363-918e-cfe03c6ccb4f"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sorghum","Jerusalem artichoke","ash","plant growth","physiological activity","fertilization","synergism","Spirodela polyrhiza"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060763677"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"661cca1640970734e76fb559","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Paraszkiewicz","documentHash":"1b444daa-636e-45d3-9f3d-740cda67f039"},{"objectId":"661cca1640970734e76fb558","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Różalska","documentHash":"2a75fcdd-4613-45f9-95fc-6e042fb6bd6a"},{"objectId":"661cca1640970734e76fb557","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Bernat","documentHash":"329f2e75-ceff-42ad-8967-fef1c454f43d"},{"objectId":"661cca1640970734e76fb556","name":"Anna","lastName":"Jasińska","documentHash":"1e8a5d51-4c74-4448-a4aa-65c64e06eec9"},{"objectId":"661cca1640970734e76fb555","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Walaszczyk","documentHash":"3f69f34f-f4f2-46dc-981c-acfce0ee12e7"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398362","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Sas-Paszt","uuid":"F65BF0798F03691C5ACA3C2A1EA4E5FD87ED5CB37729DF32BC5DB47710F0EBA374AA8CB082C6E75E322B257742E90231A958EB8FE9204AC6F2B651D5DF6471FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-4076-4032","documentHash":"c4b1b795-a964-4309-87da-3ec6e5c5aacd"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397ea4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Lisek","uuid":"C38FF7CEE15417AD4CC38A70CE53F9A2560AE5D83DA50BC26F276FAF8784228713271870F15964508BC5C7EBD2E2300F98393D7F45D8360A6B078185F7CB312E","orcidId":"0000-0002-3421-8759","documentHash":"a5bd2572-1af0-4f84-8b9e-d52fcf895ac8"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-04-10","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"661cca1640970734e76fb553","doi":"10.3390/ijms25084175","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/25/8/4175/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The Combined Effects of Azoxystrobin and the Biosurfactant-Producing Bacillus sp.

Kol B3 influences the growth of the phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium sambucinum IM 6525. The results showed a noticeable increase in antifungal effectiveness when biotic and abiotic agents were combined. This effect manifested across diverse parameters, including fungal growth inhibition, changes in hyphae morphology, fungal membrane permeability and levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). In response to the presence of Fusarium and AZ in the culture, the bacteria changed the proportions of biosurfactants (surfactin and iturin) produced. The presence of both AZ and/or Fusarium resulted in an increase in iturin biosynthesis. Only in 72 h old bacterial–fungal co-culture a 20% removal of AZ was noted. In the fungal cultures (with and without the addition of the bacteria), the presence of an AZ metabolite named azoxystrobin free acid was detected in the 48th and 72nd hours of the process.

Green leaves were treated with MeJA in lanoline on the abaxial or adaxial side of the leaf blades. After three weeks of treatment, leaf blades and petioles were collected separately for FA analyses. Additionally, petioles and leaf blades were sampled for analyses before the experiment and after 6 weeks when leaf senescence was occurring. Linolenic (C18:3) and palmitic (C16:0) acids appeared to be the quantitatively most abundant FA in leaf blades and petioles of G. biloba. Both leaf senescence and that induced by MeJA caused a decrease in unsaturated FA content, especially linolenic (C18:3). However, the decrease in C18:3 acid in both leaf blades and petioles was greater when MeJA was applied to the abaxial side than when it was applied to the adaxial side of leaves or during senescence. At the same time, saturated FA content increased, resulting in a significant decrease in the ratio of total unsaturated to saturated FA. Since leaf fatty acids occur mainly as components of cell membranes, changes in their composition may have a crucial effect on membrane function and stability, as pointed out in the discussion of the results."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ee98cd57523404d1000e9f7","5e709224878c28a047390822"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709400878c28a0473b4af1"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","uid":"bz_6XXECFL3_CFkpms5BsDQ","uuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","name":"Uniwersytet w Siedlcach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709294878c28a047398495","5e709294878c28a047398513"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","parentUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","rootUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"22","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"95-106","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709294878c28a047398495","5e709294878c28a047398513","5e709400878c28a0473b4af1","5ee98cd57523404d1000e9f7","6400617c4097072cdeca8588","5e709224878c28a047390822"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e56","mniswId":"322","title":"Acta Scientiarum Polonorum Hortorum Cultus","issn":"1644-0692","eissn":"2545-1405","documentHash":"b52d6e0d-adfb-46ab-ba0a-08c89420b431"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6400617c4097072cdeca8584","year":"2023","volume":"22","number":"1","documentHash":"daa0a40c-e826-4faa-a0d4-f554e876f15d"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Ginkgo biloba","Fatty acids","Composition","Methyl jasmonate","Induced senescence","Natural senescence"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060807822"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094da878c28a0473c5556","name":"Marian","lastName":"Saniewski","uuid":"DBC0E2E7C009F268095B648D1574D77571D306E3BF2B5CB63403E39370958268A582A7936E7C8C67A022750F7DDC35F53B545FF94AEAFB13F6007D19A0A258A0","documentHash":"bbf80f22-f5ef-40ec-9fd8-dd58833ee31d"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Marasek-Ciołakowska","uuid":"6FAB3AE6D9EBCFA4FD26AA8B3CD63FA73B99A6498DEF6A1770D2A9643E68A306803F24C467726C9A84745750C9B2D96EDD4F279404023C905B13853E9A49233F","orcidId":"0000-0001-9349-2566","documentHash":"1c86d2dd-6830-448a-8df1-57210e29a74d"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4af1","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Góraj-Koniarska","uuid":"9FC40A1F1A091811F5417DDDC0A27F9D6E4A7EBB7061A55729BDF382AC1C4764ACC6D5ECDCECC86E5F3AF92A60C7C453705F203CC84916CE364E17F25BA5DC27","orcidId":"0000-0001-7667-0279","documentHash":"2201bd21-407f-41c6-b322-bf2d514266ed"},{"objectId":"5e709294878c28a047398513","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Mitrus","uuid":"730316746E06CF1084C65ACE6B8C9133C06A987324A7E1B14927EFB1BD40DAA4C4A9757BA0750D2B58F1A9AFD3E4E065D71246755B2AB007F7F169478E2B0B0C","orcidId":"0000-0001-8000-5167","documentHash":"51ad3f4c-fdf0-4231-9c63-7a6e01d896ec"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390822","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Horbowicz","uuid":"607EF236052A333800DE056FB5A49C78E0BD32EA3C4E508F9FB7ED235589344FC6C4F33BB9310E91A5B461AF27BB59D282084C55F508C78931D9721F2D7A9019","orcidId":"0000-0002-1789-4034","documentHash":"49a74256-9b3b-4181-8fc7-f7c0367507c3"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_SA","releaseDate":"2024-08-26","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"66f3f5bafdbe8326af9760f8","doi":"10.5601/jelem.2024.29.2.3328","publicUri":"https://jsite.uwm.edu.pl/articles/view/3328/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The effect of fluridone on breaking the dormancy of inflorescence shoots and the content of pigments in Muscari armeniacum Leichtl. ex Baker leaves","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The herbicide fluridone (1-methyl-3-phenyl-5-[3-trifluoromethyl(phenyl)]-4(1H)-pyridinone) affects processes related to plant growth and development. It interferes with carotenoid biosynthesis by inhibiting the activity of phytoene desaturase which converts phytoene to phytofluene. Besides, fluridone indirectly inhibits abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of fluridone on plant pigments and proanthocyanidins in Muscari armeniacum leaves and on the dormancy of inflorescence shoots. In carried out experiments, uncooled M. armeniacum bulbs with fully differentiated adventitious roots were used. Three-week soaking of bulbs in water solutions of fluridone at concentrations of 5 and 10 mg dm-3 significantly inhibited root growth of M. armeniacum plants. Besides, fluridone caused degradation of chlorophylls and carotenoids in the primary leaves of this species. Leaves obtained from fluridone-treated bulbs showed a pink color due to the presence of anthocyanins, but histological analysis showed that these pigments were found only in the leaf parenchyma and not in the epidermis. Secondary leaves grew from bulbs after a long, 54-days, treatment with fluridone contained almost no carotenoids and chlorophylls. This longer treatment of M. armeniacum bulbs also resulted in a large increase in anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin contents. The high anthocyanin content in leaves is visible effect of fluridone-induced stress. Application of fluridone to M. armeniacum bulbs resulted also on breaking the dormancy of inflorescence shoots."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut

When the abaxial surface of detached leaves was held lower than the adaxial surface (the normal or natural position) under natural light conditions, anthocyanins were not accumulated on the abaxial side of the leaves. In contrast, when the adaxial surface of detached leaves was held lower than the abaxial surface (inverted position), anthocyanins were highly accumulated on the abaxial side of the leaves. These phenomena were independent of the growth stage of K. blossfeldiana as well as photoperiod. Application of JA-Me in lanolin paste significantly inhibited anthocyanin accumulation induced on the abaxial side of detached leaves held in an inverted position in a dose-dependent manner. Anthocyanin accumulation in the excised stem in response to natural light was also significantly inhibited by JA-Me in lanolin paste. Possible mechanisms of anthocyanin accumulation on the abaxial side of detached K. blossfeldiana leaves held in an inverted position under natural light conditions and the inhibitory effect of JA-Me on this process are described.

These are rich in antioxidants, vitamin C and anthocyanins, making them a valuable ingredient in the food and beverage industry. However, prolonged periods of drought during the fruiting season lead to drought stress, which has serious ecological and agricultural implications, inhibiting blackcurrant growth and reducing yields. To facilitate the analysis of underlying molecular processes, we present the first high-quality chromosome-scale and partially haplotype-resolved assembly of the blackcurrant genome (cv. Rosenthals Langtraubige), also the first in the family Grossulariaceae. We used this genomic reference to analyze the transcriptomic response of blackcurrant leaves and roots to drought stress, revealing differentially expressed genes with diverse functions, including those encoding the transcription factors bZIP, bHLH, MYB and WRKY, and tyrosine kinase-like kinases such as PERK and DUF26. Gene expression was correlated with the abundance of primary metabolites, revealing 14 with significant differences between stressed leaves and controls indicating a metabolic response to drought stress. Amino acids such as proline were more abundant under stress conditions, whereas organic acids were depleted. The genomic and transcriptomic data from this study can be used to develop more robust blackcurrant cultivars that thrive under drought stress conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a7878c28a0473c1102","5e7092db878c28a04739e38c"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","issue":"uhae313","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["673d9050fdbe8321547d2611","673d9050fdbe8321547d2612","673d9050fdbe8321547d2613","673d9050fdbe8321547d2614","673d9050fdbe8321547d2615","5e7094a7878c28a0473c1102","5e7092db878c28a04739e38c","673d9050fdbe8321547d2616","673d9050fdbe8321547d2617","673d9050fdbe8321547d2618","673d9050fdbe8321547d2619"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c2eb","mniswId":"7727","title":"Horticulture Research","issn":"2052-7276","eissn":"2052-7276","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"3e157e9e-1da8-4442-9da5-599cb1850b98"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"66619e6f409707458fb797e9","year":"2024","documentHash":"3d2b6189-5933-4832-99e9-4e8dfe4988dd"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["blackcurrant","drought","differentially expressed genes","metabolomics","omics data integration"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060879294"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"68089233fdbe832e346c841d","name":"Anna","lastName":"Stań","documentHash":"e9cc24f1-e4d6-4be6-b19a-a6cd04476b6f"},{"objectId":"68089233fdbe832e346c841c","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Wojciechowska","documentHash":"16d84d3e-e5b4-4301-bfba-0de9f58cbb3b"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398376","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Sitarek","uuid":"81A2618FAEDFB627B48156F62B32026215D11A59AF9B4AD50A23A2139DB87EC15763E2C058FFCFFCBAF8071C101C7814D2CFD0FB8C0FB0C38E7E8336773A30B0","orcidId":"0000-0001-5041-148X","documentHash":"a031375f-fb10-4242-8cbd-1baa5adf5247"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"JUNE","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"68089233fdbe832e346c841b","publicUri":"https://zdr.cdr.gov.pl/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Ocena plonowania wybranych odmian winorośli deserowej w warunkach glebowo-klimatycznych Polski Centralnej","otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"Yielding of chosen table grapevine cultivars in the soil and climate conditions of Central Poland"}],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Celem badań przeprowadzonych w latach 2019-2021 w winnicy doświadczalnej Sadu Doświadczalnego w Dąbrowicach (Instytut Ogrodnictwa-PIB w Skierniewicach) była ocena plonowania 15 genotypów winorośli deserowej w warunkach glebowo-klimatycznych Polski Centralnej.

The study was carried out on plants planted in 2004 at a spacing of 2.80 x 1.15 m, and trained in Double Guyot system. The fruits of the cultivars tested ripened from the third decade of August ('Kristaly') to the end of the first decade of October ('Frumoasa Albae', 'Remaily Seedless'). The number of clusters from 10 randomly selected fruit-bearing shoots was 16 in the 'Remaily Seedless' in 2021 up to 29 for the 'Muskat Letni' in 2019. The highest average weight of all the grapes and average weight of 1 cluster had 'Remaily Seedless', 'Agat Doński' and 'Frumoasa Albae'.

This study aimed to determine the abundance and trophic composition of nematode populations in seven soil-plant beds, the third component of plant-based wastewater treatment plants designed as Nature-Based Solutions (NBSs), in line with blue–green infrastructure and the closed-loop economy. The technology of this type of treatment plant is also in line with the idea of sustainability due to the very low energy requirements of the wastewater treatment system. In addition, soil nematodes were analysed in the soil adjacent to the WWTPs to assess the differences in trophic structure between these environments. The average nematode abundance in the soil-plant beds ranged from 606,000 [N·m−2] to 1,982,000 [N·m−2], with bacterivorous nematodes being the most abundant trophic group (61–73% of the population). This study’s results confirmed that soil-plant beds are abundantly populated by bacteria participating in key organic matter decomposition processes and nitrogen and phosphorus compound transformations, contributing to adequate wastewater treatment. The dominance of bacterivorous nematodes indicates a practical support of physicochemical and biological processes that reduce pollutant concentrations and eliminate pathogenic bacteria flowing into the deposits with the wastewater."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709350878c28a0473a70e9"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0f","uid":"br7hcJFLf6iH-raneJQQ4Eg","uuid":"ca2a2d0a-202a-4189-8c9c-3f9d36488fba","name":"Instytut Technologiczno-Przyrodniczy - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f1878c28a04739fa97","5e709469878c28a0473bc84f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0f","parentUuid":"ca2a2d0a-202a-4189-8c9c-3f9d36488fba","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0f","rootUuid":"ca2a2d0a-202a-4189-8c9c-3f9d36488fba","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"3","pagesFromTo":"1329","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67b83f32fdbe83514c8091cb","67b83f32fdbe83514c8091cc","5e7092f1878c28a04739fa97","5e709350878c28a0473a70e9","67b83f32fdbe83514c8091ce","67b83f32fdbe83514c8091cf","5e709469878c28a0473bc84f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","issn":"2071-1050","eissn":"2071-1050","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"46882d20-8996-4dde-bd15-7d5f8ecc797a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6790ba66fdbe835da5496ed6","year":"2025","volume":"17","number":"3","documentHash":"72a9d894-8ab5-43de-9ac5-31dfa99ce846"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["soil nematodes","hydrophytic treatment plants","soil-plant beds","nematode trophic groups","blue–green infrastructure","nature-based solutions"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060934697"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c2c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Wrzodak","uuid":"DD0902EC722F650D2557905DC36078794A03753014017DFA37805D32092EF1907648778A1814F55ABC2B1B2D4FE4EAE0B2D82D20ED3B546C9BDD9309E2D00A80","orcidId":"0000-0001-5472-888X","documentHash":"4ffe1343-e9dd-4148-8301-038630a669bd"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"SEPTEMBER","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"680b70f4fdbe830d21230e03","publicUri":"https://zdr.cdr.gov.pl/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Produkty żywnościowe kwaszone w polskiej tradycji","otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"Traditional fermented product in Poland"}],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Rynek produktów żywnościowych XXI wieku charakteryzuje się masową produkcją żywności wysoko przetworzonej i wygodnej, nie zawsze dobrej jakości i zazwyczaj o niskiej cenie.

The 3 km surroundings of each apiary were analysed using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery from the S2GLC-PL (National Satellite Information System 2025). The analysis identified eight distinct land cover classes: anthropogenic, agricultural, broad-leaved forest, coniferous forest, grassland, shrubs, wetlands, and water bodies. The findings revealed no statistically significant variation in the total nectar collected between urban and rural colonies (72.9 kg vs. 64.5 kg; p > 0.6). However, urban colonies exhibited a significantly higher number of foraging days (67 vs. 56). No significant correlations were identified between specific land cover types and nectar yield. Principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering revealed distinct landscape gradients, yet these did not influence nectar collection. The findings of this study indicate that diverse urban environments have the capacity to support beekeeping to a similar extent as rural areas and may even have superior conditions, provided that the continuity and diversity of nectar plants are maintained."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709288878c28a047397728"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"15","issue":"8","pagesFromTo":"4497","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709288878c28a047397728","680f3406fdbe83659c82ec4d"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff33dad49b31ccec0104f","title":"Applied Sciences","issn":"2076-3417","eissn":"2076-3417","documentHash":"96f827ef-c2c8-4b76-ab17-c7357fffee4e"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6800c533fdbe830a5fbf01b1","year":"2025","volume":"15","number":"8","documentHash":"620a7700-46c2-4e10-acaf-6a5dd503e485"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["urban beekeeping","rural beekeeping","environmental impact","nectar gathering","land cover","beehive weight gain"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060955802"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0f26","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Jaśkiewicz","uuid":"C0D9549780CD069CC4F2CE17EE65809F8F48CF1B322DCD8DEFF88CEC6A30F799BCD760DA709D236F43B84E25DF4CDEDBF164EB982D05E7D7297368BD8297E7B7","orcidId":"0000-0002-4494-1991","documentHash":"c4ac94cf-1ec5-4e20-baf1-1228b9568799"},{"objectId":"5e7094a0878c28a0473c08da","name":"Monika","lastName":"Strzałkowska-Abramek","uuid":"F6934ECA3F11EF57F0ABD8567EB9F71D8834DE70483827E1A87FAC297238B5A8D2DC12E952B05DA0C63E4E402985EAD58A1726757DA953982B0091B1C8372756","documentHash":"c0649328-40c7-4e36-b81d-bc4210801ba1"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a047390a05","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Sulborska-Różycka","uuid":"1E7A3DE5135EA8989DC3C64C39840055AEFF471E55CD5D8130607B9CB33653483604EFB164DC4C355F227EA1B7131D7FB216422EE78C5683472F167D5828BDE8","orcidId":"0000-0002-7720-0719","documentHash":"00105c16-d08c-4d76-bcae-6d05cb25113b"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a0473908eb","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Denisow","uuid":"73798982F93A1835404F5C3F6E1596451194F0A70A5A34C017983CA2A56EB8AE4746A7FC9CF5B1C4CF94D9F44F9F96772D116BD9C27748AA18588176068B7B51","orcidId":"0000-0001-6718-7496","documentHash":"f82c2203-a2b3-46b7-becd-ef578a3e7b73"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2025-04-11","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67ff7c09fdbe837d216faf5d","doi":"10.1038/s41598-025-96806-w","publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-96806-w#citeas","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Floral reward traits change between sexual phases in two Helleborus species","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Nectar and pollen attractants as well as visitors in Helleborus viridis ssp. viridis and H. purpurascens (Ranunculaceae), i.e. European species, were studied during two flowering seasons.

Both species are protogynous, having an initial female phase lasting for 3 days. The nectar and sugar mass was consistently male-biased. At the end of the flower’s life span, the nectar mass and the sugar concentration decreased considerably. In both species, sucrose predominated in the nectar, which also contained small quantities of other disaccharides (maltose and trehalose) and monosaccharides (glucose and fructose). The chemical composition of the nectar sugar varied between the sexual phases; sucrose in the female-phase nectar was replaced mainly by fructose. In addition to nectar, the flowers offered pollen (between 2 and 4 and 10–17 days of anthesis).

Hence, we explored the potential of innovative microbiologically enriched NPK fertilizer (called biofertilizer) to stimulate the activity and diversity of soil microbial communities in two degraded soils - Brunic Arenosol (BA) and Abruptic Luvisol (AL), under maize cultivation. The two year field experiments included the following treatments - standard, optimal dose of mineral fertilizer without microbial enrichment (PC/PK) designed to meet the nutritional requirements of maize and serving as the control treatment, optimal dose amended with beneficial bacterial strains (PA100/PW100) and a dose containing 40 % less NPK fertilizer but enriched with microorganisms (PA60/PW60). The application of biofertilizer stimulated the activity of key enzymes involved in carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus biotransformations in the soil, modified the metabolic profile of soil microorganisms and changed the genetic diversity of bacteria, archaea and fungi. We observed the increased number and the presence of specific terminal restriction fragments pointing on the higher diversity within microbial communities. Next Generation Sequencing revealed that biofertilizer modified the community composition at different taxonomic levels, increased number of functional sequences assigned to metabolic processes of various compounds and higher relative abundance of fungal trophic modes and ecological guilds important for soil health. The obtained results showed that microbiologically enriched NPK fertilizer exhibits multifarious actions and has a potential to improve soil microbiome quality and diversity, as well as influencing yield of maize production."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The results of long-term observations show that among organic additives, biochar demonstrates the most pronounced stabilising effect on the structure of the nematode community, although its impact on the total number of nematodes is limited. The application of biochar increased the diversity of trophic groups and modified the soil trophic network, which was dose-dependent. The experiment also revealed a significant impact of organic additives on the ecological indicators of nematode communities. In particular, the use of biochar significantly increased the Maturity Index (MI) and the Structural Index (SI), which indicates an improvement in the stability and complexity of the soil ecosystem. Reducing the number of migratory endoparasites and other plant-parasitic nematodes, such as Pratylenchus spp. was crucial in increasing the yield of M. × giganteus. The most pronounced changes were observed when biochar was applied at 10% (BD2). The field trial also assessed the impact of organic amendments on soil microbiological characteristics. Although the total number of bacteria and fungi did not change significantly, there was an increase in the number of Pseudomonas bacteria in the biochar-treated samples. This confirms the role of biochar as a stimulator of the growth of beneficial microorganisms and improvement of soil microbial activity. At the same time, the activity of dehydrogenase, which is an indicator of microbial activity, did not change significantly under the influence of additives. The test findings indicate that the addition of biochar has a beneficial effect on the yield of M. × giganteus, contributing to an increase in green mass at harvest. The impact of organic amendments was long-lasting, demonstrating the potential to increase the productivity of energy crops on marginal lands. Reducing the number of plant-parasitic nematodes, especially migratory endoparasites, was a key factor in improving yields. The outcomes of the study confirm the significance of an integrated approach to the application of organic amendments to improve soil health and increase the productivity of energy crops. The dose-dependent effects of biochar indicate the need to adapt application strategies to specific agroecosystems. Further research should focus on analysing the long-term effects of organic fertilisers on the functioning of trophic networks and microbiological processes in the soil."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709295878c28a04739869a","5e70928e878c28a047397d8c"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"33","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"e2508","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6819c4adfdbe8364f517cd7a","6819c4adfdbe8364f517cd7b","6819c4adfdbe8364f517cd7c","6819c4adfdbe8364f517cd7d","6819c4adfdbe8364f517cd7e","6819c4adfdbe8364f517cd7f","5e709295878c28a04739869a","5e70928e878c28a047397d8c"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f3df","mniswId":"28583","title":"Biosystems Diversity","issn":"2519-8513","eissn":"2520-2529","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"da0f8f57-950c-4da3-88f3-b0bb03e2984b"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6819c4adfdbe8364f517cd79","year":"2025","volume":"33","number":"1","documentHash":"affda1a8-9ef0-414c-ad41-cb4073afd43c"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["productivity","soil health","soil biota","trophic groups","plant-parasitic nematodes"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060974212"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"67ffab81fdbe83559c2c8370","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Kowalska","documentHash":"6afcd3f0-b402-4f2f-ae56-38f4fbd413af"},{"objectId":"5e7094a5878c28a0473c0f41","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Szczechura","uuid":"48D797CC6B4AD1EF5CEF54ABFC93FBE58FF68C34EE25D286A435374B99F644D480D84D0D12C6590FB895089AF44697FD3D64ECD1684D2BAAD97E086380D66A4C","orcidId":"0000-0002-9184-1790","documentHash":"b4f14a05-722c-473a-ac55-da90bff017c9"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Marasek-Ciołakowska","uuid":"6FAB3AE6D9EBCFA4FD26AA8B3CD63FA73B99A6498DEF6A1770D2A9643E68A306803F24C467726C9A84745750C9B2D96EDD4F279404023C905B13853E9A49233F","orcidId":"0000-0001-9349-2566","documentHash":"1c86d2dd-6830-448a-8df1-57210e29a74d"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c2e","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"A2B49DD05D2FC4275519F9F1E9891DE97310FF25C96A971233122CEFCED42F5071913FEAE6767BD75780A65CFF3912F6DB744ADA7E8EE2D3434D23CEA0FD2520","orcidId":"0000-0002-6079-9745","documentHash":"810a5685-6b49-4740-b70c-1a87eac9bde9"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c07","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Nowakowska","uuid":"F00630A48446DD9BE883474C571859E8745EA9A04E6EE9DDDB7C85E9AC275BD31BAA13149867462BD059A29A909A3ED931DF8DF10E3B5A614E8D2F579D349864","orcidId":"0000-0002-6825-7756","documentHash":"ca996a74-794d-4ada-b146-eb8433549979"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398339","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Podwyszyńska","uuid":"B2F52BE0F8A5B79B13A48C312966FAF67C57B8B98C867157CF8141B8D7208AF78325A4F99008EDCBA6781E8BB00736EC29CC4B6CD7950AC77678B349D9B9CC47","orcidId":"0000-0003-3005-4053","documentHash":"685f5ee6-b147-4b3e-b614-46c6ff16b171"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a047397975","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kamiński","uuid":"E9F44EC1380F12AD1DE04ECB73794FF24275BC44AD3C6BF4680147EB45EF8116C31A19B53EBB4F957595F3EB7E997B4461AD0DD5ED77A6B4C1E265925A237CC3","orcidId":"0000-0002-6954-6197","documentHash":"c53c2a2c-1797-4d68-826c-ea9a403e3051"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2025-04-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67ffab81fdbe83559c2c836e","doi":"10.1016/j.scienta.2025.114102","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0304423825001530?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Development and characteristics of intergeneric Brassica rapa L. subsp. pekinensis × Sinapis alba hybrids as a new germplasm for the breeding","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Intergeneric hybridization between Chinese cabbage inbred lines (Brassica rapa L. subsp. pekinensis) (2n=20) and white mustard (Sinapis alba L.)

Pollinator insects significantly simplified cross-pollination between B. rapa CMS (cytoplasmic male sterile) lines and male-fertile S. alba, resulting in the generation of 48 intergeneric F1 hybrids. Morphological and cytological characteristics, including seed development, nuclear DNA content, chromosome constitution, SSR (Simple sequence repeats) markers, and pollen viability, were analyzed throughout the vegetative and generative stages. Among the 48 F1 hybrids, seven exhibited male-fertility, whereas 41 were male-sterile, indicating the presence of nuclear fertility restorer genes. The nuclear DNA content of B. rapa lines ranged from 1.05 to 1.07 pg, while S. alba exhibited a DNA volume of 1.12 pg. In contrast, the B. rapa × S. alba F1 hybrids displayed increased and diversified nuclear DNA content, ranging from 1.57 pg to 2.26 pg, with chromosome numbers from 28 to 39. The hybrids exhibited morphological characteristics that were predominantly transgressive or intermediate in relation to the parental genotypes, which may be of significance. SSR markers confirmed the hybrid status of the F1 plants by detecting alleles from both parents and revealing novel genetic patterns. These findings demonstrate the potential of insect-mediated cross-pollination for generating B. rapa × S. alba hybrids, offering valuable genetic resources for Brassica breeding programs with improved diversity and agronomic characteristics."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","5e70928b878c28a047397975","5e709292878c28a047398339","5e709401878c28a0473b4c07","5e7094a5878c28a0473c0f41"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"344","pagesFromTo":"114102","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928b878c28a047397975","5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","5e709292878c28a047398339","5e709401878c28a0473b4c07","5e7094a5878c28a0473c0f41","67ffab81fdbe83559c2c8370","5e709401878c28a0473b4c2e"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b4","mniswId":"18258","title":"SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE","issn":"0304-4238","eissn":"1879-1018","metadataSource":"WOS","documentHash":"2a554406-91f1-426c-8e10-e67b2e56031a"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"67ffab81fdbe83559c2c836f","year":"2025","volume":"344","documentHash":"d1746660-6fd1-45aa-8c35-ebfd0792439a"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Intergeneric hybrids","Insects’ cross-pollination","DNA content","Phenotype","SSR markers"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747060987804"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"681b1475fdbe8356ff073230","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Horbowicz","documentHash":"8c7ba6f5-9ff3-4eff-9bbf-f82a294065ba"},{"objectId":"681b1475fdbe8356ff07322f","name":"Marian","lastName":"Saniewski","documentHash":"ed087206-01b8-4471-9ddb-fcd51d925f35"},{"objectId":"681b1475fdbe8356ff07322e","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Mitrus","documentHash":"a1f72dfa-7012-486c-ae6b-8d4569e6c3bd"},{"objectId":"681b1475fdbe8356ff07322d","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Kaszubski","documentHash":"81926735-4cfa-4d58-a69f-9ece6793d0d9"},{"objectId":"681b1475fdbe8356ff07322c","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Szawara-Nowak","documentHash":"440e65b7-f74b-4576-afd3-640c991e41f8"},{"objectId":"681b1475fdbe8356ff07322b","name":"Wieslaw","lastName":"Wiczkowski","documentHash":"04dd17de-2bbc-4681-be10-7b1c67aaf2a7"},{"objectId":"681b1475fdbe8356ff07322a","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Marasek-Ciołakowska","documentHash":"c7cdf347-8e6d-417c-a5ae-12ce4d6cf355"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Marasek-Ciołakowska","uuid":"6FAB3AE6D9EBCFA4FD26AA8B3CD63FA73B99A6498DEF6A1770D2A9643E68A306803F24C467726C9A84745750C9B2D96EDD4F279404023C905B13853E9A49233F","orcidId":"0000-0001-9349-2566","documentHash":"1c86d2dd-6830-448a-8df1-57210e29a74d"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4af1","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Góraj-Koniarska","uuid":"9FC40A1F1A091811F5417DDDC0A27F9D6E4A7EBB7061A55729BDF382AC1C4764ACC6D5ECDCECC86E5F3AF92A60C7C453705F203CC84916CE364E17F25BA5DC27","orcidId":"0000-0001-7667-0279","documentHash":"2201bd21-407f-41c6-b322-bf2d514266ed"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_SA","releaseDate":"2025-03-03","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"681b1475fdbe8356ff073229","doi":"10.5601/jelem.2024.29.4.3435","publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.5601/jelem.2024.29.4.3435","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Effect of natural light on development of adventitious roots in stem cuttings of Salix babylonica ‘Tortuosa’: histological and biochemical evaluation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"During the vegetative propagation of willow Salix babylonica, stem cuttings develop adventitious roots\nthat accumulate high levels of anthocyanins in the presence of light. This metabolic response has been\nknown earlier, but there are no data in the available literature regarding the profile of these pigments.\nThe aim of this study has been to determine the composition and content of anthocyanins and other\naccompanying phenolic compounds and salicinoids in adventitious roots of S. babylonica. Identification\nand analysis of anthocyanins were carried out using micro-HPLC-MS/MS-TOF, while HPLC-MS/MS\nwas applied to analyze phenolic acids, flavonoids and salicinoids. In addition to these analyses, histolo-\ngical observations were made using a microscope. On microscopic cross-sections, a red color was found\nonly locally, namely in some sub-epidermal cells of the exodermis and parenchyma cells of the cortex.\nIn S. babylonica roots, presence of eleven glycosides of cyanidin, delphinidin, petunidin, peonidin,\npelargonidin and malvidin has been demonstrated. Quantitatively, the main anthocyanin in roots\ndeveloped in darkness was delphinidin glycoside, while the main anthocyanin in light-exposed\nroots was cyanidin glucoside. The increase in the anthocyanin content in roots exposed to light for\nthree weeks was several hundred times greater than in those kept in the dark, and their total level\nwas more than a hundred times higher than that of flavonoids, phenolic acids and/or salicinoids.

In the Cynips quercusfolii L. gall, the larval chamber in its final stage was formed from the remnants of dead cells that remained after larval feeding on the gall nutritive tissue. The cells of the gall nutritive tissue and the cells of the gall parenchyma exhibited diametrical differences: the former contained dense cytoplasm and had large nuclei and nucleoli, whereas the latter displayed sparse cytoplasm, prominent vacuoles, and very small nuclei. The region of coalescence between the gall stalk and leaf tissues has been described. In Neuroterus numismalis Geoffroy gall, the early developmental phases have been described in detail.

Here, lettuce, a widely popular edible vegetable, was selected as a model with which to investigate the effects of long-term application (FM) and temporary cessation (cessation) of fresh chicken manure on the distribution and movement of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the soil-root-plant system to elucidate the bottleneck in assessing the health risks of manure application. ARGs associated with 13 antibiotics and 384 subtypes in soil were quantitatively analyzed via high-throughput qPCR, and the results revealed that cessation treatment significantly affected the patterns of bacteria, mobile genetic elements (MGEs) and ARGs in the soil, leaves and roots in the soil–lettuce cropping system compared with FM treatment. Cessation of manure application reduced the abundance of ARGs by 34.0 %, 53.7 %, and 23.9 % in the bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, and leaves, respectively. Correlation network and source-tracking analyses of ARGs and bacteria within leaves and roots revealed that cessation treatment reduced the diffusion of ARGs and bacteria within leaves and roots into adjacent sites, and partial least squares path model (PLSPM) analysis indicated that FM treatment indirectly affected the pattern of ARGs in soil by influencing the bacterial community and soil properties, which play key roles in the distribution of ARGs. In summary, we investigated the driving mechanism of the effects of manure on the microbial community and ARG spectrum in a soil–lettuce planting system, and the results can support strategies for managing the spread of ARGs in the soil."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398362"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"211","pagesFromTo":"106100","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6819d093fdbe8364f51892bd","6819d093fdbe8364f51892be","6819d093fdbe8364f51892bf","6819d093fdbe8364f51892c0","6819d093fdbe8364f51892c1","6819d093fdbe8364f51892c2","6819d093fdbe8364f51892c3","6819d093fdbe8364f51892c4","5e709292878c28a047398362","6819d093fdbe8364f51892c5","6819d093fdbe8364f51892c6","6819d093fdbe8364f51892c7"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477151","mniswId":"1520","title":"APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY","issn":"0929-1393","eissn":"1873-0272","documentHash":"a048b589-834d-41fd-8329-d472700efb24"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6819d093fdbe8364f51892bc","year":"2025","volume":"211","documentHash":"0c10503a-96c4-4294-98c8-63a8170876a5"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Antimicrobial resistance","Soil–lettuce systems","Poultry manure","Microbial network interaction","Source tracking","High-throughput qPCR"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747061062162"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"68189d8bfdbe8375b17f7b00","name":"Khalid F.","lastName":"Almutairi","documentHash":"902e66e4-d3e2-44a8-891e-9dfe31d88e8e"},{"objectId":"68189d8bfdbe8375b17f7aff","name":"Walid F.

In commercial rhubarb stalk production, the bud dormancy development and release are crucial processes that determine the yields and quality of stalks. To date, reports on rhubarb bud dormancy regulation, however, are lacking. It is known that dormancy status depends on cultivars. The study aimed to determine the dormancy regulation in a valuable selection of rhubarb ‘Malinowy’. Changes in carbohydrate, total phenolic, endogenous hormone levels, and gene expression levels during dormancy development and release were studied in micropropagated rhubarb plantlets. Dormancy developed at high temperature (25.5 °C), and long day. Leaf senescence and dying were consistent with a significant increase in starch, total phenolics, ABA, IAA and SA levels. Five weeks of cooling at 4 °C were sufficient to break dormancy, but rhizomes stored for a longer duration showed faster and more uniformity leaf growing, and higher stalk length. No growth response was observed for non-cooled rhizomes. The low temperature activated carbohydrate and hormone metabolism and signalling in the buds. The increased expression of AMY3, BMY3, SUS3, BGLU17, GAMYB genes were consistent with a decrease in starch and increase in soluble sugars levels during dormancy release. Moreover, some genes (ZEP, ABF2, GASA4, GA2OX8) related to ABA and GA metabolism and signal transduction were activated.

Thus far, little is known about the factors and mechanisms involved in the dormancy development of micropropagated herbaceous perennials, including rhubarb. This study determined physiological and molecular changes in the Rheum rhaponticum (culinary rhubarb) ‘Raspberry’ planting material in response to photoperiod and temperature. We found that the rhubarb plantlets that were grown under a 16-h photoperiod (LD) and a temperature within the normal growth range (17–23 °C) showed active growth of leaves and rhizomes and did not develop dormancy. Rapid growth cessation and dormancy development were observed in response to a 10-h photoperiod (SD) or elevated temperature under LD. These morphological changes were accompanied by enhanced abscisic acid (ABA) and starch levels and also the upregulation of various genes involved in carbohydrate synthesis and transport (SUS3, AMY3, BMY3, BGLU17) and ABA synthesis and signaling (ZEP and ABF2). We also found enhanced expression levels of heat shock transcription factors (HSFA2 and HSFA6B), heat shock proteins (HSP22, HSP70.1, HSP90.2 and HSP101) and antioxidant enzymes (PRX12, APX2 and GPX). This may suggest that dormancy induction in micropropagated rhubarb plantlets is a stress response to light deficiency and high temperatures and is endogenously coordinated by the ABA, carbohydrate and ROS pathways."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709295878c28a047398705","5e7094a7878c28a0473c10e9"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Red-stalked cultivars and selection are more attractive for the fresh market and processing industry. In vitro cultures are important for rapidly multiplying value genotypes and producing plants free of viruses. This study aimed to develop an in vitro propagation method for six rhubarb selections from the Raspberry (R1, R2, R3), Leader (L1, L2), and Karpow Lipskiego (KL) groups. In addition, the planting material of six rhubarb selections was subjected to phytochemical analysis using the HPLC method to assess the content of bioactive compounds. The cultures were initiated from underground buds on the crowns. The initial growth was obtained for 45 to 75% of initial explants because of bacterial contamination and low bud activity of some genotypes. The type and concentration of cytokinin and its interaction with gibberellin acid (GA3) were shown to have a significant effect on the cyclic multiplication and commercially interesting rate of all rhubarb genotypes. A high in vitro rooting frequency, 93.7 to 95.8% for rhubarb Raspberry, 94.3 to 100% for rhubarb Leader, and 96.7% KP selections were obtained after two-cycle rooting on a medium containing IBA and NAA. The polyphenolic compounds, such as cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside, rhaponticin, resveratrol, caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, cinnamic acid, syringic acid, and ferulic acid were detected in selected rhubarb genotypes. The highest content of anthocyanins (2.9 mg·1 g−1 DM) and rhaponticin (107.8 µg·1 g−1 DM) was found in Raspberry selections. On the other hand, Leader selections were characterized by the highest content of resveratrol (0.25 µg·1 g−1 DM) and phenolic acids (1.3 µg·1 g−1 DM). The less attractive for functional food production seems to be KL selection."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709295878c28a047398705"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

For the model developed using Subspace Discriminant, clone T-201567-01\nand cultivar Markat were completely correctly classified with the highest accuracy of 100%. Whereas in the\ncase of the model built using Multilayer Perceptron clone T-201567-01 was characterized by the highest\nclassification metrics, such as Precision and F-measure equal to 0.983, MCC of 0.980, PRC Area and ROC\nArea of 1.000. The developed approach can be used in practice to discriminate advanced clones and cultivars\nof strawberry in an objective and nondestructive manner."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa -

Two independent trials were established to assess the effect of several plant species generally utilized as fore crops on grubs’ survival. Species included Fagopyrum esculentum, Sinapis alba and their mixture, Tagetes spp., Zea mais, Sorghum vulgare, Triticum aestivum, Lupinus albus, Trifolium repens and Fragaria × ananassa (as control). Plants were grown in 50-L pots (40 cm depth) and one month after the introduction of the grubs (10 specimens per pot at stadium L2-L3,) they were cut, minced and mixed with the soil (up to 5 cm depth). A month later S. alba resulted to be the most effective in reducing the number of survived grubs compared to other fore crops species in both experiments. F. esculentum reduced also the survival, though to a lesser extent, but the mortality was halved when the two plants were grown together. The three graminaceous species, Tagetes spp. and the two leguminous species were not consistent in reducing the total number of survived larvae. Melolontha spp. larvae behaviour in the presence of plant extracts was tested on a dual-choice experiment. Water and hydro-alcoholic extracts of F. esculentum, Calendula officinalis and Tagetes spp. were applied to the soil near strawberry plants and the behaviour of the grubs was compared to water application. The feeding behaviour of the larvae was not affected by the application of extracts from Tagetes spp. and C. officinalis plants, while extracts of F. esculentum resulted to reduce the presence of grubs on the strawberry plants in the upper layer of the soil. The results suggest that besides using S. alba and F. esculentum as a fore crop to reduce the risk of damage from Melolontha spp. larvae, a push-pull method using F. esculentum extracts could be considered within an integrated strategy for the control of cockchafer grubs in organic strawberry crops."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75","5e70943c878c28a0473b8910"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","issue":"1354","pagesFromTo":"187-192","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70943c878c28a0473b8910","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9abddad204581b62eba67","mniswId":"201401","title":"Acta Horticulturae","issn":"0567-7572","documentHash":"571116f9-2d73-46be-a4d7-d594c8f850cd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ef65c64097075fda41c687","year":"2022","number":"1354","documentHash":"5a5bf54a-75db-43ac-bead-d45daed9c07f"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["botanical extract","Fagopyrum esculentum","larval behaviour","Sinapis alba"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654702348"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70943c878c28a0473b8910","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Tartanus","uuid":"C48F7A279E8EDA4D4DFBE28F3C623A7EAA5380BBBAFDDB1CE8F9164A68B7AEEB3F79910A01C2E86DB12F23C3E9653ACC1C1BCF2B853A8F3EBA141FE39F41E80B","orcidId":"0000-0001-8374-1581","documentHash":"2e2870e8-c34f-47e9-8d68-2ceb836182d1"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75","name":"Eligio","lastName":"Malusa","uuid":"96702563F39315C1D693D3C97550CD6CAC824FFBF4F0B9CDA39B5B31CA25E279C7ADE056365DF1361FAB162C59DECD06A6B181EEEBEDF857A17AA24E3CAEAB00","orcidId":"0000-0002-9802-3379","documentHash":"1678ebd7-0f8e-4fff-b0c1-2a3a11e42d48"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d85","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"3897AF5C7E4FAAF35F404A9BC0F9A8CC22B535BAEF573567F51A2A1A784D9620935E656E73521A53CD02CED856407343E2833BC3E064485F8738EE7724777E10","orcidId":"0000-0002-1473-9207","documentHash":"93393335-9114-4927-8bda-c788c468a09e"}],"objectId":"63ef617e4097075fda416ffd","doi":"10.17660/actahortic.2022.1354.23","publicUri":"https://www.actahort.org/members/showpdf?booknrarnr=1354_23","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Effect of plant extracts on strawberry plants in relation to <i>Melolontha</i> spp. grubs damage","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Plant extracts for plant protection of organic crops are among the compounds allowed by the European Union legislation. In an effort of finding possible plants extracts suitable for the control of Melolontha spp. grubs in soil, trials were performed in organic strawberry plantations characterized by a high incidence of grubs’ damage. Extracts were obtained with the following plant species by mixing them at a 1:2 (w:v) ratio with either water (Allium sativum, Fagopyrum esculentum) or alcohol (mixtures of Urtica dioica, Mentha spicata and Artemisia absinthium). The extracts were analysed for their nutrient content and after application leaf samples were collected to determine micro- and macro-element content. Three trials were performed independently applying the extracts to plants twice in June, with a 7-day interval. Plants treated with water were used as control. The number of damaged plants and the number of cockchafer grubs in the soil were assessed after a month. All extracts, irrespective of the extraction method, were characterised by acid reaction and high nutrient content, especially in nitrate nitrogen and potassium. A. sativum resulted to have the highest nutrients content. The application of the extracts significantly increased only the calcium content in strawberry leaves compared to the control, without impacting on plant nutrient status and growth. The extracts obtained with U. dioica as a component of the mixture resulted the most consistent in increasing the number of damaged plants by cockchafer grubs in comparison to the control and also to the soil area surrounding the treated plots. However, differences emerged depending on the trial location, which could be related to the soil characteristics. U. dioica could be suggested as a possible botanical extract to be used within an “attract and kill” strategy for Melolontha spp. grubs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397d85","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75","5e70943c878c28a0473b8910"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","issue":"1354","pagesFromTo":"181-186","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70943c878c28a0473b8910","5e70928e878c28a047397d85","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e71002c46e0fb0001b60a3e","title":"Acta Horticulturae","issn":"0567-7572","documentHash":"02f4af12-405b-45e1-b66e-a9c36a705bc7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ef617e4097075fda416ffe","year":"2022","number":"1354","documentHash":"65eb226f-79ae-44de-aff3-4974ef55162e"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cockchafer white grubs","botanical extracts","Urtica dioica"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654702352"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"64675fb7409707515b4fdcd7","name":"E.","lastName":"Kaçal","documentHash":"83090730-95f1-4edb-8b2a-8543f77ebb43"},{"objectId":"64675fb7409707515b4fdcd6","name":"F.","lastName":"Pınar Öztürk","documentHash":"682e4d39-da3f-4419-94de-a62d21e2b385"},{"objectId":"64675fb7409707515b4fdcd5","name":"D.","lastName":"Karamürsel","documentHash":"97df0f33-f8fa-4790-a2d9-0c87ade7b4ee"},{"objectId":"64675fb7409707515b4fdcd4","name":"J.","lastName":"Kambor","documentHash":"d60ad294-f171-4978-b3e1-466fd46c03ac"},{"objectId":"64675fb7409707515b4fdcd3","name":"E.","lastName":"Bravin","documentHash":"325d029e-4201-4ad7-9e11-0d65949428cb"},{"objectId":"64675fb7409707515b4fdcd2","name":"A.","lastName":"Duarte","documentHash":"f9cb75c9-05d1-47c6-89a6-78bf024ef140"},{"objectId":"64675fb7409707515b4fdcd1","name":"M.","lastName":"de Belém Costa Freitas","documentHash":"02a5aceb-5d39-4b12-b4a3-18dc3b0932ec"},{"objectId":"64675fb7409707515b4fdcd0","name":"G.","lastName":"De Ros","documentHash":"44b13044-59c1-43aa-af41-e15e857067d6"},{"objectId":"64675fb7409707515b4fdccf","name":"V.","lastName":"Altamura","documentHash":"3332811a-603f-4125-b5a4-d16d59c758e0"},{"objectId":"64675fb7409707515b4fdcce","name":"A.","lastName":"Bertazzoli","documentHash":"1169814d-1e55-497d-975a-287f0e4a22bc"},{"objectId":"64675fb7409707515b4fdccd","name":"K.","lastName":"Cimer","documentHash":"0ae16fb3-38af-456e-92b2-00aaf4406dc9"},{"objectId":"64675fb7409707515b4fdccc","name":"G.","lastName":"Kurthy","documentHash":"935725e5-0ea8-4568-82f0-09d62bc37608"},{"objectId":"64675fb7409707515b4fdccb","name":"K.","lastName":"Kličková","documentHash":"44a2fa4b-6135-4024-961b-7d12dc7887bd"},{"objectId":"64675fb7409707515b4fdcca","name":"F.","lastName":"Rosner","documentHash":"771b627e-6f3e-4583-8b25-f595f59ed29f"},{"objectId":"64675fb7409707515b4fdcc9","name":"K.","lastName":"Kerngast","documentHash":"1ba94d9c-2a5f-4700-8955-5194c06fe72f"},{"objectId":"64675fb7409707515b4fdcc8","name":"S.","lastName":"Dreisiebner-Lanz","documentHash":"db1b328e-a401-4dcb-bc56-f1ea2271585a"},{"objectId":"64675fb7409707515b4fdcc7","name":"H.","lastName":"Garming","documentHash":"9fced2d7-c6fe-419c-bbfb-72c975f2de37"},{"objectId":"64675fb7409707515b4fdcc6","name":"A.","lastName":"Muder","documentHash":"3e075198-82d8-49bd-84b5-eb3fa4e6c0c1"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a04739871a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Zmarlicki","uuid":"2562BFCF5B19E83DF2E0F444FD83ED5BE42CD4C1752A4307110C0EE728100DCB53FCFD9711C27C42BAA12CC734C207669AA57BAC3750D25262A77A34E1BEFD20","orcidId":"0000-0002-1816-7592","documentHash":"787192ce-ef6d-46f4-b231-139d512d2739"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2022-01-01","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"64675fb7409707515b4fdcc4","doi":"10.17660/ejhs.2022/059","publicUri":"https://www.pubhort.org/ejhs/87/6/59/index.htm","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Apple production and apple value chains in Europe","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents an overview of the apple sector in nine major apple producing countries in Europe, in order to assess factors for the competitiveness of the national apple value chains and identify challenges for the future development of the sector.

For each country, a brief description of the development of apple production and acreage over the past ten years, farm size distribution, level of production technology and main market channels is presented, followed by a discussion of differences and similarities. Results show a diverse picture of the apple sector in Europe. Similarities are observed in the existence of regional production clusters and a generally small farm size. Differences are found in the technology level, with a broad range of very traditional extensive production systems up to highly intensified orchards with high tree density. All countries experienced high fluctuation in apple production quantities over the past years, mainly due to weather events, particularly spring frost and drought, and climate risks are expected to increase in the future, leading to increasing costs for mitigation

The experiment included the application of fungi (Aspergillus niger and Purpureocillium lilacinum), bacteria (Bacillus sp., Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Paenibacillus polymyxa) alone or together with mineral fertilizers (Polifoska 6, Urea, Super Fos Dar 40). The study investigated the number of inflorescences and flowers, the intensity of the green colour of leaves, fruit yield and weight (g and %), pH, extract (°Brix), titratable acidity (g/100 g), fruit firmness (N), as well as the concentrations of macro-and microelements in the leaves of the plants. The obtained results depend on the type of fertilizer and its concentration. Strains of filamentous fungi or bacterial strains only (without fertilizer), increase the fruit yield by 60 and 35%, respectively. Reduced to 60% doses of Polifoska 6, Urea, and Super Fos Dar 40 combined with beneficial soil microorganisms influence the strawberry fruit yield more beneficially than the fertilizers applied in standard doses (100%). The mineral fertilizers enriched with soil beneficial fungi and bacteria increase the mean fruit weight by 25-30%. Both Super Fos Dar 40 enriched with bacterial strains and Polifoska 6 at 100% positively affect the physical and chemical properties of strawberry fruits. The application of reduced to 60% doses of Fos Dar 40 and Polifoska 6 enriched with beneficial bacterial strains increase the nitrogen and potassium contents in the leaves, respectively. Urea and Super Fos Dar 40 at 100% enriched with beneficial bacteria positively affect magnesium content in the leaves. Application of Polifoska 6 and NPK enriched with bacteria beneficially influences the iron content in the leaves. The calcium content in strawberry leaves decreases due to fertilization."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa -

A social science study, with a participatory approach, was carried out to evaluate the perception of professional stakeholders (farmers, advisors and researchers) toward innovative practices of organic orchard management in relation to nine services that had been selected among the four categories of ecosystem services. A questionnaire was prepared asking to provide an answer to the following question: “How do you perceive/believe that the new agricultural techniques proposed/tested by DOMINO Projectb b\n\nThe project DOMINO tested several innovative orchard management practices to enhance soil fertility, biodiversity and economic sustainability of intensive organic fruit orchards. http://www.domino-coreorganic.eu/\nwill affect the ecosystem services?” From the analysis of the questionnaires gathered, a quite diversified perception emerged depending on the country and the practice concerned. The impact of a temporary net system on biodiversity and aesthetics was assessed negatively everywhere, while that of the row management was highly dependent on the country of the respondent. On the other hand, in case of cover crops, row living mulch and recycled materials for fertilizers the perception of the impact on soil nutrients, pollination and culture was higher among Italian stakeholders compared to all other countries. On the contrary, in Poland the innovative management was perceived as having a negative effect on provisioning services. Contrasting perception emerged in case of cultural services, while no major impact was perceived for supporting services. The analysis of the questionnaire indicated a high consideration of the added value of the living mulches in terms of aesthetic value and marketing claims for farmers selling directly their products on-farm."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75","5e70943c878c28a0473b8910"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","issue":"1354","pagesFromTo":"1-8","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63ef42ec4097075fda3f7520","63ef42ec4097075fda3f7521","5e70943c878c28a0473b8910","63ef42ec4097075fda3f7522","63ef42ec4097075fda3f7523","63ef42ec4097075fda3f7524","63ef42ec4097075fda3f7525","63ef42ec4097075fda3f7526","63ef42ec4097075fda3f7527","63ef42ec4097075fda3f7528","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c75"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff1bdad49b31ccebe942e","title":"Acta horticulturae","doi":"","issn":"0567-7572 ","eissn":"2406-6168 ","websiteLink":"http://www.ishs.org/acta-horticulturae","documentHash":"3d7d74b7-ff1c-4866-9282-87413047b6df"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ef42ec4097075fda3f751f","year":"2022","number":"1354","documentHash":"7b0092c6-40b1-4a9f-b5a3-a2755ad3f912"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["alternative organic fertilizers","cover crops","living mulches","participatory approach","row management","temporary net systems"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654761062"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c3426","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Golian","uuid":"141889D31819A09F2C92496C42E3023D8764CBA2F83091F958F2A2FF28847C69F46AFE40989E51705467A08AE5D1DE3D52779BA1C8939C3E9AE0A13B412B7BE9","orcidId":"0000-0003-0797-5495","documentHash":"c48ee163-e95d-4b27-a994-addec7826aa3"},{"objectId":"5e70944b878c28a0473b9dd3","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kwiatkowska","uuid":"1A5022510AE3B5E6ECE6CB243DAF11C58C7494415A81E00081CAC15BAE397814A771B618DCC78A70475A66273011DDF27532AFA55A810E5EF60BD9AE4D3D0F6A","orcidId":"0000-0002-1844-9231","documentHash":"45b886c5-eac3-4d36-ac32-7ef95e35b56e"},{"objectId":"5e7093fb878c28a0473b45dd","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Anyszka","uuid":"49991779EB2BFC0721E85AA0E9CE71A201C76BF394409DAC799F46DB56C813DCA9A2D8D7683BD3FB70780A2DCADDFD38E9CA76F84FE298636B5466F43DB16398","orcidId":"0000-0002-5315-7496","documentHash":"6c73057f-7b95-4269-816b-dadf87e40473"},{"objectId":"5e70936e878c28a0473a95fc","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Furmańczyk","uuid":"5DCDB8B04A3DF78B7CFA1599AEC526F806E31CD289493ECA04270BB300715A0348DBBD3227AAC79D1D7E902AB0D1ABA76ECC919ED07A28F50BEF18A5624138C7","orcidId":"0000-0002-2584-4387","documentHash":"c85b3562-cfbe-4f12-87a9-07c0317a4fa7"}],"objectId":"63f5c35e409707158a8361e3","doi":"10.17660/actahortic.2022.1354.4","publicUri":"https://www.actahort.org/members/showpdf?booknrarnr=1354_4","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"Changes in weed population in organic apple orchard as a result of soil management with living mulches","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A trial was carried out in the years of 2019-2020 at the National Institute of Horticultural Research in Skierniewice to assess the suitability of various multifunctional living mulch species grown on the tree rows (understory) of eight-year-old organic apple orchard (‘Gala’ and ‘Golden Delicious’) to control the weed infestation. Living mulch species included three perennials (Alchemilla vulgaris, Fragaria vesca and Mentha piperita) and two annuals crops (Tropaeolum majus and Cucurbita maxima). Perennial species were planted at the beginning of experiment and annual species in the spring of each year. The number of weeds was determined at spring time, summer and in autumn. A high weeds infestation, mostly by annual species, was observed. The number of total weeds and annual species at spring time was highly reduced by mulch with T. majus and C. maxima, while in summer and autumn weeds were reduce by M. piperita. The lowest number of perennial weeds in all living mulch species and in natural cover was recorded at spring time and the highest in summer.

It is financed from the state budget by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. This program includes breeding for resistance, fruit quality and adaptation. Newly bred cultivars should be characterized by high productivity, good suitability for various methods of fruit management (processing, freezing, fresh consumption), good adaptation to the Polish climatic and soil conditions and various cultivation technologies NDASH processing cultivars for picking fruits by different harvesters and dessert cultivars for trellising crop cultivation. In addition, new cultivars should be less susceptible or resistant to the most dangerous diseases and pests. The traditional crossing (hybridization) method is applied in the breeding program. During the 35 years of blackcurrant breeding work, 10 cultivars (‘Tisel’, ‘Tiben’, ‘Ores’, ‘Ruben’, ‘Tines’, ‘Gofert’, ‘Polares’, ‘Tihope’, ‘Polben’ and ‘Polonus’) were released and registered into the national list of cultivars in the Research Centre for Cultivar Testing, COBORU (http://www.coboru.gov.pl/index_en). First nine of these cultivars have also been covered by Community protection law at the Community Plant Variety Office, Angers, France, CPVO (https://cpvo.europa.eu/en) within the territory of the EU countries. In addition, three cultivars (‘Gofert’, ‘Polares’ and ‘Tihope’) obtained the plant patent in the US in 2016. Polish blackcurrant cultivars have gained great recognition among Polish and foreign growers. The available data show that the share of Polish cultivars in commercial plantations in our country is currently over 80%.

Rapid changes in agricultural technology and growing interest in the consumption of blueberry fruits due to their health benefits have directed breeders’ attention to developing improved cultivars. However, highbush blueberry cultivars with purple fruit flesh, containing high anthocyanin content, are not available yet. The fruit flesh of cultivated Vaccinium species is translucent as it does not contain anthocyanins. In contrast, the bilberry is characterized by purple fruit flesh. To introduce new traits, e.g., anthocyanin-containing flesh from wild diploid species of V. myrtillus to V. corymbosum which is tetraploid, it is crucial to double the chromosome number in diploid species. This is necessary to overcome a post zygotic crossing barrier, a strong triploid block, existing within the genus Vaccinium. In previous studies, several autotetraploids were induced in vitro for five genetically diverse bilberry accessions. The obtained tetraploids were multiplied in vitro, rooted and grown ex vitro. The first flowering was observed in 1.5-year-old plants. Bilberry autotetraploids bloomed slightly later and they had less flowers but significantly larger leaves, flowers and pollen tetrads compared to diploids. The germination capacity of pollen tetrads was high in tetraploids (ca. 90%). After pollinating the flowers of three highbush blueberry cultivars with pollen from the bilberry tetraploid plants, a few seedlings were obtained for each of the crosses with the cultivars ‘Bluecrop’, ‘Liberty’, and ‘Northland’. Most of the seedlings from interspecific crosses showed a weaker growth and had fewer and shorter shoots with slightly smaller leaves compared to V. corymbosum seedlings. The hybrid nature of some seedlings was confirmed by ISSR molecular markers. Germination of V. myrtillus pollen grains on stigma pistils of V. corymbosum 24 and 48 h after pollination was generally very poor, but pollen germination in reciprocal crossing was more abundant and fast. Further molecular analyses and phenotypic observations are needed to confirm the hybrid status of seedlings originated from the interspecific crosses of V. corymbosum and V. myrtillus."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut

The number\nof bacteria of the genus Pseudomonas in the rhizosphere of apple trees was the highest in combination with Urea 60%\n+ fungi and Polifoska 60% + bacteria. These values were 2–3 times higher compared with the control. In combination\nwith Polifoska 60% + bacteria, the number of fluorescent Pseudomonas bacteria was five times higher compared to the\ncontrol. The highest number of actinomycetes was observed in the third year of the study, in combination with Polifoska\n60% + bacteria. The use of this fertilizer increased the number of these bacteria more than five-fold compared with\nthe control. The beneficial effect of Polifoska 60% + bacteria, Super Fos Dar 100% + bacteria, and Urea 60% + fungi on\nphosphate-solubilizing bacteria was observed in the third year of cultivation. The additional application of filamen-\ntous fungi together with Urea did not have a significant effect on this group of microorganisms.

The main breeding goals are similar to those implemented in other breeding centers worldwide. The most important are the development of native cultivars, well adapted to local climatic and soil conditions, which are winter hardy, high yielding, resistant to the main fungal diseases, with varying times of fruit ripening. Good fruit quality is also essential, with a need for large attractive fruit that are firm with prolonged shelf life. New dessert cultivars should meet the requirements of the fresh fruit market with fruit of high nutritional value and health benefits. Molecular methods support the classical breeding to accelerate and increase the efficiency of this work. Recognition of molecular mechanisms of biosynthesis of fruit healthy supplements is crucial for breeding of new highbush blueberry cultivars. Molecular analyses (SSR’s) of genetic diversity at the DNA level of 7 highbush blueberry cultivars from the breeding collection of the DHCB allowed to distinguish two main clusters containing cultivars ‘Bluegold’, ‘Bonifacy’, ‘Jorma’ and ‘Aurora’, ‘Rubel’, ‘Toro’, ‘Liberty’, differ in regard to fruit wax coat intensity. Additionally, the evaluation of expression profile of six genes involved in cuticular wax formation pathway, encoding: acetyl coenzyme A - fat reductase (CR1, CR3 and FAR), acetyl coenzyme A – fat synthase (KCS4), lipid transporter protein (LTP) and WSD1 – wax synthase, was performed in regard the fruit skin and fruit flesh samples of selected cultivars. The analyzed genes showed a significantly higher level of activity in the ripe fruit skin of cultivars characterized by the presence of a wax cuticle in comparison to samples collected from fruits whit low intensity of wax coat."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709200878c28a04738e669","5e7094a7878c28a0473c1102","5e7092db878c28a04739e38c"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","issue":"1412","pagesFromTo":"199-206","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709200878c28a04738e669","5e7092db878c28a04739e38c","679a2090fdbe831aedcc2965","5e7094a7878c28a0473c1102"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9abddad204581b62eba67","mniswId":"201401","title":"Acta Horticulturae","issn":"0567-7572","documentHash":"571116f9-2d73-46be-a4d7-d594c8f850cd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"678f5595fdbe835856b24471","year":"2024","number":"1412","documentHash":"19273b78-8198-48b1-b7d4-30cdee0b0feb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["northern type blueberry","breeding goals","dessert cultivars","transcripts","regulatory genes","wax coat"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654954479"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4ace","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Głowacka","uuid":"67D70CED771A8A9FF44238B473A0B36D8EBDE57FEAC4C694FD4E935A5AB47322B67496D1992FF289DDB745536708B30670D12CD185A4C6C6E35AB2F1BC63E72F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6061-1880","documentHash":"34bb66bd-35b9-4e0d-a4dc-e7e14fadc1c9"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398351","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Rozpara","uuid":"1786131B2AF5AFAF45685292B4C47C98C846FAF4C6025B99DB99B816806597FC9410C499DB5CA2DD6F5437C22DC26B13E85C2A384602B08BA2A33C56FF785B4B","orcidId":"0000-0003-0188-6088","documentHash":"9a9264f0-5c99-46d0-8827-1158b39c7e76"}],"objectId":"6798b1b9fdbe834383a85a0d","doi":"10.17660/actahortic.2024.1408.11","publicUri":"https://www.actahort.org/members/showpdf?booknrarnr=1408_11","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Preservation and evaluation of old historical cherry genotypes in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Convention on Biological Diversity, of the 1992 adopted at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, obliges all signatory countries to collect, protect and sustainably use existing biodiversity. Poland signed the document mentioned above. The genetic resources of fruit plants belonging to the temperate climate zone are maintained in Poland by the National Institute of Horticultural Research, which is located in Skierniewice, in the central part of Poland. Genotypes of fruit plants have been collected here for over 70 years. The genetic resources of cherries, similarly to other fruit plants, are a rich source of genes determining the various biological characteristics of these species. The possessed genetic resources allow for the preservation of the existing biodiversity for future generations, and are also widely used in creative breeding. They also constitute a valuable experimental and educational base for students, advisers, gardeners – hobbyists and farmers. Nowadays, this activity is financed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, intended for the financing of biological progress in plant production. The genetic resources of cherries in Poland are gathered and kept in two separate field collections: collection of sweet cherry and collection of sour cherry. At the end of 2022, there were gathered over 500 genotypes in both collections, including the 326 sweet cherry and 208 sour cherry genotypes. A large part of the genotypes in the collection are local cultivars collected in the territory of Poland, during special scientific expeditions. Due to the large genetic and phenotypic diversity of collected plants."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398351","5e709400878c28a0473b4ace"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","issue":"1408","pagesFromTo":"77-84","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709292878c28a047398351","5e709400878c28a0473b4ace"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ebff1bdad49b31ccebe942e","title":"Acta horticulturae","doi":"","issn":"0567-7572 ","eissn":"2406-6168 ","websiteLink":"http://www.ishs.org/acta-horticulturae","documentHash":"3d7d74b7-ff1c-4866-9282-87413047b6df"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6798b1b9fdbe834383a85a0e","year":"2024","number":"1408","documentHash":"66d6a743-5a92-4e6d-8100-134c423c652b"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cherry","historical cultivars","biodiversity","preservation","evaluation","using"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654955193"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a7878c28a0473c10e9","name":"Monika","lastName":"Markiewicz","uuid":"9C3050846A2EE8BD9E991C0B69EFB60787BE007A5D933A079693A8D6F873E454EB0394193D9C926189C594654D1D3674380B4C0C03F8BB0097B10FAD513BA79F","orcidId":"0000-0002-5900-5557","documentHash":"1b325ea2-14b4-4025-8a07-7f6168a2ab58"},{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b8719","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Zgórzyńska","uuid":"BA7AFDCFAC54C6FA1A6C2AF990D2E1657A9A0A27758F9ECB0E7BBF763E8249C7ACBBD5DBB65652D4447EE458D668C775830A275CF9FC662531FCC785F7E388F7","orcidId":"0000-0002-5411-3778","documentHash":"fda634e2-7ac1-492a-b0ab-ce2de5e702fd"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bc5","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Wieczorek-Szukała","uuid":"C5744B795BB42CF1F721B507885AE85FD3ED5645AA1C6085705F453E3AE368973DA8933C3A8389544C8FDB583839E6A46F68EE3D960B327FECF929E1847BDA42","orcidId":"0000-0003-2999-5964","documentHash":"37bac781-6165-42ea-85af-44c7a019bbea"},{"objectId":"5e7092de878c28a04739e804","name":"Anna","lastName":"Walczewska","uuid":"496352B48F2091F90E1CBF8894634C71E4741C5958A7CBBC56CBF8234AB146A18614704A2B5022C016AFC905CC830C86CD85A469F9AE56DFC4A2FDB0C07619F1","orcidId":"0000-0001-5859-8891","documentHash":"5e2bc3a6-b166-4b89-800b-d9eda5de1648"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-11-13","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"67373bbffdbe832d85afae52","doi":"10.33594/000000668","publicUri":"https://www.cellphysiolbiochem.com/Articles/000668/","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2023,"title":"Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) Reduces LPS-Induced Inflammatory Response Via ATF3 Transcription Factor and Stimulates Src/Syk Signaling-Dependent Phagocytosis in Microglia","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background/aims: Microglial cells play a crucial role in the development of neuroinflammation in response to harmful stimuli, such as infection, ischemia or injury. Their chronic activation, however, is associated with a progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, looking for potential factors limiting microglial activation, the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the inflammatory response and TREM2-dependent phagocytic activity in microglia was investigated.\n\nMethods: In LPS-induced primary microglia preincubated with DHA, or without preincubation the expression of ATF3 and TREM2 genes and TREM2, Syk, Akt proteins were determined by RT-PCR and WB, respectively. Cell viability was assayed by MTT and cytokine and chemokine expression was determined by the Proteome Profiler assay. Moreover, the phagocytic activity of microglia was assayed using immunofluorescence.\n\nResults: We found that DHA significantly increased the expression of ATF3 , and decreased the levels of CINC-1, CINC-2αβ, CINC-3 chemokines, IL-1α and IL-1β cytokines, and ICAM-1 adhesion protein. Additionally, preincubation of microglia with DHA resulted in increased Src/Syk kinases activation associated with increased phagocytic microglia activity.\n\nConclusion: These findings indicate that DHA efficiently inhibits ATF3-dependent release of proinflammatory mediators and enhances phagocytic activity of microglia. The study provides a new mechanism of DHA action in reactive microglia, which may help limit neuronal damage caused by the pro-inflammatory milieu in the brain."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a7878c28a0473c10e9"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"57","pagesFromTo":"411-425","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bc5","5e7092de878c28a04739e804","5e709439878c28a0473b8719","5e7094a7878c28a0473c10e9"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477594","mniswId":"3397","title":"Cellular Physiology and Biochemistry","issn":"1015-8987","eissn":"1421-9778","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"7eb0f5ce-ddbe-4609-bdad-59dec911e2d8"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Inflammation","Docosahexaenoic acid","Phagocytosis","Microglia"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747654996231"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6788ba13fdbe8373455da9c0","name":"J.","lastName":"Zindović","documentHash":"6808e15d-6d57-4317-8411-b6587dd36eff"},{"objectId":"6788ba13fdbe8373455da9bf","name":"K.","lastName":"Zikeli","documentHash":"43d336a9-ec5f-4c01-8731-34050957d4c2"},{"objectId":"6788ba13fdbe8373455da9be","name":"C.","lastName":"Zhou","documentHash":"9d7b5a6b-cc56-4113-a0db-0ca7ceb9afe3"},{"objectId":"6788ba13fdbe8373455da9bd","name":"R.","lastName":"Yokomi","documentHash":"5c23bf78-4a49-48f1-bb00-2993faea4a2a"},{"objectId":"6788ba13fdbe8373455da9bc","name":"W.

Those agents remain on regulatory lists, creating barriers in trade and plant certification. Historically identified based solely on symptoms, these agents lack isolates or sequence data, making reliable detection or risk assessment impossible. After reviewing over 120 such agents across 10 key plant genera, we recommend their removal from regulatory lists and call for revised standards aligned with modern diagnostics.

The development of grey mould on spinach leaves was inhibited in the treatment with\n4 h biofumigation with the volatiles from mustard S seeds in experiments conducted at 10 °C and also at 18 °C. In the\nsensory and storage quality analysis, the spinach leaves treated with volatiles from mustard seeds showed acceptable\nparameters that predisposed the product to consumption. The results show that it is possible to reduce the incidence\nof vegetable grey mould with the treatment of milled mustard seeds, opening a potential application of biofumigation\nin the control of B. cinerea in vegetables."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709401878c28a0473b4c2c","5e709200878c28a04738e64f","5e709295878c28a04739869a","5e709288878c28a047397765","5e70928e878c28a047397d8c"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"61","issue":"1","pagesFromTo":"66-76","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928e878c28a047397d8c","5e709295878c28a04739869a","5e709288878c28a047397765","5e709401878c28a0473b4c2c","5e709200878c28a04738e64f"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792cd","mniswId":"16209","title":"PLANT PROTECTION SCIENCE","issn":"1212-2580","documentHash":"dbad0dee-82db-475b-ae0d-7936ff5da6b1"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"678e34f4fdbe8352f866a3d6","year":"2025","volume":"61","number":"1","documentHash":"be8f3615-ba46-4683-9f63-82f7d4113d56"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biofumigation","mustard","grey mould","cucumber","bean"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655040294"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"679a1a53fdbe831aedcbae64","name":"B.","lastName":"Idczak","documentHash":"05f65149-376b-4a5e-8155-6b2029bde3d4"},{"objectId":"679a1a53fdbe831aedcbae63","name":"E.","lastName":"Żurawicz","documentHash":"eba11f0a-96f5-4615-82ae-2d0e578827c0"},{"objectId":"679a1a53fdbe831aedcbae62","name":"M.U.","lastName":"Korbin","documentHash":"d98d9bdc-6513-4d7c-97b5-43c9df59f353"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c1e","name":"Marek","lastName":"Szymajda","uuid":"9FDF7765FBA01A0940EFE3D842149684D9F84C7430CE9AD5FF8E82D2E71C8A02F41C6DC2E24B7F9B8DAFDBE52AF2F373BD4E7865783AA9D4757AB5522E062743","orcidId":"0000-0001-9734-7016","documentHash":"f46dc0b5-1c16-453c-94dd-7b8d1f4da775"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397eaf","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Masny","uuid":"1F339AF20AD04B12026C56880F3C3B14CD67FDFBF04C4F0F747194E7FE88D355D5D8CC47EBDFB5327AC47237CF1139F5E348395AE3A6A14D01F3BCA771F5F703","orcidId":"0000-0002-6727-5653","documentHash":"1b781e37-8fe9-473e-8e62-0103934482ee"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397e96","name":"Anita","lastName":"Kuras","uuid":"80DA45629098C8E91C25095841315C03495C9DCF893055A8291C9132BD0B647BB2A256A4611B921DE32C7262DE06E84BE4DA69B90547F014E3832537C1FF039A","orcidId":"0000-0003-4724-788X","documentHash":"2ad3784f-b10c-4be2-8f13-62fd3d58636d"}],"objectId":"679a1a53fdbe831aedcbae60","doi":"10.17660/actahortic.2024.1408.17","publicUri":"https://www.actahort.org/members/showpdf?booknrarnr=1408_17","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"Direction of sour cherry breeding in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Beginning of regular sour cherry breeding in Poland dates back to the 1950s. Breeding activity, focused on the extension of the range of cultivars well-suited to our bio-meteorological conditions, resulted in several promising cultivars such as ‘Nefris’, ‘Wanda’, ‘Lucyna’, ‘Sabina’, and then ‘Koral’ – all bred in the Institute of Horticulture in Skierniewice. Later on, our breeding program has been targeted not only on high productivity and quality of fruits but also on the blooming and harvest time, as well as on suitability for mechanical harvesting. Both were aimed at extending the period of availability of cherries on the market and reducing labor costs. The breeding program has been constantly improving by using for hybridization new parental forms from Polish and foreign genetic resources. Recently, breeding has been supported by the embryo rescue technique in case of difficulties in seed germination, and by SSR-based tests (molecular passport of the cultivars and confirmation of the progeny origin). Three latest results of our breeding – cultivars ‘Galena’, ‘Granda’ and ‘Ekowis’ were registered in the National List of Varieties of Fruit Plants in 2013, 2020 and 2021, respectively. ‘Granda’ and ‘Ekowis’ are also legally protected by Plant Breeders’ Rights in the Research Centre for Cultivar Testing (COBORU, PL). The new cultivars and clones characterize with low to moderate susceptibility to diseases, are suitable for processing and fresh consumption, ripen at total from June to the end of July, have high yields and some of them can be combine-harvested."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928f878c28a047397eaf","5e70928f878c28a047397e96","5e709401878c28a0473b4c1e"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","issue":"1408","pagesFromTo":"127-132","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["679a1a53fdbe831aedcbae62","679a1a53fdbe831aedcbae63","5e709401878c28a0473b4c1e","679a1a53fdbe831aedcbae64","5e70928f878c28a047397e96","5e70928f878c28a047397eaf"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e71002c46e0fb0001b60a3e","title":"Acta Horticulturae","issn":"0567-7572","documentHash":"02f4af12-405b-45e1-b66e-a9c36a705bc7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"679a1a53fdbe831aedcbae61","year":"2024","number":"1408","documentHash":"3cb67a3d-1208-4eda-9960-508745c35784"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Prunus cerasus","new cultivars","conventional & unconventional methods"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655040564"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4ad4","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Głuszek","uuid":"0C82F5F3CC7ACBB922A4B35BB3D33B2AA74398112C0287172F38AE599DBA5B21FFF352F03E0841D8AA3CA9FA46A17D8A871215ADBE0877B4D4172EDD4C3C05F4","orcidId":"0000-0003-3158-6828","documentHash":"fd9b0f17-39c3-4b22-9278-c5b6f1391dac"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4ac0","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Derkowska","uuid":"DC2C866AE8A6C089963E14A3845F032DBE76438ED234E2ECFB55841FDA45D276725BB2F275E7B39BC568D8C8887852E3B052F02A216D95BD81DC65C8A9577276","orcidId":"0000-0003-4108-336X","documentHash":"2c421a7d-ba04-4bea-af0d-5cd6b446754d"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a0473986e0","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Treder","uuid":"CA809C02520EED47C9A82056AF627806F94D6BB9721D9DB8BB14025A6684CE9FE71CFD1C9D18ECE0B1A2610D5554D573E7368A857C8E508CD75D20E6A051643E","orcidId":"0000-0003-1640-9671","documentHash":"c6034984-8a2c-4af0-ae6a-63868a0ca950"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a047398696","name":"Beata","lastName":"Sumorok","uuid":"30B3437D3166078ADC8E6F0EEBAF4D410B4D95DED2503F8F9087AAC9CC1CFC9A8E26A851803FE57C8868713678466973797C488003428654AE0EB39EEBF91B79","orcidId":"0000-0001-7688-2570","documentHash":"be7e26f8-c9ed-4720-b742-78865742da19"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398362","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Sas-Paszt","uuid":"F65BF0798F03691C5ACA3C2A1EA4E5FD87ED5CB37729DF32BC5DB47710F0EBA374AA8CB082C6E75E322B257742E90231A958EB8FE9204AC6F2B651D5DF6471FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-4076-4032","documentHash":"c4b1b795-a964-4309-87da-3ec6e5c5aacd"},{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a04739774c","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Górnik","uuid":"19AD443F777649DA4F15E704C3941EEF104D6A04AFF5BDD504891FF22EAEDDB9D1AFA2A3756E511232FFA08C6F55B87394C1AC7473173212E5961083E7CE3B34","orcidId":"0000-0002-6612-6779","documentHash":"76a1c56b-5e2d-4e68-b4f3-93eae65930b6"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2024},"objectId":"6790e4c3fdbe835da54ebba9","doi":"10.17221/69/2023-hortsci","publicUri":"http://hortsci.agriculturejournals.cz/doi/10.17221/69/2023-HORTSCI.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2024,"title":"The influence of bioproducts on mycorrhizal occurrence in the vegetable roots","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the study was to assess the impact of the use of biofertilizers on the degree of coloniza-\ntion of cucumber and tomato plant roots by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and the number of AMF spores in the\nrhizosphere soil.

In the case of apple, it has been shown that triploid genotypes are characterized by many beneficial features that can make them superior to diploid cultivars, such as vigorous growth, high-quality large fruits and increased adaptability to biotic and abiotic stress factors. The aim of the presented study was to evaluate the possibility of using synthetic autotetraploid (4x) forms of ‘Pinova’ and ‘Free Redstar’ apple cultivars in the crossings to develop triploid (3x) genotypes. The diploid (2x) cultivar ‘Šampion’ was used as a pollinator in 4x×2x crosses. Microscopic observations showed that the pollen grains of tetraploid forms of ‘Pinova’ and ‘Free Redstar’ were significantly larger but their viability and germination were reduced compared to that of diploid ‘Pinova’, ‘Free Redstar’ and ‘Šampion’. In the case of interploid crossings, in both crossing directions (2x×4x and 4x×2x), few pollen tubes were observed in the pistil. As a result of ‘Pinova’ (4x) × ‘Šampion’ (2x) interploid cross-pollination, six seedlings were obtained, while all crosses ‘Free Redstar (4x) × ‘Šampion’ (2x) failed. Evaluation of the obtained progeny by flow cytometry showed that five of the seedlings are triploid and one is tetraploid. The genetic status of the seedlings analyzed by comparative profiling of SSR molecular markers confirmed that they originated from the parental forms used in the crosses."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","5e709434878c28a0473b81d3","5e709292878c28a047398339","5e7092db878c28a04739e38c","64546a2940e3ff38f8b353a1","5e70928f878c28a047397ea0"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","issue":"1412","pagesFromTo":"251-260","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709434878c28a0473b81d3","5e7092db878c28a04739e38c","5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","5e70928f878c28a047397ea0","5e709292878c28a047398339","64546a2940e3ff38f8b353a1"]},"journal":{"objectId":"61b9abddad204581b62eba67","mniswId":"201401","title":"Acta Horticulturae","issn":"0567-7572","documentHash":"571116f9-2d73-46be-a4d7-d594c8f850cd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"678f5595fdbe835856b24471","year":"2024","number":"1412","documentHash":"19273b78-8198-48b1-b7d4-30cdee0b0feb"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pollen viability","pollen germination","flow cytometry","ploidy level","SSR markers"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747655053185"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4b57","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kicińska","uuid":"EC5DE12EDE5B265063BD3D60DDD3875A1F00C3856E449082E09CF849EB32AA28B297AB6E2E9429808B8CCAB4BD1408B51A4BCB3C54F468BCF82419F2DF21C7C3","orcidId":"0000-0002-0773-7449","documentHash":"639c6b75-b014-4400-a23c-4b194d19ab2a"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a0473986b2","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Szymczak","uuid":"79B7BBA6B744AC9AC2CEFB7D6FA8AFF5C38009855D3AAA0FC54013F592B19C8CEB922961865060C2F15B6A7CB969D2897335AB1BAB67999A7581740225AC9D31","orcidId":"0000-0002-9090-7604","documentHash":"fc6fa606-bde2-4b70-8945-6760b9af75a9"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397ec3","name":"Artur","lastName":"Miszczak","uuid":"AB1A4BECA5CB0D8BA050DDFFBC80FD1E3F8F8BBE326F903E3E96A28D7322A5689DDE77E06719FB80D9420583057BB6D9794EB0B0D3267950C4268619318FB191","orcidId":"0000-0002-8201-6836","documentHash":"2be6d73e-feb0-4037-9bd4-98c93014f5bb"}],"objectId":"682c208cfdbe8315623ddef3","doi":"10.17660/actahortic.2025.1427.13","publicUri":"https://www.actahort.org/members/showpdf?booknrarnr=1427_13","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Detection of pesticide residues in conventional versus organic crops and food in Poland","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Plant protection products (PPPs) are widely used in conventional agriculture to control pests and increase crop yields. Still, their residues can remain in/on fruits, vegetables, and grains, posing a potential risk to human health when consumed. On the other hand, organic farming prohibits synthetic pesticides and promotes natural methods of pest control. In Poland, as in other EU countries, detecting pesticide residues in conventional and organic crops and food is a subject of research and monitoring by regulatory authorities, scientific institutions, and private laboratories. Data presented in this study comes mainly from the Food Safety Laboratory in the National Institute of Horticultural Research (FSL), as this laboratory participates in official monitoring and, at the same time, analyzes samples from the private sector. Monitoring on the correct use of PPPs by Polish farmers in their conventional crops, carried out for the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) in 2023, shows that out of a total of 1,300 samples tested, no residues of PPPs were found in 510 samples, i.e. 39.2% of the total analyzed. In 755 samples, i.e., 58.1%, residues below the maximum residue level (MRL) were detected; among them - 167 samples contained residues of incorrect pesticides, i.e., not registered by MARD for the tested crops. MRL violations specified in EU regulations were found in 35 cases (2.7% of the total samples). At the same time, in 202 samples sent for analysis by certification bodies in organic farming, residues were detected in 33 cases (16.3%). These were most often detections of single pesticides occurring at low levels. On the other hand, organic samples sent by companies verifying food products before sale showed that approximately 30% of the nearly 350 samples analyzed by FSL in 2023 contained pesticide residues."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709401878c28a0473b4b57","5e709295878c28a0473986b2","5e70928f878c28a047397ec3"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","issue":"1427","pagesFromTo":"101-108","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928f878c28a047397ec3","5e709295878c28a0473986b2","5e709401878c28a0473b4b57"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e71002c46e0fb0001b60a3e","title":"Acta Horticulturae","issn":"0567-7572","documentHash":"02f4af12-405b-45e1-b66e-a9c36a705bc7"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"682c208cfdbe8315623ddef4","year":"2025","number":"1427","documentHash":"769e5888-6357-40eb-b1fc-3381d8920095"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pesticide residues","organic farming","conventional agriculture","crops","food"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747779470598"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"6798a325fdbe834383a7bdbf","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kowalczys","documentHash":"60ab9516-b4cc-4ed6-ad9a-34222c2cb206"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b81d3","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"15C84D361E7F90D4BC9678770A73D2603CAF45B8230680F4C3B3F1A7800752AE280D80EC1A108C0FE59CC58F62B268FE75D4405BA63AC5570743AB59944C41E5","orcidId":"0000-0002-3556-8080","documentHash":"88d10266-fa30-4cda-bfba-7401a9772c60"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c22","name":"Artur","lastName":"Mikiciński","uuid":"1876B2C9DBBE82492F5579859B3368B35FCDB39BAFBDC22CC1FF09CB6E6FD429437C183C2765036886926F810A26D3AF34A87CC0ADB3A664BB2088A653E40DD3","orcidId":"0000-0002-4047-0918","documentHash":"ae7cc2d7-81b7-45ad-8c4b-eb72d9ccf73b"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a0473983a3","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Sobiczewski","uuid":"043EDCCAEE224C9E3FB91A4CBD06FF271FA0A2E5027F427C9F4FA028BA6E00DD8CAC0E8AA3EFA8A41F4CBD1D888131A920E51CACABF95AA1113F1783055EA4AA","orcidId":"0000-0001-9925-3611","documentHash":"83c979d7-ef2f-4ba8-85d0-1ef16c219dbf"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2025-01-27","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"6798a325fdbe834383a7bdbd","doi":"10.1007/s10658-025-03003-6","publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10658-025-03003-6.pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Induction of defence responses in apple trees by treatment with products of natural origin","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"One of the promising directions for protecting plants against diseases is to induce their mechanisms of resistance by plant resistance inducers (PRIs). In addition to assessing the effectiveness of such a strategy, it is important to elucidate the molecular basis of changes occurring in the plant after the use of the studied inducer. In this study, three products of natural origin: protein harpin derived from Erwinia amylovora, a causal agent of fire blight, commercialized as Messenger® and ethanol extracts from ivy (Hedera helix) and mistletoe (Viscum album) were examined for their potential to induce defense-related genes in apple (Malus × domestica) cv. ‘Ligol’. Their potential usefulness in protecting plants against diseases has been confirmed by other authors. For expression profiling, two approaches, cDNA-AFLP and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were used. Thirty-eight differentially expressed sequence tags (dESTs) were identified in leaves of plants sprayed with each Messenger® formulation and ivy extract and 37 dESTs – after treatment with mistletoe extract. Most of the genes were up-regulated in response to treatments. The majority of identified dESTs were involved in signalling pathways, defence and stress response, cell cycle and morphogenesis, as well as protein processing or transport. The qRT-PCR analysis of selected defence-related genes revealed, that PR genes were strongly up-regulated in response to treatments, while expression of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes and enzymes of phenylpropanoid pathway were only little or not at all affected. The expression of PR genes, considered as markers of systemic acquired resistance (SAR), was most strongly induced in leaves of apple ‘Ligol’ in response to spraying with mistletoe extract."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709401878c28a0473b4c22","5e709434878c28a0473b81d3","5e709292878c28a0473983a3"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"172","pagesFromTo":"315-327","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709434878c28a0473b81d3","5e709401878c28a0473b4c22","6798a325fdbe834383a7bdbf","5e709292878c28a0473983a3"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477be8","mniswId":"6248","title":"European Journal of Plant Pathology","issn":"0929-1873","eissn":"1573-8469","documentHash":"ba5f2ac8-c16e-4f6c-844d-ba543c6bf1b6"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"6798a325fdbe834383a7bdbe","year":"2025","documentHash":"eaae72d8-f354-495d-9a39-735ec3627161"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["transcript profiling","CDNA-AFLP","PR genes","Messenger®","ivy extract","mistletoe extract"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747952396371"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"637d93b9752340568b01c2f7","name":"Niall","lastName":"Dickinson","uuid":"A5E2934E0B17FC740F8F6B6FD241D864786E4AA2E0FE6C49C89FEC64A76191834BEAAB5DA57ADF4FA6EBA464C3962588A0111B3C4D403C3EFBF3F179DF336F12","documentHash":"532086f9-7740-4229-88b9-319c62d68b1d"},{"objectId":"5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ropelewska","uuid":"E3575740307CA373F3BD454AAC58C202E1C2CA28B9FC90C6BC3006DB867893BEE70DFAC85C7D9667CD0ACB7837B8DF63F7D6636679B032F0F1E0E534A3F3CBD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8891-236X","documentHash":"e9d0e369-fc46-40fe-9cb3-5236d6ea38a0"},{"objectId":"5e7094a7878c28a0473c10f5","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Pąśko","uuid":"DE40123461286F717FE9AA707403B9432EA5B8CF4C492B978A16B5F7D826264306C8E36782FE8F2805C63577B50FC4D90F31E95DAC6CD0D6C3BE14D01C8A82D0","orcidId":"0000-0001-8997-5266","documentHash":"279599d5-0ec1-4749-9932-26742baf2b02"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4a96","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Bielicki","uuid":"312ED47D2915DABD71B5B8588B71DEE3544B35DF11BE673F806B9939D7C99F92AB2B65A7FF204374D97189BD34ADC0A24D0A9DD611702919E49FDD60189A3B1B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5730-2312","documentHash":"479221fd-ba0e-4c8b-aa57-18b9ef62c69c"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397ea0","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Lewandowski","uuid":"FF9CB12B6F29964A550A5E57E5FD89260B52352595E70F20C435F3D419C03232071E90EF786DD9DE8845ACEF45C58EFA629D010F430B68BF6C31B8E066171866","orcidId":"0000-0002-4852-5514","documentHash":"a75b54d4-0935-425b-ad8e-156f972f1c3e"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-05-09","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"68248eaefdbe836c41b9eec7","doi":"10.3390/su17104317","publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/17/10/4317/pdf","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"Relationships Between Chemical Properties, Color Parameters, and Image Features of New Clones of Apples (Malus domestica L.) from Ecological Cultivation","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study aimed at determining the relationships between the selected quality properties of four new apple clones: ‘Free Redstar’ × ‘Melfree’, ‘Free Redstar’ × ‘Ariwa’, ‘Free Redstar’ × ‘Rajka’, and ‘Free Redstar’ × ‘Rubinola’. Significant differences between the selected clones in terms of quality properties were revealed. For example, the ‘Free Redstar’ × ‘Ariwa’ clone had the highest total sugar content (132.7 g kg−1) and total polyphenol content (TPC) (260.7 mg 100 g−1 GAE), while ‘Free Redstar’ × ‘Rajka’ was characterized by the highest total acid level of 739.0 mg 100 g−1 and the lowest a* value of −0.62, which were significantly different from all other clones. Correlations between image textures and chemical and color characteristics were observed. Among the sugars, sucrose showed the strongest positive correlation with the selected texture parameters of images in color channel Y, obtaining a Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of 0.946, while sorbitol had the strongest negative correlation (R = −0.946) with the selected texture of images in color channel b. In terms of acids, the Pearson correlation coefficient was up to 0.953 for the relationship between the content of citric acid and the selected texture of images in color channel G, and for TPC, the value of Pearson’s correlation coefficient reached 0.921 for the selected texture feature of images in color channel X. Regarding color parameters, the correlations were also strong, reaching 0.945 between parameter a* and the selected texture of the images in color channel a. These findings provide insights into the potential use of image texture analysis in combination with chemical profiling for evaluating apple quality and clone differentiation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a7878c28a0473c10f5","5e709400878c28a0473b4a96","5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","5e70928f878c28a047397ea0","637d93b9752340568b01c2f7"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"17","issue":"10","pagesFromTo":"4317","articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","637d93b9752340568b01c2f7","5e709400878c28a0473b4a96","5e7094a7878c28a0473c10f5","5e70928f878c28a047397ea0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5ec0064fad49b31cced97ee1","title":"Sustainability","doi":"10.3390/su","issn":"2071-1050","eissn":"2071-1050","documentHash":"eb388892-6801-4141-aec4-18c5219948bd"},"_version":4,"journalIssue":{"objectId":"68248eaefdbe836c41b9eec8","year":"2025","volume":"17","number":"10","documentHash":"fa0df605-89fa-4cf8-9aa3-8f4e6953db70"},"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["apple clones","sugars","acids","phenolic content","flesh color","image textures","correlation"]}],"lastRefresh":"1747952398969"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"63d00fd94097076d267abfd5","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Denisow","documentHash":"aaf81dbf-5cd3-4c08-a3ad-67412616e7b3"},{"objectId":"5eec31f47523404d1000ea2e","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Jachuła","uuid":"53D9EC0B80F8CE39263F5F1EE2D8B339894DC4A3233245366D89476CC68C59970463D9A9CE67166CB85C07A89102DBC41B63EB898B47A87BA6C5C3774403BD53","orcidId":"0000-0001-8949-776X","documentHash":"44c1042c-286f-4525-b681-c1fe501b4a57"},{"objectId":"5e709319878c28a0473a2cd0","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Ziółkowska","uuid":"51892CE28E27A15FE63B24D8A5873F76093DDA0920F7BC4E7FE2A71AE99F173B912425E38D7847EEBDA452296F83307076CCC645CAC33C8D7E1066212767C949","documentHash":"388165fe-4e3e-4d85-8281-0eb80639f9bb"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a04739ff3e","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Wrzesień","uuid":"BEF260DCA601E3A3346E03A25AF19BDD6B0C75C584B137C4738D2DD957098D4F1A9664A3FC2E2998BD7BA5D4439BF6144A9CCD75524CA847DC4089E7A543AD5B","orcidId":"0000-0002-9503-5403","documentHash":"0c029cd3-eaeb-460a-87a3-d0f4a27737f5"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-04-10","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OTHER"},"objectId":"62b582704097075e19dcd663","doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156551","publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/handle/item/551366","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2022,"title":"The need for weeds : man-made, non-cropped habitats complement crops and natural habitats in providing honey bees and bumble bees with pollen resources","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In Europe, honey bees and bumble bees are among the most important pollinators, and there is a growing interest in understanding the effects of floral resource availability on their survival. Yet, to date, data on nectar and pollen supplies available to bees in agricultural landscapes are still scarce. In this paper, we quantify species-, habitat- and landscape-scale pollen production in the Lublin Upland, SE Poland. The production per unit area was highest (mean = 2.2–2.6 g/m$^{2}$) in non-forest woody vegetation, field margins and fallows, whilst significantly lower pollen amounts were shown to be available in road verges and railway embankments (mean = 1.3–1.6 g/m$^{2}$). At landscape scale, natural and semi-natural areas (forests and meadows/pastures) offered ca. 44% of the total pollen resources during the year. Relatively high amounts of pollen (ca. 35% of the year-round total pollen resources) were from winter rape, but this resource was short-term. Man-made, non-cropped habitats added only ca. 18% of the total pollen mass offered for pollinators during flowering season. However, they provided 66–99% of pollen resources available from July to October. There exists an imbalance in the availability of pollen resources throughout the year. Hence, a diversity of natural, semi-natural and man-made, non-cropped areas is required to support the seasonal continuity of pollen resources for pollinators in an agricultural landscape. Efforts should be made to secure habitat heterogeneity to enhance the flower diversity and continual pollen availability for pollinators."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5eec31f47523404d1000ea2e"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709319878c28a0473a2cd0"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"}],"mainLanguage":"eng","mainLanguageName":"angielski","volume":"840","articleEvaluation":{"isReview":false},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5eec31f47523404d1000ea2e","63d00fd94097076d267abfd5","5e7092f5878c28a04739ff3e","5e709319878c28a0473a2cd0"]},"journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"Science of the Total Environment","issn":"0048-9697","metadataSource":"SCOPUS","documentHash":"59516ca8-3554-4f06-a1d4-f330ee71985e"},"_version":4,"translation":false,"editors":[],"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"translationEditors":[],"keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pollen","man-made habitats","insect pollinators","resource gaps","agricultural landscape"]}],"lastRefresh":"1748039396581"},{"authors":[{"objectId":"5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ropelewska","uuid":"E3575740307CA373F3BD454AAC58C202E1C2CA28B9FC90C6BC3006DB867893BEE70DFAC85C7D9667CD0ACB7837B8DF63F7D6636679B032F0F1E0E534A3F3CBD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8891-236X","documentHash":"e9d0e369-fc46-40fe-9cb3-5236d6ea38a0"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4a25","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Szwejda-Grzybowska","uuid":"E63ABDF6CE3F6DA4DB877DAFB373AC8EE21CAFC0CDFAAA0BFF10BB63F29FB6F9DBDAEE1496421B5EA36DCA1A7313AA64673821B8C5CD0E767B6D9491422289A1","orcidId":"0000-0002-1260-5897","documentHash":"d87c59fd-a8de-4484-bf37-2aa30009886e"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397ebc","name":"Monika","lastName":"Mieszczakowska-Frąc","uuid":"6900A32F634EF1531D8F8C6ACE07E99EB67DDA525F899A042C0F3631CBD6903E79CD1E6BC74E398C0CD9A37D077102F17EEBAC43BB98995342398DA2B165761C","orcidId":"0000-0001-8786-7990","documentHash":"beeb1f34-0cfd-4aa6-909a-19583be25118"}],"openAccess":{"textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-05-15","releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL"},"objectId":"683013b8fdbe8312e616fdf1","doi":"10.1016/j.jfca.2025.107763","publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0889157525005782?httpAccept=text/xml","type":"ARTICLE","typeName":"Artykuł","year":2025,"title":"The application of image textures and physicochemical parameters for quality monitoring of freeze-dried cubes and slices of red-fleshed apples","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study aimed to assess the effect of freeze-drying on the quality of red-fleshed apples dried in the form of\ncubes and slices.
