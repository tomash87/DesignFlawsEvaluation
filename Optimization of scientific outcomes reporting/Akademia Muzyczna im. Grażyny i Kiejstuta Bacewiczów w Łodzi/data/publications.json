None of these events have been recounted in the organological literature so far. Nitrowski’s expert opinion about the organ in Kwidzyn – an instrument built between 1597 and 1609 by Joachim Zickermann and Johann Hellwig – was written in cooperation with the Salomon Klapper, the main organist at St John’s Church in Gdańsk. Nitrowski and Klapper had known each other at least since 1671/1672. It transpired that Johann Georg Wulff, who restored the Kwidzyn organ, had to make some corrections. The Drewnica contract includes detailed specifications of a new organ to be built by Nitrowski and his team. The instrument had one manual and pedals as well as 12 stops and a tremulant. It was supposed to be equipped with a completely new organ case, ivory coverings of the manual keys and a  rather modern compass including F# and G# in the bottom octave of both keyboards. With the exception of the lowest octave of Subbaß 16’, all pipes were supposed to be made of metal."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dc84","uid":"bMKM4ytaPEf2Cyxat6g8d5A","uuid":"1cdeb0b0-d2cb-4790-b753-32804af5202f","name":"Akademia Muzyczna im.

The article discusses the transformations that took place in twentieth-century pipe organ building, starting from the first attempts inspired by the revival movement in the spirit of the Baroque era (Orgelbewegung, the Alsatian Organ Reform), through neoclassical organ building, to the concept of renovation and copying of original Baroque instruments. The differences in organological approaches are demonstrated in the context \nof the increasing popularisation of Baroque music in the early twentieth century as well as the growing awareness of its changing interpretation. Today’s performance of early music focuses on the question of choosing an adequate instrument for the repertoire performed. This practice is linked to the current state of knowledge of period instruments as well as to the constantly improving condition of preserved pipe organs from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and to the interpretation based on the rudiments of historically-informed performance. However, when it comes to concerts, a contemporary organist must often deliver a varied programme which, in terms of style, would require several instruments. In such case, working with a single instrument raises an interesting challenge. To render the beauty of the music while, at the same time, capturing the individual qualities of a particular instrument requires flexibility and going beyond the usual registrations derived from historical rules. Such experience may be very inspiring. Experimenting with various combinations \nof stops or using stops of Romantic provenance in Baroque music allows the interpreter to hear the piece afresh and to create it on their own, while respecting the particular instrument."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dc84","uid":"bMKM4ytaPEf2Cyxat6g8d5A","uuid":"1cdeb0b0-d2cb-4790-b753-32804af5202f","name":"Akademia Muzyczna im.

Usually improvised, voluntaries were composed by organists as early as in the 16th century. Many of them were actually written down, and later also printed, which is how we discovered these pieces. This article presents a profile of the composer and his artistic career, with reference to his disability (Stanley lost his sight as a result of an accident at the age of two). His notable contribution to the development of the already established genre of voluntary may be found in his three collections of voluntaries published during his lifetime. The composer popularized the two-movement structure, and the style of his music demonstrates that he was familiar with the works of the great masters of the era, such as Handel or Corelli. With many of his works being officially published, Stanley paved the way for an increase in the umber of published organ works. The article draws attention to Stanley’s flair for improvisation, which was known and admired throughout London. The article also addresses the question of writing down music played during live performances; to what extent being aware of the origin of voluntaries, as well as knowledge of the composer’s talent for improvisation, may influence the contemporary performances of Stanley’s works."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dc84","uid":"bMKM4ytaPEf2Cyxat6g8d5A","uuid":"1cdeb0b0-d2cb-4790-b753-32804af5202f","name":"Akademia Muzyczna im.

The structure of the late-Baroque aria, perpetuated by Mattheson, usually takes the form of an aria da capo also in Haendel's works; following the Italian model, we may distinguish in it such parts as exordium, narratio prepositio, confutatio, confirmatio and the crowning peroratio. The arias that we may find in Haendel’s works, despite their similar formal structure, are diverse in terms of the emotion, i.e. the affect that they express. We may distinguish such types of arias as the tender aria cantabile, the majestic aria di portamento, the aria di mezzocarattere full of doubt, the violent aria agitata, the virtuosic aria di bravura or the aria concertata inspired by a solo concerto, along with its three variants (aria simile, aria di guerra, aria di caccia). Each aria is accompanied by a wide range of expressive means to emphasize the main emotion. An important element, at the performer’s discretion, is the choice of ornamentation appropriate to the character of the aria and the manner of its performance."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dc84","uid":"bMKM4ytaPEf2Cyxat6g8d5A","uuid":"1cdeb0b0-d2cb-4790-b753-32804af5202f","name":"Akademia Muzyczna im.
