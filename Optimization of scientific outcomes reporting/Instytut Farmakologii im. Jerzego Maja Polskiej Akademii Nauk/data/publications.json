With these interindividual differences and a number of antidepressants to choose from, the first choice of treatment often fails to produce improvement in the patient's condition. A substantial part of the variation in response to antidepressants can be explained by genetic factors. Accordingly, variants related to drug metabolism in two pharmacogenes, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, have already been translated into guidelines for antidepressant prescriptions. The role of variants in other genes that influence antidepressant responses is not yet understood. Furthermore, rare and individual variants account for a substantial part of genetic differences in antidepressant efficacy. Recent years have brought a tremendous increase in the accessibility of genome sequencing in terms of data availability and its clinical use. In this review, we summarize recent developments and current issues in the personalization of major depressive disorder treatment through pharmacogenomics."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

It is postulated that antidepressants may harm male fertility, but the cellular mechanism is still poorly understood. The role of growth factors and klotho protein in maintaining normal male reproductive function is well documented. Hence, the study aimed to investigate the effect of the antidepressant drug – imipramine (tricyclic AD), and other substances with antidepressant potential (ALS), administered in combination or in combination with LPS (an animal model of depression) on gene expression and protein synthesis of IGF-2 (insulin-like growth factor 2), TGF-β1 (transforming growth factor β1), NGF (nerve growth factor), KGF (keratinocyte growth factor) and protein synthesis of VEGF-A (vascular endothelial growth factor A), IGF-IR (insulin-like growth factor receptor 1), EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and klotho in the testis of mice. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with selected ALS and LPS or 10% DMSO (controls) (n = 7/group) once a day for 14 days. Animals were decapitated and testes collected for RNA and protein purification. PCR and western blot methods were employed for the evaluation of growth factors and klotho expression. The results obtained indicated a decreased level of most of the analyzed genes and proteins, except KGF; its expression increased after treatment with MTEP and IMI administrated individually and after NS-398, and IMI in combination with LPS. Our results may suggest that the tested ALS and LPS can contribute to a reduction of male fertility, but NS-398, IMI, and IMI+NS-398 may also act as stimulants after LPS."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

We evaluated the association between patient dissatisfaction and five categories of variables:1) sociodemographic; 2) preoperative pain and disability [pain duration, level of surgery, previous spinal surgeries, pain scores as measured by the Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ), numerical rating of average pain (NRS), disability as measured by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)]; 3) preoperative psychological status [depression, anxiety, and overall distress as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), life satisfaction as measured by the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), and surgery expectations (SE) as measured by a Likert scale]; 4) postoperative improvements in pain and disability [improvements in SF-MPQ, improvement in ODI] and 5) postoperative psychological status [HADS, SWLS]. Results showed that 17.8% patients were dissatisfied with surgery. In the multivariate logistic analysis, more negative surgery expectations, smaller improvement in ODI scores, and a greater postoperative overall distress were significant risk factors associated with patient dissatisfaction with surgery."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c1878c28a0473b040b","5e7092cb878c28a04739cc01","5e709321878c28a0473a342e","5e70925e878c28a047394815","5e709470878c28a0473bd040"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

To overcome these challenges, attempts have been made to use safer enantiomer ((R)-ketamine) or mGlu2/3 receptor antagonists, which induce ketamine-like effects and enhance its action. Here, we propose combining these two strategies to investigate the antidepressant-like effects of low doses of two ketamine enantiomers in combination with a low dose of the mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist LY341495. Rapid and sustained antidepressant-like effects were assessed in C57BL/6J mice using the tail suspension test (TST) and the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model of depression in stress-naïve mice. ELISA was used to measure BDNF levels. In the TST, low doses of both (S)-ketamine and (R)-ketamine were potentiated by a subeffective dose of LY341495. However, in the CUMS model, only (R)-ketamine was able to induce long-lasting anti-apathetic and anti-anhedonic effects when coadministered with low-dose LY341495. The mechanism of this drug combination was dependent on BDNF and AMPA receptor activity. ELISA results suggest that the hippocampus might be the site of this action. MGlu2/3 receptor antagonists, in combination with (R)-ketamine, may serve as potential RAADs, with a high efficiency and low risk of side effects."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Ribavirin serves as a model molecule because it possesses a broad-spectrum antiviral effect against RNA viruses, which are expected as emerging viruses. The choice of monomers enables to stabilize the pre-polymerization complex and to synthesize biocompatible polymers. Predictive studies as well as experimental works conclude similar results on best ribavirin:monomers ratios. Thus, materials exhibit high selective cavities toward ribavirin. These affinities allow to show release profiles drastically different from the non-imprinted ones at two temperatures. The imprinted materials show a sustained profile able to release antiviral for more than 24 h. The hydrogels obtained are biocompatible with model cells retained, human lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells. Cell viability is excellent and pro-inflammatory response is insignificant when imprinted polymers are incubated with cells. Finally, viral tests carried out on Influenza A infected lung cells show that imprinted delivery systems delivering 1 to 3 µg of antiviral have the same efficiency as a medium containing 30 µg mL-1 of active agent. As a very interesting result, the molecularly imprinted polymers as drug delivery systems allow to increase the local concentration of antiviral, to improve their delivery when its bioavailability is low."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

A known ROS generator, pesticide paraquat (PQ), was indicated as an environmental substance potentially increasing the incidence of PD and is used to model this disease. We investigated if a combination of inflammation and oxidative stress in subthreshold doses would exacerbate the modelled neuropathology.\n\nMethods: We examined the late effects of acute or repeated peripheral inflammation induced by low dose of LPS (10 μg/kg, ip) on PQ toxicity in the rat nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, microglial activation markers and expression of major Lewy bodies proteins, α-synuclein and synphilin-1.\n\nResults: We observed that LPS increased, while PQ decreased body temperature and microglia CD11b expression in the SN. Single LPS pretreatment, 3 h before repeated weekly PQ injections (4×) slightly aggravated neuronal degeneration in the SN. Moreover, degeneration of dopaminergic neurons after weekly repeated inflammation itself (4×) was observed. Interestingly, repeated LPS administration combined with each PQ dose counteracted such effect. The expression of α-synuclein decreased after repeated LPS injections, while only combined, repeated LPS and PQ treatment lowered the levels of synphilin-1. Therefore, α-synuclein and synphilin-1 expression change was influenced by different mechanisms. Concomitantly, decreased levels of the two proteins correlated with decreased degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and with a normalized microglia activation marker.\n\nConclusions: Our results indicate that both oxidative insult triggered by PQ and inflammation caused by peripheral LPS injection can individually induce neurotoxicity. Those factors act through different mechanisms that are not additive and not selective towards dopaminergic neurons, probably implying microglia.

In particular, the -NBOMe series, which are more potent than their 2C compounds analogs, are considered worthy substitutes for LSD by users. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of 25H-NBOMe and its halogenated derivatives (25I-NBOMe and 25B-NBOMe) in comparison to their 2C compounds analogs and LSD on the sensorimotor (visual, acoustic, and overall tactile), reaction time, spontaneous (total distance traveled) and stimulated (drag, accelerod test) motor activity, grip strength test, and prepulse inhibition (PPI) responses in mice. Systemic administration of -NBOMe, 2C compounds analogs, and LSD (0.001-10 mg/kg) differently impaired the sensorimotor, reaction time, motor, and PPI responses in mice. In particular, halogenated (25I and 25B)-NBOMe derivatives appear to be more effective than the entire class of 2C compounds analogs in altering visual and acoustic responses, affecting reaction time, and motor and sensory gating in PPI test. In fact, the specific rank order of compounds potency for nearly all of the experiments showed that (25I and 25B)-NBOMe were more potent than 2C compounds analogs and LSD. -NBOMe and 2C compounds analogs impaired not only the reception of incoming sensory stimuli (visual and acoustic), but their correct brain processing (PPI) in an equal and sometimes stronger way than LSD. This sensory impairment directly affected the spontaneous motor response and reaction time of mice, with no change in performance in stimulated motor activity tests. These aspects should be carefully considered to better understand the potential danger that psychedelic phenethylamines, in particular -NBOMe, may pose to public health, with particular reference to decreased performance in driving and hazardous works that require special sensorimotor skills."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Platelets are the reservoir of transforming growth factor 1 (TGF-β1), a multipotent cytokine involved in the maintenance of, i.a., central nervous system homeostasis. Here, we analyzed the effect of a decrease in TGF-β1 active form on synaptic proteins levels, and brain electrophysiology, in mice after intraperitoneal (ip) administration of TGF-β1 antibody (anti-TGF-β1; 1 mg/mL). Next, we correlated it with a thrombocytopenia-induced TGF-β1 decrease, documented in an azoxymethane-induced (AOM; 100 mM ip) model of ALF, and clarified the impact of TGF-β1 decrease on blood–brain barrier functionality. The increase of both synaptophysin and synaptotagmin in the cytosolic fraction, and its reduction in a membrane fraction, were confirmed in the AOM mice brains. Both proteins’ decrease in analyzed fractions occurred in anti-TGF-β1 mice. In turn, an increase in postsynaptic (NR1 subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, postsynaptic density protein 95, gephyrin) proteins in the AOM brain cortex, but a selective compensatory increase of NR1 subunit in anti-TGF-β mice, was observed. The alterations of synaptic proteins levels were not translated on electrophysiological parameters in the anti-TGF-β1 model. The results suggest the impairment of synaptic vesicles docking to the postsynaptic membrane in the AOM model. Nevertheless, changes in synaptic protein level in the anti-TGF-β1 mice do not affect neurotransmission and may not contribute to neurologic deficits in AOM mice."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

We report the design, synthesis, and characterization of two novel fluorescent probes for the 5-HT1A receptor.

Fluoroprobe 5a was able to label the 5-HT1A receptor in pancreatic islet cell cultures in a selective manner, as the fluorescence emission was significantly attenuated by co-administration of the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635.

However, clinical data revealed that not only the dopaminergic system is affected in PD. Postmortem studies showed degeneration of noradrenergic cells in the locus coeruleus (LC) to an even greater extent than that observed in the SN/VTA. Pharmacological models support the concept that modification of noradrenergic transmission can influence the PD-like phenotype induced by neurotoxins. Nevertheless, there are no existing data on animal models regarding the distant impact of noradrenergic degeneration on intact SN/VTA neurons. The aim of this study was to create a transgenic mouse model with endogenously evoked progressive degeneration restricted to noradrenergic neurons and investigate its long-term impact on the dopaminergic system. To this end, we selectively ablated the transcription initiation factor-IA (TIF-IA) in neurons expressing dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) by the Cre-loxP system. This mutation mimics a condition of nucleolar stress affecting neuronal survival. TIF-IADbhCre mice were characterized by selective, progressive degeneration of noradrenergic neurons, followed by phenotypic alterations associated with sympathetic system impairment. Our studies did not show any loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells in the SN/VTA of mutant mice; however, we observed increased indices of oxidative stress, enhanced markers of glial cell activation, inflammatory processes and isolated degenerating cells positive for FluoroJade C. These results were supported by gene expression profiling of VTA and SN from TIF-IADbhCre mice, revealing that 34 out of 246 significantly regulated genes in the SN/VTA were related to PD. Overall, our results shed new light on the possible negative influence of noradrenergic degeneration on dopaminergic neurons, reinforcing the neuroprotective role of noradrenaline."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

In this study, a statistical analysis of the nature, geometry, and frequency of hydrogen bonds (HBs) formed between the aromatic and aliphatic C-F groups of small molecules and biological targets found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) repository was presented. Interaction energies were calculated for those complexes using three different approaches. The obtained results indicated that the interaction energy of F-containing HBs is determined by the donor-acceptor distance and not by the angles. Moreover, no significant relationship between the energies of HBs with fluorine and the donor type was found, implying that fluorine is a weak HB acceptor for all types of HB donors. However, the statistical analysis of the PDB repository revealed that the most populated geometric parameters of HBs did not match the calculated energetic optima. In a nutshell, HBs containing fluorine are forced to form due to the stronger ligand-receptor neighboring interactions, which make fluorine the \"donor's last resort\"."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Some μ-opioid receptor agonists with G protein bias, including SR compounds, were proposed to induce diminished side effects. However, in many aspects, behavioral effects of those compounds, as well as the mechanisms underlying differences in their action, remain unexplored. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of SR-14968 and SR-17018, highly G protein-biased opioid agonists, on antinociception, motor activity and addiction-like behaviors in C57BL/6J mice. The obtained results showed that the compounds induce strong and dose-dependent antinociception. SR-14968 causes high, and SR-17018 much lower, locomotor activity. Both agonists develop reward-associated behavior and physical dependence. The compounds also cause antinociceptive tolerance, however, developing more slowly when compared to morphine. Interestingly, SR compounds, in particular SR-17018, slow down the development of antinociceptive tolerance to morphine and inhibit some symptoms of morphine withdrawal. Therefore, our results indicate that SR agonists possess rewarding and addictive properties, but can positively modulate some symptoms of morphine dependence. Next, we have compared behavioral effects of SR-compounds and PZM21 and searched for a relationship to the substantial differences in molecular interactions that these compounds form with the µ-opioid receptor."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Although ketamine has an advantage over classic antidepressants (ADs) due to its rapid action, it remains a controversial drug due to its undesirable effects. Behavioral studies indicate that another enantiomer of ketamine, namely, (R)-ketamine, has been proposed as a safer but still effective RAAD. However, these conclusions have not been confirmed in any model of depression based on chronic environmental stress, which effectively reflects the core symptoms of this disease. Thus, we decided to compare the effects of (R)- and (S)-ketamine on chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in mice. Behavioral studies showed that (R)-ketamine induced anti-anhedonic and anti-apathetic efficacy up to seven days after administration, while the (S)-ketamine effect persisted up to 24 h or 3 days after injection. The behavioral effects of (R)-ketamine depended on the activation of TrkB receptors, while the (S)-ketamine effects did not. Western blot analyses showed that (S)-ketamine action might be related to both mTOR and ERK pathway activation and to the increased expression of GluA1 protein in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). In contrast, (R)-ketamine did not change ERK phosphorylation in the PFC, while it increased mTOR expression. (S)-Ketamine produced behavioral effects indicative of possible side effects in the dose range studied, while (R)-ketamine did not. This indicates that (R)-ketamine may be more effective, have a longer-lasting effect, and be safer to use than (S)-ketamine."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

These enzymes catalyze the biotransformation pathways of neuroactive endogenous substrates (neurosteroids, neurotransmitters) and are necessary for the detoxification processes. The aim of the present study was to assess changes in the CYP2D activity and protein level during the aging process and as a result of serotonin deficiency in the female brain. The CYP2D activity was measured in brain and liver microsomes of Dark Agouti wild type (WT) female rats (mature 15-week-old and senescent 18-month-old rats) and in tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2)-deficient senescent female rats. The CYP2D activity in mature WT Dark Agouti females was independent of the changing phases of the estrous cycle. In senescent WT females rats, the CYP2D activity and protein level were decreased in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and liver, but increased in the brain stem. In the other examined structures (frontal cortex, hypothalamus, thalamus, striatum), the enzyme activity did not change. In aging TPH2-deficient females, the CYP2D activity and protein levels were decreased in the frontal cortex, hypothalamus and brain stem (activity only), remaining unchanged in other brain structures and liver, relative to senescent WT females. In summary, the aging process and TPH2 deficit affect the CYP2D activity and protein level in female rats, which may have a negative impact on the compensatory capacity of CYP2D in the synthesis of serotonin and dopamine in cerebral structures involved in cognitive and emotional functions. In the liver, the CYP2D-catalyzed drug metabolism may be diminished in elderly females. The results in female rats are compared with those obtained previously in males. It is concluded that aging and serotonin deficiency exert sex-dependent effects on brain CYP2D, which seem to be less favorable in females concerning CYP2D-mediated neurotransmitter synthesis, but beneficial regarding slower neurosteroid metabolism."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

In this chapter, we describe a behavioral protocol for preclinical experiments in rats that can be used for the assessment of the interaction between cognitive judgment bias measured as a stable and enduring behavioral trait and decision-making under risk.\n\nFor this, the rats are initially trained and screened in a series of ambiguous-cue interpretation tests for “pessimistic” and “optimistic” traits. Subsequently, the animals are retrained and retested in the rat slot machine task, which allows the assessment of decision-making under risk and the crucial feature of gambling-like behavior that has been investigated in rats and humans—the interpretation of “near-miss” outcomes as a positive (i.e., “clear win”) situation.\n\nPreclinical modeling of these cognitive distortions in animals can facilitate our understanding of their neurobiological bases and potentially stimulate novel treatment options."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

In the present study biochemical receptor binding and proximity ligation assay were used to study possible changes in the allosteric receptor-receptor interactions and the density of the A2AR-D2R heterocomplexes in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens shell) in extinction from cocaine self-administration including cue induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking. A significant and clear-cut reduction of active lever pressing was observed in extinction on day 10 from cocaine use. In cue induced reinstatement of cocaine self-administration a significant return in active lever presses developed. In extinction, significant increases in the density of A2AR-D2R and D2R-Sigma1R heterocomplexes were observed in nucleus accumbens shell. In contrast, cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking produced no significant changes in these heteroreceptor complexes of the nucleus accumbens shell. In the 3H raclopride/quinpirole competition binding experiments, the extinction led to a significant increase in the D2R Ki, High dissociation constant in the ventral striatum upon ex vivo exposure to CGS 21680 (100 nM), compared to the same exposure performed in membrane preparations from yoked saline rats. No significant changes in D2R Ki, High values were observed in membrane preparations from rats after cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking undergoing the same exposure ex vivo to CGS 21680 when compared with membrane preparations from yoked saline rats undergoing the same procedures. It seems likely that increased formation of A2AR-D2R and putative A2AR-D2R-Sigma1R heterocomplexes in the nucleus accumbens shell is part of the mechanism for the enhanced antagonistic allosteric A2AR-D2R interactions developed in extinction learning from cocaine. It reduces cocaine reward through reduced D2R function, and these inhibitory mechanisms are no longer in operation in cue induced reinstatement of cocaine seeking."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Computational studies provided insights into the key interactions of the new compounds for FPR2 activation. In mouse microglial N9 cells and in rat primary microglial cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, selected compounds inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, counterbalanced the changes in mitochondrial function, and inhibited caspase-3 activity. Among the new agonists, (S)-11l stands out also for the ability to permeate the blood-brain barrier and to accumulate in the mouse brain in vivo, thus representing a valuable pharmacological tool for studies in vivo."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

To address this issue, we have examined the effect of a single administration of ketamine and psilocybin on the extracellular levels of neurotransmitters in the rat frontal cortex and reticular nucleus of the thalamus using microdialysis. The genotoxic effect and density of glutamate receptor proteins was measured with comet assay and Western blot, respectively. An open field test, light-dark box test and forced swim test were conducted to examine rat behavior 24 h after drug administration. Ketamine (10 mg/kg) and psilocybin (2 and 10 mg/kg) increased dopamine, serotonin, glutamate and GABA extracellular levels in the frontal cortex, while psilocybin also increased GABA in the reticular nucleus of the thalamus. Oxidative DNA damage due to psilocybin was observed in the frontal cortex and from both drugs in the hippocampus. NR2A subunit levels were increased after psilocybin (10 mg/kg). Behavioral tests showed no antidepressant or anxiolytic effects, and only ketamine suppressed rat locomotor activity. The observed changes in neurotransmission might lead to genotoxicity and increased NR2A levels, while not markedly affecting animal behavior."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

However, the direct influence of insulin signaling on abnormal α-synuclein accumulation-a hallmark of Parkinson's disease-remains poorly explored. To our best knowledge, this work is the first attempt to investigate the direct effects of insulin signaling on pathological α-synuclein accumulation induced by the addition of α-synuclein preformed fibrils in primary dopaminergic neurons. We found that modifying insulin signaling through (1) insulin receptor inhibitor GSK1904529A, (2) SHIP2 inhibitor AS1949490 or (3) PTEN inhibitor VO-OHpic failed to significantly affect α-synuclein aggregation in dopaminergic neurons, in contrast to the aggregation-reducing effects observed after the addition of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. Subsequently, we tested different media formulations, with and without insulin. Again, removal of insulin from cell culturing media showed no effect on α-synuclein accumulation. We observed, however, a reduced α-synuclein aggregation in neurons cultured in neurobasal medium with a B27 supplement, regardless of the presence of insulin, in contrast to DMEM/F12 medium with an N2 supplement. The effects of culture conditions were present only in dopaminergic but not in primary cortical or hippocampal cells, indicating the unique sensitivity of the former. Altogether, our data contravene the direct involvement of insulin signaling in the modulation of α-synuclein aggregation in dopamine neurons.

In affective disorders, recent precision nomothetic psychiatry studies disclosed new pathway phenotypes, including an ROI-reoccurrence of illness (ROI)-oxidative stress latent construct. The aim of the present study is to delineate a) whether ACEs sensitize the M1 macrophage, the T helper cells (Th)1, Th2, and Th17, the IRS (immune-inflammatory-responses system), the CIRS (compensatory immunoregulatory system), and the neuroimmunotoxic and growth factor (GF) profiles and whether they are associated with ROI and the phenome of affective disorders and b) the molecular pathways underpinning the effects of the ACEs. We collected supernatants of stimulated (5 μg/mL of PHA and 25 μg/mL of LPS) and unstimulated diluted whole blood in 20 healthy controls and 30 depressed patients and measured a panel of 27 cytokines/GF using a Luminex method. ACEs (comprising mental and physical trauma, mental neglect, domestic violence, family history of mental disease, and parent loss) are accompanied by the increased stimulated, but not unstimulated, production of M1, Th1, Th2, Th17, IRS, neuroimmunotoxic, and GF profiles and are strongly correlated with ROI and the phenome. A latent vector extracted from the ROI features (recurrent episodes and suicidal behaviors) and the IRS/neuroimmunotoxic/GF profiles explains 66.8% of the variance in the phenome and completely mediates the effects of ACEs on the phenome. Enrichment analysis showed that the ACE-associated sensitization of immune/GF profiles involves JAK-STAT, nuclear factor-κB, tumor necrosis factor-α, G-protein coupled receptor, PI3K/Akt/RAS/MAPK, and hypoxia signaling. In summary, the ACE-induced sensitization of immune pathways and secondary immune hits predicts the phenome of affective disorders."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Sugar homeostasis and intake require complex hormonal and nervous control to proper body energy balance. Added sugar in processed food results in metabolic, cardiovascular, and nervous disorders. Epidemiological reports have shown enhanced consumption of sweet products in children and adults, especially in reproductive age and in pregnant women, which can lead to the susceptibility of offspring's health to diseases in early life or in adulthood and proneness to mental disorders. In this review, we discuss the impacts of high-sugar diet (HSD) or sugar intake during the perinatal and/or postnatal periods on neural and behavioural disturbances as well as on the development of substance use disorder (SUD). Since several emotional behavioural disturbances are recognized as predictors of SUD, we also present how HSD enhances impulsive behaviour, stress, anxiety and depression. Apart from the influence of HSD on these mood disturbances, added sugar can render food addiction. Both food and addictive substances change the sensitivity of the brain rewarding neurotransmission signalling. The results of the collected studies could be important in assessing sugar intake, especially via maternal dietary patterns, from the clinical perspective of SUD prevention or pre-existing emotional disorders. Methodology: This narrative review focuses on the roles of a high-sugar diet (HSD) and added sugar in foods and on the impacts of glucose and fructose on the development of substance use disorder (SUD) and on the behavioural predictors of drugs abuse. The literature was reviewed by two authors independently according to the topic of the review. We searched the PubMed and Scopus databases and Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute open access scientific journals using the following keyword search strategy depending on the theme of the chapter: \"high-sugar diet\" OR \"high-carbohydrate diet\" OR \"sugar\" OR \"glucose\" OR \"fructose\" OR \"added sugar\" AND keywords. We excluded inaccessible or pay-walled articles, abstracts, conference papers, editorials, letters, commentary, and short notes. Reviews, experimental studies, and epidemiological data, published since 1990s, were searched and collected depending on the chapter structure. After the search, all duplicates are thrown out and full texts were read, and findings were rescreened. After the selection process, appropriate papers were included to present in this review."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Biased ligands, by favoring one of the multiple bioactive conformations of GPCRs, allow selective signaling through either of these pathways. Here, we identified Serodolin as the first β-arrestin-biased agonist of the serotonin 5-HT7 receptor. This new ligand, while acting as an inverse agonist on Gs signaling, selectively induces ERK activation in a β-arrestin-dependent way.

Both the acute and chronic administration of IMI increased the BDNF-Trkβ interaction observed 3 h after drug administration. Withdrawal of IMI for 72 h or 7 days did not alter BDNF-Trkβ interaction. A significant reduction in this interaction after chronic IMI administration followed by 21 drug-free days was observed, but it returned to the control value when a new dose of IMI was given after this time. The level of mRNA encoding BDNF or Trkβ did not change in the experimental groups of animals, so one can conclude that alterations in the BDNF-Trkβ interaction depend not on acute vs. repeated treatment with IMI but on the presence of the drug in the body. This effect correlates well with the strong pro-cognitive effect of acute IMI, assessed by the novel object recognition (NOR) test."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Modeling schizophrenia is based on inducing damage or changes in the activity of relevant regions in the rodent brain (mainly the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus).

However, individual differences among people are critical as some people exhibit vulnerability while other are resilient to repeated exposure to stress. Among the others, a recent theory postulates that alterations of energy metabolism might contribute to the development of psychopathologies. Here we show that the bioenergetic status in the ventral hippocampus (vHip), a brain subregion tightly involved in the regulation of MDD, defined the development of vulnerability or resilience following two weeks of chronic mild stress. Among the different metabolomic signatures observed, the glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle may be specifically involved in defining vulnerability, revealing a previously unappreciated mechanism of sensitivity to stress. These findings point to mitochondrial morphology and recycling as critical in the ability to cope with stress. We show that vulnerable rats favor mitochondrial fusion to counteract the overproduction of reactive oxidative species whereas resilient rats activate fission to guarantee metabolic efficiency. Our results indicate that the modulation of the energetic metabolite profile in vHip under chronic stress exposure may represent a mechanism to explain the difference between vulnerable and resilient rats, unraveling novel and promising targets for specific therapeutic interventions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Several studies have suggested that the lipophilicity of a molecule can play an important role. To date, this aspect has been studied for several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) ligands but not for the 5-HT7 receptor (5-HT7R), a GPCR proposed as a valid therapeutic target in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with abnormal neuronal connectivity. In this study, we report on structure-kinetics relationships of a set of arylpiperazine-based 5-HT7R ligands. We found that it is not the overall lipophilicity of the molecule that influences drug-target interaction kinetics but rather the position of polar groups within the molecule. Next, we performed a combination of molecular docking studies and molecular dynamics simulations to gain insights into structure-kinetics relationships. These studies did not suggest specific contact patterns between the ligands and the receptor-binding site as determinants for compounds kinetics. Finally, we compared the abilities of two 5-HT7R agonists with similar receptor-binding affinities and different residence times to stimulate the 5-HT7R-mediated neurite outgrowth in mouse neuronal primary cultures and found that the compounds induced the effect with different timing. This study provides the first insights into the binding kinetics of arylpiperazine-based 5-HT7R ligands that can be helpful to design new 5-HT7R ligands with fine-tuning of the kinetic profile."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Tremulous Jaw Movements (TJMs) are suggested to be a well-validated rodent model of PD resting tremor. TJMs can be induced by typical antipsychotics and are known to be reduced by different drugs, including adenosine A2A receptor antagonists. The aim of the present study was to search for brain structures involved in the tremorolytic action of SCH58261, a selective A2A receptor antagonist, in TJMs induced by subchronic pimozide. Besides TJMs, we evaluated in the same animals the expression of zif-268 mRNA (neuronal responsiveness marker), and mRNA levels for glutamic acid decarboxylase 65-kDa isoform (GAD65) and vesicular glutamate transporters 1 and 2 (vGluT1/2) in selected brain structures, as markers of GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, respectively. We found that SCH58261 reduced the pimozide-induced TJMs. Pimozide increased the zif-268 mRNA level in the striatum, nucleus accumbens (NAc) core, and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). Additionally, it increased GAD65 mRNA in the striatum and SNr, and vGluT2 mRNA levels in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). A positive correlation between zif-268, GAD65 and vGluT2 mRNAs and TJMs was found. SCH58261 reversed the pimozide-increased zif-268 mRNA in the striatum and NAc core and GAD65 mRNA in the striatum and SNr. In contrast, SCH58261 did not influence vGluT2 mRNA in STN. The present study suggests an importance of the striato-subthalamo-nigro-thalamic circuit in neuroleptic-induced TJMs. The tremorolytic effect of A2A receptor blockade seems to involve this circuit bypassing, however, STN."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

However, the effects of hyposerotonergia on ethanol drinking behavior are contradictory. In this study, mice deficient in tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph2−/−), the rate-limiting enzyme of 5-HT synthesis in the brain, were used to assess the role of central 5-HT in alcohol drinking behavior. Life-long 5-HT depletion in these mice led to an increased ethanol consumption in comparison to wild-type animals in a two-bottle choice test. Water consumption was increased in naïve 5-HT-depleted mice. However, exposure of Tph2−/− animals to ethanol resulted in the normalization of water intake to the level of wild-type mice. Tph2 deficiency in mice did not interfere with ethanol-evoked antidepressant response in the forced swim test. Gene expression analysis in wild-type animals revealed no change in Tph2 expression in the brain of mice consuming ethanol compared to control mice drinking water. However, within the alcohol-drinking group, inter-individual differences in chronic ethanol intake correlated with Tph2 transcript levels. Taken together, central 5-HT is an important modulator of drinking behavior in mice but is not required for the antidepressant effects of ethanol."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

ARI was administered at doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg while NAC at doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg, alone or in combination. Administration of higher doses of ARI or NAC alone, or co-treatment with lower, ineffective doses of these drugs significantly improved social and cognitive performance as assessed in behavioral tests. Both doses of NAC and 0.3 mg/kg of ARI increased the expression of BDNF mRNA in the PFC, while all doses of these drugs and their combinations enhanced the levels of BDNF protein in this brain structure. In the HIP, only 0,3 mg/kg ARI increased the levels of both BDNF mRNA and its protein.

Plant natural products are accessible, structurally diverse compounds with antimicrobial potential. The pharmacological applications of plants in medicine can be guided by the attestation of traditional use, as demonstrated in this study. In Irish ethnomedical literature, Inula helenium L. (elecampane) is often indicated for respiratory and dermal ailments. This is the first assessment of antimicrobial sesquiterpene lactones from the roots of elecampane, naturalised in Ireland. Traditional hydro-ethanolic extracts were prepared from multi-origin elecampane roots. A novel clean-up strategy facilitated the bioactivity-guided fractionation of a subset of anti-staphylococcal fractions (the compositions of which were investigated using HPLC-DAD, supported by 1H NMR). The natural products attributing to the antimicrobial activity, observed in vitro, were identified as alantolactone (1), isoalantolactone (2), igalan (3), and an unseparated mixture of dugesialactone (4) and alloalantolactone (5), as major compounds. The findings suggest that the geographical origin of the plant does not influence the anti-bacterial potency nor the chemical composition of traditional elecampane root. Considering the prevalence of staphylococci-associated infections and associated broad spectrum resistance in Irish hospitals, currently, further research is warranted into the usage of the identified compounds as potential candidates in the control of staphylococcal carriage and infection."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

The endocannabinoid system has attracted attention as an emerging drug target for OA. However, the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids is limited by psychoactive side-effects related to CB1 activation and tolerance development for analgesic effects. β-Caryophyllene (BCP) is a low-efficacy natural agonist of CB2 and a common constituent of human diet with well-established anti-inflammatory properties. The results presented herein show the anti-nociceptive and chondroprotective potential of BCP in an animal model of OA induced by intra-articular injection of monoiodoacetate (MIA). Behavioural assessment included pressure application measurement and kinetic weight bearing tests. Histological assessment of cartilage degeneration was quantified using OARSI scoring. Experiments established the dose-response effects of BCP and pharmacological mechanisms of the antinociceptive action dependent on CB2 and opioid receptors. Chronic BCP treatment was able to hamper cartilage degeneration without producing tolerance for the analgesic effects. The data presented herein show that BCP is able to produce both acute and prolonged antinociceptive and chondroprotective effects. Together with the safety profile and legal status of BCP, these results indicate a novel and promising disease-modifying strategy for treating OA."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

The effect of social contact strongly depends on circumstances, and the reward may be driven by varied motivational processes, ranging from parental or affiliative behaviors to investigation or aggression. Reward associated with nonreproductive interactions in rodents is measured using the social conditioned place preference (sCPP) paradigm, where a change in preference for an initially neutral context confirms reinforcing effects of social contact. Here, we revised the sCPP method and reexamined social reward in adult female mice. Contrary to earlier studies, we found that robust rewarding effects of social contact could be detected in adult (14-week-old) female C57BL/6 mice when the sCPP task was refined to remove confounding factors. Strikingly, the rewarding effects of social interaction were only observed among female siblings who remained together from birth. Contact with same-age nonsiblings was not rewarding even after 8 weeks of cohousing. Other factors critical for the social reward effect in the sCPP paradigm included the number of conditioning sessions and the inherent preference for contextual cues.

Although an individual may slip into drug abuse throughout his/her life, adolescents are at higher risk, but, so far, only a few studies have attempted to elucidate the underlying cellular and molecular bases of such vulnerability. Indeed, preclinical evidence indicates that psychostimulants and adolescence interact and contribute to promoting a dysfunctional brain. In this review, we have focused our attention primarily on changes in neuroplasticity brought about by cocaine, taking into account that there is much less evidence from exposure to cocaine in adolescence, compared with that from adults. This review clearly shows that exposure to cocaine during adolescence, acute or chronic, as well as contingent or non-contingent, confers a vulnerable endophenotype, primarily, by causing changes in neuroplasticity. Given the close relationship between drug abuse and psychiatric disorders, we also discuss the translational implications providing an interpretative framework for clinical studies involving addictive as well as affective or psychotic behaviours."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Of note, there are differences in individual susceptibility to stress, with some subjects displaying vulnerability and others showing resistance. Furthermore, the ability to react to stressful-life events can alter the response to a subsequent new stressor. Hence, we investigated whether the vulnerability and resilience to the chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm, in terms of the hedonic phenotype, are paralleled by a different response when facing a novel acute challenge. Specifically, rats submitted to CMS were stratified based on their sucrose intake into vulnerable (anhedonic rats showing reduce intake of sucrose) and resilient (rats not showing the anhedonic-like behavior) subgroups and then further exposed to an acute restraint stress (ARS). Then, neuronal activation was investigated by measuring the gene expression of early immediate (IEG) genes such as Arc and Cfos and early response (ERG) genes, such as Gadd45β, Sgk1, Dusp1, and Nr4a1, in brain regions that play a crucial role in the stress response. We found that resilient rats preserve the ability to increase ERG expression following the ARS selectively in the ventral hippocampus. Conversely, such ability is lost in vulnerable rats. Interestingly, the recovery from the anhedonic phenotype observed in vulnerable rats after 3 weeks of rest from the CMS procedure also parallels the restoration of the ability to adequately respond to the challenge. In conclusion, these findings support the role of the ventral subregion of the hippocampus in the management of both chronic and acute stress response and point to this brain subregion as a critical target for a potential therapeutic strategy aimed at promoting stress resilience."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

A number of mechanisms responsible for these actions are convergent to the mechanism of the fast antidepressant-like effect of ketamine. Furthermore, the data indicate that ketamine effect is related to the action of mGlu2 receptors and may be reduced by their agonists. The above facts became the basis for the hypothesis that the antidepressant effect of low doses of ketamine might be enhanced by coadministration of a mGlu2 receptor antagonist. This strategy was aimed not only at enhancing the therapeutic effect of ketamine but also at reducing the risk of undesirable effects by lowering its therapeutic dose. It is known that ketamine, effective in relieving depressive symptoms in patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression (TRD), is burdened with a number of side effects, which may be particularly dangerous in psychiatric patients. Data have confirmed that subeffective doses of ketamine and its enantiomer, (R)-ketamine, coadministered with an mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist, induce antidepressant-like effects in the screening tests and in the chronic-stress-induced model of depression. At the same time, these drug combinations did not cause undesirable effects characteristic of higher doses of ketamine and (S)-ketamine, including those related to psychostimulatory effects. Further research is required to prove whether this strategy will also be effective in depressive patients."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

However, at the same time, they require a three-dimensional structure of a protein and a relatively high amount of computational resources. Nowadays, as both docking and molecular dynamics are much more extensively used, the amount of data output from these procedures is also growing.

alcohol drinking and emotional tone are mediated by neutral sphingomyelinase during development in males","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Alcohol use, abuse, and addiction, and resulting health hazards are highly sex-dependent with unknown mechanisms. Previously, strong links between the SMPD3 gene and its coded protein neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (NSM) and alcohol abuse, emotional behavior, and bone defects were discovered and multiple mechanisms were identified for females. Here we report strong sex-dimorphisms for central, but not for peripheral mechanisms of NSM action in mouse models. Reduced NSM activity resulted in enhanced alcohol consumption in males, but delayed conditioned rewarding effects. It enhanced the acute dopamine response to alcohol, but decreased monoaminergic systems adaptations to chronic alcohol. Reduced NSM activity increased depression- and anxiety-like behavior, but was not involved in alcohol use for the self-management of the emotional state. Constitutively reduced NSM activity impaired structural development in the brain and enhanced lipidomic sensitivity to chronic alcohol. While the central effects were mostly opposite to NSM function in females, similar roles in bone-mediated osteocalcin release and its effects on alcohol drinking and emotional behavior were observed. These findings support the view that the NSM and multiple downstream mechanism may be a source of the sex-differences in alcohol use and emotional behavior."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Developing new treatments requires a better understanding of the aetiology of symptoms and evaluation of novel therapeutic targets in preclinical studies. Recent developments in our understanding of the reinforcement-based cognitive biases (RBCBs) that contribute to the development of AUD and its treatment offer new opportunities for both clinical and preclinical research. In this review, we first briefly describe psychological and cognitive theories that involve various aspects of reinforcement sensitivity in the development, maintenance, and recurrence of alcohol addiction. Furthermore, in separate sections, we describe studies investigating RBCBs and their neural, neurochemical, and pharmacological correlates, and we discuss possible interactions between RBCBs and trajectories of AUD. Finally, we describe how recent translational studies using state-of-the-art animal models can facilitate our understanding of the role of reinforcement sensitivity and RBCBs in various aspects of AUD."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

While liver CYP enzymes are responsible for the biotransformation of psychotropic drugs, brain CYP enzymes are involved in the local metabolism of these drugs and endogenous neuroactive substances, such as neurosteroids, and in alternative pathways of neurotransmitter biosynthesis including dopamine and serotonin. Recent studies have revealed a relation between the brain nervous system and cytochrome P450, indicating that CYP enzymes metabolize endogenous neuroactive substances in the brain, while the brain nervous system is engaged in the central neuroendocrine and neuroimmune regulation of cytochrome P450 in the liver. Therefore, the effect of neuroactive drugs on cytochrome P450 should be investigated not only in vitro, but also at in vivo conditions, since only in vivo all mechanisms of drug-enzyme interaction can be observed, including neuroendocrine and neuroimmune modulation. Psychotropic drugs can potentially affect cytochrome P450 via a number of mechanisms operating at the level of the nervous, hormonal and immune systems, and the liver. Their effect on cytochrome P450 in the brain is often different than in the liver and region-dependent. Since psychotropic drugs can affect cytochrome P450 both in the liver and brain, they can modify their own pharmacological effect at both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic level. The article describes the mechanisms by which psychotropic drugs can change the expression/activity of cytochrome P450 in the liver and brain, and discusses the significance of those mechanisms for drug action and drug-drug interactions. Moreover, the brain CYP2D6 is considered as a potential target for psychotropics."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

To address this issue, we used a transgenic model of conditional GR knockout mice, targeted to connexin 30-expressing astrocytes, treated with repeated doses of morphine. We observed no difference between control mice and astrocytic GR knockouts in the development of antinociceptive tolerance. Nevertheless, when animals were subjected to precipitated withdrawal, knockouts presented some attenuated symptoms, including jumping. Taken together, our data suggest that hippocampal and spinal astrocytic GRs appear to be involved in opioid withdrawal, and drugs targeting the GR may relieve some symptoms of morphine withdrawal without influencing its antinociceptive properties"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

In the present work, a comparative study on the effect of intraperitoneal administration of the noradrenergic neurotoxin DSP-4 and the knockout of noradrenaline transporter (NET-KO) on the CYP3A in the liver of male and female mice was performed.\n\nMethods: The experiments were conducted on C57BL/6J WT and NET-/- male/female mice. DSP-4 was injected intraperitoneally as a single dose (50 mg/kg ip.) to WT mice. The activity of CYP3A was measured as the rate of 6β-hydroxylation of testosterone in liver microsomes. The CYP3A protein level was estimated by Western blotting.\n\nResults: DSP-4 evoked a selective decrease in the noradrenaline level in the brain of male and female mice. At the same time, DSP-4 reduced the CYP3A activity in males, but not in females. The level of CYP3A protein was not changed. The NET knockout did not affect the CYP3A activity/protein in both sexes.\n\nConclusions: The results with DSP-4 treated mice showed sex-dependent differences in the regulation of liver CYP3A by the brain noradrenergic system (with only males being responsive), and revealed that the NET knockout did not affect CYP3A in both sexes. Further studies into the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal hormones in DSP-4 treated mice may explain sex-specific differences in CYP3A regulation, whereas investigation of monoaminergic receptor sensitivity in the hypothalamic/pituitary areas of NET-/- mice will allow for understanding a lack of changes in the CYP3A activity in the NET-KO animals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

The purpose of this study was to delineate the effects of PBT and SpO2 during acute infection, as well as the increased neurotoxicity on the physical, psychological, social and environmental domains of health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in people with Long COVID. We recruited 86 participants with Long COVID and 39 normal controls, assessed the WHO-QoL-BREF (World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument-Abridged Version, Geneva, Switzerland) and the physio-affective phenome of Long COVID (comprising depression, anxiety and fibromyalgia-fatigue rating scales) and measured PBT and SpO2 during acute infection, and neurotoxicity (NT, comprising serum interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18 and caspase-1, advanced oxidation protein products and myeloperoxidase, calcium and insulin resistance) in Long COVID. We found that 70.3% of the variance in HR-QoL was explained by the regression on the physio-affective phenome, lowered calcium and increased NT, whilst 61.5% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome was explained by calcium, NT, increased PBT, lowered SpO2, female sex and vaccination with AstraZeneca and Pfizer. The effects of PBT and SpO2 on lowered HR-QoL were mediated by increased NT and lowered calcium yielding increased severity of the physio-affective phenome which largely affects HR-QoL. In conclusion, lowered HR-Qol in Long COVID is largely predicted by the severity of neuro-immune and neuro-oxidative pathways during acute and Long COVID."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

This study analyzed the gene expression profile after exposure of RAW 264.7 cells to the standard particulate matter (PM) material, NIST1648a, and PM with a reduced organic matter content, LAp120, in comparison to the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The selected parameters of cell viability, cell cycle progression, and metabolic and inflammatory activity were also investigated. Both forms of PM negatively influenced the parameters of cell activity. These results were generally reflected in the gene expression profile. Only NIST1648a, excluding LAp120, contained endotoxins and showed small but statistically significant pro-inflammatory activity. However, the gene expression profiling revealed strong pro-inflammatory cell activation induced by NIST1648a that was close to the effects of LPS. Changes in gene expression triggered by LAp120 were relatively small.

Consequently, there is a continuous need to search for new, safer, and more effective antidepressant therapeutics. Previous studies have suggested a potential association of brain histaminergic/serotoninergic signaling and antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects. Here, we evaluated the in vivo antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects of the newly developed multiple-active ligand ST-2300. ST-2300 was developed from 5-HT2A/2C inverse agonist pimavanserin (PIM, ACP-103) and incorporates a histamine H3 receptor (H3R) antagonist pharmacophore. Despite its parent compound, ST-2300 showed only moderate serotonin 5-HT2A antagonist/inverse agonist affinity (Ki value of 1302 nM), but excellent H3R affinity (Ki value of 14 nM). In vivo effects were examined using forced swim test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), and the open field test (OFT) in C57BL/6 mice. Unlike PIM, ST-2300 significantly increased the anxiolytic-like effects in OFT without altering general motor activity. In FST and TST, ST-2300 was able to reduce immobility time similar to fluoxetine (FLX), a recognized antidepressant drug. Importantly, pretreatment with the CNS-penetrant H3R agonist (R)-α-methylhistamine reversed the antidepressant-like effects of ST-2300 in FST and TST, but failed to reverse the ST-2300-provided anxiolytic effects in OFT. Present findings reveal critical structural features that are useful in a rational multiple-pharmacological approach to target H3R/5-HT2A/5-HT2C."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

In the present study, on the postnatal days p5-p16, male pups were treated with the inhibitor of glutathione synthesis, L-buthionine-(S,R)- sulfoximine (BSO, 3.8 or 7.6 mmol/kg), and the dopamine uptake inhibitor, GBR 12,909 (5 mg/kg) alone or in combination, and prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response (PPI) was evaluated in adult 90-day-old rats. Moreover, the monoamine levels in the cortex and hippocampus of 16-day-old rats or 91-day-old rats were measured. The present results showed that administration of BSO at 3.8 mmol/kg led to a decreasing tendency in PPI for all tested prepulse intensities. In contrast, a combined treatment with BSO in both studied doses and GBR 12,909 did not induce significant deficits in PPI. Moreover, the results of biochemical studies indicated that treatment with BSO or GBR 12,909 alone induced a weak increase in the activity of dopaminergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic systems in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of 16-day-old rats and 91-day-old rats. However, the combined administration of both substances allowed for maintaining the normal activity of monoaminergic systems in the rat brain. The most significant changes in the functioning of monoaminergic systems were observed in the frontal cortex of 16-day-old rats. Therefore, it seems that the frontal cortex of rat puppies is most sensitive to glutathione deficiencies resulting in increased oxidative stress in neurons. As a result, it can lead to cognitive and memory impairment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Both L-DOPA and desipramine + L-DOPA significantly increased DA levels in the ipsilateral striatum, substantia nigra, prefrontal cortex and the ipsi- and contralateral hippocampus. The combined treatment also significantly increased noradrenaline content in the ipsi- and contralateral striatum, while L-DOPA alone decreased serotonin level on both sides of the hippocampus.\n\nConclusions: The performed analysis of the level of monoamines and their metabolites in the selected brain structures suggests that co-modulation of noradrenergic and dopaminergic transmission in Parkinson's disease by the combined therapy with desipramine + L-DOPA may have some positive implications for motor and psychiatric functions but further research is needed to exclude potential negative effects."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (DSCAM), a member of the immunoglobulin cell adhesion molecule (Ig-CAM) superfamily, is involved in developing the central and peripheral nervous system by influencing cell adhesion mechanisms necessary for synaptic activity and plasticity. Since COX-2 has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric diseases (e.g., major depressive disorder) resulting from neuroplasticity disorders, and on the other hand, its expression is regulated by synaptic activity, we hypothesized that cognitive changes after administration of COX-2 inhibitor and mGluR5 antagonist might be a consequence of impaired DSCAM expression. Importantly, DSCAM deficiency leads to dysregulation of glutamatergic transmission and plasticity. In previous studies, we have demonstrated glutamatergic changes after NS398 and MTEP administration, further supporting the validity of our hypothesis. Due to the different effects observed in behavioral tests, this study used the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HC) of C57BL/6J mice, which received NS398 and MTEP alone, or in combination, for 7 or 14 days. Among many properties, we also previously investigated the antidepressant potential of these compounds, so we used imipramine (a tricyclic antidepressant) as the reference drug. DSCAM mRNA expression was determined by qRT-PCR. Our results indicate that DSCAM expression after administration of MTEP and NS398 and imipramine along with NS398 is structure- and time-dependent."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a1878c28a0473ae135","5e709217878c28a04738fbde"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Therapy of depressive disorders is based mainly on drugs discovered in the 1960s and early 1970s. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are frontline pharmacological strategies for the medical treatment of depression. In addition, approved by FDA in 2019, esketamine [as nasal spray; N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors antagonist with additional effects on α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel (L-VDCC), opioid receptors, and monoaminergic receptors] is an essential compound in suicide and drug-resistant depression. However, the treatment of depression is burdened with severe side effects, and in many cases, it is ineffective. An equally important issue is the choice of antidepressant therapy in people with comorbid somatic diseases, for example, due to possible interactions with the patient's other drugs. Therefore, there is a great need for new antidepressants with different mechanisms of action and the need to refine the search for new substances. The purpose of this review was to discuss new research directions and new trends that dominate laboratories worldwide. We have reviewed the literature to present new points on the pharmacological target of substances with antidepressant activity. In addition, we propose a new perspective on depressive therapies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the major causes of chronic pain in adults and elderly people. A substantial body of evidence demonstrate that hippocampal neural circuits, especially monoamine dopamine and serotonin levels, contributes to negative affect and avoidance motivation experienced during pain. Current pharmacological strategies for OA patients are unsatisfying and the endocannabinoid system modulation might represent an alternative for the treatment of OA-related pain. In the present study, we used a rat model of osteoarthritis induced by intra-articular injection of sodium monoiodoacetate to assess, 28 days post-induction, the contribution of endocannabinoid system on the possible alteration in pain perception and affective behavior, in LTP and monoamine levels in the lateral entorhinal cortex-dentate gyrus pathway. The results show that OA-related chronic pain induces working memory impairment and depressive-like behavior appearance, diminishes LTP, decreases dopamine levels and increases serotonin levels in the rat dentate gyrus. URB597 administration (i.p., 1 mg/kg) reduces hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia, improves recognition memory and depressive-live behavior, restores LTP and normalizes monoamine levels in the hippocampus. The effect was observed 60–120 min post-treatment and was blocked by AM251, which proves the action of URB597 via the CB1 receptor. Therefore, our study confirms the role of anandamide in OA-related chronic pain management at the behavioral and hippocampal levels."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

The only efficient treatment to date is anticoagulant therapy and thrombectomy,which enable res-titution of blood flow to ischemic tissues. Numerous promising neuroprotectants have failed in clin-ical trials. Given thecomplex pathomechanism of stroke, a multitarget pharmacotherapy seems a more rational approach in stroke prevention and treatment than drugs acting on single molecular targets. Recently, vitamin D3 has emerged as a potential treatment adjunct for ischemic stroke,as it interferes with the key prosurvival pathways and shows neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, re-generative and anti-aging properties in both neuronal and vascular tissue. Moreover, the stimula-tory effect of vitamin D3 on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling and neuroplasticity may play a role not only in the recovery of neurological functions, but also in ameliorating post-stroke depression and anxiety. This narrative review presents advances in research on the biochem-ical mechanisms of stroke-related brain damage, and the genomic and non-genomic effects of vita-min D3 which may interfere with diverse cell death signaling pathways. Next, we discuss the results of in vitro and in vivo experimental studies on the neuroprotective potential of 1alpha,25-dihy-droxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) in brain ischemia models. Finally, the outcomes of clinical trials on vit-amin D3 efficiency in ischemic stroke patients are briefly reviewed. Despite the mixed results of the clinical trials, it appears that vitamin D3 still holds promise in preventing or ameliorating neurolog-ical and psychiatric consequences of ischemic stroke and certainly deserves further study."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Ligands with desired activity profile cannot be used for treatment if they are characterized by unfavourable physicochemical or ADMET properties. In the study, we consider metabolic stability and focus on selected subtypes of cytochrome P450 - proteins, which take part in the first phase of compound transformations in the organism. We develop a protocol for generation of new potential inhibitors of selected cytochrome isoforms. Its subsequent stages are composed of generation and assessment of new derivatives of known cytochrome inhibitors, docking and evaluation of the compound possible inhibition on the basis of the obtained ligand-protein complexes. Besides the library of new potential agents inhibiting particular cytochrome subtypes, we also prepare a graph neural network that predicts the change in activity for all modifications of the starting molecule. In addition, we perform a systematic statistical study on the influence of particular substitutions on the potential inhibition properties of generated compounds (both mono- and di-substitutions are considered), provide explanations of the inhibitory predictions and prepare an on-line visualization platform enabling manual inspection of the results. The developed methodology can greatly support the design of new cytochrome P450 inhibitors with the overarching goal of generation of new metabolically stable compounds. It enables instant evaluation of possible compound-cytochrome interactions and selection of ligands with the highest potential of possessing desired biological activity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Our study demonstrated for the first time that a 6-h delayed post-treatment with amorfrutin B prevented hypoxia/ischemia-induced neuronal apoptosis in terms of the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, heterochromatin foci formation, and expression of specific genes and proteins. The expression of all studied apoptosis-related factors was decreased in response to amorfrutin B, both during hypoxia and ischemia, except for the expression of anti-apoptotic BCL2, which was increased. After post-treatment with amorfrutin B, the methylation rate of the pro-apoptotic Bax gene was inversely correlated with the protein level, which explained the decrease in the BAX/BCL2 ratio as a result of Bax hypermethylation. The mechanisms of the protective action of amorfrutin B also involved the inhibition of autophagy, as evidenced by diminished autophagolysosome formation and the loss of neuroprotective properties of amorfrutin B after the silencing of Becn1 and/or Atg7. Although post-treatment with amorfrutin B reduced the expression levels of Becn1, Nup62, and Ambra1 during hypoxia, it stimulated Atg5 and the protein levels of MAP1LC3B and AMBRA1 during ischemia, supporting the ambiguous role of autophagy in the development of brain pathologies. Furthermore, amorfrutin B affected the expression levels of apoptosis-focused and autophagy-related miRNAs, and many of these miRNAs were oppositely regulated by amorfrutin B and hypoxia/ischemia. The results strongly support the position of amorfrutin B among the most promising anti-stroke and wide-window therapeutics."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) is expressed almost exclusively in the striatum and its inhibition is suggested to offer potential treatment in disorders associated with basal ganglia. We evaluated the selectivity, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, pharmacokinetics and potential adverse effects of a novel PDE10A inhibitor, CPL500036, in vivo.\n\nMethods: The potency of CPL500036 was demonstrated by microfluidic technology, and selectivity was investigated in a radioligand binding assay against 44 targets. Cardiotoxicity in vitro was evaluated in human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG)-potassium channel-overexpressing cells by the patch-clamp method and by assessing key parameters in 3D cardiac spheroids. Cytotoxicity was determined in H1299, HepG2 and SH-SY5Y cell lines. The Ames test was used for genotoxicity analyses. During in vivo studies, CPL500036 was administered by oral gavage. CPL500036 exposure were determined by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry and plasma protein binding was assessed. The bar test was employed to assess catalepsy. Prolactin and glucose levels in rat blood were measured by ELISAs and glucometers, respectively. Cardiovascular safety in vivo was investigated in dogs using a telemetry method.\n\nResults: CPL500036 inhibited PDE10A at an IC50 of 1 nM, and interacted only with the muscarinic M2 receptor as a negative allosteric modulator with an IC50 of 9.2 µM. Despite inhibiting hERG tail current at an IC25 of 3.2 μM, cardiovascular adverse effects were not observed in human cardiac 3D spheroids or in vivo. Cytotoxicity in vitro was observed only at > 60 μM and genotoxicity was not recorded during the Ames test. CPL500036 presented good bioavailability and penetration into the brain. CPL500036 elicited catalepsy at 0.6 mg/kg, but hyperprolactinemia or hyperglycemic effects were not observed in doses up to 3 mg/kg.\n\nConclusion: CPL500036 is a potent, selective and orally bioavailable PDE10A inhibitor with a good safety profile distinct from marketed antipsychotics. CPL500036 may be a compelling drug candidate."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Male Wistar rats received lurasidone (1 mg/kg ip.) for two weeks. The activity of CYP2D was measured in brain and liver microsomes as the rate of bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation. The CYP2D protein level was determined in microsomes by Western blot analysis. The CYP2D gene expression was estimated in liver tissue by a qRT-PCR method. Lurasidone decreased the activity and protein level of CYP2D in the frontal cortex but increased them in the striatum, nucleus accumbens, brain stem, substantia nigra, and the remainder of the brain. The neuroleptic did not affect CYP2D in the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. In the liver, lurasidone did not affect the CYP2D activity and protein level, though it enhanced the mRNA of CYP2D1 without affecting that of CYP2D2, CYP2D3, CYP2D4, and CYP2D5. In conclusion, lurasidone regulates brain (but not liver) CYP2D activity/protein level in a region-dependent manner, which is similar to that of other atypical neuroleptics (iloperidone and asenapine) as concerns the frontal cortex (down-regulation) and nigrostriatal pathway (up-regulation) and may be of pharmacological significance.

It has been demonstrated previously that people with alcohol use disorder are less sensitive to the negative outcomes of their actions and less able to use negative feedback to guide and adjust their ongoing behaviour. However, far less is known about the aberrant processing of negative feedback before the onset of alcohol use disorder. In this study, we investigated the theoretical claim that sensitivity to negative feedback - as a stable and enduring behavioural trait - can predict vulnerability to the development of compulsive alcohol consumption in rats.\nMethods: We trained and tested rats in a series of probabilistic reversal learning tests, and based on this \"negative feedback sensitivity screening,\" we classified each rat as more or less sensitive to negative feedback. Then, in the intermittent-access 2-bottle choice paradigm, we measured alcohol consumption in the animals classified above. In the next step, using the instrumental second-order chained schedule of alcohol reinforcement task, we examined the influence of sensitivity to negative feedback on the development of compulsive alcohol seeking behaviour. Finally, we measured how trait sensitivity to negative feedback affected the extinction and reinstatement of alcohol seeking after a period of abstinence.\nResults: Trait sensitivity to negative feedback predicted the vulnerability of rats to the development of compulsive alcohol seeking and consumption. We also found significant differences between the more sensitive and less sensitive groups in their propensity to extinguish alcohol seeking behaviours when the alcohol was no longer available.\nLimitations: The findings from our study did not answer the question of whether individual differences in sensitivity to negative feedback have a genetic basis or develop in response to postnatal experiences.\nConclusion: The results of our study suggest that negative feedback sensitivity screening could be used to evaluate individual vulnerability to the development and maintenance of alcohol use disorder."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

The critical developmental processes, which might trigger a cascade of molecular events resulting in mental disorders in adulthood, are still to be elucidated. Here we proposed that sex hormones, particularly testosterone, might determine the \"developmental programming\" of long-term consequences of prenatal stress in foetuses of both sexes. We observed that severe prenatal stress in the model of repeated corticosterone injections enhanced brain levels of corticosterone and testosterone in male foetuses. The expression of GluN1 and GluN2A, but not GluN2B NMDA receptor subunits were significantly reduced in the brain of stressed male foetuses. However, female foetuses were protected against stress effects on the brain corticosterone and testosterone levels. More moderate types of stress, such as repeated restraint stress and chronic unpredictable stress, did not induce an increase in brain corticosterone in dams and testosterone concentrations in foetuses of both sexes. Moreover, chronic unpredictable stress reduced brain testosterone concentration in male foetuses. Altogether, changes in brain testosterone level might be one of the crucial mechanisms determining the development of long-term consequences of severe prenatal stress in male, but not in female foetuses. Targeting this mechanism might allow to develop principally new prediction and therapeutic approaches for prenatal stress-associated psychiatric disorders."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

High relapse rates, which is a hallmark of drug addiction, prompt the study of changes in Wnt signaling elements (Wnt5a, Wnt7b, and Ctnnb1) in the motivational aspects of cocaine use and early drug-free period (3 days after the last exposure to cocaine). For this purpose, an animal model of intravenous cocaine self-administration and two types of drug-free period (extinction training and abstinence in the home cage) were used. The studies showed that chronic cocaine self-administration mainly disturbs the expression of Wnt5a and Ctnnb1 (the gene encoding β-catenin) in the examined brain structures (striatum and hippocampus), and the examined types of early abstinence are characterized by a different pattern of changes in the expression of these genes. At the same time, in cocaine self-administrated animals, there were no changes in the level of Wnt5a and β-catenin proteins at the tested time points. Moreover, exposure to cocaine induces a significant reduction in the striatal and hippocampal expression of miR-374 and miR-544, which can regulate Wnt5a levels post-transcriptionally. In summary, previous observations from experimenter-administered cocaine have not been fully validated in the cocaine self-administration model. Yoked cocaine administration appears to disrupt Wnt signaling more than cocaine self-administration. The condition of the cocaine-free period, the routes of drug administration, and the motivational aspect of drug administration play an important role in the type of drug-induced molecular changes observed. Furthermore, in-depth research involving additional brain regions is needed to determine the exact role of Wnt signaling in short-term and long-lasting plasticity as well as in the motivational aspects of cocaine use, and thus to assess its potential as a target for new drug therapy for cocaine use disorder."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

This study compared the effects of repeated restraint stress and corticosterone injections on DRN neuronal excitability, spontaneous synaptic transmission, and its 5-HT7 receptor-dependent modulation. Male Wistar rats received corticosterone injections for 7 or 14 days or were restrained for 10 min twice daily for 3 days. Repeated restraint stress and repeated corticosterone administration evoked similar changes in performance in the forced swim test. They increased the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) recorded from DRN neurons. In contrast to the treatment with corticosterone, restraint stress-induced changes in sEPSC kinetics and decreased intrinsic excitability of DRN neurons did not modify inhibitory transmission. Repeated injections of the 5-HT7 receptor antagonist SB 269970 ameliorated the effects of restraint on excitability and sEPSC frequency but did not restore the altered kinetics of sEPSCs. Thus, repeated restraint stress and repeated corticosterone administration differ in consequences for the intrinsic excitability of DRN projection neurons and their excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Effects of repeated restraint stress on DRN neurons can be partially abrogated by blocking the 5-HT7 receptor."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Of all mGlu receptors, this receptor is most highly expressed in the brain. Additionally, relatively intense expression of the receptor was found at the periphery, for example in the bowels or in the reproductive system of male mice, but this review will be focused predominantly on its role in the brain.\n\nIn the CNS, the receptor is expressed presynaptically, in the center of the synaptic cleft, at the terminals of both excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory GABAergic neurons. Thus, it may regulate the release of both glutamate and GABA.\n\nSchizophrenia is thought to develop as a consequence of a disturbed glutamatergic-GABAergic balance in different parts of the brain. Thus, the mGlu7 receptor may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and consequently constitute the target for antipsychotic drug discovery.\n\nIn this review, we summarize the available data about mGlu7 receptor ligands and their activity in animal models of schizophrenia. At present, only a few ligands are available, and negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) appear to exert antipsychotic-like efficacy, indicating that the inhibition of the receptor could constitute a promising target in the search for novel drugs. Additionally, the data concerning the expression of the receptor in the CNS and putative mechanisms by which its inhibition may contribute to the treatment of schizophrenia will be discussed. Finally, the polymorphisms of genes encoding the receptor in schizophrenic patients will also be provided."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

This study aimed to investigate how animals exposed to chronic mild stress (CMS) responded to an acute stress (AS), as a vulnerability's challenge, and to establish the potential effects of the antipsychotic drug lurasidone on such mechanisms. Adult male Wistar rats were exposed or not (controls) to a CMS paradigm for 7 weeks. Starting from the end of week 2, animals were randomized to receive vehicle or lurasidone for 5 weeks. Sucrose intake was used to measure anhedonia. At the end, half of the animals were exposed to an acute stress before sacrifice. Exposure to CMS produced a significant reduction in sucrose consumption, whereas lurasidone progressively normalized such alteration. We found that exposure to AS produced an upregulation of Brain derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) in the prefrontal cortex of controls animals. This response was impaired in CMS rats and restored by lurasidone treatment. While in control animals, AS-induced increase of Bdnf mRNA levels was specific for Parvalbumin cells, CMS rats treated with lurasidone show a significant upregulation of Bdnf in pyramidal cells. Furthermore, when investigating the activation of different brain regions, CMS rats showed an impairment in the global response to the acute stressor, that was largely restored by lurasidone treatment. Our results suggest that lurasidone treatment in CMS rats may regulate specific circuits and mechanisms, which will ultimately contribute to boost resilience under stressful challenges."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

The aim of this work was to study the effect of short- and long-term treatment with the selective antagonist of the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor, the compound CP-101,606, which possesses antidepressant properties, on CYP2D expression and activity in the liver and brain of male rats. The presented work shows time-, organ- and brain-structure-dependent effects of 5-day and 3-week treatment with CP-101,606 on CYP2D. Five-day treatment with CP-101,606 increased the activity and protein level of CYP2D in the hippocampus. That effect was maintained after the 3-week treatment and was accompanied by enhancement in the CYP2D activity/protein level in the cortex and cerebellum. In contrast, a 3-week treatment with CP-101,606 diminished the CYP2D activity/protein level in the hypothalamus and striatum. In the liver, CP-101,606 decreased CYP2D activity, but not the protein or mRNA level, after 5-day or 3-week treatment. When added in vitro to liver microsomes, CP-101,606 diminished the CYP2D activity during prolonged incubation. While in the brain, the observed decrease in the CYP2D activity after short- and long-term treatment with CP-101,606 seems to be a consequence of the drug effect on enzyme regulation. In the liver, the direct inhibitory effect of reactive metabolites formed from CP-101,606 on the CYP2D activity may be considered. Since CYP2Ds are engaged in the metabolism of endogenous neuroactive substances, it can be assumed that apart from antagonizing the NMDA receptor, CP-101,606 may modify its own pharmacological effect by affecting brain cytochrome P450. On the other hand, an inhibition of the activity of liver CYP2D may slow down the metabolism of co-administered substrates and lead to pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

A comprehensive body of evidence points to the cholinergic system, including alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7-nAChRs), as a potential target of pharmacotherapy. A promising approach is based on positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of these receptors due to their advantages over direct agonists. Nevertheless, α7 n-AChR ligands have not been widely studied in the context of autism. Therefore, using one of the most widely used rodent models of ASD, that is, prenatal exposure to valproic acid (VPA), we examined the impact of α7-nAChR PAMs (PNU-120596 and CCMI) on socio-communicative behavior during social play in adolescent male and female rats. The current study demonstrated that PAM treatment affected certain aspects of socio-communicative behavior in adolescent rats. Accordingly, PNU-120596 ameliorated deficient play abilities in VPA-exposed males, as revealed by increased play time during a social encounter. In addition, this compound enhanced the emission of ultrasonic vocalizations that accompanied playful interactions. Moreover, we observed the overall effect of PNU-120596 on non-playful forms of social behavior (i.e., social exploration) and acoustic parameters (i.e., the duration) of emitted calls. The present results suggest the ability of α7-nAChR PAMs to facilitate socio-communicative behavior in adolescent rats."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Recently, the coexistence of blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction and inflammation has been implicated in the etiology and progression of mental and/or neurodegenerative diseases. There are sex differences in the prevalence and outcomes of these disorders. The number of studies reporting the effects of ELS and sex on BBB functioning and neuroinflammatory processes in response to immune challenge is very limited, and the data are inconsistent. In the present study, we examined whether ELS, based on the maternal separation (MS) paradigm in rats, can condition male and female subjects to subsequent lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced immune challenge in juvenility or adulthood. Twenty-four hours after acute LPS injection, serum proinflammatory cytokines were measured, and BBB permeability in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HP) was evaluated. Additionally, the mRNA expression of neuroinflammatory markers and BBB-related genes was also studied. We found that a single LPS challenge induced a proinflammatory response both in the periphery and in the mPFC and HP and increased BBB permeability in a sex-dependent fashion. Moreover, MS enhanced the neuroinflammatory response to LPS challenge in males (especially juveniles), whereas MS females showed no difference or a blunted central response to LPS compared with control females, mainly during adulthood.

It is thus important to search for new efficacious therapeutic strategies. Preclinical studies on the role of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in neuroprotection conducted over the years show that these receptors may have therapeutic potential in these CNS disorders. However, clinical trials, especially for treating Parkinson's disease, have been unsatisfactory. This review focuses on the specific role of group III mGluRs in neuroprotection in experimental in vitro and in vivo models of excitotoxicity/neurotoxicity using neurotoxins as well as ischemia, traumatic brain injury, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's diseases, and multiple sclerosis. The review highlights recent preclinical studies in which group III mGluR ligands (especially those acting at mGluR4 or mGluR7) were administered after damage, thus emphasizing the importance of the therapeutic time window in the treatment of ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury. From a clinical standpoint, the review also highlights studies using group III mGluR agonists with favorable neuroprotective efficacy (histological and functional) in experimental ischemic stroke, including healthy normotensive and-hypertensive rats. This review also summarizes possible mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective activity of the group III mGluR ligands, which may be helpful in developing more effective and safe therapeutic strategies.\n\nTherefore, to fully assess the role of these receptors in neuroprotection, it is necessary to uncover new selective ligands, primarily those stimulating mGlu4 and mGlu7 receptors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

It acts via allosteric blockade of receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) kinase, thereby preventing the formation of the necrosome complex and execution of necroptotic program. Apart from serving a crucial physiological role during development and adulthood, necroptosis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various human pathologies including acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions. This chapter summarizes experimental data on neuroprotective effects of Nec-1 and current views on its molecular mechanisms of action. It also highlights advantages and limitations of Nec-1 as a potential neuroprotectant. Nec-1 showed marked neuroprotective properties in a wide range of in vivo experimental models of brain ischemia, neonatal hypoxia-ischemia, retinal ischemia, subarachnoid hemorrhage, traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries, neuropathies, and some neurodegenerative diseases. However, as a candidate for a clinically useful neuroprotectant, Nec-1 shows also some shortcomings. Its solubility in water is limited and its half-time after systemic administration is relatively short. Nevertheless, Nec-1 proved to be a highly valuable tool in studying the relationships between various cell death pathways enabling researchers to get more insight into severe CNS pathologies, and in this way this compound may contribute to further development of the long-desired clinically approved neuroprotectant."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

In mice, this treatment produces a range of behavioral deficits, including impairment in social interactions and locomotion. To date, these phenotypes were described primarily in the Swiss and C3H/HeHsd mouse strains. A few studies investigated ketamine-induced behaviors in the C57BL/6J strain, but to our knowledge the C57BL/6N strain was not investigated thus far. This is surprising, as both C57BL/6 sub-strains are widely used in behavioral and neuropsychopharmacological research, and are de facto standards for characterization of drug effects. The goal of this study was to determine if C57BL/6N mice are vulnerable to develop social deficits after 5 days withdrawal from sub-chronic ketamine treatment (5 days, 30 mg/kg, i.p.), an experimental schedule shown before to cause deficits in social interactions in C57BL/6J mice. Our results show that sub-chronic administration of ketamine that was reported to cause psychotic-like behavior in C57BL/6J mice does not induce appreciable behavioral alterations in C57BL/6N mice. Thus, we show that the effects of sub-chronic ketamine treatment in mice are sub-strain specific."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Regarding therapy, antipsychotics continually constitute the cornerstone of schizophrenia treatment. To their various efficacy and side effects, as well as not fully recognised mechanisms of action, further characteristics have been suggested, including an anti-inflammatory action via the impact on neuron-microglia axes responsible for inhibition of microglial activation. Therefore, in the present study, we sought to determine whether chronic treatment with chlorpromazine, quetiapine or aripiprazole could influence schizophrenia-like behavioural disturbances at the level of sensorimotor gating in male offspring prenatally exposed to LPS. Simultaneously, we wanted to explore if the chosen antipsychotics display a positive impact on the neuroimmunological parameters in the brains of these adult animals with a special focus on the ligand-receptor axes controlling neuron-microglia communication as well as pro- and anti-inflammatory factors related to the microglial activity. The results of our research revealed the beneficial effect of quetiapine on deficits in sensorimotor gating observed in prenatally LPS-exposed offspring. In terms of axes controlling neuron-microglia communication and markers of microglial reactivity, we observed a subtle impact of quetiapine on hippocampal Cx3cl1 and Cx3cr1 levels, as well as cortical Cd68 expression. Hence, further research is required to fully define and explain the involvement of quetiapine and other antipsychotics in Cx3cl1-Cx3cr1 and/or Cd200-Cd200r axes modulation and inflammatory processes in the LPS-based model of schizophrenia-like disturbances."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Therefore, we aimed to summarize animal studies reporting the behavioral consequences of chronic exposure to the most widely prescribed antidepressant drug among adolescents i.e., fluoxetine.\n\nMethods: Electronic databases (Medline via Pubmed, Web of Science Core Collection, ScienceDirect) were systematically searched until April 12, 2022, for published, peer-reviewed, controlled trials concerning the effects of chronic fluoxetine administration vs. vehicle on anxiety and depression measures in naïve and stress-exposed adolescent rodents. All of the relevant studies were selected and critically appraised, and a meta-analysis of eligible studies was performed.\n\nResults: A total of 18 studies were included in the meta-analysis. In naïve animals, chronic adolescent fluoxetine administration showed dose-related anxiogenic-like effects, measured as a reduction in time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus maze. No significant effects of chronic adolescent fluoxetine on depression-like behavior were reported in naïve animals, while in stress-exposed rodents chronic adolescent fluoxetine significantly decreased immobility time in the forced swim test compared to vehicle.\n\nConclusions: These results suggest that although chronic fluoxetine treatment proves positive effects in animal models of depression, it may simultaneously increase anxiety in adolescent animals in a dose-related manner. Although the clinical implications of the data should be interpreted with extreme caution, adolescent patients under fluoxetine treatment should be closely monitored."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

It manifests as a gradual degeneration of the cartilage and subchondral part of the bone, leading to joint damage. Recent studies indicate that not only the cells that make up the articular cartilage but also the synoviocytes, which build the membrane surrounding the joint, contribute to the development of OA. Therefore, the aim of the study was to determine the response to inflammatory factors of osteoarthritic synoviocytes and to identify proteins secreted by them that may influence the progression of OA. This study demonstrated that fibroblast-like synoviocytes of OA patients (FLS-OA) respond more strongly to pro-inflammatory stimulation than cells obtained from control patients (FLS). These changes were observed at the transcriptome level and subsequently confirmed by protein analysis. FLS-OA stimulated by pro-inflammatory factors [such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) were shown to secrete significantly more chemokines (CXCL6, CXCL10, and CXCL16) and growth factors [angiopoietin-like protein 1 (ANGPTL1), fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5), and insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2)] than control cells. Moreover, the translation of proteolytic enzymes [matrix metalloprotease 3 (MMP3), cathepsin K (CTSK), and cathepsin S (CTSS)] by FLS-OA is increased under inflammatory conditions. Our data indicate that the FLS of OA patients are functionally altered, resulting in an enhanced response to the presence of pro-inflammatory factors in the environment, manifested by the increased production of the previously mentioned proteins, which may promote further disease progression."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Among the inflammatory mediators dysregulated in depressed patients, interleukin (IL)-6 has recently been proposed to play a crucial role. IL-6 activates a signaling pathway comprising the JAK/STAT proteins and characterized by a specific negative feedback loop exerted by the cytoplasmic protein suppressor of cytokine signalling-3 (SOCS3). On these bases, here, we explored the potential involvement of IL-6 signaling in the ability of the antidepressant drug agomelatine to normalize the anhedonic-like phenotype induced in the rat by chronic stress exposure. To this aim, adult male Wistar rats were subjected to the chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm and chronically treated with vehicle or agomelatine. The behavioral evaluation was assessed by the sucrose consumption test, whereas molecular analyses were performed in the prefrontal cortex. We found that CMS was able to stimulate IL-6 production and signaling, including SOCS3 gene and protein expression, but the SOCS3-mediated feedback-loop inhibition failed to suppress the IL-6 cascade in stressed animals.

We examined 36 healthy people, aged 21 to 30 years, and divided them into two groups: 1 (n = 15)—participants with a normal range of dorsiflexion in the ankle joint (20° or more), and 2 (n = 21)—participants with a reduced range of dorsiflexion in the ankle joint (below 20°). The length of the free part of the Achilles tendon was measured using ultrasonography. Ankle joint range of dorsiflexion was assessed, and a weight-bearing lunge test (WBLT) was conducted. Group 1 performed the WBLT better and demonstrated significantly greater Achilles tendon length compared to Group 2. A moderate, significant correlation was observed between ankle joint range of dorsiflexion and Achilles tendon length (r = 0.53, p < 0.05); between WBLT and Achilles tendon length (r = 0.61, p < 0.05); as well as between ankle joint range of dorsiflexion and WBLT (r = 0.63, p < 0.05). Thus, we can suggest that both the length of the tendon (measured by USG) and the ankle range of motion under a body-weight load (measured by WBLT) are good indicators regarding the range of foot dorsiflexion, but only up to specific values (6 cm of tendon length and 11 cm of WBLT reach). Therefore, Achilles tendon length, e.g., after injury and during tendon healing, may be monitored using the method of ultrasound imaging presented in this study."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Moreover, the mechanism of neuropathy is still not entirely understood; however, much evidence indicates that chemokines are important factors in the initial and late phases of neuropathic pain. To date, the roles of CCR1, CCR3 and their endogenous ligands have not been extensively studied; therefore, they have become the subject of our research. In the present comprehensive behavioral and biochemical study, we detected significant time-dependent and long-lasting increases in the mRNA levels of CCR1 and/or CCR3 ligands, such as CCL2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9, in the murine spinal cord after chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve, and these increases were accompanied by changes in the levels of microglial/macrophage, astrocyte and neutrophil cell markers. ELISA results suggested that endogenous ligands of CCR1 and CCR3 are involved in the development (CCL2/3/5/7/8/9) and persistence (CCL2/7/8) of neuropathic pain. Moreover, intrathecal injection of CCL2/3/5/7/8/9 confirmed their possible strong influence on mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity development. Importantly, inhibition of CCL2/7/8 production and CCR1 and CCR3 blockade by selective/dual antagonists effectively reduced neuropathic pain-like behavior. The obtained data suggest that CCL2/7/8/CCR1 and CCL7/8/CCR3 signaling are important in the modulation of neuropathic pain in mice and that these chemokines and their receptors may be interesting targets for future investigations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

There is growing evidence that demonstrates a key role for dysfunctional energy metabolism in driving the onset of depression; thus, bioenergetic alterations should be extensively studied. Brain metabolism is known to be a glucocorticoid-sensitive process, but the long-lasting consequences in adulthood following high levels of glucocorticoids at the early stages of life are unclear. We examined a possible association between brain energetic changes induced by synthetic glucocorticoid-dexamethasone treatment in the prenatal period and depressive-like behavior. The results show a reduction in the oxidative phosphorylation process, Krebs cycle impairment, and a weakening of the connection between the Krebs cycle and glycolysis in the frontal cortex of animals receiving dexamethasone, which leads to ATP reduction. These changes appear to be mainly due to decreased expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase, impairment of lactate transport to neurons, and pyruvate to the mitochondria. Acute stress in adulthood only slightly modified the observed alterations in the frontal cortex, while in the case of the hippocampus, prenatal exposure to dexamethasone made this structure more sensitive to future adverse factors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

An animal model resembling human TRD is the Wistar Kyoto rat strain. In the present study, we focused on selecting miRNAs that differentiate rats of the WKY strain from Wistar Han (WIS) rats in two divisions of the habenula, the lateral and medial (LHb and MHb, respectively). Based on our preliminary study and literature survey, we identified 32 miRNAs that could be potentially regulated in the habenula. Six miRNAs significantly differentiated WKY rats from WIS rats within the MHb, and three significantly differentiated WKY from WIS rats within the LHb. Then, we selected relevant transcripts regulated by those miRNAs, and their expression in the habenular nuclei was investigated. For mRNAs that differentiated WKY rats from WIS rats in the MHb (Cdkn1c, Htr7, Kcnj9, and Slc12a5), their lower expression correlated with a higher level of relevant miRNAs. In the LHb, eight mRNAs significantly differentiated WKY from WIS rats (upregulated Htr4, Drd2, Kcnj5, and Sstr4 and downregulated Htr2a, Htr7, Elk4, and Slc12a5). These data indicate that several important miRNAs are expressed in the habenula, which differentiates WKY rats from WIS rats and in turn correlates with alterations in the expression of target transcripts. Of particular note are two genes whose expression is altered in WKY rats in both LHb and MHb: Slc12a5 and Htr7.

Results of the conducted experiments indicated that animals displaying trait insensitivity to NF were more prone to develop stress-induced anxiety than their NF-sensitive conspecifics. Moreover, an analysis of the behavioral patterns displayed by the NF-insensitive animals during the forced swim test (FST) revealed complementary (anxiety-driven) effects of trait sensitivity to NF on the strategy of coping with an acute, stressful situation. Finally, an analysis of the interactions between NF sensitivity and the effects of antidepressant drug — mirtazapine — revealed that in animals subjected to chronic stress, the effects of the drug on anxiety and coping strategies differ significantly between animals classified as NF insensitive and NF sensitive. The present results suggest that NF sensitivity screening could be potentially used to determine individual vulnerability to development of affective disorders and effectivity of their treatment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

The role of serotonin 2C (5-HT2C) receptors in the mechanisms responsible for the coexistence of depression and CUD was not investigated.\n\nMethods: We combined bilateral olfactory bulbectomy (OBX), an animal model of depression, with intravenous cocaine self-administration and extinction/reinstatement in male rats to investigate two 5-HT2C receptor agonists (Ro 60-0175 (RO) and WAY 161503 (WAY)) and the 5-HT2C-receptor preferring antagonist mirtazapine (MIR; an antidepressant), with the goal of determining whether these drugs alter cocaine-induced reinforcement and seeking behaviors. Additionally, neurochemical analyses were performed following cocaine self-administration and its abstinence period in the brain structures in OBX rats and SHAM-operated controls.\n\nResults: Acute administration of RO reduced, while WAY non-significantly attenuated cocaine reinforcement in both rat phenotypes. Moreover, RO or WAY protected against cocaine-seeking behavior after acute or after repeated drug administration during extinction training in OBX and SHAM rats. By contrast, acutely administered MIR did not alter cocaine reinforcement in both rat phenotypes, while it's acute (but not repeated) pretreatment reduced cocaine-seeking in OBX and SHAM rats. In neurochemical analyses, cocaine reinforcement increased 5-HT2C receptor levels in the ventral hippocampus; a preexisting depression-like phenotype enhanced this effect. The 10-daily cocaine abstinence reduced 5-HT2C receptor expression in the dorsolateral striatum, while the coexistence of depression and CUD enhanced local receptor expression.\n\nConclusion: The results support a key role of 5-HT2C receptors for treating CUD and comorbid depression and CUD.

These results suggested that antidepressant resistance may result from an insufficiency of transmission from vHIP to mPFC. Here we examined whether similar effects can be elicited from major output of mPFC; the pathway from to nucleus accumbens core (NAc).\n\nMethod: WKY rats were subjected to Chronic Mild Stress and were used in two sets of experiments: 1) they were treated acutely with optogenetic stimulation of afferents to NAc core originating from the mPFC, and 2) they were treated with chronic (5 weeks) venlafaxine (10 mg/kg) and/or repeated (once weekly) optogenetic stimulation of afferents to NAc originating from either mPFC or vHIP.\n\nResults: Chronic mild stress procedure decreased sucrose intake, open arm entries on elevated plus maze, and novel object recognition test. Acute optogenetic stimulation of the mPFC-NAc and vHIP-NAc pathways had no effect in sucrose or plus maze tests, but increased object recognition. Neither venlafaxine nor mPFC-NAc optogenetic stimulation alone was effective in reversing the effects of CMS, but the combination of chronic antidepressant and repeated optogenetic stimulation improved behaviour on all three measures.\n\nConclusions: The synergism between venlafaxine and mPFC-NAc optogenetic stimulation supports the hypothesis that the mechanisms of non-responsiveness of WKY rats involves a failure of antidepressant treatment to restore transmission in the mPFC-NAc pathway. Together with earlier results, this implicates insufficiency in a vHIP-mPFC-NAc circuit in non-responsiveness to antidepressant drugs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

The mentioned implications have increased the demand for misinformation detection and intervention. To contribute to this challenge, we are presenting a systematic scoping review of psychological interventions countering misinformation in social media. The review was conducted to (i) identify and map evidence on psychological interventions countering misinformation, (ii) compare the viability of the interventions on social media, and (iii) provide guidelines for the development of effective interventions.\n\nMethods: A systematic search in three bibliographic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Scopus) and additional searches in Google Scholar and reference lists were conducted.\n\nResults: 3,561. records were identified, 75. of which met the eligibility criteria for the inclusion in the final review. The psychological interventions identified during the review can be classified into three categories distinguished by Kozyreva et al.: Boosting, Technocognition, and Nudging, and then into 15. types within these. Most of the studied interventions were not implemented and tested in a real social media environment but under strictly controlled settings or online crowdsourcing platforms. The presented feasibility assessment of implementation insights expressed qualitatively and with numerical scoring could guide the development of future interventions that can be successfully implemented on social media platforms.\n\nDiscussion: The review provides the basis for further research on psychological interventions counteracting misinformation. Future research on interventions should aim to combine effective Technocognition and Nudging in the user experience of online services.\n\nSystematic review registration: [https://figshare.com/], identifier [https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14649432.v2]."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c34c519543c723365443e8","5e7092d2878c28a04739d6eb","63ca5a964097076d2607cc6c","60c341269543c72336544296"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

The brain and nervous system regulate liver cytochrome P450 via neuroendocrine mechanisms, as shown in rodents. Cocaine exerts its addictive effects through the dopaminergic system, the functioning of which undergoes changes during its continuous use. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that the regulation of cytochrome P450 by cocaine may also alter during the addiction process, cessation and relapse. We analyzed preclinical studies on the mechanisms of the pharmacological action of cocaine, the role of the brain’s dopaminergic system in the neuroendocrine regulation of cytochrome P450 and the in vitro and in vivo effects of cocaine on the cytochrome P450 expression/activity and hepatotoxicity. The results of passive cocaine administration indicate that cocaine affects liver cytochrome P450 enzymes (including those engaged in its own metabolism) via different mechanisms involving the expression of genes encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes and interaction with enzyme proteins. Thus, it may affect its own oxidative metabolism and the metabolism of endogenous substrates and other co-administered drugs and may lead to hepatotoxicity. Its effect depends on the specific cytochrome P450 enzyme affected, cocaine dosage, treatment duration and animal species. However, further complementary studies are needed to find out whether cocaine affects cytochrome P450 via the brain’s dopaminergic system. The knowledge of cocaine’s effect on cytochrome P450 function during the entire addiction process is still incomplete. There is a lack of information on the enzyme expression/activity in animals self-administering cocaine (addicted), in those withdrawn after cocaine self-administration, and during relapse in animals previously addicted; furthermore, there is no such information concerning humans. The subject of cytochrome P450 regulation by cocaine during the addiction process is an open issue, and addressing this topic may help in the treatment of drug abuse patients."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Dysregulation of neuroplasticity and calcium homeostasis are frequently observed in BD patients, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we show that miR-499-5p regulates dendritogenesis and cognitive function by downregulating the BD risk gene CACNB2. miR-499-5p expression is increased in peripheral blood of BD patients, as well as in the hippocampus of rats which underwent juvenile social isolation. In rat hippocampal neurons, miR-499-5p impairs dendritogenesis and reduces surface expression and activity of the L-type calcium channel Cav1.2. We further identified CACNB2, which encodes a regulatory β-subunit of Cav1.2, as a direct functional target of miR-499-5p in neurons. miR-499-5p overexpression in the hippocampus in vivo induces short-term memory impairments selectively in rats haploinsufficient for the Cav1.2 pore forming subunit Cacna1c. In humans, miR-499-5p expression is negatively associated with gray matter volumes of the left superior temporal gyrus, a region implicated in auditory and emotional processing.

Over last three decades, great advance has been made in understanding the basic physiology of endogenous opioid peptide (EOP) systems and their biogenesis, anatomy, and functions. EOPs and their receptors are expressed in the CNS, the periphery, the gut, and the immune system. The EOPs act as transmitters or modulate synaptic actions of primary transmitters. There are numerous data implicating EOPs in the central and peripheral antinociception, motor activity, feeding, and regulation of body temperature respiration, as well as cardiovascular and gastrointestinal functions. They are known to be released from endocrine organs and are involved in regulation of release of various hormones and modulation of immune functions. EOPs are involved in reward, learning and memory, and emotional states. EOP systems play an important role in modulation and adaptation of the organism to challenges. While relatively quiescent in the resting state, EOPs are released during intense stimulation and modify disturbed homeostasis. EOPs appear to be involved in brain diseases such as pain, addiction, depression, and anxiety disorders. Progress made during the last years in pharmacology, genomics, and complex genetics opens avenues for investigating a role of the EOPs and their receptors in various brain diseases and new pathways for investigating novel opioid therapeutics."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

While (R)-ketamine produces fewer dissociative effects, its antidepressant actions are less studied. Depression is associated with time overestimation (i.e., subjectively, time passes slowly). Our recent report suggests that while (S)-ketamine induces an opposite effect, i.e., time underestimation, the (R)-isomer does not affect timing. It has been suggested that opioid receptors are involved in the antidepressant effect of ketamine. In the present study we tested (R)- and (S)-ketamine, and fluoxetine as a positive control in the differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate (DRL) 72-s schedule of reinforcement in male rats following naloxone pretreatment. DRL classic metrics as well as peak deviation analyses served to determine antidepressant-like actions and those associated with timing. We report antidepressant-like effects of (S)-ketamine (30-60 mg/kg) that resemble fluoxetine's (2.5-10 mg/kg), as both compounds increased reinforcement rate and peak location (suggesting increased performance), reduced premature responses (suggesting time underestimation) and decreased Weber's fraction (suggesting increased timing precision). (R)-ketamine (30, but not 60 mg/kg) increased only the reinforcement rate and peak location but did not affect timing. Only fluoxetine decreased burst responses, suggesting decreased impulsivity. Naloxone pretreatment did not block ketamine enantiomers' actions, but unexpectedly, increased fluoxetine' performance.

Accordingly, exposure of adult rats to chronic stress represents a valuable tool to investigate the ability of a pharmacological intervention to counteract the adverse effects produced by stress exposure.ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to perform a time course analysis of the treatment with the antipsychotic drug lurasi-done in normalizing the anhedonic phenotype in the chronic mild stress (CMS) model in order to identify early mechanisms that may contribute to its therapeutic activity.MethodsMale Wistar rats were exposed to CMS or left undisturbed for 7 weeks. After two weeks of stress, both controls and CMS rats were randomly divided into two subgroups that received vehicle or lurasidone for five weeks. Weekly measures of sucrose intake were recorded to evaluate anhedonic behavior, and animals were sacrificed at different weeks of treatment for molecular analyses.ResultsWe found that CMS-induced anhedonia was progressively improved by lurasidone treatment. Interestingly, after two weeks of lurasidone treatment, 50% of the animals showed a full recovery of the phenotype, which was associated with increased activation of the prefrontal and recruitment of parvalbumin-positive cells that may lead to a restoration of excita-tory/inhibitory balance.ConclusionThese results suggest that the capacity of lurasidone to normalize anhedonia at an early stage of treatment may depend on its ability to modulate the function of the prefrontal cortex."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Agonist binding to the receptor stimulates GDP/GTP exchange within the heterotrimeric G protein complex, whereas recent structures of GPCR–G protein complexes revealed that the H5, S1 and S2 domains of Gα are involved in binding the active receptor, earlier studies showed that a short peptide analog derived from the C-terminus (H5) of the G protein transducin (Gt) is sufficient to stabilize rhodopsin in an active form.Methods  We have used Molecular Dynamics simulations along with biological evaluation by means of radio-ligand binding assay to study the interactions between Gαi-derived peptide (G-peptide) and the μ-opioid receptor (μOR).ResultsHere, we show that a Gαi-derived peptide of 12 amino acids binds the μ-opioid receptor and acts as an allosteric modulator. The Gαi-derived peptide increases μOR affinity for its agonist morphine in a dose-dependent way.ConclusionsThese results indicate that the GPCR–Gα peptide interaction observed so far for only rhodopsin can be extrapo-lated to μOR.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are the building blocks of the brain and are responsible for the proper functioning of neurons, synapses, and neuronal communication. The deficiency of a significant component, omega-3 (ω-3) FA, in favor of omega-6 (ω-6) FA can exacerbate the course of mental illness and be one of the triggers of the cascade of neurodegenerative changes. PUFAs play an essential role in transmitting neuronal signals, affecting brain homeostasis. Physicochemical parameters of lipid layers significantly affect their functioning; interactions between lipids and proteins in brain cells are critical for mechanical stability and maintaining adequate elasticity for vesicle budding and membrane fusion. This paper discusses the role of PUFA deficiency or inappropriate ratios in brain tissue. The deficiency is a crucial element in depressive disorders and cognitive impairment, while in Alzheimer's disease, there is some controversy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

The mechanisms of ELS action are not well understood. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) are cellular processes involved in brain maturation through the regulation of pro-survival or proapoptotic processes. We hypothesized that ER stress and the UPR in the mPFC are involved in the neurobiology of ELS.Methods We performed a maternal separation (MS) procedure from postnatal days 1 to 14 in rats. Before each MS, pups were injected with an inhibitor of ER stress, salubrinal or a vehicle. The mRNA and protein expression of UPR and apop-totic markers were evaluated in the mPFC using RT-qPCR and Western blot methods, respectively. We also estimated the numbers of neurons and glial cells using stereological methods. Additionally, we assessed behavioral phenotypes related to fear, anhedonia and response to psychostimulants.Results MS slightly enhanced the activation of the UPR in juveniles and modulated the expression of apoptotic markers in juveniles and preadolescents but not in adults. Additionally, MS did not affect the numbers of neurons and glial cells at any age. Both salubrinal and vehicle blunted the expression of UPR markers in juvenile and preadolescent MS rats, often in a treatment-specific manner. Moreover, salubrinal and vehicle generally alleviated the behavioral effects of MS in preadoles-cent and adult rats.Conclusions Modulation of ER stress and UPR processes may potentially underlie susceptibility or resilience to ELS."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Here, the ability of the compounds to prevent the induction of long-term memory deficits by MK-801 or scopolamine administration was investigated. The Morris Water Maze test, a reliable and valid test of spatial learning and memory, was used, in which escape latency in the acquisition phase and nine different parameters in the retention phase were measured. A fast NO releaser (spermine NONOate), a slow NO releaser (DETA NONOate), and a nNOS inhibitor, N(ω)-propyl-L-arginine (NPLA), were used. The compounds were administered i.p. at a dose range of 0.05–0.5 mg/kg. All compounds prevented learning deficits in the acquisition phase and reversed reference memory deficits in the retention phase of the scopolamine-treated mice. Spermine NONOate was the least effective.

Approximately fifty chemokines are distinguished in humans, which are classified into four subfamilies based on the N-terminal conserved cysteine motifs: CXC, CC, C, and CX3C. Chemokines activate specific receptors localized on the surface of various immune and nervous cells. Approximately twenty chemokine receptors have been identified, and each of these receptors is a seven-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptor. Recent studies provide new evidence that CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) is important in the pathogenesis of many diseases, such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, asthma, dermatitis, and cancer. This review briefly characterizes CCR4 and its ligands (CCL17, CCL22, and CCL2), and their contributions to immunological and neoplastic diseases. The review notes a significant role of CCR4 in nociceptive transmission, especially in painful neuropathy, which accompanies many diseases. The pharmacological blockade of CCR4 seems beneficial because of its pain-relieving effects and its influence on opioid efficacy. The possibilities of using the CCL2/CCL17/CCL22/CCR4 axis as a target in new therapies for many diseases are also discussed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

However, the aetiology and development of schizophrenia are still under investigation. Several data suggest that the dysfunction of epigenetic mechanisms is known to be involved in the pathomechanism of this mental disorder. The present article revised the epigenetic background of schizophrenia based on the data available in online databases (PubMed, Scopus). This paper focused on the role of epigenetic regulation, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and interference of non-coding RNAs, in schizophrenia development. The article also reviewed the available data related to epigenetic regulation that may modify the severity of the disease as a possible target for schizophrenia pharmacotherapy. Moreover, the effects of antipsychotics on epigenetic malfunction in schizophrenia are discussed based on preclinical and clinical results. The obtainable data suggest alterations of epigenetic regulation in schizophrenia. Moreover, they also showed the important role of epigenetic modifications in antipsychotic action. There is a need for more data to establish the role of epigenetic mechanisms in schizophrenia therapy. It would be of special interest to find and develop new targets for schizophrenia therapy because patients with schizophrenia could show little or no response to current pharmacotherapy and have treatment-resistant schizophrenia."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Given that embryogenesis and carcinogenesis share many mechanisms, we analyzed a broad spectrum of tumors to establish whether dystrophin alteration evokes related outcomes. Transcriptomic, proteomic, and mutation datasets from fifty tumor tissues and matching controls (10,894 samples) and 140 corresponding tumor cell lines were analyzed. Interestingly, dystrophin transcripts and protein expression were found widespread across healthy tissues and at housekeeping gene levels. In 80% of tumors, DMD expression was reduced due to transcriptional downregulation and not somatic mutations. The full-length transcript encoding Dp427 was decreased in 68% of tumors, while Dp71 variants showed variability of expression. Notably, low expression of dystrophins was associated with a more advanced stage, older age of onset, and reduced survival across different tumors. Hierarchical clustering analysis of DMD transcripts distinguished malignant from control tissues. Transcriptomes of primary tumors and tumor cell lines with low DMD expression showed enrichment of specific pathways in the differentially expressed genes. Pathways consistently identified: ECM-receptor interaction, calcium signaling, and PI3K-Akt are also altered in DMD muscle. Therefore, the importance of this largest known gene extends beyond its roles identified in DMD, and certainly into oncology."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

The VDR is expressed in diverse brain regions and has been implicated in the neuroprotective, antiaging, prosurvival, and anti-inflammatory action of vitamin D. Accordingly, a relationship between vitamin D insufficiency and susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases has been suggested. However, due to the multitargeted mechanisms of vitamin D and its often overlapping genomic and nongenomic effects, the role of the VDR in brain pathologies remains obscure. In this narrative review, we present progress in deciphering the molecular mechanism of nuclear VDR-mediated vitamin D effects on prosurvival and anti-inflammatory signaling pathway activity within the central nervous system. In line with the concept of the neurovascular unit in pathomechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases, a discussion of the role of the VDR in regulating the immune and vascular brain systems is also included. Next, we discuss the results of preclinical and clinical studies evaluating the significance of vitamin D status and the efficacy of vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, emphasizing the possible role of the VDR in these phenomena. Finally, the associations of some VDR polymorphisms with higher risks and severity of these neurodegenerative disorders are briefly summarized."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Using quantitative autoradiography, we observed a decrease in the binding\nof [3H] methylspiperone to the dopamine D2 receptor, specifically in that brain region—but not\nin the striatum, nor the nucleus accumbens—in WKY rats. Further, we focused our studies on\nthe expression level of several components associated with canonical (G proteins), as well as non-\ncanonical, D2-receptor-associated intracellular pathways (e.g., βarrestin2, glycogen synthase kinase\n3 beta—Gsk-3β, and β-catenin). As a result, we observed an increase in the expression of mRNA\nencoding the regulator of G protein signaling 2-RGS2 protein, which is responsible, among other\nthings, for internalizing the D2 dopamine receptor. The increase in RGS2 expression may therefore\naccount for the decreased binding of the radioligand to the D2 receptor. In addition, WKY rats are\ncharacterized by the altered signaling of genes associated with the dopamine D2 receptor and the\nβarrestin2/AKT/Gsk-3β/β-catenin pathway, which may account for certain behavioral traits of this\nstrain and for the treatment-resistant phenotype."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

The objectives of the WLGB relate to the identification, collection, distribution, conservation, and characterization of the population genetic structure of these unique germplasms for crop improvement. Comprehensive studies are ongoing to determine the taxonomic position and crossing potential of the critical mass of collected species with domesticated lettuce, L. sativa, based on: (i) select morphological and phenological characteristics; (ii) molecular data; (iii) downy mildew resistance and (iv) variation in biologically active secondary metabolite content. In this review we present an overview of our key findings and highlight the advances in knowledge on these themes. Our germplasm collections and novel results, obtained by detailed, large-scale screening of natural populations and individuals for genetic variation, will considerably advance crop breeding research and practices. In addition, we critically summarize the recent literature and findings relating to three additional WLRs: L. dregeana, L. scarioloides, and L. azerbaijanica.

These changes may cause neuropsychiatric disorders in the early life of offspring the basis of which may be memory impairment. In this study, the effects of maternal HFD during pregnancy and lactation on the short-term memory in adolescent and young adult offspring were evaluated. We analyzed the expression of genes encoding the glutamatergic transporters in the hippocampus to verify the association between changes in glutamatergic transporters and behavioral changes in offspring. Next, we examined whether maternal diet-induced changes in the mRNA levels of genes encoding the NMDA receptor subunits and the AMPA receptor subunits, as well as BDNF in this structure in offspring. All significant changes were validated at the protein level. We found that a maternal HFD during pregnancy and lactation disrupts short-term memory in adolescent and young adult females. The latter change is likely related to the dysregulation of hippocampal levels of GluN2B subunit of NMDA receptors and of reduced levels of BDNF. In summary, we showed that a maternal HFD during pregnancy and lactation triggered several changes within the glutamatergic system in the hippocampus of rat offspring, which may be related to producing behavioral changes in offspring."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Following exposure to a variety of mild stressors for several weeks, the rats’ behavior is modified in several ways that parallel symptoms of depression. Among these is a substantial reduction in consumption of a 1% sucrose solution, which models the cardinal symptom of major depression, anhedonia. Our standard procedure employs a battery of behavioral tests, comprising weekly assessment of sucrose intake and, at the end of treatment, the elevated plus-maze and novel object recognition tests to assess the anxiogenic and dyscognitive effects of CMS. Chronic administration of antidepressant drugs reverses the decreased sucrose intake and other behavioral changes in these subjects. Also effective are second-generation antipsychotics. The CMS model can be employed in discovery programs to identify anti-anhedonic drugs (e.g., antidepressants and antipsychotics) that act more quickly than existing agents. While most antidepressants require 3 to 5 weeks to normalize behavior, some treatments provide a faster onset of action. For example, the CMS-induced deficits can be reversed by acute or sub-chronic application of treatments that act rapidly in depressed patients, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), ketamine, and scopolamine, as well as several compounds that have yet to be tested in humans but have fast-onset antidepressant-like effects in animals, such as the 5-HT-1A biased agonists NLX-101 and GLYX-13. Application of the CMS model in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats causes similar behavioral changes to those seen in Wistars, but these are not reversed by antidepressant treatment. However, WKY rats respond to DBS and ketamine, which are effective in patients who are antidepressant non-responders, establishing CMS in WKY rats as a model of treatment-resistant depression. © 2023 The Authors.

In recent years, it was reported that laboratory animals also favor prosocial choices in various experimental paradigms, thus demonstrating that prosocial behaviors are evolutionarily conserved. Here, we investigated prosocial choices in adult male and female C57BL/6 laboratory mice in a task where a subject mouse was equally rewarded for entering any of the two compartments of the experimental cage, but only entering of the compartment designated as \"prosocial\" rewarded an interaction partner. In parallel we have also assessed two traits that are regarded as closely related to prosociality: sensitivity to social reward and the ability to recognize the affective state of another individual. We found that female, but not male, mice increased frequency of prosocial choices from pretest to test. However, both sexes showed similar rewarding effects of social contact in the conditioned place preference test, and similarly, there was no effect of sex on affective state discrimination measured as the preference for interaction with a hungry or relieved mouse over a neutral animal. These observations bring interesting parallels to differences between sexes observed in humans, and are in line with reported higher propensity for prosocial behavior in human females, but differ with regard to sensitivity to social stimuli in males."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

The spinal changes in the mRNA/protein levels of the abovementioned chemokines and their receptors were measured using RT-qPCR and ELISA/Western blot techniques in a mouse model of chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve. Behavioral studies were performed using the von Frey and cold plate tests after pharmacological treatment with neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) against chemokines or antagonists (CCR1-J113863, CCR5-TAK-220/AZD-5672) alone and in coadministration with morphine on Day 7, when the hypersensitivity was fully developed. Our results showed enhanced protein levels of CCL3 and CCL9 1 and 7 days after nerve injury. The single intrathecal administration of CCL3 or CCL9 nAb, J113863, TAK-220, or AZD-5672 diminished neuropathic pain symptoms and enhanced morphine analgesia.

Recently, KP metabolites, which are collectively called kynurenines, have become an area of intense research due to their ability to directly and indirectly affect a variety of classic neurotransmitter systems. However, the significance of KP in neuropathic pain is still poorly understood. Therefore, we designed several experiments to verify changes in the mRNA levels of KP enzymes in parallel with other factors related to this metabolic route after chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve (CCI model) in mice. The analysis revealed an increase in, Kmo, Kynu and Haoo mRNA levels in the spinal cord on the 7th day after CCI, while Kat1, Kat2, Tdo2, Ido2 and Qprt mRNA levels remain unchanged. Subsequent pharmacological studies provided evidence that modulation of KP by single intrathecal administration of 1-D-MT, UPF468 or L-kynurenine attenuates mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity and increases the effectiveness of selected opioids in mice as measured on day 7 after CCI. Moreover, our results provide the first evidence that the injection of L-kynurenine preceded by UPF468 (KMO inhibitor) is more effective at reducing hypersensitivity in animals with neuropathic pain. Importantly, L-kynurenine also exerts an analgesic effect after intravenous injections, which is enhanced by the administration of minocycline, an inhibitor of microglial activation. Additionally, L-kynurenine administered intrathecally and intravenously enhances analgesia evoked by all tested opioids (morphine, buprenorphine and oxycodone). Overall, our results indicate that the modulation of KP at different levels might be a new pharmacological tool in neuropathy management."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Stress in adolescence is particularly consequential on brain development and maturation, and is implicated in several psychiatric disorders. We previously showed that pre-reproductive stress (PRS) in female adolescent rats affects behavior and corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) expression in first- (F1) and second- (F2) generation offspring. We further showed that offspring phenotypes are partially reversed by post-stress treatment with fluoxetine (FLX) or the CRHR1 antagonist NBI27914 (NBI). Epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation, are implicated in the stress response and interact with maternal care quality across generations. Here, we asked whether PRS and FLX or NBI exposure would affect maternal care and global DNA methylation in the brains of exposed dams and their adult F1 and paternally-derived F2 offspring. We found that PRS decreased self-care while increasing pup-care behaviors. PRS also increased DNA methylation in the amygdala of dams and their F1 male offspring, but decreased it in F2 females. Drug treatment had no effect on maternal care, but affected DNA methylation patterns in F0 and F1 generations. Furthermore, PRS altered the expression of DNA methylating enzymes in brain, blood and oocytes. Finally, maternal care variables differentially predicted methylation levels in PRS and control offspring.

Gene expression studies using microarray and sequencing technologies reported the aberrant transcription of numerous genes in the PFC in patients with schizophrenia. Altered gene expression in schizophrenia is related to several biological pathways and networks (synaptic function, neurotransmission, signalling, myelination, immune/inflammatory mechanisms, energy production and response to oxidative stress).

Since currently available therapies are insufficient, there is an urgent need for novel neuroprotective strategies to address the effects of cerebrovascular accidents. One such recent approach is based on the neuroprotective properties of estrogen receptors (ERs). However, activation of ERs by estrogens may contribute to the development of endometriosis or hormone-dependent cancers. Therefore, in this study, we utilized ospemifene, a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) already used in dyspareunia treatment. Here, we demonstrated that posttreatment with ospemifene in primary neocortical cell cultures subjected to 18 h of hypoxia and/or ischemia followed by 6 h of reoxygenation has robust neuroprotective potential. Ospemifene partially reverses hypoxia- and ischemia-induced changes in LDH release, the degree of neurodegeneration, and metabolic activity. The mechanism of the neuroprotective actions of ospemifene involves the inhibition of apoptosis since the compound decreases caspase-3 overactivity during hypoxia and enhances mitochondrial membrane potential during ischemia. Moreover, in both models, ospemifene decreased the levels of the proapoptotic proteins BAX, FAS, FASL, and GSK3β while increasing the level of the antiapoptotic protein BCL2. Silencing of specific ERs showed that the neuroprotective actions of ospemifene are mediated mainly via ESR1 (during hypoxia and ischemia) and GPER1 (during hypoxia), which is supported by ospemifene-evoked increases in ESR1 protein levels in hypoxic and ischemic neurons. The results identify ospemifene as a promising neuroprotectant, which in the future may be used to treat injuries due to brain hypoxia/ischemia."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

In recent years, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been explored as adjunctive therapy for many psychiatric disorders, including depression, for its antioxidant properties. Given the promising efficacy of this compound for the treatment of such pathologies, it is fundamental to investigate, at the preclinical level, the ability of the drug to act in the modulation of neuroplastic mechanisms in basal conditions and during challenging events in order to highlight the potential features of the drug useful for clinical efficacy. To this aim, adult male Wistar rats were treated with the antidepressant venlafaxine (VLX) (10 mg/kg) or NAC (300 mg/kg) for 21 days and then subjected to 1 h of acute restraint stress (ARS). We found that NAC enhanced the expression of several immediate early genes, markers of neuronal plasticity in the ventral and dorsal hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and amygdala, and in particular it mediated the acute-stress-induced upregulation of Nr4a1 expression more than VLX. These data suggested the ability of NAC to induce coping strategies to face external challenges, highlighting its potential for the improvement of neuroplastic mechanisms for the promotion of resilience, in particular via the modulation of Nr4a1."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Recent studies indicate that serotonin can also be synthesized by cytochrome P450 (CYP), via the CYP2D6-mediated 5-methoxytryptamine O-demethylation, while melatonin is catabolized by CYP1A2, CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 via aromatic 6-hydroxylation and by CYP2C19 and CYP1A2 via O-demethylation. In gut microbes, tryptophan is metabolized to indole and indole derivatives. Some of those metabolites act as activators or inhibitors of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, thus regulating the expression of CYP1 family enzymes, xenobiotic metabolism and tumorigenesis. The indole formed in this way is further oxidized to indoxyl and indigoid pigments by CYP2A6, CYP2C19 and CYP2E1. The products of gut-microbial tryptophan metabolism can also inhibit the steroid-hormone-synthesizing CYP11A1. In plants, CYP79B2 and CYP79B3 were found to catalyze N-hydroxylation of tryptophan to form indole-3-acetaldoxime while CYP83B1 was reported to form indole-3-acetaldoxime N-oxide in the biosynthetic pathway of indole glucosinolates, considered to be defense compounds and intermediates in the biosynthesis of phytohormones. Thus, cytochrome P450 is engaged in the metabolism of tryptophan and its indole derivatives in humans, animals, plants and microbes, producing biologically active metabolites which exert positive or negative actions on living organisms. Some tryptophan-derived metabolites may influence cytochrome P450 expression, affecting cellular homeostasis and xenobiotic metabolism."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Since social and communicative deficits are included in the first diagnostic criterion of ASD, we aimed to characterize socio-communicative behaviors in the MIA model based on prenatal exposure to poly(I:C). Our previous studies demonstrated impaired socio-communicative functioning in poly(I:C)-exposed adolescent rats. Therefore, the current study sought to clarify whether these changes would persist beyond adolescence. For this purpose, we analyzed behavior during the social interaction test and recorded ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) accompanying interactions between adult poly(I:C) rats. The results demonstrated that the altered pattern of social behavior in poly(I:C) males was accompanied by the changes in acoustic parameters of emitted USVs. Poly(I:C) males also demonstrated an impaired olfactory preference for social stimuli. While poly(I:C) females did not differ from controls in socio-positive behaviors, they displayed aggression during the social encounter and were more reactive to somatosensory stimulation. Furthermore, the locomotor pattern of poly(I:C) animals were characterized by repetitive behaviors. Finally, poly(I:C) reduced parvalbumin and GAD67 expression in the cerebellum. The results showed that prenatal poly(I:C) exposure altered the pattern of socio-communicative behaviors of adult rats in a sex-specific manner."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

PSD95 is a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinases protein family, mainly located at the postsynaptic density of the excitatory synapse. PSD95, via direct interaction, regulates the clustering and functionality of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors at a synapse. Here, the effects of treatment with an antagonist of mGluR5 (MTEP) and NS398 (cyclooxygenase-2, COX-2 inhibitor) on PSD95, mTOR, and DSCAM in the hippocampus (HC) of C57B1/6 J mice using Western blots in the context of learning were examined. Moreover, the sensitivity of selected proteins to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was monitored. MTEP injected for seven days induced upregulation of PSD95 in HC of mice. The observed effect was regulated by a COX-2 inhibitor and concurrently by LPS.

Despite many decades of intensive research, causal treatment of this common neurologic disorder is still unavailable. Nevertheless, it is expected that advances in modern neuroscience and molecular biology tools, as well as improved animal models may accelerate designing antiepileptogenic and epilepsy-modifying drugs. Epileptogenesis triggers a vast array of genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic changes, which ultimately lead to morphological and functional transformation of specific neuronal circuits resulting in the occurrence of spontaneous convulsive or nonconvulsive seizures. Recent decades unraveled molecular processes and biochemical signaling pathways involved in the proepileptic transformation of brain circuits including oxidative stress, apoptosis, neuroinflammatory and neurotrophic factors. The “omics” data derived from both human and animal epileptic tissues, as well as electrophysiological, imaging and neurochemical analysis identified a plethora of possible molecular targets for drugs, which could interfere with various stages of epileptogenetic cascade, including inflammatory processes and neuroplastic changes. In this narrative review, we briefly present contemporary views on the neurobiological background of epileptogenesis and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of some more promising molecular targets for antiepileptogenic pharmacotherapy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Here, we evaluated 5-HT7R inverse agonists as novel drugs in the treatment of tauopathies.\n\nMethods: Based on structural homology, we screened multiple approved drugs for their inverse agonism toward 5-HT7R. Therapeutic potential was validated using biochemical, pharmacological, microscopic, and behavioral approaches in different cellular models including tau aggregation cell line HEK293 tau bimolecular fluorescence complementation, primary mouse neurons, and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons carrying an FTD-associated tau mutation as well as in two mouse models of tauopathy.\n\nResults: Antipsychotic drug amisulpride is a potent 5-HT7R inverse agonist. Amisulpride ameliorated tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation in vitro. It further reduced tau pathology and abrogated memory impairment in mice.\n\nDiscussion: Amisulpride may be a disease-modifying drug for tauopathies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

However, research is still being carried out on the search for further RAADs that will be not only effective but also safe to use. Recent data have indicated that the combined administration of (R)-ketamine and the mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist LY341495 (mixRL) induces rapid and sustained effects in the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model of depression in mice, and the use of this drug combination is associated with a low risk of undesirable effects. Considering the possible influence of stress on cortical plasticity and, on the other hand, the role of this plasticity in the mechanism of action of ketamine, we decided to investigate whether mixed RL affects synaptic plasticity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the CUMS model of depression using electrophysiological techniques and explore whether these effects are related to memory impairments. Using behavioral methods, we found that a single administration of mixRL reversed CUMS-induced PFC-dependent memory deficits and alleviated depression-like effects induced by CUMS. In turn, electrophysiological experiments indicated that the amplitude of field potentials as well as paired-pulse responses in CUMS mice were increased, and mixRL was found to reverse these effects. Additionally, the magnitude of long-term potentiation (LTP) was reduced in CUMS mice, and mixRL was shown to restore this parameter. In summary, mixRL appeared to exert its antidepressant effects and cognitive enhancing effects in a mouse model of depression, at least in part, by mechanisms involving modulation of glutamatergic transmission and LTP in the PFC."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

However, measuring progress in the field has been challenging due to the lack of realistic retrospective benchmarks, and the large cost of prospective validation. To close this gap, we propose a benchmark based on docking, a widely used computational method for assessing molecule binding to a protein. Concretely, the goal is to generate drug-like molecules that are scored highly by SMINA, a popular docking software. We observe that various graph-based generative models fail to propose molecules with a high docking score when trained using a realistically sized training set. This suggests a limitation of the current incarnation of models for de novo drug design. Finally, we also include simpler tasks in the benchmark based on a simpler scoring function. We release the benchmark as an easy to use package available at https://github.com/cieplinski-tobiasz/smina-docking-benchmark. We hope that our benchmark will serve as a stepping stone toward the goal of automatically generating promising drug candidates."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Classical estrogen receptors (ERs) act transcriptionally and govern the vast majority of hormonal effects, whereas membrane ERs (mERs) enable acute modulation of estrogenic signaling and have recently been shown to exert strong neuroprotective capacity without the negative side effects associated with nuclear ER activity. In recent years, GPER1 was the most extensively characterized mER. Despite triggering neuroprotective effects, cognitive improvements, and vascular protective effects and maintaining metabolic homeostasis, GPER1 has become the subject of controversy, particularly due to its participation in tumorigenesis. This is why interest has recently turned toward non-GPER-dependent mERs, namely, mERα and mERβ. According to available data, non-GPER-dependent mERs elicit protective effects against brain damage, synaptic plasticity impairment, memory and cognitive dysfunctions, metabolic imbalance, and vascular insufficiency. We postulate that these properties are emerging platforms for designing new therapeutics that may be used in the treatment of stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. Since mERs have the ability to interfere with noncoding RNAs and to regulate the translational status of brain tissue by affecting histones, non-GPER-dependent mERs appear to be attractive targets for modern pharmacotherapy for nervous system diseases."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Balb/c male mice were administered these antidepressants intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 14 days following intrasplenic injections of C26 colon carcinoma cells. Desipramine and fluoxetine, but not mirtazapine, significantly increased the number of tumor foci and total volume of the tumor in liver tissue. This effect was associated with a decrease in the ability of splenocytes to produce interleukin (IL)-1$\\beta$ and interferon (IFN)-γ and an increase in their ability to produce interleukin (IL)-10. Similar changes were observed in plasma IL-1$\\beta$, IFN-γ, and IL-10 levels.

As serotonin has been identified as an important modulator of sensitivity to feedback and because the hippocampus has been implicated in the mediation of learning from positive and negative outcomes, the present study aimed to identify differences in the expression of various genes encoding 5-HT receptors in this brain region between the rats displaying trait sensitivity and insensitivity to negative feedback. The results demonstrated that trait sensitivity to negative feedback is associated with increased mRNA expression of the 5-HT2A receptors in the rat ventral hippocampus (vHipp). Further analysis revealed that this increased expression might be modulated epigenetically by miRNAs with a high target score for the Htr2a gene (miR-16-5p and miR-15b-5p). Additionally, although not confirmed at the protein level, trait sensitivity to negative feedback was associated with decreased expression of mRNA encoding the 5-HT7 receptor in the dorsal hippocampus (dHipp). We observed no statistically significant intertrait differences in the expression of the Htr1a, Htr2c, and Htr7 genes in the vHipp and no statistically significant intertrait differences in the expression of the Htr1a, Htr2a, and Htr2c genes in the dHipp of the tested animals. These results suggest that resilience to depression manifested by reduced sensitivity to negative feedback may be mediated via these receptors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

One of the most important cascades that modulate the nociceptive response is the family of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), as well as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). The aim of this study was to determine the effect of nonselective modulators of MAP kinases-fisetin (ERK1/2 and NFκB inhibitor, PI3K activator), peimine (MAPK inhibitor), astaxanthin (MAPK inhibitor, Nrf2 activator) and artemisinin (MAPK inhibitor, NFκB activator), as well as bardoxolone methyl (selective activator of Nrf2) and 740 Y-P (selective activator of PI3K)-in mice with peripheral neuropathy and to compare their antinociceptive potency and examine their effect on analgesia induced by opioids. The study was performed using albino Swiss male mice that were exposed to chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve (CCI model). Tactile and thermal hypersensitivity was measured using von Frey and cold plate tests, respectively. Single doses of substances were administered intrathecally on day 7 after CCI. Among the tested substances, fisetin, peimine, and astaxanthin effectively diminished tactile and thermal hypersensitivity in mice after CCI, while artemisinin did not exhibit analgesic potency in this model of neuropathic pain. Additionally, both of the activators tested, bardoxolone methyl and 740 Y-P, also showed analgesic effects after intrathecal administration in mice exposed to CCI. In the case of astaxanthin and bardoxolone methyl, an increase in analgesia after combined administration with morphine, buprenorphine, and/or oxycodone was observed. Fisetin and peimine induced a similar effect on tactile hypersensitivity, where analgesia was enhanced after administration of morphine or oxycodone. In the case of 740 Y-P, the effects of combined administration with each opioid were observed only in the case of thermal hypersensitivity. The results of our research clearly indicate that substances that inhibit all three MAPKs provide pain relief and improve opioid effectiveness, especially if they additionally block NF-κB, such as peimine, inhibit NF-κB and activate PI3K, such as fisetin, or activate Nrf2, such as astaxanthin. In light of our research, Nrf2 activation appears to be particularly beneficial. The abovementioned substances bring promising results, and further research on them will broaden our knowledge regarding the mechanisms of neuropathy and perhaps contribute to the development of more effective therapy in the future."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

In parallel, an important regulatory element in the above diseases is cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a modulator of the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway, and a cause of neuroinflammation, and glutamate (Glu) dysregulation, affecting calcium (Ca) metabolism in cells. This review presents the effects of major trace elements and heavy metals on COX-2 expression. Calcium (Ca), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), vanadium (V), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), and iron (Fe) can potentially increase COX-2 expression, inducing neuroinflammation and Glu excitotoxicity; while magnesium (Mg), lithium (Li), and selenium (Se) can potentially decrease COX-2 expression. The associated mechanisms are described in the article."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Along with its specific affinity for multiple receptors, this compound exerts other biological characteristics, among which anti-inflammatory effects are strongly suggested. Simultaneously, published data indicated that inflammation and microglial activation could be diminished by stimulation of the CD200 receptor (CD200R), which takes place by binding to its ligand (CD200) or soluble CD200 fusion protein (CD200Fc). Therefore, in the present study, we sought to evaluate whether quetiapine could affect certain aspects of microglial activity, including the CD200-CD200R and CX3CL1-CX3CR1 axes, which are involved in the regulation of neuron-microglia interactions, as well as the expression of selected markers of the pro- and anti-inflammatory profile of microglia (Cd40, Il-1β, Il-6, Cebpb, Cd206, Arg1, Il-10 and Tgf-β). Concurrently, we examined the impact of quetiapine and CD200Fc on the IL-6 and IL-10 protein levels. The abovementioned aspects were investigated in organotypic cortical cultures (OCCs) prepared from the offspring of control rats (control OCCs) or those subjected to maternal immune activation (MIA OCCs), which is a widely implemented approach to explore schizophrenia-like disturbances in animals. The experiments were performed under basal conditions and after additional exposure to the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS), according to the \"two-hit\" hypothesis of schizophrenia. The results of our research revealed differences between control and MIA OCCs under basal conditions and in response to treatment with LPS in terms of lactate dehydrogenase and nitric oxide release as well as Cd200r, Il-1β, Il-6 and Cd206 expression. The additional stimulation with the bacterial endotoxin resulted in a notable change in the mRNA levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory microglial markers in both types of OCCs. Quetiapine diminished the influence of LPS on Il-1β, Il-6, Cebpb and Arg1 expression in control OCCs as well as on IL-6 and IL-10 levels in MIA OCCs. Moreover, CD200Fc reduced the impact of the bacterial endotoxin on IL-6 production in MIA OCCs. Thus, our results demonstrated that quetiapine, as well as the stimulation of CD200R by CD200Fc, beneficially affected LPS-induced neuroimmunological changes, including microglia-related activation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

It has been shown that, after entering the body, DEHP has the ability to cross the blood-placenta and blood-brain barriers. One of the proposed mechanisms of action of DEHP is the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Many different functions of PPARγ in cells have been demonstrated, one of which is the modulation of the activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Pparγ, Mmp-2, and Mmp-9 in the mechanism of action of DEHP. The experiments were performed on in vitro primary murine neurons and astrocytes. The results showed that DEHP has a pro-apototic effect on neurons, causing an increase in caspase-3 activity and in the number of apoptotic bodies. However, in astrocytes, the increase in caspase-3 activity was not related to the apoptosis process, as no increase in the formation of apoptotic bodies was observed. Moreover, DEHP increased the proliferation of astrocytes, which was confirmed by the increase in the amount and expression of the Ki-67 protein. In astrocytes, DEHP decreased the expression of the Pparγ and Mmp-9 proteins but increased the expression of the Mmp-2 protein. In DEHP neurons, it increased the expression of the Pparγ protein but decreased the expression of the Mmp-2 and Mmp-9 proteins."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","uid":"bLDwoyIU1jG5BHqZ9HzVPQg","uuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","name":"Wyższa Szkoła Informatyki i Zarządzania z siedzibą w Rzeszowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944b878c28a0473b9e29"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","parentUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","rootUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

For these reasons, pharmaceutical companies have invested in discovering compounds able to modulate the P2X7R and filed many patent applications. This review article presents an account of P2X7R structure, function, and tissue distribution, emphasizing its role in inflammation. Next, we illustrate the different chemical classes of non-competitive P2X7R antagonists reported by highlighting their properties and qualities as clinical candidates for treating inflammatory disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.

They are being used as food preservatives and additives or ingredients of cosmetics. For nearly forty years, Rhizobium rhizogenes-transformed roots (hairy roots) have been studied in respect to their usability as producers of plant specialized metabolites of different, primarily medical applications. Moreover, the hairy root cultures have proven their value as a tool in crop plant improvement and in plant secondary metabolism investigations. Though cultivated plants remain a major source of plant polyphenolics of economic importance, the decline in biodiversity caused by climate changes and overexploitation of natural resources may increase the interest in hairy roots as a productive and renewable source of biologically active compounds. The present review examines hairy roots as efficient producers of simple phenolics, phenylethanoids, and hydroxycinnamates of plant origin and summarizes efforts to maximize the product yield. Attempts to use Rhizobium rhizogenes-mediated genetic transformation for inducing enhanced production of the plant phenolics/polyphenolics in crop plants are also mentioned."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

These effects persisted for 3 weeks following treatment cessation. In the NOR test, both doses of NLX-101/NLX-204, and ketamine, rescued the deficit in discrimination index caused by CMS on Days 3 and 17; all three compounds increased time spent in open arms (EPM) but only NLX-204 achieved statistical significance on Days 2 and 16. In Wistar-Kyoto rats, all 3 compounds were also active in the sucrose test and, to a lesser extent, in the NOR and EPM. In non-stressed rats (both strains), the three compounds produced no significant effects in all tests.\n\nConclusions: these observations further strengthen the hypothesis that biased agonism at 5-HT1A receptors constitutes a promising strategy to achieve rapid-acting/sustained antidepressant effects combined with activity against TRD, in addition to providing beneficial effects against memory deficit and anxiety in depressed patients."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

As consequence, energy metabolism imbalance has been commonly associated to several mental disorders, including depression. Here, by employing a metabolomic approach, we aimed to establish if differences in energy metabolite concentration may underlie the vulnerability and resilience in an animal model of mood disorder named chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm. In addition, we have investigated the possibility that modulation of metabolite concentration may represent a pharmacological target for depression by testing whether repeated treatment with the antidepressant venlafaxine may normalize the pathological phenotype by acting at metabolic level. The analyses were conducted in the ventral hippocampus (vHip) for its key role in the modulation of anhedonia, a core symptom of patients affected by depression. Interestingly, we showed that a shift from glycolysis to beta oxidation seems to be responsible for the vulnerability to chronic stress and that vHip metabolism contributes to the ability of the antidepressant venlafaxine to normalize the pathological phenotype, as shown by the reversal of the changes observed in specific metabolites. These findings may provide novel perspectives on metabolic changes that could serve as diagnostic markers and preventive strategies for the early detection and treatment of depression as well as for the identification of potential drug targets."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Here we show that miR-483-5p in the amygdala of male mice counterbalances the structural, functional and behavioural consequences of stress to promote a reduction in anxiety-like behaviour. Upon stress, miR-483-5p is upregulated in the synaptic compartment of amygdala neurons and directly represses three stress-associated genes: Pgap2, Gpx3 and Macf1. Upregulation of miR-483-5p leads to selective contraction of distal parts of the dendritic arbour and conversion of immature filopodia into mature, mushroom-like dendritic spines. Consistent with its role in reducing the stress response, upregulation of miR-483-5p in the basolateral amygdala produces a reduction in anxiety-like behaviour. Stress-induced neuromorphological and behavioural effects of miR-483-5p can be recapitulated by shRNA mediated suppression of Pgap2 and prevented by simultaneous overexpression of miR-483-5p-resistant Pgap2. Our results demonstrate that miR-483-5p is sufficient to confer a reduction in anxiety-like behaviour and point to miR-483-5p-mediated repression of Pgap2 as a critical cellular event offsetting the functional and behavioural consequences of psychological stress."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9a","uid":"b8KxaPPV_aM8-YLJlYjQq8Q","uuid":"cd9df9ee-5c47-4b8c-bda2-b903eac95559","name":"Instytut Biologii Doświadczalnej im.

It also represents a potential and promising therapeutic approach for the management of numerous inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. We designed and assessed the biological activity of new fluorinated analogues of CPL302415, taking into account the therapeutic potential of our selective PI3K inhibitor and fluorine introduction as one of the most frequently used modifications of a lead compound to further improve its biological activity. In this paper, we compare and evaluate the accuracy of our previously described and validated in silico workflow with that of the standard (rigid) molecular docking approach. The findings demonstrated that a properly fitted catalytic (binding) pocket for our chemical cores at the induced-fit docking (IFD) and molecular dynamics (MD) stages, along with QM-derived atomic charges, can be used for activity prediction to better distinguish between active and inactive molecules. Moreover, the standard approach seems to be insufficient to score the halogenated derivatives due to the fixed atomic charges, which do not consider the response and indictive effects caused by fluorine. The proposed computational workflow provides a computational tool for the rational design of novel halogenated drugs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Recent studies have highlighted that a maternal high-sugar diet (HSD) could be a risk factor for neurobehavioural dysregulations, including mood disorders. Increased consumption of added sugar in food such as refined fructose/glucose can increase the risk of metabolic disorders and impact susceptibility to mental disorders. Furthermore, a few papers have reported disabilities in learning and memory among offspring after maternal HSD, thus suggesting a relationship between maternal nutrition and offspring neurogenesis. In this study, we evaluated the impact of maternal monosaccharide consumption based on a glucose (GLU) or fructose (FRU) diet during pregnancy and lactation in adolescent and young adult offspring rats of both sexes on cognitive, locomotor, and emotional disturbances. Locomotor activity, short-term memory, anxiety-like and depressive-like behavior were evaluated in the offspring. We report for the first time that the maternal GLU or FRU diet is sufficient to evoke anxiety-like behavior among adolescent and young adult offspring. Moreover, we found that maternal monosaccharide diets lead to hyperactivity and depressive-like behavior in male adolescent rats. We also noticed that a maternal FRU diet significantly enhanced novelty-seeking behavior only in young adult male rats. Our novel findings indicated that the maternal monosaccharide diet, especially a diet enriched in FRU, resulted in strong behavioral alterations in offspring rats at early life stages. This study also revealed that male rats were more susceptible to hyperactivity and anxiety- and depressive-like phenotypes than female rats. These results suggest that maternal monosaccharide consumption during pregnancy and lactation is an important factor affecting the emotional status of offspring."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

It has been suggested that µ-opioid receptor agonists may attenuate behavioural despair following animals' exposure to an acute, inescapable stressor. Moreover, morphine was shown to ameliorate fear memories caused by a traumatic experience. As typical µ-opioid receptor agonists entail a risk of serious side effects and addiction, novel, possibly safer and less addictive agonists of this receptor are currently under investigation. One of them, PZM21, preferentially acting via the G protein signalling pathway, was previously shown to be analgesic, but less addictive than morphine. Here, we aimed to further test this ligand in stress-related behavioural paradigms in mice. The study has shown that, unlike morphine, PZM21 does not decrease immobility in the forced swimming and tail suspension tests. On the other hand, we observed that both mice treated with PZM21 and those receiving morphine presented a slight attenuation of freezing across the consecutive fear memory retrievals in the fear conditioning test. Therefore, our study implies that at the range of tested doses, PZM21, a nonrewarding representative of G protein-biased µ-opioid receptor agonists, may interfere with fear memory consolidation while having no beneficial effects on behavioural despair in mice."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Surprisingly, there are no studies examining the canonical signal transduction pathway activated by mGlu5 receptors (i.e. polyphosphoinositide - PI - hydrolysis) in mouse models of autism. We have developed a method for in vivo assessment of PI hydrolysis based on systemic injection of lithium chloride followed by treatment with the selective mGlu5 receptor PAM, VU0360172, and measurement of endogenous inositolmonophosphate (InsP) in brain tissue. Here, we report that mGlu5 receptor-mediated PI hydrolysis was blunted in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and corpus striatum of Ube3am-/p+ mice modeling Angelman syndrome (AS), and in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of Fmr1 knockout mice modeling FXS. In vivo mGlu5 receptor-mediated stimulation of Akt on threonine 308 was also blunted in the hippocampus of FXS mice. These changes were associated with a significant increase in cortical and striatal Homer1 levels and striatal mGlu5 receptor and Gαq levels in AS mice, and with a reduction in cortical mGlu5 receptor and hippocampal Gαq levels, and an increase in cortical phospholipase-Cβ and hippocampal Homer1 levels in FXS mice.

These cages provide objective data collection and have revolutionized behavioral research. Unfortunately, in the rush towards automation, many mistakes may have been made that could have been avoided by observing experimental animals. The study described in this paper is an excellent example of how important additional behavioral observation can be for interpreting instrumental data. In this study, we evaluated the effects of single injections of 3 different doses of agomelatine (5, 10, and 40 mg/kg) on feedback sensitivity in rats. To this end, we tested 40 animals in the instrumental probabilistic reversal learning task in a Latin square design. The highest applied dose of agomelatine, prima facie, reduced the sensitivity of rats to negative feedback - an effect that can be considered antidepressant. However, additional behavioral observation dramatically changed the interpretation of the results and revealed that the perceived effect of agomelatine on sensitivity to negative feedback can actually be attributed to drug-induced drowsiness."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Ex vivo studies using the A2AR agonist CGS21680 also suggested the existence of enhanced antagonistic accumbal A2AR-D2R allosteric interactions after treatment with OSU-6162 during cocaine self-administration. However, a 3-day treatment with OSU-6162 (5 mg/kg) failed to alter the behavioral effects of cocaine self-administration. To test these results and the relevance of OSU-6162 (2.5 mg/kg) and/or A2AR (0.05 mg/kg) agonist interactions, we administered low doses of receptor agonists during cocaine self-administration and assessed their neurochemical and behavioral effects. No effects were observed on cocaine self-administration; however, marked and highly significant increases using the proximity ligation assay (PLA) were induced by the co-treatment on the density of the A2AR-D2R heterocomplexes in the nucleus accumbens shell. Significant decreases in the affinity of the D2R high- and low-affinity agonist binding sites were also observed. Thus, in low doses, the highly significant neurochemical effects observed upon cotreatment with an A2AR agonist and a Sigma1R ligand on the A2AR-D2R heterocomplexes and their enhancement of allosteric inhibition of D2R high-affinity binding are not linked to the modulation of cocaine self-administration. The explanation may be related to an increased release of ATP and adenosine from astrocytes in the nucleus accumbens shell in cocaine self-administration. This can lead to increased activation of the A1R protomer in a putative A1R-A2AR-D2R complex that modulates glutamate release in the presynaptic glutamate synapse. We hypothesized that the integration of changes in presynaptic glutamate release and postjunctional heteroreceptor complex signaling, where D2R plays a key role, result in no changes in the firing of the GABA anti-reward neurons, resulting in no reduction in cocaine self-administration in the present experiments."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

As a result of this process, neurons in the ischaemic core are deprived of oxygen and trophic substances and are consequently destroyed. Tissue damage in brain ischaemia results from a complex pathophysiological cascade comprising various distinct pathological events. Ischaemia leads to brain damage by stimulating many processes, such as excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation, acidotoxicity, and apoptosis. Nevertheless, less attention has been given to biophysical factors, including the organization of the cytoskeleton and the mechanical properties of cells. Therefore, in the present study, we sought to evaluate whether the oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) procedure, which is a commonly accepted experimental model of ischaemia, could affect cytoskeleton organization and the paracrine immune response. The abovementioned aspects were examined ex vivo in organotypic hippocampal cultures (OHCs) subjected to the OGD procedure. We measured cell death/viability, nitric oxide (NO) release, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) levels. Next, the impact of the OGD procedure on cytoskeletal organization was evaluated using combined confocal fluorescence microscopy (CFM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Concurrently, to find whether there is a correlation between biophysical properties and the immune response, we examined the impact of OGD on the levels of crucial ischaemia cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, TNF-α, IL-10, IL-4) and chemokines (CCL3, CCL5, CXCL10) in OHCs and calculated Pearsons’ and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients. The results of the current study demonstrated that the OGD procedure intensified cell death and nitric oxide release and led to the potentiation of HIF-1α release in OHCs. Moreover, we presented significant disturbances in the organization of the cytoskeleton (actin fibers, microtubular network) and cytoskeleton-associated protein 2 (MAP-2), which is a neuronal marker. Simultaneously, our study provided new evidence that the OGD procedure leads to the stiffening of OHCs and a malfunction in immune homeostasis. A negative linear correlation between tissue stiffness and branched IBA1 positive cells after the OGD procedure suggests the pro-inflammatory polarization of microglia. Moreover, the negative correlation of pro- and positive anti-inflammatory factors with actin fibers density indicates an opposing effect of the immune mediators on the rearrangement of cytoskeleton induced by OGD procedure in OHCs. Our study constitutes a basis for further research and provides a rationale for integrating biomechanical and biochemical methods in studying the pathomechanism of stroke-related brain damage. Furthermore, presented data pointed out the interesting direction of proof-of-concept studies, in which follow-up may establish new targets for brain ischemia therapy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","uid":"bdkLR6wGCrp59lwUjwb_dMA","uuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","name":"Instytut Fizyki Jądrowej im.

There is evidence of an association between suicidal behavior and depressive disorders (DDs). An increasing number of studies have suggested that nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2), a major endogenous regulator of the oxidative stress response, can be a novel target for the neurobiology of suicide-related disorders (including depression). This study aimed to investigate the relationship between oxidative stress progression, Nrf2 regulation, and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) subunit composition in the hippocampus (Hp) and frontal cortex (FCx) of suicide victims (n=14) and matched controls (n=8). Furthermore, zinc and magnesium concentrations and their potency to inhibit [3H] MK-801 (radioactively labeled form of MK-801 - dizocilpine, a well-characterized NMDAR channel uncompetitive antagonist frequently used in receptor-binding assays) binding to NMDA receptor channels were measured. Our results revealed a statistically significant increase in protein carbonyl levels and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) concentrations in Hp and FCx of suicide victims. Enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity (only in FCx) in suicides compared to controls was shown. These alterations were accompanied by an increase in Nrf2 protein levels in whole homogeneous tissue lysates and cytosolic fractions of Hp and FCx. Importantly, suicide victims presented a significant reduction in Nrf2 protein levels in the nuclear fraction of FCx. Finally, the observed decrease in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 2B (GluN2B) and postsynaptic density proteins 95 (PSD-95) protein levels was associated with a statistically significant reduction in magnesium levels in the FCx of suicide victims. These results confirm for the first time that increased oxidative stress parameters are related to Nrf2 protein changes and alterations in the NMDA receptor complex in the pathophysiology of suicidal behavior."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a1878c28a0473ae135"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Badania prowadzone w ostatnich latach wskazują, że zmiany w zachowaniu mogą być powiązane ze zmianami w składzie mikrobioty jelitowej. Pojawiają się również informacje, że nawet styl życia rodziców może w pewnym stopniu oddziaływać na mikrobiotę potomstwa poprzez dziedziczenie epigenetyczne. Skumulowany stres w różnej postaci powoduje zmiany w mikrobiocie jelitowej, a wydaje się, że oddziaływanie na mikrobiotę jelitową ma realny wpływ na zdrowie psychiczne.

Prenatal stress (PS) can affect brain maturation and neuroimmune and metabolic interactions, leading to age-dependent cognitive deficits in offspring. However, a multi-faceted cause-and-effect impact of PS on the development of cognitive deficits in the process of physiological ageing and in the APPNL-F/NL-F mouse model of Alzheimer's disease has not yet been evaluated. We have identified age-dependent cognitive learning and memory deficits using male C57BL/6 J (wild type, WT) and the knock-in APPNL-F/NL-F (KI) aged 12, 15, and 18 months. An increase in the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and mouse ApoE levels in the hippocampus and frontal cortex preceded the onset of cognitive deficits in the KI mice. Moreover, dysfunction in insulin signaling, including increased IRS-1 serine phosphorylation in both brain areas and the tyrosine phosphorylation deficit in the frontal cortex, suggested age-dependent insulin/IGF-1 resistance. Resistance was reflected by disturbances in mTOR or ERK1/2 kinase phosphorylation and excessive pro-inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-23) status in the KI mice. Importantly, our study has provided insights into the higher vulnerability to PS-induced exacerbation of age-dependent cognitive deficits and biochemical dysfunction in KI mice than in WT animals.

In order to determine the pharmacological profile of σ1R ligands, the most common method is to assess their potency to alleviate opioid analgesia. It has been well established that σ1R agonists reduce opioid analgesic activity, while σ1R antagonists have been demonstrated to enhance opioid analgesia in different pain models.\n\nMethods: In the present study, we evaluated the pharmacological profile of selected σ1R ligands using a novel object recognition (NOR) test, to see if any differences in cognitive functions between σ1R agonists and antagonists could be observed. We used the highly selective PRE-084 and S1RA as reference σ1R agonist and antagonist, respectively. Furthermore, compound KSK100 selected from our ligand library was also included in this study. KSK100 was previously characterized as a dual-targeting histamine H3/σ1R antagonist with antinociceptive and antiallodynic activity in vivo.

We investigated the role of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), a potential inhibitor of mastocyte serine proteases, on mast cell-dependent processes of relevance to the skin barrier defense in psoriasis. Here, we demonstrate that the dermal mast cells of patients with psoriasis express SLPI but not those of healthy donors. Moreover, SLPI transcripts were found to be markedly upregulated in murine mast cells by mediators derived from psoriasis skin explant cultures. Using mast cells from SLPI-deficient mice and their SLPI+ wild-type controls, we show that SLPI inhibits the activity of serine protease chymase in mastocytes. SLPI was also found to enhance the degranulation of mast cells activated via anti-IgE Abs but not Mrgprb2 ligands. Finally, we demonstrate that the expression and function of Mrgprb2 in mast cells are suppressed by a normal and, to a larger extent, psoriatic skin environment. Together, these findings reveal mechanisms underlying FcεRI- and Mrgprb2-dependent mast cell function that have not been described previously."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Numerous studies indicate that this type of pain is a chronic condition with a complex mechanism that tends to worsen over time, leading to a significant deterioration in patients' quality of life and issues like depression, disability, and disturbed sleep. Presently used analgesics are not effective enough in neuropathy treatment and may cause many side effects due to the high doses needed. In recent years, many researchers have pointed to the important role of chemokines not only in the development and maintenance of neuropathy but also in the effectiveness of analgesic drugs. Currently, approximately 50 chemokines are known to act through 20 different seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors located on the surface of neuronal, glial, and immune cells. Data from recent years clearly indicate that more chemokines than initially thought (CCL1/2/3/5/7/8/9/11, CXCL3/9/10/12/13/14/17; XCL1, CX3CL1) have pronociceptive properties; therefore, blocking their action by using neutralizing antibodies, inhibiting their synthesis, or blocking their receptors brings neuropathic pain relief. Several of them (CCL1/2/3/7/9/XCL1) have been shown to be able to reduce opioid drug effectiveness in neuropathy, and neutralizing antibodies against them can restore morphine and/or buprenorphine analgesia. The latest research provides irrefutable evidence that chemokine receptors are promising targets for pharmacotherapy; chemokine receptor antagonists can relieve pain of different etiologies, and most of them are able to enhance opioid analgesia, for example, the blockade of CCR1 (J113863), CCR2 (RS504393), CCR3 (SB328437), CCR4 (C021), CCR5 (maraviroc/AZD5672/TAK-220), CXCR2 (NVPCXCR220/SB225002), CXCR3 (NBI-74330/AMG487), CXCR4 (AMD3100/AMD3465), and XCR1 (vMIP-II). Recent research has shown that multitarget antagonists of chemokine receptors, such as CCR2/5 (cenicriviroc), CXCR1/2 (reparixin), and CCR2/CCR5/CCR8 (RAP-103), are also very effective painkillers. A multidirectional strategy based on the modulation of neuronal-glial-immune interactions by changing the activity of the chemokine family can significantly improve the quality of life of patients suffering from neuropathic pain.

While the pathophysiology underlying AUD is relatively well known, the cognitive mechanisms of an individual's susceptibility to the development of alcohol dependence remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the theoretical claim that sensitivity to positive feedback (PF), as a stable and enduring behavioural trait, can predict individual susceptibility to the acquisition and maintenance of alcohol-seeking behaviour in rats.\n\nMethods: Trait sensitivity to PF was assessed using a series of probabilistic reversal learning tests. The escalation of alcohol intake in rats was achieved by applying a mix of intermittent free access and instrumental paradigms of alcohol drinking. The next steps included testing the influence of sensitivity to PF on the acquisition of compulsive alcohol-seeking behaviour in the seeking-taking punishment task, measuring motivation to seek alcohol, and comparing the speed of extinction and reinstatement of alcohol-seeking after a period of abstinence between rats expressing trait insensitivity and sensitivity to PF. Finally, trait differences in the level of stress hormones and in the expression of genes and proteins in several brain regions of interest were measured to identify potential physiological and neuromolecular mechanisms of the observed interactions.\n\nResults: We showed that trait sensitivity to PF in rats determines the level of motivation to seek alcohol following the experience of its negative consequences. They also revealed significant differences between animals classified as insensitive and sensitive to PF in their propensity to reinstate alcohol-seeking behaviours after a period of forced abstinence. The abovementioned effects were accompanied by differences in blood levels of stress hormones and differences in the cortical and subcortical expression of genes and proteins related to dopaminergic, serotonergic, and GABAergic neurotransmission.\n\nConclusion: Trait sensitivity to PF can determine the trajectory of alcohol addiction in rats. This effect is, at least partially, mediated via distributed physiological and molecular changes within cortical and subcortical regions of the brain."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated the promise of pharmacological drugs in controlling the reinstatement of cocaine by targeting the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Recent evidence has revealed that esketamine, a (S) enantiomer of ketamine, shows a high affinity to NMDA receptors and has been used in clinical trials to treat moderate-to-severe depression. Methods: In the present paper, we investigated the effects of esketamine in regulating cocaine-seeking behaviour induced through the use of cocaine (10 mg/kg) or the cocaine-associated conditioned cue after a short (10 days)-lasting period of drug abstinence with extinction training, home cage or enrichment environment conditions in male rats. Furthermore, we investigated the acute effects of esketamine on locomotor activity in drug-naïve animals. Results: Esketamine (2.5–10 mg/kg) administered peripherally attenuated the reinstatement induced with cocaine priming or the drug-associated conditioned cue after different conditions of abstinence. Conclusions: These results seem to support esketamine as a candidate for the pharmacological management of cocaine-seeking and relapse prevention; however, further preclinical and clinical research is needed to better clarify esketamine’s actions in CUD."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

A less explored topic concerns the use of repeated low doses of psychedelics, at a dose that is well below the psychedelic dose used in psychedelic-assisted therapy and often referred to as microdosing. Psilocybin microdose users frequently report increases in mental health, yet such reports are often highly biased and vulnerable to placebo effects. Here we establish and validate a psilocybin microdose-like regimen in rats with repeated low doses of psilocybin administration at a dose derived from occupancy at rat brain 5-HT2A receptors in vivo. The rats tolerated the repeated low doses of psilocybin well and did not manifest signs of anhedonia, anxiety, or altered locomotor activity. There were no deficits in pre-pulse inhibition of the startle reflex, nor did the treatment downregulate or desensitize the 5-HT2A receptors. However, the repeated low doses of psilocybin imparted resilience against the stress of multiple subcutaneous injections, and reduced the frequency of self-grooming, a proxy for human compulsive actions, while also increasing 5-HT7 receptor expression and synaptic density in the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus. These results establish a well-validated regimen for further experiments probing the effects of repeated low doses of psilocybin. Results further substantiate anecdotal reports of the benefits of psilocybin microdosing as a therapeutic intervention, while pointing to a possible physiological mechanism."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Recently, in this context, the importance of formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) has been underlined. FPR2 activity is modulated by a wide range of endogenous ligands, including specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) (e.g., LXA4 and AT-LXA4) and synthetic ligands. Since SPMs have unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties, we aimed to evaluate the protective and pro-resolving effects of a new potent FPR2 agonist, compound CMC23, in organotypic hippocampal cultures (OHCs) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The protective activity of CMC23 limited the lactate dehydrogenase release in LPS-stimulated cultures. This activity was mediated by the interaction with FPR2 as pretreatment with the FPR2 selective antagonist WRW4 abolished CMC23-induced protection. Furthermore, decreased levels of pro-inflammatory IL-1β and IL-6 were observed after CMC23 administration in LPS-treated OHCs. CMC23 also diminished the LPS-induced increase in IL-17A and both IL-23 subunits p19 and p40 in OHCs. Finally, we demonstrated that CMC23 exerts its beneficial impact via the STAT3/SOCS3 signaling pathway since it attenuated the level of phospho-STAT3 and maintained the LPS-induced SOCS3 levels in OHCs. Collectively, our research implies that the new FPR2 agonist CMC23 has beneficial protective and anti-inflammatory properties in nanomolar doses and FPR2 represents a promising target for the enhancement of inflammation resolution."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Recent studies have demonstrated that CYP expression in the liver is controlled by the central nervous system via hormonal pathways. In particular, the expression of hepatic CYPs is negatively regulated by the brain serotoninergic system. The present study aimed to investigate changes in the function of the main liver drug-metabolizing CYP enzymes as a result of serotonin depletion in the brain of aging rats, caused by knockout of brain tryptophan hydroxylase gene (TPH2-KO).\n\nMethods: The hepatic CYP mRNA (qRT-PCR), protein level (Western blotting) and activity (HPLC), and serum hormone levels (ELISA) were measured in Dark Agouti wild-type (WT) male rats (mature 3.5-month-old and senescent 21-month-old) and in TPH2-KO senescent animals.\n\nResults: The expression/activity of the studied CYPs decreased with age in the liver of wild-type rats. The deprivation of serotonin in the brain of aging males decreased the mRNA level of most of the studied CYPs (CYP1A/2A/2B/3A), and lowered the protein level of CYP2C11 and CYP3A. In contrast, the activities of CYP2C11, CYP3A and CYP2C6 were increased. The expression of cytochrome b5 decreased in aging rats, but increased in TPH2-deficient senescent animals. The serum concentration of growth hormone declined in the aged and further dropped down in TPH2-deficient senescent rats.\n\nConclusions: Rat liver cytochrome P450 functions deteriorate with age, which may impair drug metabolism. The TPH2 knockout, which deprives brain serotonin, affects cytochrome P450 expression and activity differently in mature and senescent male rats."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

In the present study, we evaluated the antidepressant potential of NitroSynapsin (NS) at behavioural, structural, and functional levels. NS is a memantine derivative and a dual allosteric N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) antagonist using targeted delivery by the aminoadamantane of a warhead nitro group to inhibitory redox sites on the NMDAR. In a chronic restraint stress (CRS) mouse model of depression, five doses of NS administered on three consecutive days evoked antidepressant-like activity in the chronically stressed male C57BL/6J mice, reversing CRS-induced behavioural disturbances in sucrose preference and tail suspension tests. CRS-induced changes in morphology and density of dendritic spines in cerebrocortical neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) were also reversed by NS. Moreover, CRS-induced reduction in long-term potentiation (LTP) in the mPFC was found to be prevented by NS based on the electrophysiological recordings. Our study showed that NS restores structural and functional synaptic plasticity and reduces depressive behaviour to the level found in naïve animals. These results preliminarily revealed an antidepressant-like potency of NS."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9a","uid":"b8KxaPPV_aM8-YLJlYjQq8Q","uuid":"cd9df9ee-5c47-4b8c-bda2-b903eac95559","name":"Instytut Biologii Doświadczalnej im.

It strongly impairs daily functioning, and, in extreme cases, it can lead to suicide. Although different treatment options are available for patients with depression, there is an ongoing search for novel therapeutic agents, such as scopolamine (also known as hyoscine), that would offer higher efficacy, a more rapid onset of action, and a more favorable safety profile. The aim of our study was to review the current clinical evidence regarding the use of scopolamine, a promising therapeutic option in the treatment of depression. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL databases up to 5 June 2023. We included randomized placebo-controlled or head-to-head clinical trials that compared the clinical efficacy and safety of scopolamine in the treatment of major depressive disorder. Two reviewers independently conducted the search and study selection and rated the risk of bias for each study. Four randomized controlled trials were identified in the systematic review. The included studies investigated the use of scopolamine administered as an oral, intramuscular, or intravenous drug, alone or in combination with other antidepressants. The results indicated that scopolamine exerts antidepressant effects of varying intensity. We show that not all studies confirmed a statistically and clinically significant reduction of depressive symptoms vs. placebo. A broader perspective on scopolamine use in antidepressant treatment should be confirmed in subsequent large randomized controlled trials assessing both effectiveness and safety. Therefore, studies directly comparing the effectiveness of scopolamine depending on the route of administration are required."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5f89810d2467f02bdcfafa51","name":"Zakład Badań nad Żywieniem i Lekami, Instytut Zdrowia Publicznego, Uniwersytet Jagielloński","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709321878c28a0473a3434"],"type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Although there are various definitions and grading models for TRD, common criteria for assessing TRD have still not been established. However, a common feature of any TRD model is the lack of response to at least two attempts at antidepressant pharmacotherapy. The causes of TRD are not known; nevertheless, it is estimated that even 60% of TRD patients are so-called pseudo-TRD patients, in which multiple biological factors, e.g., gender, age, and hormonal disturbances are concomitant with depression and involved in antidepressant drug resistance. Whereas the phenomenon of TRD is a complex disorder difficult to diagnose and successfully treat, the search for new treatment strategies is a significant challenge of modern pharmacology. It seems that despite the complexity of the TRD phenomenon, some useful animal models of TRD meet the construct, the face, and the predictive validity criteria. Based on the literature and our own experiences, we will discuss the utility of animals exposed to the stress paradigm (chronic mild stress, CMS), and the Wistar Kyoto rat strain representing an endogenous model of TRD.

The role of microRNAs (miRs) in the regulation of metabolism is postulated. The aim of the study is to identify miRs that may be markers of MetS and to assess changes in miRs expression as a result of 10 and 20 whole-body cryotherapy treatments (WBC; 3 min, -120 °C) in postmenopausal women with MetS (M-60, BMI 30.56 ± 5.38 kg/m2), compared to healthy postmenopausal (H-60, BMI 25.57 ± 2.46 kg/m2) and healthy young women (H-20, BMI 22.90 ± 3.19 kg/m2). In a fasting state, before 1 WBC and after 10 WBCs, as well as 20 WBCs, the expression of miR-15a-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-23a-3p, miR-146a-5p, miR-197-3p, miR-223-3p, fasting blood glucose (FBG) and blood lipid profile were determined. miR-15a-5p and miR-21-5p were down-regulated in M-60, while miR-23a-3p and miR-197-3p were up-regulated, and miR-223-3p down-regulated in M-60 and H-60, compared to H-20. Significant positive correlations between up-regulated (mostly for miR-23-3p and miR-197-3p) and significant negative correlations between down-regulated (mostly for miR-15a-5p) miRs and markers of body composition as well as metabolic disorders were observed. After 20 WBCs, miR-15a-5p expression was up-regulated in all groups. In H-60, down-regulation of miR-197-3p expression occurred after 10 WBCs and 20 WBCs. Following 10 WBCs, FBG decreased in all groups, which intensified in M-60 post-20 WBCs. In our research, it has been shown that miR-23a-3p and miR-197-3p are accurate markers of MetS and MetS risk factors, while miR-15a-5p and miR-23a-3p are precise markers of body composition disorders. WBC is an effective treatment for up-regulating miR-15a-5p and lowering glucose levels in young and postmenopausal women and down-regulating miR-197-3p expression in postmenopausal women. It may be an adjunctive effective treatment method in MetS and hyperglycemia."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of a 7-day treatment with 25B-NBOMe in a dose of 0.3 mg/kg on the following: the neurotransmitter release in vivo using microdialysis in freely moving animals, hallucinogenic activity measured in the Wet Dog Shake (WDS) test, anxiety level as measured in the light/dark box (LDB) and locomotor activity in the open field (OF) test, DNA damage with the comet assay, and on a number of neuronal and glial cells with immunohistochemistry. Repeated administration of 25B-NBOMe decreased the response to a challenge dose (0.3 mg/kg) on DA, 5-HT and glutamatergic neurons in the rats' frontal cortex, striatum, and nucleus accumbens. The WDS response dropped drastically after the second day of treatment, suggesting a rapid development of tolerance. LDB and OF tests showed that the effect of 25B-NBOMe on anxiety depends on the treatment and environmental settings. Results obtained with the comet assay indicate a genotoxic properties in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. An increase in immunopositive glial but not neuronal cells was observed in the cortical regions but not in the hippocampus. In conclusion, our study showed that a chronic administration of 25B-NBOMe produces the development of tolerance observed in the neurotransmitters release and hallucinogenic activity.

However, prolonged or excessive microglial activation leads to disturbances in the resolution of inflammation (RoI). Formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) is a crucial player in the RoI, interacting with various ligands to induce distinct conformational changes and, consequently, diverse biological effects. Due to the poor pharmacokinetic properties of endogenous FPR2 ligands, the aim of our study was to evaluate the pro-resolving effects of a new ureidopropanamide agonist, compound AMS21, in hippocampal organotypic cultures (OHCs) stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Moreover, to assess whether AMS21 exerts its action via FPR2 specifically located on microglial cells, we conducted a set of experiments in OHCs depleted of microglial cells using clodronate. We demonstrated that the protective and anti-inflammatory activity of AMS21 manifested as decreased levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), nitric oxide (NO), and proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 release evoked by LPS in OHCs. Moreover, in LPS-stimulated OHCs, AMS21 treatment downregulated NLRP3 inflammasome-related factors (CASP1, NLRP3, PYCARD) and this effect was mediated through FPR2 because it was blocked by the FPR2 antagonist WRW4 pre-treatment. Importantly this beneficial effect of AMS21 was only observed in the presence of microglial FPR2, and absent in OHCs depleted with microglial cells using clodronate. Our results strongly suggest that the compound AMS21 exerts, at nanomolar doses, protective and anti-inflammatory properties and an FPR2 receptor located specifically on microglial cells mediates the anti-inflammatory response of AMS21. Therefore, microglial FPR2 represents a promising target for the enhancement of RoI."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

In this study, polyacrylic acid conjugated cerium oxide (PAA-CeO) nanoparticles were synthesized in a 50-60 nm size range with a zeta potential of - 35 mV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis revealed a mixed valence state of Ce4+ and Ce3+. PAA-CeO nanoparticles were safe for undifferentiated (UN-) and retinoic acid-differentiated (RA-) human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and reduced the extent of cell damage evoked by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). In the H2O2 model of cell damage PAA-CeO did not affect the caspase-3 activity (apoptosis marker) but attenuated the number of propidium iodide-positive cells (necrosis marker). In the 6-OHDA model, nanoparticles profoundly reduced necrotic changes and partially attenuated caspase-3 activity. However, we did not observe any impact of PAA-CeO on intracellular ROS formation induced by H2O2. Further, the flow cytometry analysis of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled PAA-CeO revealed a time- and concentration-dependent cellular uptake of nanoparticles. The results point to the neuroprotective potential of PAA-CeO nanoparticles against neuronal cell damage induced by H2O2 and 6-OHDA, which are in both models associated with the inhibition of necrotic processes and the model-dependent attenuation of activity of executor apoptotic protease, caspase-3 (6-OHDA model) but not with the direct inhibition of ROS (H2O2 model)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

They are of special interest because of their positive effects on neuropsychiatric disorders (depression and posttraumatic stress disorder). However, several findings revealed that some psychedelic actions are similar to symptoms observed in schizophrenia (psychosis, sensorimotor gating impairments, attention, and working memory deficits) which might limit their clinical applications. Psychedelics activate some neurotransmitters, i.e., serotonergic, and glutamatergic, that are also impaired in schizophrenia. Therefore, the neurobiological background of psychedelics and schizophrenia is partially similar. Another important aspect to discuss is the perspective of using psychedelics in schizophrenia therapy. Postmortem studies showed a loss of synapses in schizophrenia, and the positive effects of psychedelics on neuroplasticity (synaptogenesis, neurogenesis, and neuritogenesis) might be essential in the context of schizophrenia therapy. However, because of psychedelics' psychotic action, the recommended doses of psychedelics in schizophrenia treatment are not established, and subpsychedelic dosing or microdosing are considered. Exploratory studies are needed to determine the tolerability of treatment and appropriate dosing regimen. Another therapeutic option is using non-hallucinogenic psychedelic analogs that also induce neuroplastic outcomes but do not have psychotogenic effects. Further preclinical and clinical studies are needed to recognize the potential effectiveness of 5-HT2A agonists in schizophrenia therapy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

In the field of molecular property prediction, the emphasis is now on designing new model architectures, and the importance of atom featurization is oftentimes belittled. When contrasting two graph neural networks, the use of different representations possibly leads to incorrect attribution of the results solely to the network architecture. To better understand this issue, we compare multiple atom representations by evaluating them on the prediction of free energy, solubility, and metabolic stability using graph convolutional networks. We discover that the choice of atom representation has a significant impact on model performance and that the optimal subset of features is task-specific. Additional experiments involving more sophisticated architectures, including graph transformers, support these findings. Moreover, we demonstrate that some commonly used atom features, such as the number of neighbors or the number of hydrogens, can be easily predicted using only information about bonds and atom type, yet their explicit inclusion in the representation has a positive impact on model performance. Finally, we explain the predictions of the best-performing models to better understand how they utilize the available atomic features."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Currently used pharmacotherapy involves symptomatic treatment that do not always provide adequate pain relief. This may be due to concomitance of central sensitization and development of neuropathic features in OA patients. Here we performed studies in the animal model of OA to investigate of the neuropathic component. Intraarticular injection of monoiodoacetate (MIA, 1 mg) was used to induce OA in Wistar male rats. Development of pain phenotype was assessed by behavioral testing (PAM test and von Frey’s test), while corresponding changes in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs L3–L5) and spinal cord (SC) gene expression were assessed by means of qRT-PCR technique. We also performed microtomography of OA-affected knee joints to correlate the level of bone degradation with observed behavioral and molecular changes. We observed gradually developing remote allodynia after MIA treatment, indicating the presence of neuropathic component. Our results showed that, among DRGs innervating knee joint, development of central sensitization is most likely due to peripheral input of stimuli through DRG L5. In SC, development of secondary hypersensitivity correlated with increased expression of TAC1 and NPY.

Methods We used deep sequencing to investigate 5-HT2C receptor editing in mice during early ethanol deprivation following prolonged alcohol exposure and mice lacking tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH)2, a key enzyme in central 5-HT production.\nWe also examined Tph2 expression in ethanol-deprived animals using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Results Cessation from chronic 10% ethanol exposure in a two-bottle choice paradigm enhanced immobility time anddecreased latency in the forced swim test (FST), indicating a depression-like phenotype. In the hippocampus, ethanol-deprived “high ethanol-drinking” mice displayed reduced Tph2 expression, elevated 5-HT 2C receptor editing efficiency, and decreased frequency of the D mRNA variant, encoding the less-edited INV protein isoform. Tph2–/– mice showed attenuated receptor editing in the hippocampus and elevated frequency of non-edited None and D variants. In the prefrontal cortex, Tph2 deficiency increased receptor mRNA editing at site D and reduced the frequency of AB transcript, predicting a reduction in\nthe corresponding partially edited VNI isoform. Conclusions Our findings reveal differential effects of 5-HT depletion and ethanol cessation on 5-HT2C receptor editing. Central 5-HT depletion attenuated editing in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, whereas ethanol deprivation, coinciding\nwith reduced Tph2 expression in the hippocampus, enhanced receptor editing efficiency specifically in this brain region. This study highlights the interplay between 5-HT synthesis, ethanol cessation, and 5-HT 2C receptor editing, providing potential mechanism underlying increased ethanol consumption and deprivation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091d5878c28a04738bf15","name":"MAX DELBRUCK CENTER FOR MOLECULAR MIEDICINE","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094d6878c28a0473c4ecd"],"type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Unlike acute pain, which is short-term and starts suddenly in response to an injury, neuropathic pain arises from somatosensory nervous system damage or disease, is usually chronic, and makes every day functioning difficult, substantially reducing quality of life. The main reason for the lack of effective pharmacotherapies for neuropathic pain is its diverse etiology and the complex, still poorly understood, pathophysiological mechanism of its progression. Numerous experimental studies, including ours, conducted over the last several decades have shown that the development of neuropathic pain is based on disturbances in cell activity, imbalances in the production of pronociceptive factors, and changes in signaling pathways such as p38MAPK, ERK, JNK, NF-κB, PI3K, and NRF2, which could become important targets for pharmacotherapy in the future. Despite the availability of many different analgesics, relieving neuropathic pain is still extremely difficult and requires a multidirectional, individual approach. We would like to point out that an increasing amount of data indicates that nonselective compounds directed at more than one molecular target exert promising analgesic effects. In our review, we characterize four substances (minocycline, astaxanthin, fisetin, and peimine) with analgesic properties that result from a wide spectrum of actions, including the modulation of MAPKs and other factors. We would like to draw attention to these selected substances since, in preclinical studies, they show suitable analgesic properties in models of neuropathy of various etiologies, and, importantly, some are already used as dietary supplements; for example, astaxanthin and fisetin protect against oxidative stress and have anti-inflammatory properties. It is worth emphasizing that the results of behavioral tests also indicate their usefulness when combined with opioids, the effectiveness of which decreases when neuropathy develops. Moreover, these substances appear to have additional, beneficial properties for the treatment of diseases that frequently co-occur with neuropathic pain. Therefore, these substances provide hope for the development of modern pharmacological tools to not only treat symptoms but also restore the proper functioning of the human body."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Despite the availability of various treatments for depression, including pharmacotherapy, there is still a need to search for new agents with higher effectiveness and faster onset of action, especially for patients with treatment-resistant depression.\n\nAreas covered: A substance that has attracted considerable attention for nearly a decade is psilocybin, a natural psychedelic found in psilocybin mushrooms. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of psilocybin in the treatment of depression, based on pivotal randomized clinical trials. Moreover, we used findings from observational studies regarding recreational use. We also looked at ongoing clinical trials and discussed the registration status and clinical potential of the drug.\n\nExpert opinion: Clinical phase I-II trials published to date reported promising results for psilocybin in the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression, in a relatively short time after administration. However, before psilocybin is approved for use and administered to patients with depression, the results of large ongoing phase III clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety and to change the way it is perceived by physicians and patients."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5f89810d2467f02bdcfafa51","name":"Zakład Badań nad Żywieniem i Lekami, Instytut Zdrowia Publicznego, Uniwersytet Jagielloński","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709321878c28a0473a3434"],"type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

The complexity of the interactions that occur in living organisms requires improvements in the monolayer cultures. In the work presented here, neuroepithelial stem (NES) cells were differentiated into peripheral-like neurons (PLN) and the phenotype of the cells was confirmed at the genetic and protein levels. Then RNA-seq method was used to investigate how stimulation with pro-inflammatory factors such as LPS and IFNγ affects the expression of genes involved in the immune response in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (HFLS). HFLS were then cultured on semi-permeable membrane inserts, and after 24 hours of pro-inflammatory stimulation, the levels of cytokines secretion into the medium were checked. Inserts with stimulated HFLS were introduced into the PLN culture, and by measuring secreted ATP, an increase in cell activity was found in the system. The method used mimics the condition that occurs in the joint during inflammation, as observed in the development of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or osteoarthritis (OA). In addition, the system used can be easily modified to simulate the interaction of peripheral neurons with other cell types."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Cognitive deficits (including inattention, poor memory, and decision-making difficulties) are common in the clinical picture of depression. Cognitive impairment has been hypothesized to be one of the most important components of major depressive disorder (MDD; referred to as clinical depression), although typical cognitive symptoms are less frequent in people with depression than in people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (BD; sometimes referred to as manic-depressive disorder). The importance of α-Klotho in the aging process has been well-documented. Growing evidence points to the role of α-Klotho in regulating other biological functions, including responses to oxidative stress and the modulation of synaptic plasticity. It has been proven that a Klotho deficit may contribute to the development of various nervous system pathologies, such as behavioral disorders or neurodegeneration. Given the growing evidence of the role of α-Klotho in depression and cognitive impairment, it is assumed that this protein may be a molecular link between them. Here, we provide a research review of the role of α-Klotho in depression and cognitive impairment. Furthermore, we propose potential mechanisms (related to oxidative stress and glutamatergic transmission) that may be important in α-Klotho-mediated regulation of mental and cognitive function."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a1878c28a0473ae135","65333a5e40e3ff51d51ed8fb","5e709217878c28a04738fbde"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Their activation induces inhibition of neurotransmitter release, which are gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate (Glu), dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine. Postsynaptically localized CB1Rs regulate the activity of selected ion channels and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). CB2Rs are mainly peripheral and will not be considered here. Anandamide metabolism, mediated by cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), generates anandamide-derived prostanoids. In addition, COX-2 regulates the formation of CB1 ligands, which reduce excitatory transmission in the hippocampus (HC). The role of CB1Rs and COX-2 has been described in anxiety, depression, and cognition, among other central nervous system (CNS) disorders, affecting neurotransmission and behavior of the synapses.

Developing one universal and effective pharmacotherapy remains troublesome due to the high complexity and variety of symptoms. Over the last decades, the understanding of the mechanism of pathophysiology of depression and its key consequences for brain functioning have undergone significant changes, referring to the monoaminergic theory of the disease. After the breakthrough discovery of ketamine, research began to focus on the modulation of glutamatergic transmission as a new pharmacological target. Glutamate is a crucial player in mechanisms of a novel class of antidepressants, including hallucinogens such as ketamine. The role of glutamatergic transmission is also suggested in the antidepressant (AD) action of scopolamine and psilocybin. Despite fast, robust, and sustained AD action hallucinogens belonging to a group of rapid-acting antidepressants (RAA) exert significant undesired effects, which hamper their use in the clinic. Thus, the synergistic action of more than one substance in lower doses instead of monotherapy may alleviate the likelihood of adverse effects while improving therapeutic outcomes. In this review, we explore AD-like behavioral, synaptic, and molecular action of RAAs such as ketamine, scopolamine, and psilocybin, in combination with mGlu2/3 receptor antagonists."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

While crucial in the history of drug development, recent studies undermine the effectiveness of currently used antidepressant drugs in comparison to placebo, emphasizing the long time it takes to initiate the therapeutic response and numerous adverse effects. Thus, the scope of contemporary pharmacological research shifts from drugs affecting the serotonin system to rapid-acting antidepressant drugs. The prototypical representative of the aforementioned class is ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist capable of alleviating the symptoms of depression shortly after the drug administration. This discovery led to a paradigm shift, focusing on amino-acidic neurotransmitters and growth factors. Alas, the drug is not perfect, as its therapeutic effect diminishes circa 2 weeks after administration. Furthermore, it is not devoid of some severe side effects. However, there seems to be another, more efficient, and safer way to target the glutamatergic system. Hallucinogenic agonists of the 5-HT2A receptor, commonly known as psychedelics, are nowadays being reconsidered in clinical practice, shedding their infamous 1970s stigma. More and more clinical studies prove their clinical efficacy and rapid onset after a single administration while bearing fewer side effects. This review focuses on the current state-of-the-art literature and most recent clinical studies concerning the use of psychedelic drugs in the treatment of mental disorders. Specifically, the antidepressant potential of LSD, psilocybin, DMT, and 5-MeO-DMT will be discussed, together with a brief summary of other possible applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Recently, we showed that newly designed PaPE-1 (Pathway Preferential Estrogen-1), which selectively activates ER non-nuclear signaling pathways, elicited neuroprotection in a cellular model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) when it was applied at the same time as amyloid-β (Aβ). Since delayed treatment reflects clinical settings better than cotreatment does, current basic study proposes a novel therapeutic approach for AD that relies on a posttreatment with PaPE-1. In this study, mouse neuronal cell cultures treated with preaggregated Aβ1-42 (10 µM) showed the presence of extracellular Aβ1-42, confirming the adequacy of the AD model used. We are the first to demonstrate that a 24-h delayed posttreatment with PaPE-1 decreased the degree of Aβ-induced neurodegeneration, restored neurite outgrowth, and inhibited the expression of AD-related genes, i.e., Rbfox, Apoe, Bace2, App, and Ngrn, except for Chat, which was stimulated. In addition, PaPE-1 elicited anti-apoptotic effects by inhibiting Aβ-induced caspase activities as well as attenuating apoptotic chromatin condensation, and in these ways, PaPE-1 prevented neuronal cell death. Posttreatment with PaPE-1 also downregulated the Aβ-affected mRNA expression of apoptosis-specific factors, such as Bax, Gsk3b, Fas, and Fasl, except for Bcl2, which was upregulated by PaPE-1. In parallel, PaPE-1 decreased the protein levels of BAX, FAS, and FASL, which were elevated in response to Aβ. PaPE-1 elicited a decrease in the BAX/BCL2 ratio that corresponds to increased methylation of the Bax gene. However, the PaPE-1-evoked Bcl2 gene hypermethylation suggests other PaPE-1-dependent mechanisms to control Aβ-induced apoptosis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Over the past few years, compelling evidence has emerged suggesting that prenatal exposure to a maternal high-fat diet (HFD) could trigger neuropsychiatric disorders in the offspring, such as depression. The majority of brain development takes place before birth and during lactation. Nevertheless, our understanding of the impact of HFD on myelination in the offspring's brain during both gestation and lactation remains limited. In the present study, we investigated the effects of maternal HFD (60% energy from fat) on depressive-like and myelin-related changes in adolescent and adult rat offspring. Maternal HFD increased immobility during the forced swimming test in both adolescent and adult offspring. Correspondingly, the depressive-like phenotype in offspring correlated with dysregulation of several genes and proteins in the prefrontal cortex, especially of MOG, MAL, CNPase, kallikrein 6, and transferrin in male offspring, as well as of MOG and kallikrein 6 in female offspring, which persist even into adulthood. Maternal HFD also induced long-lasting adaptations manifested by the reduction of immature and mature oligodendrocytes in the prefrontal cortex in adult offspring. In summary, maternal HFD-induced changes in myelin-related genes are correlated with depressive-like behavior in adolescent offspring, which persists even to adulthood."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Our previous study showed that the systemic administration of the antagonist of the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor, the compound CP-101,606, affected liver cytochrome P450 expression and activity. To discern between the central and peripheral mechanisms of enzyme regulation, our current study aimed to explore whether the intracerebral administration of CP-101,606 could impact cytochrome P450. The injection of CP-101,606 to brain lateral ventricles (6, 15, or 30 µg/brain) exerted dose-dependent effects on liver cytochrome P450 enzymes and hypothalamic or pituitary hormones. The lowest dose led to an increase in the activity, protein, and mRNA level of CYP2C11 compared to the control. The activities of CYP2A, CYP2B, CYP2C11, CYP2C6, CYP2D, and protein levels of CYP2B, CYP2C11 were enhanced compared to the highest dose. Moreover, CP-101,606 increased the CYP1A protein level coupled with elevated CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 mRNA levels, but not activity. The antagonist decreased the pituitary somatostatin level and increased the serum growth hormone concentration after the lowest dose, while independently decreasing the serum corticosterone concentration of the dose. The findings presented here unveil a novel physiological regulatory mechanism whereby the brain glutamatergic system, via the NMDA receptor, influences liver cytochrome P450.

We aimed at performing a comparative study on the influence of chronic treatment with lurasidone on the expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver and in peripheral blood lymphocytes, and to evaluate the relationship between changes in the expression of CYP enzymes in the two experimental models. The obtained results show a fairly similar expression pattern of the main CYP enzymes in the rat livers and lymphocytes, and they indicate that in the liver, lurasidone exerts an inhibitory effect on the activity, protein and mRNA levels of CYP2B1/2 (not CYP2B2 mRNA), CYP2C11 and CYP2E1, while in the case of CYP3A1 and CYP3A2, it causes enzyme induction. At the same time, lurasidone decreases the expression of CYP2B, CYP2C11 (CYP2C11 protein only) and CYP2E1 but increases that of CYP3A2 (not CYP3A1) in lymphocyte cells. In conclusion, chronic treatment with lurasidone simultaneously and in the same way influences the expression and activity of CYP2B, CYP2C11, CYP2E1 and CYP3A2 in the liver and peripheral blood lymphocytes of rats. Thus, the lymphocyte cytochrome P450 profile may be utilized as an indicator of the hepatic cytochrome P450 profile in further clinical studies with lurasidone, and lymphocytes may serve as easily available surrogates for examining the impact of new drugs and chronic in vivo treatments on CYP enzyme expression, as well as to estimate drug-drug interactions and toxicity risk."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Results showed that CA protected mouse primary neuronal cell cultures against hydrogen peroxide-induced damage more efficiently than ED or EB. The neuroprotective effects of CA were associated with attenuation of reactive oxygen species level and increased mitochondrial membrane potential but not with a reduction in caspase-3 activity. None of the tested substances was protective against glutamate or oxygen-glucose deprivation-evoked neuronal cell damage, and EB even increased the detrimental effects of these insults. Further experiments using the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells showed that CA but not ED or EB attenuated the cell damage induced by hydrogen peroxide and that the composition of culture medium is the critical factor in evaluating neuroprotective effects in this model. Our data indicate that the neuroprotective potential of CA, ED, and EB may be revealed in vitro only under specific conditions, with their rather narrow micromolar concentrations, relevant cellular model, type of toxic agent, and exposure time.

Their role in depression, cognition, schizophrenia, learning and memorization, Alzheimer's disease, and more is well documented. In the search for new drug candidates in depression, intensive studies have been conducted. Compounds that act by influencing NMDARs have been particularly intensively investigated following the success of ketamine in clinics. Unfortunately, the side effects associated with ketamine do not allow it to be useful in all cases. Therefore, it is important to learn about new unknown mechanisms related to NMDAR activation and study the impact of changes in the excitatory synapse environment on this receptor. Both direct and intermediary influence on NMDARs via mGluRs and COX-2 are effective. Our prior studies showed that both mGluRs ligands and COX-2 inhibitors are potent in depression-like and cognitive studies through mutual interactions. The side effects associated with imipramine administration, e.g., memory impairment, were improved when inhibiting COX-2. Therefore, this study is a trial that involves searching for modifications in NMDARs in mouse brains after prolonged treatment with MTEP (mGluR5 antagonist), NS398 (COX-2 inhibitor), or imipramine (tricyclic antidepressant). The prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HC) were selected for PCR and Western blot analyses. Altered expression of Gin2a or Grin2b genes after treatment was found. The observed effects were more potent when COX-2 was inhibited. The finding described here may be vital when searching for new drugs acting via NMDARs without the side effects related to cognition."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a1878c28a0473ae135","5e709217878c28a04738fbde"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

They arouse recent interest due to their therapeutic applications in the treatment of major depressive disorder, substance use disorder, end-of-life anxiety,= and anxiety symptoms, and obsessive–compulsive disorder. In this review, the current state of preclinical research on the mechanism of action, neurotoxicity, and behavioral impact of psychedelics is summarized. The effect of selective 5-HT2A receptor agonists, 25I- and 25B-NBOMe, after acute and repeated administration is characterized and compared with the effects of a less selective drug, psilocybin. The data show a significant effect of NBOMes on glutamatergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic neurotransmission in the frontal cortex, striatum, and nucleus accumbens. The increases in extracellular levels of neurotransmitters were not dose-dependent, which most likely resulted from the stimulation of the 5-HT2A receptor and subsequent activation of the 5-HT2C receptors. This effect was also observed in the wet dog shake test and locomotor activity. Chronic administration of NBOMes elicited rapid development of tolerance, genotoxicity, and activation of microglia. Acute treatment with psilocybin affected monoaminergic and aminoacidic neurotransmitters in the frontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and hippocampus but not in the amygdala. Psilocybin exhibited anxiolytic properties resulting from intensification of GABAergic neurotransmission.

The administration of the activators of these receptors prevents the development of cognitive dysfunctions in animal models of schizophrenia induced by MK-801 (N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist) administration. GABAergic dysfunction is considered as one of the most important causes of MK-801-induced spatial learning deficits.\n\nMethods: Novel object recognition (NOR) and Morris water maze (MWM) tests were used to study the anti-amnestic effect of the biased 5-HT1A receptor agonist (F15599) alone or in combinations with VU0357017 (M1 receptor allosteric agonist), VU0152100 (M4 receptor positive allosteric modulator), and VU0238429 (M5 receptor positive allosteric modulator) on MK-801-induced dysfunctions. The compounds were administered for 5 consecutive days. Animals tested with the MWM underwent 5-day training. Western blotting was used to study the expressions of 5-HT1A receptors and the level of GAD65 in the frontal cortices (FCs) and hippocampi of the animals.\n\nResults: F15599 prevented the amnestic effect induced by MK-801 in the MWM at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg. The co-administration of the compound with muscarinic receptors activators had no synergistic effect. The additive effect of the combinations was evident in the prevention of declarative memory dysfunctions investigated in NOR. The administration of MK-801 impaired 5-HT1A expression in the hippocampi and decreased GAD65 levels in both the FCs and hippocampi. The administration of muscarinic ligands prevented these MK-801-induced deficits only in the hippocampi of MWM-trained animals. No effects of the compounds were observed in untrained mice.\n\nConclusion: Our results indicate that F15599 prevents schizophrenia-related spatial learning deficits in the MWM; however, the activity of the compound is not intensified with muscarinic receptors activators. In contrast, the combined administration of the ligands is effective in the NOR model of declarative memory. The muscarinic receptors activators reversed MK-801-induced 5-HT1A and GAD65 dysfunctions in the hippocampi of MWM-trained mice, but not in untrained mice."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Currently available therapies against Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies are mostly symptomatic and fail to slow the disease progression in the long term. Modification of α-synuclein (αS) aggregation and toxicity of its pathogenic forms is one of the main goals in neuroprotective approach. Since the discovery of lipid component of Lewy bodies, fatty acids became a crucial, yet little explored target for research. MUFAs (monounsaturated fatty acids) are substrates for lipids, such as phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters. They regulate membrane fluidity, take part in signal transduction, cellular differentiation and other fundamental processes. αS and MUFA interactions are essential for Lewy body pathology. αS increases levels of MUFAs, mainly oleic acid, which in turn can enhance αS toxicity and aggregation. Thus, reduction of MUFAs synthesis by inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) activity could be the new way to prevent aggravation of αS pathology. Due to the limited distribution in peripheral tissues, SCD5 is a potential target in novel therapies and therefore could be an important starting point in search for disease-modifying neuroprotective therapy. Here we summarize facts about physiology and pathology of αS, explain recently discovered lipid-αS interactions, review SCD function and involved mechanisms, present available SCD inhibitors and discuss their pharmacological potential in disease management.

Previously, we have shown that brief optogenetic inhibition of VTA DA neurons with 1 s pulses delivered every 9 s attenuates cocaine seeking under extinction conditions in rats without producing overt signs of dysphoria or locomotor sedation. Whether recruitment of neuronal pathways inhibiting VTA neuronal activity would suppress drug seeking remains unknown. Here, we asked if optogenetic stimulation of the lateral habenula (LHb) efferents in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) as well as RMTg efferents in VTA would reduce drug seeking. To investigate this, we measured how recruitment of elements of this inhibitory pathway affects cocaine seeking in male rats under extinction conditions. The effectiveness of brief optogenetic manipulations was confirmed electrophysiologically at the level of electrical activity of VTA DA neurons. Real-time conditioned place aversion (RT-CPA) and open field tests were performed to control for potential dysphoric/sedating effects of brief optogenetic stimulation of LHb-RMTg-VTA circuitry. Optogenetic stimulation of either RMTg or LHb inhibited VTA DAergic neuron firing, whereas similar stimulation of RMTg efferents in VTA or LHb efferents in RMTg reduced cocaine seeking under extinction conditions. Moreover, stimulation of LHb-RMTg efferents produced an effect that was maintained 24 h later, during cocaine seeking test without stimulation.

Chronic restraint stress (CRS) is well validated and is one of the most commonly used models to induce depressive-like behavior in rodents. The present study aimed to evaluate whether fluoxetine (FLU 5 mg/kg) and zinc (Zn 10mg/kg) given simultaneously induce a more pronounced antidepressant-like effect in the CRS model than both those compounds given alone. Behavioral assessment was performed using the tail suspension and splash tests (TST and ST, respectively). Furthermore, the effects of CRS, FLU and Zn given alone and combined treatment with FLU + Zn on the expression of proteins involved in the apoptotic, inflammatory, and epigenetic processes were evaluated in selected brain structures (prefrontal cortex, PFC; and hippocampus, Hp) using Western blot analysis or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The results obtained indicated that three hours (per day) of immobilization for 4 weeks induced prominent depressive symptoms that manifested as increased immobility time in the TST, as well as decreased number and grooming time in the ST. Behavioral changes induced by CRS were reversed by both FLU (5 and 10 mg/kg) or Zn (10 mg/kg). Zinc supplementation (10 mg/kg) slightly increases the effectiveness of FLU (5 mg/kg) in the TST. However, it significantly increased the activity of FLU in the ST compared to the effect induced by FLU and Zn alone. Biochemical studies revealed that neither CRS nor FLU and Zn given alone or in combined treatment alter the expression of proteins involved in apoptotic or inflammatory processes. CRS induced major alterations in histone deacetylase (HDAC) levels by increasing the level of HADC1 and decreasing the level of HADC4 in the PFC and Hp, decreasing the level of HADC6 in the PFC but increasing it in Hp. Interestingly, FLU + Zn treatment reversed CRS-induced changes in HDAC levels in the Hp, indicating that HDAC modulation is linked to FLU + Zn treatment and this effect is structure-specific."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a1878c28a0473ae135","5e709217878c28a04738fbde"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Excessive action of these hormones is known to contribute to psychiatric disorders, including depression.\n\nMaterials: The study was performed in a rat model of depression based on prenatal administration of dexamethasone (DEX) in late pregnancy (0.1 mg/kg, days 14-21). We evaluated the effects of prenatal DEX treatment on the cognition and bioenergetic signaling pathways in the brain of adult male rats, in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, and in response to stress in adulthood, using behavioral and biochemical test batteries.\n\nResults: We revealed cognitive deficits in rats prenatally treated with DEX. At the molecular level, a decrease in the orexin A and orexin B levels and downregulation of the AMPK-SIRT1-PGC1α transduction pathway in the frontal cortex of these animals were observed. In the hippocampus, a decreased expression of orexin B was found and changes in the MR/GR ratio were demonstrated. Furthermore, an increase in HDAC5 level triggered by the prenatal DEX treatment in both brain structures and a decrease in MeCP2 level in the hippocampus were reported.\n\nConclusions: Our study demonstrated that prenatal DEX treatment is associated with cognitive dysfunction and alterations in various proteins leading to metabolic changes in the frontal cortex, while in the hippocampus adaptation mechanisms were activated. The presented results imply that different pathophysiological metabolic processes may be involved in depression development, which may be useful in the search for novel therapies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Since oxytocin (OXT) is known to play a role in social functions and modulates cognitive processes, we investigated the effects of a novel, nonpeptide, selective OXT receptor agonist, LIT-001, in a neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia. Administration of methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM; 22 mg/kg) on the 17th day of rat pregnancy is known to cause developmental disturbances of the brain, which lead to schizophrenia-like symptomatology in the offspring. Here, we examined the effects of acutely administered LIT-001 (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg) in MAM-exposed males and females on social behaviour, communication and cognition. We report that MAM-treated adult male and female rats displayed reduced social behaviour, ultrasonic communication and novel object recognition test performance. LIT-001 partially reversed these deficits, increasing the total social interaction time and the number of 'positive', highly-modulated 50 kHz ultrasonic calls in male rats. The compound ameliorated MAM-induced deficits in object discrimination in both sexes.

Dopamine is involved in reward, motivation, and social behavior. Thus, we evaluated whether neonatal ethanol exposure (in an animal model of FASDs) has an impact on social recognition memory using the three-chamber social novelty discrimination test during early and middle adolescence in male and female rats, and whether the modafinil analog, the novel atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitor CE-123, can modify this effect. Our study shows that male and female rats neonatally exposed to ethanol exhibited sex- and age-dependent deficits in social novelty discrimination in early (male) and middle (female) adolescence. These deficits were specific to the social domain and not simply due to more general deficits in learning and memory because these animals did not exhibit changes in short-term recognition memory in the novel object recognition task. Furthermore, early-adolescent male rats that were neonatally exposed to ethanol did not show changes in the anxiety index but demonstrated an increase in locomotor activity. Chronic treatment with CE-123, however, prevented the appearance of these social deficits. In the hippocampus of adolescent rats, CE-123 increased BDNF and decreased its signal transduction TrkB receptor expression level in ethanol-exposed animals during development, suggesting an increase in neuroplasticity. Thus, selective dopamine reuptake inhibitors, such as CE-123, represent interesting drug candidates for the treatment of deficits in social behavior in adolescent individuals with FASDs."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Among them, CXCL12 is constitutively and widely expressed in the CNS, where it was shown to act on cellular, synaptic, network, and behavioral levels. Its receptor, CXCR4, is abundant in the amygdala, a brain structure involved in pathophysiology of anxiety disorders. Dysregulation of CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling has been implicated in anxiety-related behaviors. Here we demonstrate that exogenous CXCL12 at 2 nM but not at 5 nM increased neuronal excitability in the lateral division of the rat central amygdala (CeL) which was evident in the Late-Firing but not Regular-Spiking neurons. These effects were blocked by AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist. Moreover, CXCL12 increased the excitability of the neurons of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) that is known to project to the CeL. However, CXCL12 increased neither the spontaneous excitatory nor spontaneous inhibitory synaptic transmission in the CeL. In summary, the data reveal specific activation of Late-Firing CeL cells along with BLA neurons by CXCL12 and suggest that this chemokine may alter information processing by the amygdala that likely contributes to anxiety and fear conditioning."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

The C–C composites were made via chemical vapour deposition (CVD) synthesis of pyrocarbon on carbon fibers, with subsequent thermal spray deposition of carbon nanotubes (CNT). Different CNT types were tested to evaluate their impact on electrochemical and biological performance. Materials were analyzed for microstructure, surface chemistry, and electrochemical properties, then tested using SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells for biological assessment. The C–C composites coated with a hydroxy-terminated CNT demonstrated significantly enhanced electrochemical properties, in particular increased cathodal charge capacity up to 12.51 mC cm−2, a wide safe potential window of −1.53 to 1.26 V, and decreased impedance, and cut-off frequency (fcut-off = 0.16 kHz). No acute negative biological responses of the materials were detected after 48 h of exposition. Such properties significantly outperform the properties of platinum, which is the basic element of platinum electrodes, demonstrating the excellent performance of the obtained composites and showing it may constitute the basic element of carbon electrodes for nerve stimulation in the future.

However, its effects are not the same in all the subjects as only a portion of individuals exposed to stress will eventually develop negative mental outcomes, while others can be considered resilient. However, the biological processes underlying the development of a vulnerable or resilient phenotype are still poor understood. In order to cover this, we here used both transcriptomic and miRNomic based approaches in the ventral hippocampus of control (CON) and rats exposed to the chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm, which were then divided into vulnerable (VULN) or resilient (RES) animals according to the sucrose consumption test.\nTranscriptomic analyses in VULN rats, compared to both the group of CON and RES animals, revealed the activation of inflammatory/immune-related pathways, specifically involved in antibodies and cytokine production, and the inhibition of pathways involved in protein synthesis. Conversely, transcriptomic data in RES animals suggested the activation of several pathways involved in neurotransmission.\nWe then performed a mRNA-miRNA integration analysis by using miRComb R package, and we found that the most significant mRNA-miRNA pairs were involved in promoting the inflammatory status in VULN animals and, vice versa, by decreasing it in RES rats. Moreover, in VULN animals, the mRNA-miRNA combining analyses revealed the modulation of the olfactory sensory system, a key biological process that has been already found involved in the etiology of stress related disorders such as depression.\nOverall, our mRNA-miRNA integration-based approach identified distinct biological processes that are relevant for the development of a vulnerable or resilient phenotype in response to the negative effects of CMS exposure, which could allow the identification of novel targets for prevention or treatment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

In turn, exposure to stress induces noradrenergic system adaptations, some of which are implicated in the etiology of stress-related disorders. Adrenergic receptors (AR) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) have been demonstrated to regulate phasic dopamine (DA) release in the forebrain, necessary for behavioral responses to conditional cues. However, the impact of stress on noradrenergic modulation of the VTA has not been previously explored. We demonstrate that ARs in the VTA regulate dopaminergic activity in the VTA-BLA (basolateral amygdala) circuit, a key system for processing stress-related stimuli; and that such control is altered by acute stress. We utilized fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to assess the effects of intra-VTA microinfusion of α1 -AR and α2 -AR antagonists (terazosin and RX-821002, respectively), on electrically evoked phasic DA release in the BLA in stress-naïve and stressed (unavoidable electric shocks - UES) anaesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats. In addition, we used western blotting to explore UES-induced alterations in AR protein level in the VTA. Intra-VTA terazosin or RX-821002 dose-dependently attenuated DA release in the BLA. Interestingly, UES decreased the effects of intra-VTA α2 -AR blockade on DA release (24 h but not 7 days after stress), while the effects of terazosin were unchanged. Despite changes in α2 -AR physiological function in the VTA, UES did not alter α2 -AR protein levels in either intracellular or membrane fractions. These findings demonstrate that NA-ergic modulation of the VTA-BLA circuit undergoes significant alterations in response to acute stress, with α2 -AR signaling indicated as a key target."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Over the past few years, compelling evidence has emerged suggesting that prenatal exposure to a maternal high-fat diet (HFD) could trigger neuropsychiatric disorders in the offspring, such as depression. The majority of brain development takes place before birth and during lactation. Nevertheless, our understanding of the impact of HFD on myelination in the offspring's brain during both gestation and lactation remains limited. In the present study, we investigated the effects of maternal HFD (60% energy from fat) on depressive-like and myelin-related changes in adolescent and adult rat offspring. Maternal HFD increased immobility time during the forced swimming test in both adolescent and adult offspring. Correspondingly, the depressive-like phenotype in offspring correlated with dysregulation of several genes and proteins in the prefrontal cortex, especially of myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), myelin and lymphocyte protein (MAL), 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), kallikrein 6, and transferrin in male offspring, as well as of MOG and kallikrein 6 in female offspring, which persist even into adulthood. Maternal HFD also induced long-lasting adaptations manifested by the reduction of immature and mature oligodendrocytes in the prefrontal cortex in adult offspring. In summary, maternal HFD-induced changes in myelin-related genes are correlated with depressive-like behavior in adolescent offspring, which persists even to adulthood."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Hence, stress-induced alterations represent a key target for pharmacological interventions aimed at restoring brain function in affected individuals. We have previously demonstrated that lurasidone, a multi-receptor antipsychotic drug approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar depression, can normalize the functional and molecular impairments induced by stress exposure, representing a valuable tool for the treatment of stress-induced mental illnesses. However, the mechanisms that may contribute to the therapeutic effects of lurasidone are still poorly understood. Here, we performed a transcriptomic analysis on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of adult male rats exposed to the chronic mild stress (CMS) paradigm and we investigated the impact of chronic lurasidone treatment on such changes. We found that CMS exposure leads to an anhedonic phenotype associated with a down-regulation of different pathways associated to neuronal guidance and synaptic plasticity within the PFC. Interestingly, a significant part of these alterations (around 25%) were counteracted by lurasidone treatment. In summary, we provided new insights on the transcriptional changes relevant for the therapeutic intervention with lurasidone, which may ultimately promote resilience."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

CeONPs and Eu-CeONPs in the size range of 15–30 nm were stable at room temperature. The X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis revealed the chemical state of Eu and Ce components, and we could conclude that all Eu3+ detected on the surface is well integrated into the cerium oxide lattice. The emission spectrum of Eu-CeO arising from the 7F0 → 5D1 MD and 7F0 → 5D2 transitions indicated the Eu3+ ion acting as a luminescence center. The fluorescence of Eu-CeONPs was visualized by depositing them at the surface of positively charged latex particles. The developed nanoparticles were safe for human neuronal-like cells. Compared with CeONPs, Eu-CeONPs at all concentrations exhibited enhanced neuroprotection against 6-OHDA, while the protection trend of Eu-CeO was similar to that of CeO against H2O2 in SH-SY5Y cells.

The mechanism of these changes is not well understood; however, clinical studies have shown that the administration of the fast-acting antidepressant ketamine reversed the decrease in hippocampus and amygdala volume in depressed patients, and the magnitude of this effect correlated with the reduction in depressive symptoms. In the present study, we attempted to find out whether the psychedelic substance psilocybin affects neurotransmission in the limbic system in comparison to ketamine. Psilocybin and ketamine increased the release of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) in the nucleus accumbens of naive rats as demonstrated using microdialysis. Both drugs influenced glutamate and GABA release in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus and amygdala and increased ACh levels in the hippocampus. The changes in D2, 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor density in the nucleus accumbens and hippocampus were observed as a long-lasting effect. A marked anxiolytic effect of psilocybin in the acute phase and 24 h post-treatment was shown in the open field test. These data provide the neurobiological background for psilocybin's effect on stress, anxiety and structural changes in the limbic system and translate into the antidepressant effect of psilocybin in depressed patients."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

One of the most commonly reported causal conditions is osteoarthritis (OA). In addition to sensory symptoms, chronic pain shares an inherent overlap with mood or anxiety disorders. The involvement of the frontal cortex, striatum and nucleus accumbens, in the affective processing of pain is still poorly understood.\n\nMethods: Male Wistar rats were divided into two groups: MIA (monoiodoacetate injected into the knee-model of OA) and sham (NaCl). Behavioral tests assessing pain, anxiety, and depressive behavior were performed at week 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10. Neurochemical assays were conducted at weeks 3, 6, and 10 post-MIA injection, followed by the neurotransmitters and their metabolites correlation matrix and network analysis.\n\nResults: OA animals developed rapid pain phenotype, whereas anxiety-like behavior accompanied the development of a pain phenotype from 6 week post-MIA injection. We did not detect any depressive-like behavior. Instead, immobility time measured in the forced swimming test transiently decreased at 3 weeks post-MIA in the OA group. We detected changes in noradrenaline and serotonin levels in analyzed structures at distinct time points. Network analysis revealed noradrenaline and serotonin neurotransmission changes in the nucleus accumbens, confirming it to be the key structure affected by chronic pain.\n\nConclusion: Animals with chronic pain exhibit symptoms of anxiety-like behavior and we identified underlying neurochemical changes using network analysis."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

During development, we used a dataset that consisted of recordings from real-world experiments in the open field. Recordings like these pose obstacles to automatic USV detection, one of which is the noise produced by mice in the experimental area or in nearby cages.

potential use in this type of pain. Hybrids consist of two types of pharmacophores that are connected by different types of linkers. The first pharmacophore is an opioid agonist, and the second pharmacophore is an antagonist of the pronociceptive system, i.e., an antagonist of the melanocortin-4 receptor. The results of tests in acute and neuropathic pain models of the obtained compounds have shown that the type of linker used to connect pharmacophores had an effect on antinociceptive activity. Peptidomimetics containing longer flexible linkers were very effective at low doses in the neuropathic pain model. To elucidate the effect of linker lengths, two hybrids showing very high activity and two hybrids with lower activity were further tested for affinity for opioid (mu, delta) and melanocortin-4 receptors. Their complexes with the target receptors were also studied by molecular modelling. Our results do not show a simple relationship between linker length and affinity for particular receptor types but suggest that activity in neuropathic pain is related to a proper balance of receptor affinity rather than maximum binding to any or all of the target receptors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927d878c28a0473968fb","61dd6f322467f047f3af8de9","61dd6f322467f047f3af8de5","61dd6f322467f047f3af8de8","61dd6f322467f047f3af8deb","5e70941c878c28a0473b6626"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Despite extensive basic research and promising outcomes in animal models, the translation of GPCR heterodimer-targeting drugs into clinical use remains limited. The complexities of in vivo conditions, particularly within thecomplex central nervous system, pose challenges in fully replicating physiological environments, hindering clinical success. This review discusses examples of the most studied heterodimers, their involvement in nervous system pathology, and the available data on their potential ligands. In addition, this review highlights the intricate interplay between lipids and GPCRs as a potential key factor in understanding the complexity of cell signaling. The multifaceted role of lipids in modulating the dynamics of GPCR dimerization is explored, shedding light on the elaborate molecular mechanisms governing these interactions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Since the effective treatment with psychedelics is usually provided with psychotherapy, it is debatable whether their prolonged efficacy can be observed in infrahuman species. Preclinical reports on psychedelics’ effects most often address their acute actions, and different tests and models provide inconsistent results. The goal of this study was to examine whether the treatment with psilocybin and/or LSD would demonstrate immediate and/or sustained antidepressant-like effects in the differential reinforcement of low-rate responding (DRL) schedule in rats. In contrast to the antidepressant screening tools, the DRL 72s test is known to detect antidepressants with high predictive validity as it differentiates clinically effective antidepressants from other psychoactive drugs in non-stressed animals. Methods: Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were injected over three consecutive days with psilocybin (1 mg/kg), LSD (0.08 mg/kg), or saline and then tested in DRL 72s for the following 4 weeks. Results: Treatment with psilocybin but not LSD demonstrated an immediate antidepressant-like effect, manifested as an increased number of reinforced presses and response efficiency. By contrast, neither of the drugs showed a long-term (up to 4 weeks following administration) antidepressant-like effect. Conclusions: Using DRL 72s schedule of reinforcement, we demonstrated the acute antidepressant-like effect of psilocybin but not of LSD, and failed to detect their persistent antidepressant-like efficacy. The present study suggests that the detection of long-lasting antidepressant-like activity in rats could be challenging and may require entirely novel behavioral methods."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

and molecular insight into piperazine and piperidine derivatives as histamine H3 and sigma-1 receptor antagonists with promising antinociceptive properties","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In an attempt to extend recent studies showing that some clinically evaluated histamine H3 receptor (H3R) antagonists possess nanomolar affinity at sigma-1 receptors (σ1R), we selected 20 representative structures among our previously reported H3R ligands to investigate their affinity at σRs. Most of the tested compounds interact with both sigma receptors to different degrees. However, only six of them showed higher affinity toward σ1R than σ2R with the highest binding preference to σ1R for compounds 5, 11, and 12. Moreover, all these ligands share a common structural feature: the piperidine moiety as the fundamental part of the molecule. It is most likely a critical structural element for dual H3/σ1 receptor activity as can be seen by comparing the data for compounds 4 and 5 (hH3R Ki = 3.17 and 7.70 nM, σ1R Ki = 1531 and 3.64 nM, respectively), where piperidine is replaced by piperazine. We identified the putative protein-ligand interactions responsible for their high affinity using molecular modeling techniques and selected compounds 5 and 11 as lead structures for further evaluation. Interestingly, both ligands turned out to be high-affinity histamine H3 and σ1 receptor antagonists with negligible affinity at the other histamine receptor subtypes and promising antinociceptive activity in vivo. Considering that many literature data clearly indicate high preclinical efficacy of individual selective σ1 or H3R ligands in various pain models, our research might be a breakthrough in the search for novel, dual-acting compounds that can improve existing pain therapies. Determining whether such ligands are more effective than single-selective drugs will be the subject of our future studies."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091da878c28a04738cf31","uid":"bKX7S6jKc88qGqhxAQ1_plA","uuid":"67982ca1-da20-4e12-a3e0-f6da57be2af2","name":"Katedra Technologii i Biotechnologii Środków Leczniczych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b27","5e709321878c28a0473a343e","5effed397523404d1000eb05","5e709325878c28a0473a3a30","5e709322878c28a0473a368c"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Due to their capacity for self-renewal and differentiation into several cell types, MSCs have been extensively studied in experimental biology and regenerative medicine in recent years. Moreover, MSCs release extracellular vesicles (EVs), which might be partly responsible for their regenerative properties. MSCs regulate several processes in target cells via paracrine signalling, such as immunomodulation, anti-apoptotic signalling, tissue remodelling, angiogenesis and anti-fibrotic signalling. The aim of this review is to provide a detailed description of the functional properties of MSCs and EVs and their potential clinical applications, with a special focus on pain treatment. The analgesic, anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties of MSCs and EVs will be discussed for several diseases, such as neuropathic pain, osteoarthritis and spinal cord injury."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Recently, the role of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit GluN2B has been highlighted in cocaine abstinence followed by extinction training. Since the GluN2B subunit is stabilized at synaptic level by the interaction with its scaffolding protein PSD95, in this study we aimed at investigating efficacy of Tat-NR2B9c peptide, a PSD95 inhibitor, which disrupts the interaction of PSD95 with GluN2B, in the attenuation of cocaine seeking-behavior or cue-induced reinstatement. We found that Tat-NR2B9c, administered intravenously, attenuated the reinstatement of active lever presses induced by a priming dose of cocaine or by drug-associated conditioned stimuli. At the same time, the GluN2B/PSD95 complex levels were decreased in the ventral hippocampus of rats that previously self-administered cocaine injected with Tat-NR2B9c during cocaine- or cue-induced reinstatement. In conclusion, we here provide the first evidence showing that the disruption of the GluN2B/PSD95 complexes during cocaine abstinence followed by extinction training may represent a useful strategy to reduce reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709321878c28a0473a3510"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

The symptoms of depression may subside for several\ndays after the administration of a dose of ketamine. In contrast, achieving a therapeutic effect\nwith classic antidepressants requires chronic administration. The critical issue for ketamine is\nunderstanding the biological basis of its amazing effects. Because one of the main molecular\nmechanisms of ketamine action is the blockade of NMDA-activated glutamate receptors, a great\neffort has been directed at understanding the role of the glutamate system in the pathophysiol-\nogy of depression and the unique antidepressant profile of ketamine.\nThis review discusses the most relevant glutamate hypotheses explaining the molecular and\ncellular mechanisms of ketamine action. In the first place, phenomena such as the disinhibi-\ntion of glutamate release and the inhibition of NMDA receptors stimulated by spontaneously\nreleased glutamate are discussed, followed by the relationship between the antidepressant\neffects of ketamine, glutamate and the functioning of the lateral habenula.

It was unknown whether dystrophic myoblasts-the effector cells of muscle growth and regeneration-are affected. Using transcriptomic, genome-scale metabolic modelling and functional analyses, we demonstrate, for the first time, convergent abnormalities in primary mouse and human dystrophic myoblasts. In Dmdmdx myoblasts lacking full-length dystrophin, the expression of 170 genes was significantly altered. Myod1 and key genes controlled by MyoD (Myog, Mymk, Mymx, epigenetic regulators, ECM interactors, calcium signalling and fibrosis genes) were significantly downregulated. Gene ontology analysis indicated enrichment in genes involved in muscle development and function. Functionally, we found increased myoblast proliferation, reduced chemotaxis and accelerated differentiation, which are all essential for myoregeneration. The defects were caused by the loss of expression of full-length dystrophin, as similar and not exacerbated alterations were observed in dystrophin-null Dmdmdx-βgeo myoblasts. Corresponding abnormalities were identified in human DMD primary myoblasts and a dystrophic mouse muscle cell line, confirming the cross-species and cell-autonomous nature of these defects. The genome-scale metabolic analysis in human DMD myoblasts showed alterations in the rate of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, leukotriene metabolism, and mitochondrial beta-oxidation of various fatty acids. These results reveal the disease continuum: DMD defects in satellite cells, the myoblast dysfunction affecting muscle regeneration, which is insufficient to counteract muscle loss due to myofiber instability. Contrary to the established belief, our data demonstrate that DMD abnormalities occur in myoblasts, making these cells a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of this lethal disease."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

The healing effects of feverfew were known in antiquity. In folk medicine, this plant has been used to treat fever, migraine headaches, as well as rheumatoid arthritis, stomach and toothache, and insect bites. The active compounds contained in the feverfew include sesquiterpene lactones, and the most important of them – is parthenolide, which is considered to be the main ingredient determining the biological activity of extracts from this perennial. Feverfew preparations, containing parthenolide, reduce the production of prostaglandins, inhibit the release of serotonin and histamine, and antagonize the 5-HT2A receptors, thus showing the anti-migraine effects. Moreover, feverfew extract has anti-infl ammatory properties and reduces allergy symptoms by inhibiting the secretion of histamine from mast cells. Currently, studies are being conducted on the use of parthenolide in the treatment of neuropathic pain. This type of chronic pain is caused by damage to the somatosensory nervous system, which is observed in the development of diabetes, stroke, cancer, or after mechanical injuries (e.g. as postoperative complications or after traffic accidents). In in vivo studies parthenolide showed a strong analgesic effect, moreover, its use allowed for the reduction of morphine doses in neuropathic animals. This important clinical implication raises great hopes for designing a multimodal therapy for neuropathic pain. In addition to its anti-infl ammatory and analgesic properties, parthenolide exhibits antitumor activity by inhibiting the NF-κB and STAT transcription factors and inducing the permanent activation of JNK kinase and p53 protein, thereby sensitizing neoplastic cells to radio- and chemotherapy. Interestingly, parthenolide induces apoptosis of cancer cells but has no toxic effects on normal cells. Currently, preparations from the feverfew are used in the phytotherapy of migraine headaches, however, the results of the preclinical research open up new perspectives for the use of this perennial, in particular parthenolide, in modern therapy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

The text was divided into three main parts. The first part describes the BBB as a functional structure, its constitution, cellular and noncellular components, mechanisms of functioning and importance for the central nervous system, in terms of both protection and nourishment. The second part is an overview of parameters important in terms of establishing and maintaining a barrier phenotype that allows for formulating criteria of evaluation of the BBB in vitro models. The third and last part discusses certain techniques for developing the BBB in vitro models. It describes subsequent research approaches and models, as they underwent change alongside technological advancement. On the one hand, we discuss possibilities and limitations of different research approaches: primary cultures vs. cell lines and monocultures vs. multicultures. On the other hand, we review advantages and disadvantages of specific models, such as models-on-a-chip, 3D models or microfluidic models. We not only attempt to state the usefulness of specific models in different kinds of research on the BBB but also emphasize the significance of this area of research for advancement of neuroscience and the pharmaceutical industry."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Apart from the very big biological heterogeneity of dental cells, tooth microenvironments differ a lot in the context of mechanical properties—ranging from 5.5 kPa for dental pulp to around 100 GPa for dentin and enamel. This physical heterogeneity and complexity plays a key role in tooth physiology and in turn, is a great target for a variety of therapeutic approaches. First of all, physical mechanisms are crucial for the pain propagation process from the tooth surface to the nerves inside the dental pulp. On the other hand, the modulation of the physical environment affects the functioning of dental pulp cells and thus is important for regenerative medicine. In the present review, we describe the physiological significance of biomechanical processes in the physiology and pathology of dental pulp. Moreover, we couple those phenomena with recent advances in the fields of bioengineering and pharmacology aiming to control the functioning of dental pulp cells, reduce pain, and enhance the differentiation of dental cells into desired lineages. The reviewed literature shows great progress in the topic of bioengineering of dental pulp—although mainly in vitro. Apart from a few positions, it leaves a gap for necessary filling with studies providing the mechanisms of the mechanical control of dental pulp functioning in vivo."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61172aa99543c757bc08286b","64a6272940e3ff295b952447"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.
