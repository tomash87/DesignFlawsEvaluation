The results reveal a strong increase in NDVI coverage in the Middle East during the study period (R = 0.75, p-value = 0.05). In Egypt, the annual coverage exhibits the strongest positive trend (R = 0.99, p-value = 0.05). In Turkey, both the vegetation coverage and density increased from 2001 to 2019, which can be attributed to the construction of some of the biggest dams in the Middle East, such as the Atatürk and Ilisu dams. Significant increases in the annual coverage and maximum and average NDVI in Saudi Arabia are due to farming in the northern part of the country for which groundwater and desalinated seawater are used. The results of this study suggest that one of the main factors affecting vegetation coverage in the Middle East are governmental policies.

On the one hand, a large amount of C is sequestered in soils, and on the other hand, the forest soils are also a significant source of carbon dioxide (CO2). Soil respiration includes anaerobic and aerobic microbial respiration, and root respiration which may contribute even more that half of the total soil respiration. Assessment of the contribution of forest soils to CO2 emissions, in addition to C sequestration, is worth special attention in the context of increasing climate change. To address this field experiments were carried out to assess the CO2 fluxes of 10 different forest soil types with different tree species (deciduous, coniferous, and mixed) in Poland (using static chamber method). The highest CO2 emissions were observed for a silty soil under the youngest deciduous forest (12 y.) with a  daily average of 1.66 ± 0.7 g CO2 m-2 d-1. The lowest daily mean CO2 flux was associated with a sandy soil in a mature stand of a predominantly coniferous forest (0.87 ± 0.3 g CO2 m-2 d-1). Annual averages were in the range 3.21 t C ha-1 to 6.06 t C ha-1 for a mature and young forest, respectively. The main factor causing differences in CO2 emissions could have been the contribution of both trees and soil properties to hydrological conditions. The young forest was covered with trees with a lower root system forest and the young trees could have a lower demand for water resulting in a higher soil moisture content than in a mature forest soil. Different CO2 fluxes could be also a result of a higher water storage capacity in silty soil in the young forest than that of a sandy soil under mature stand. In addition to water supply, the activity of soil microorganisms is also regulated by C availability which was about 30% lower in sandy soil than in silty soil. The two-yearly measurements showed seasonal variations in CO2 fluxes depending on the soil type, age and tree species. Regardless of the characteristics of the forest being studied, the highest CO2 emissions occurred in the summer or spring and the lowest CO2 emissions were found  in winter as a result of a strong influence of temperature on the biological processes under investigation. The observed seasonality in CO2 emission may be attributed to changes in soil moisture during the measurement periods since soil water content regulates microbial activity and gaseous diffusion. Statistical analyses, however, imply that temperature could have  a stronger control over CO2 emissions from the soils studied than soil moisture."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The study aim was to analyse the effect sorption capacity of bottom sediments on the content of trace elements and the bottom sediment ecotoxicity. The study found higher content of trace elements caused higher potential toxicity of bottom sediments. However, the PCA analysis indicated that ecotoxicity to Heterocypris incongruens was not related to the trace element content in the sediments. It was found that some of the physicochemical properties of bottom sediments determine the behavior of the test organism. The study revealed a strong relationships between the properties of bottom sediments and trace element sorption, which results from significant differences in the carbonate and organic matter contents. The obtained relationships showed a significant role in trace element sorption of negatively dissociating functional groups (carboxyl, phenolic, alcohol, and carbonyl groups) of Cha, Cfa, Cnh and DOC fraction and of clay minerals. Positive correlation between the metal content and the volume of ultramicropores, cryptopores and residual pores suggest that these pore groups contain reactive sites capable of effective element sorption. In contrast, larger pores turned out to be of marginal importance in trace elements sorption, probably participating only in their migration within the bottom sediment structure. An understanding of the above factors will provide comprehensive information on the fate of trace elements in aquatic systems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Coconut by-products, such as residues fromcoconut milk (RCM) and coconut oil (RCO) extraction, are a valuable source of dietaryfiber. In the study, coconutflours obtainedfrom RCM and RCO were used (FCM and FCO, respectively) for supplementation of rolls; white wheatflour was replaced withFCM or FCO at levels of 6, 12, and 18 g per 100 g.RESULTS: The effect of the addition of the coconut by-products on the nutritional value, sensory evaluation, physical proper-ties, and texture of rolls was determined after 24 and 72 h of storage. The research showed a positive effect of FCM and FCOon the roll yield, crumb moisture, and baking loss. The sensory evaluation revealed that the 12% addition of coconut residuesyielded products with high overall acceptability (8 points on a 9-point scale). Compared with the control, a 12% addition of FCOor FCM contributed to an increase in proteins of 7.9% and 3.9% respectively and an increase in dietaryfiber of 76% and 57%respectively. Despite the increase in the fat and protein contents, the energy value of the coconut rolls was significantly lower(244.6 kcal and 245.3 kcal for FCO and FCM respectively) than in the control wheat rolls (266.0 kcal).CONCLUSION: White rolls with coconutflours obtained after grinding residues from oil or coconut milk extraction significantlyincreased the nutritional value of the rolls.© 2021 Society of Chemical Industry."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

HHAIB had pronounced impact on the pectin solubility of okra pods, their structure and rheology. For example, short HHAIB, i.e. 15 and 30 s, resulted in some microcracks on the surface of okra pods, while the longer ones, i.e. 60, 90 and 120 s, resulted in higher stress and teared the outer skin of okra pods. HHAIB for 15 and 30 s prevented extractability of pectins from okra pods and resulted in a decrease in yield. HHAIB for 60 s facilitated pectin extraction providing higher yields, while HHAIB for 90 and 120 s led to the extraction of non-pectin cell wall components as well. Molecules of pectins of okra pods have been characterized by different molecular size, shape, and branching that depended on both solvent used for extraction and the time of HHAIB treatment. Degradation, aggregation and transformation of molecules to more easy soluble fractions was observed during blanching treatment. A pick of consistency index and viscosity was observed for pectins extracted from okra pods subjected to HHAIB treatment for 30–60 s.

One of the factors that strongly influences the magnitude of soil splash is the incline of the surface (slope). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the slope on the course of the splash phenomenon caused by single-drop impact (one drop impact per soil sample), with respect to the mass and proportions of the ejected material, taking into account its division into solid and liquid phases i.e. soil and water. The investigation was carried out using three types of soil with different textures, in moistened (pressure head corresponding to -1.0 kPa) and air-dry (-1500 kPa) conditions. The soil samples were on three angles of slope, being 5°, 15°, and 30°, respectively. After a single-drop impact with a diameter of 4.2 mm, the ejected material was collected using a splash cup. The following quantities of splashed material were measured: the total mass, the mass of the solid phase, and the mass of the liquid phase. Additionally, the distribution and proportions (soil/water) of the splashed material were analysed in both the upslope and downslope directions. It was found that: (i) the change of slope had a variable influence on the measured quantities for different soils; (ii) in the case of moistened samples, the measured values were mainly influenced by the texture, while in the dry samples, by the angle of the slope; (iii) with the increase of slope, the splashed material was mostly ejected in the downslope direction (irrespective of moisture conditions); (iv) in the moistened samples, the ejected material consisted mostly of water, while in the dry samples it was soil—this occurred for material ejected both upslope and downslope. The obtained results are important for improving the physical description of the process of splash erosion. A more thorough understanding and better recognition of the mechanisms governing this phenomenon at all stages could contribute to the development of more effective methods for protecting soil against erosion."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

In this study, saturated water flow was modeled using two different approaches, depending on the existence of the percolating macropore network. The soil material comprised 26 undisturbed soil cores. Soil samples were scanned using an X-ray micro-CT scanner, and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), bulk density and particle size distribution were measured. The voxel size for X-ray CT scans of soil cores was 23.6 µm, which allowed soil macropore network discrimination. The macropore network was percolating in 11 samples, while the remaining cores were not. A typical approach based on Navier–Stokes (NS) equations was used for saturated water flow modeling in the case of a percolating samples. In the case of cores with a non-percolating macropore network, the NS modeling approach could not be used. An alternative method of modeling (NS/Darcy) was used in this case, blending: regular NS flow in the well-defined macropores with the Darcy–Forchheimer flow in the remaining part – the soil matrix. Soil matrix is treated by the NS/Darcy model as a pore medium without well-defined pore geometry but with some intrinsic permeability incorporated in the model using the Darcy–Forchheimer equation. Unlike the NS approach, the NS/Darcy model allowed for the simulation of water flow for all soil samples, including those where the macropore network was not percolating. Based on simulations, the Ksat was estimated used for model validation. The analysis of results leads to the proposal of a new hybrid modeling approach, mixing the NS and NS/Darcy modeling approaches. A good estimation of the Ksat was obtained using the proposed model (R2 = 0.61). The NS/Darcy modeling approach was used for the analysis of the macropore flow in the soil media. The simulations show that water permeates through the core, but macropores are a favorable flow path if they exist, even if they are not directly connected to each other. The areas of the soil cores taking part in the preferential, macropore flow were quantified, showing that only a small fraction of the macropores take part in water flow both for percolating and non-percolating cores. But generally, for most of the analyzed flow-related indices, apparent differences in results between percolating and non-percolating samples were observed. Effective flow area (EFA), i.e., the sample area used for water flow with a velocity higher than the threshold velocity (Utr) was analyzed. Considering the macropore flow, only ∼2% of sample volume is responsible for: 82% of the total flux in case of percolated and 34% in case of non-percolated samples. Also, for non-percolated samples, the dependence (R2 = 0.44) between relative flux participation and the effective flow area is observed. The simulation results for the non-percolating samples revealed the relationship between the simulated saturated conductivity of the whole soil sample and the saturated conductivity of the soil matrix and macroporosity. This allowed for developing a simple multiple linear regression model (R2 = 0.98) of the soil core’s hydraulic conductivity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Despite the low impact of air RH on leaf conductance in plants grown in dry soil, a significant decline in transpiration with an increase in air RH occurred. The increase in air RH induced significant increase in leaf temperature in well-watered plants. Changes in leaf vapor pressure deficit (LVPD) differently affected stomatal conductance (gH2O) in plants grown in soil with optimum and limited water availability.\n\nTemporal changes in air humidity and temperature differently affected barley grown under optimum and limited water availability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

However, the EC of the wetting fluid exhibited more complex trends. In the 2-D micromodel, the number of loops decreased monotonously, reached zero, and remained constant for lower saturations, while the number of distinct components fluctuated because of the appearance and disappearance of disconnected clusters. In the 2-D model, the number of distinct components played a significant role; in the 3-D X-ray CT experiment, the number of loops of pendular rings dominated the EC.

In order to improve soil quality, we investigated the impact of phosphorus biofertilizer on the microbiological parameters of soil (type Brunic Arenosol) degraded as a result of inappropriate cultivation and fertilization, characterized by low pH and decrease in K and Mg content. Two-year field experiment included control treatment (FC) without microbial enrichment and FA100 and FA60 treatments containing beneficial microorganisms. The results showed that the biofertilizer enhanced soil enzymatic activity (as expressed by the increased activities of urease, protease, acid phosphomonoesterase and β-glucosidase), increased number of operational taxonomic units associated with metabolic processes (including phosphorus related pathways and degradation of xenobiotics), improved crop yield, increased bacterial diversity and changed the quantity of phytoavailable phosphorus in the soil. Biofertilizer also stimulated the occurrence of plant growth promoting microorganisms involved in phosphorus biotransformations, decomposition of organic matter, nitrogen fixation and protection plants against pathogens. NGS and BiologTM analyses showed that the composition of soil microbiome was affected also by soil sampling time, suggesting seasonal variations in the preferred carbon sources and level of C-substrates utilization and pointing the differences in the relative abundance of individual microbial groups at particular stages of the experiment. Taking into consideration the improvement of microbiological indicators of soil health, phosphorus biofertilizer seems to be effective approach to implement in sustainable agriculture linking soil microbiome quality with the general soil condition."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The aim of the study was to check whether the different textures of sand beds affect the size and dynamics of the formation of craters and ejection curtain after high-velocity impacts. The experiments were conducted using an aluminium impactor at two impact speeds (~700 and ~1300 m�s-1) and a sand bed composed of either a broad range of sizes (<2.0 mm) or any of the three fractions obtained from it (<0.5, 0.5–1, 1–2 mm). The diameters, depths, wall slope, and rim heights of the resulting craters were measured. The ejecta curtain was characterized by the inclination angle of walls, base diameter, and expansion velocity. The mass of the transferred material and the depth of the impactor penetration were also determined. Additionally, the results were used to calculate dimensionless parameters commonly considered in crater studies (πV, π2 and α). The texture of the sand most clearly influenced the diameters of the craters, its effect could also be seen in the case of the distance covered by the ejected material. This information appears to be relevant for future research, providing some rationale to help assess in which aspects of the phenomenon the texture may be important."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e178","uid":"bNsOc8LWMO-rYhuDMGKqClg","uuid":"b276c277-c4c6-4376-befd-8461236490bd","name":"Wydział Mechatroniki, Uzbrojenia i Lotnictwa","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a4878c28a047399c6b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Hop stems contain up to 29% of cellulose. The cellulose isolation was conducted through the thermochemical treatment. After high-speed blending, the cellulose was characterized by 67% of crystallinity degree obtained from X-ray diffraction and median diameter of 6.7 nm obtained from atomic force microscopy imaging. The high-intensity ultrasonication (HIUS) was applied to reach further disintegration of cellulose fibers. The longer HIUS treatment resulted in decrease in crystallinity degree even up to 60% and decrease in the fiber diameter up to 4 nm. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra showed that HIUS treatment led to changes in intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The stability of cellulose dispersions versus length of HIUS treatment was monitored over 14 days with back dynamic light scattering and laser Doppler electrophoresis methods. Obtained results are evidence that the hop stems are a potential source of cellulose and that it is possible to obtain stable dispersions after HIUS treatment. This was the first time that the properties of hop cellulose have been described so extensively and in detail after the use of HIUS treatment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","uid":"boRt8XbJIJxFX3j3lPkVVng","uuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","name":"Instytut Uprawy Nawożenia i Gleboznawstwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709298878c28a047398b45"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","parentUuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","rootUuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Until now, tracing the origin of splash water was a highly error-prone, or impossible, task. We propose a method for tracking splash water by means of stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) analysis. We tested the method on a water-water model, checking the effect of drop height, water layer thickness and the effect of water evaporation. It turns out that the drop height and the thickness of the water layer have practically no effect on the origin of the water in the splash, and all the water comes from the vessel, not from the drops. The only exception is when a thin layer of water is impacted with a drop, in which case 23% of the water also comes from the drop.

Within the SoilCare project, the concept of soil-improving cropping systems (SICS) was developed as a holistic approach to facilitate the adoption of soil management that is sustainable and profitable. SICS selected with stakeholders were monitored and evaluated for environmental, sociocultural, and economic effects to determine profitability and sustainability. Monitoring results were upscaled to European level using modelling and Europe-wide data, and a mapping tool was developed to assist in selection of appropriate SICS across Europe. Furthermore, biophysical, sociocultural, economic, and policy reasons for (non)adoption were studied. Results at the plot/farm scale showed a small positive impact of SICS on environment and soil, no effect on sustainability, and small negative impacts on economic and sociocultural dimensions. Modelling showed that different SICS had different impacts across Europe—indicating the importance of understanding local dynamics in Europe-wide assessments. Work on adoption of SICS confirmed the role economic considerations play in the uptake of SICS, but also highlighted social factors such as trust. The project’s results underlined the need for policies that support and enable a transition to more sustainable agricultural practices in a coherent way."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Due to their negative impact on organisms and biodiversity, it is necessary to limit their mobility. Carbonaceous materials and bacterial exopolysaccharides can be a solution. Therefore, we examined the impact of sunflower husk biochar and Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii exopolysaccharide (EPS) on kaolinite adsorption capacity towards tetracycline (TC) and cadmium (Cd).\nMaterials and methods\n\nThe experiments were performed on kaolinite—natural element of soil sorption complex, biochar—product of sunflower husks pyrolysis (650 °C), and their simple composite prepared by wet mixing. The solids were characterized by various methods—nitrogen adsorption/desorption, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, potentiometric titration, and scanning electron microscopy. The adsorbed concentrations of TC and Cd on selected solids were examined as a function of pH and EPS presence. TC concentration was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography, whilst that of Cd by ion selective electrodes.\nResults and discussion\n\nAmong all tested solids, biochar was characterized by the highest heterogeneity and highest adsorption capacity relative to Cd and TC. It adsorbed 63.4% of Cd ions (at pH 8) and 30.4% of TC (at pH 5). The biochar addition to kaolinite improved its adsorption capacity, but maximally by 5.5%. This was dictated by poor textural parameters of the selected biochar. The pH value was not a factor strongly affecting the efficiency of biochar addition to kaolinite—the difference between pH 5 and pH 8 was only 1%. EPS enhanced accumulation of Cd and TC, but this trend was clear only for the selected adsorbents. For Cd adsorption, the highest increase was noted for B (by 13.8%), whereas for TC adsorption for K (by 7.5%). The simultaneous addition of biochar and exopolysaccharide contributed to increase in Cd adsorption on kaolinite by 7%, whilst TC adsorption by 10.5%.\nConclusions\n\nSimultaneous application of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii exopolysaccharide and sunflower husk biochar increased adsorption capacity of kaolinite. Together with these substances, additional functional groups were introduced into the system. However, it must be emphasized that, due to low porosity and specific surface area of the selected biochar, the final improvement of kaolinite adsorptive ability was not satisfying. In the future, biochars of better textural parameters should be applied in such procedures. Their application together with EPS should reduce the bioavailability of hazardous substances more effectively."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The aim of this study was to\nexamine the spatial relationship between cereal (wheat and oats ) yields and soil properties\nrelated to the application of soil-improving cropping systems (SICS). Four-year experiment\n(2017-2020) was carried out on low productive sandy soil with application of following SICS: S1 –\ncontrol; S2 – liming; S3 – green manure/cover crops including lupine, phacelia, serradella; S4 –\nmanure and S5 – manure, liming and cover crops together. Effect of the SICS was evaluated using\nclassical statistics, Bland-Altman analysis and geostatistical methods. Mathematical functions,\nfitted to the experimental cross- and semivariograms were used for mapping the yields (grain and\nstraw) by ordinary cokriging. The grain yields in years with normal rainfall increased by 2% for S2,\n10% for S3, 46% for S4, 47% for S5 compared to control (S1) 2789 kg/ha and in dry years were\nlower (respectively for S2-S5 by 16.3, 10.6, 2.8, 9.9% compared to control 1567 kg/ha. The range of\nspatial dependence for the yields in direct semi-variograms varied was 50–100 m and > 100 m in\ncross-semivariograms using textural fractions as secondary variables. The spatial relationships\nwere stronger between yield and soil texture and properties were much stronger with texture and\ncation exchange capacity than with pH and organic carbon content. Using cokriging for\ninterpolation (mapping) allowed the delineation of zones of lower and higher cereal yields\nincluding areas of the SICS application. Higher cereal yield and lower spatial variability in the areas\nof SICS compared to control soil were observed in the years with normal rainfall. Analysis of the\nBland-Altman including limits of agreement enabled to quantify the effect of particular SICS on\ncereal yield vs. control reference. Different effect of particular SICS on the cereal yield was\nobserved in the years with scarce and good rainfall amount and distribution during growing\nseason. The greatest variation of the cereal yield was observed in manure amended soil (S4) and it\nwas lower and similar in the areas of remaining SICS (S2-S5). The results will help to to select most\neffective SICS for localized improving crop productivity and adaptation to global warming."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

on the water retention in arable sandy soil amended with fine size-fractionated sunflower husk biochar","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Biochar application has been reported for improving the physical, chemical, and hydrological\nproperties of soil. However, biochar can be produced from different feedstocks and at different\nconditions having a direct impact on its properties. Furthermore, the overall effect of\nimprovement depends on the type of soil. That makes biochar amendment difficult to optimize\nand creates the need for extensive studies of this issue for its better understanding. In these\nstudies, we show that water holding capacity (by means of Available Water Content - AWC) can be\nsignificantly improved in arable sandy soil using fine-sized biochar particles.\nFor our studies, we have used sunflower husk biochar (pyrolyzed at 650oC). Biochar samples were\ncharacterized using an elemental analyzer for C, H, N content studies, mercury porosimeter for\nporosity and specific pore volumes, and vibratory shaker with a stack of sieves for particle size\ndistribution. The examined biochar was sieved in order to obtain four diameter size fractions: <50\nμm, 50–100 μm, 100–250 μm and <2000 μm and mixed with arable sandy soil for 0.95, 2.24, 4.76\nand 9.52 wt.%. The unamended soil sample served as a reference. At first, we have measured the\nbulk density of the air-dried samples. After then the pressure plate method was used to determine\nthe water retention curves. The results were fitted using the van Genuchten equation. Finally, the\nAWC for all the measured samples was calculated from a difference between soil water contents\nfor pF=2.2 and pF=4.2.\nThe bulk density studies have shown a nonlinear behavior as a function of dose for all fractions of\nthe biochar. The clearest effect is observed for fractions below 100 μm for which the density vs\ndose characteristics of the samples revealed a maximum for 0.95 wt.% and a decreasing trend for\nhigher biochar contents. The AWC studies shown that the particle size fractions of biochar below\n100 μm in diameter cause also the most significant improvement in the water retention, almost\ndoubling the reference level (0.078 m3 m-3) to approximately 0.155 m3 m-3 after biochar\namendment. The results are explained by the filling of the free volume in the sandy soil matrix by\nsmall biochar particles. That leads to a shift of the pore size distribution to smaller radiuses, which\nin consequence promotes an increase in AWC."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Increasingly, this characteristic is determined using the laser diffraction method (LDM). Theoretical assumptions of LDM are, i.a. the spherical shape of the measured particles and their random orientation. These criteria are often not met. 3D prints were used to test the impact of shape on LDM PSD and to monitor particle flow with high-speed camera. It can be noticed that when the shape of the examined particles differs from a spherical shape, PSDs obtained with the use of LDM are burdened with an error that is difficult to estimate. Moreover, the more the aspect ratio value deviates from unity, the more the distribution shifts towards larger particles. It was noticed that in the case of cylinders there were no particle rotations in about 70% of cases. A lack of rotation was also observed for hemispheres—in about 16% of cases.

The aim of the study was to identify changes in the secondary and tertiary structure of gluten network induced by selected hydroxycinnamic and hydroxybenzoic acids with using FT-Raman spectroscopy. Phenolic acids were added to the model dough in concentrations of 0.05%, 0.1%, and 0.2% (w/w). Model flour consist of commercially available wheat starch and wheat gluten in proportions 80:15 (w/w). All phenolic acids caused similar alterations in the secondary structure of gluten proteins in terms of the creation of aggregated structures from α-helices, β-turns and hydrogen-bonded β-turns, although hydroxybenzoic acids induce more structural changes like pseudo-β-sheets. Furthermore, dough treatment with hydroxycinnamic derivatives results in faster dough breakdown than hydroxybenzoic acids. These results indicate that hydroxycinnamic acids have stronger interactions with gluten network in comparison to hydroxybenzoic acids. Further analysis showed that tryptophan residues were more buried in samples with phenolic acids containing methoxy groups. The interactions between phenolic acids and gluten proteins are complex, and they have been affected by the functional groups attached to the benzene ring as well as the concentration of phenolic acid and its size. Moreover, phenolic acids may primarily interact with glutenins."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

A numerical 3D multiphase transport model was applied to a splash that occurred under the impact of a petrol drop on the water surface. The splash phenomenon in immiscible liquids was simulated using the multiphaseInterFoam solver, i.e., a part of the OpenFOAM computational fluid dynamics software implementing the finite volume method (FVM) for space discretization. Thirteen variants with a variable drop size (3.00–3.60 mm) or drop velocity (3.29–3.44 m/s) were conducted and validated experimentally based on splash images taken by a high-speed camera (2800 fps). Based on the numerical simulation, it was possible to analyse aspects that were difficult or impossible to achieve experimentally due to the limitations of the image analysis method. The aspects included the cavity spread, the jet forming moment, and, notably, the scale of the petroleum contamination spread in the splash effect. The simulations showed that droplets detaching from the crown did not consist of pure water but were mostly a “mixture” of water and petrol or petrol alone. The applied modelling workflow is an efficient way to simulate three-phase splash phenomena."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

A laboratory experiment with Arabidopsis thaliana wild type (WT) and mutants npq1 and npq4 grown under optimum or reduced water availability was conducted. Dark-adapted plants were illuminated with fluctuating light (FL) of two intensities (55 and 530 μmol m−2 s−1) with each of the phases lasting for 20 s. The impact of water availability on the role of zeaxanthin and PsbS protein in NPQ induced at FL was analysed. The water deficit affected the dynamics of NPQ induced by FL. The lack of zeaxanthin or PsbS reduced plant capability to cope with FL. The synergy of both of these components was enhanced in regard to the amplitude of NPQ in the drought conditions.

Low temperature and active particles during CP processing play a significant role in limiting nutrient loss in food and modifying biomacromolecules. So far, numerous works have been carried out on the use of CP in food processing. However, the effectiveness of the CP pre-extraction treatment on the structural morphology and rheological properties of pectin fractions extracted from okra pods is not described yet. Therefore, the study aimed to evaluate the effect of CP on the changes in structural morphology and rheological properties of water-soluble pectin (WSP), chelator-soluble pectin (CSP), and diluted alkali-soluble pectin (DASP) fractions extracted from okra pods. The yield of extraction depended on the type of solvent and the duration of CP treatment. The short CP treatment (5 s) caused the suspension of extraction, while longer treatments (15 and 30 s) contributed to the formation of microcracks on the surface of okra that favored efficient extraction yields. Pectins extracted from okra belonged to the group of the low methylated ones. The degree of methylation was <50%, and it depended on the solvent type but not on the treatment. WSP fraction was characterized by the highest viscosity, and it was followed by the viscosities of DASP and CSP. CP treatment caused a slight change in the nature of fluid from dilatant towards Newtonian (CSP and DASP) or pseudoplastic behavior (WSP). The acquired knowledge may be useful for better understanding and optimization of technologies based on the CP treatment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra of water-soluble pectin (WSP), chelator-soluble pectin (CSP), and diluted alkali-soluble pectin (DASP) fractions isolated from okra pods subjected to different CP treatment times were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) and the results highlighted significant differences among different pectin fractions. The CP treatment caused a decrease in the contents of lycopene and chlorophyll alpha. However, the CP treatment with 30 s (CP30) resulted in a slight increase (4%) in the content of chlorophyll beta and led to the smallest color change of okra pods. The CP5, CP15, and CP30 slightly decreased the total phenolics (TP) content of okra pods by 5, 13, and 20%, respectively. The total flavonoids (TF) content of okra pods was not significantly affected by the CP. The short CP treatment, i.e. CP5, was found to be beneficial to the antioxidant potential of okra pods determined by the FRAP, DPPH, and ABTS assays. The antioxidant potentials of CP-treated okra pods determined by the FRAP, DPPH, and ABTS assays were positively correlated with TP contents (r = 0.53, r = 0.97, and r = 0.82, respectively) and TF contents (r = 0.92, r = 0.76, and r = 0.87, respectively).

They were analysed distance of each horse to the central point of the pasture and to the exit from the enclosure, and time and/or frequencies of elements of behaviour categorised as: increased anxiety (walking, trotting and cantering), vigilance (snoring, vocalisation, high head position, high tail position, sticking together), foraging (time of grazing), comfort (playing, examining the surroundings, sniffing), maintenance of hygiene (rubbing against objects, auto- or allogrooming, rolling) and resting. The obtained data were analysed by the Dwass, Steel and Critchlow-Fligner method using the SAS program.\r\nResults: Most of analysed elements increased in response to reproduced sounds and decreased after sounds were stop playing (p < 0.05), however, they were no significant differences in general response to each studied sound.\r\nConclusions: The responses of horses to similar sounds of both known and unknown origins, i.e. the sound of a thunderstorm, sea storm and volcanic eruption, are similar. The sound stimuli applied were not too stressful for the\r\nhorses."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Here, the structure and functional profiles of the endophytic bacterial community, associated with Paulownia elongata × fortunei, in correlation with seasonality, were evaluated using Biolog EcoPlates. Biolog EcoPlates was used to analyse the functional diversity of the microbiome. The total communities of leaf endophyte communities were investigated using 16S rRNA V5–V7 region amplicon deep sequencing via Illumina MiSeq. Community level physiological profiling (CLPP) analysis by the Biolog EcoPlate™ assay revealed that the carboxylic acids (19.67–36.18%) and amino acids (23.95–35.66%) were preferred by all by all communities, whereas amines and amides (0.38–9.46%) were least used. Seasonal differences in substrate use were also found. Based on the sequencing data, mainly phyla Proteobacteria (18.4–97.1%) and Actinobacteria (2.29–78.7%) were identified. A core microbiome could be found in leaf-associated endophytic communities in trees growing in different locations. This work demonstrates the application of Biolog EcoPlates in studies of the functional diversity of microbial communities in a niche other than soil and shows how it can be applied to the functional analyses of endomicrobiomes. This research can contribute to the popularisation of Biolog EcoPlates for the functional analysis of the endomicrobiome. This study confirms that the analysis of the structure and function of the plant endophytic microbiome plays a key role in the health control and the development of management strategies on bioenergy tree plantations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","uid":"boRt8XbJIJxFX3j3lPkVVng","uuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","name":"Instytut Uprawy Nawożenia i Gleboznawstwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a65ee","5e709347878c28a0473a6636","5e70929f878c28a04739964b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","parentUuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","rootUuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The multi-million-dollar EM sensor market continues to expand and yet lacks test standards and is generally lacking in information about sensor quality and performance. Decades of past sensor assessments have presented mixed testing approaches and a commensurate measure of mixed results. Confusion regarding EM sensor-function, -failure rate and -value, stems from testing results that often use non-standard targets including inhomogeneous (variable density and water content) and complex materials (e.g., soils) that may not be widely available for subsequent testing and verification by others. Electromagnetic sensors employ time- or frequency-domain measurements to estimate real (and sometimes including imaginary) permittivity and electrical conductivity, with different sensors measuring at varied and often unknown frequencies. Sensor output is affected by environmental impacts on circuitry (temperature) combined with effects of porous medium temperature, electrical conductivity, interfacial polarization and dielectric relaxation, all of which often combine to alter the apparent permittivity and resulting water content. Although a few attempts have been made to standardize testing, more work and research is required before an international standard can be recognized and adopted. Here we point to standardizing 1) granular porous test media, 2) media packing approaches and 3) permittivity-water content calibration functions with examples and comparison of different EM sensors."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The amounts of capsaicin in two types of sweet and hot peppers were predicted well and with high accuracy by three different methods: MLR, PCR, and PLSR. With this method, it is possible to reliably separate sweet and hot peppers based on odor parameters, and it is also possible to develop sorting machines according to the characteristics of odor."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Thus far, less attention has been given to assessing microbiological indicators of soil quality in bioenergy crops on abandoned land. The current study assessed microbial and biochemical properties of two soils with different textures in agroforestry plantations of Paulownia elongata × Paulownia fortunei, with regard to the analysis of potential for the reclamation and redevelopment of abandoned lands. The soil samples were characterised by measuring microbial biomass C and N, key enzyme activities, and determining the community-level physiological profiles (CLPP) using Biolog EcoPlates. Soil texture, sampling time (June and October), and distance of sampling (0.1 m and 1 m from a tree) had significant effects on microbiological properties. Moreover, dehydrogenases and acid phosphatase activities as well as microbial biomass C and N decreased with distance from the trees, and were significantly higher in the October than in the June. The community-level physiological profiles (CLPP) and diversity indices showed a similar trend to other parameters of biological activity. The results showed that there were significant differences in the AWCD (average well-colour development) of all carbon sources among the Paulownia microbial communities (p < 0.05). In summary, already after one year of tree planting, a statistically significant increase in microbial activity was found, regardless of soil texture, when evaluated by various methods. This proves the value of the Paulownia as fast-growing plant for recultivation and improvement of soil quality on abandoned land."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

However, the relations between soil complex dielectric permittivity and volumetric water content depend also on other factors, such as the operating frequency of the sensor, soil texture, and temperature. The goal of the presented work is to examine the impact of temperature in the 0.5 – 40°C range on the complex dielectric permittivity spectrum of two soils of silt loam and loamy sand textures. The permittivity spectra were measured in a coaxial transmission-line cell system with the use of a Copper Mountain R60 one-port vector-network-analyzer in the frequency range from 20 MHz to 3 GHz. The relations between the real part of dielectric permittivity and soil volumetric water content were modeled at each examined frequency and the temperature dependence of the applied model parameters was determined. In the future research steps, the obtained relations will be applied and tested with the use of a prototype field soil moisture probe operating in a broadband frequency range.\n\n \n\nThe research has been supported by the Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange under Grant No. PPI/APM/2018/1/00048/U/001.

The concept of this method is based on a core drill that will be equipped with a multi-probe sensor working at  radio and  microwave frequencies. The objective of the presented research focuses on the study of the multi-probe sensor that was carried out on sandy soils and clay.\n\nThis solution is based on reflection and transmission measurements using several probes arranged on the circumference of a metal tube. The use of various probes allows us on one hand to detect thresholds of the water in soil and on the other hand to diagnose the homogeneity of the material under test. This sensor is incorporated in a test bench composed of a VNA and a Switch Matrix that allows the VNA to connect with the 6 probes of the sensor. The measurements are the reflection of each probe and the transmission between two identified probes in a band of frequencies between 100MHz and 12GHz.\n\nThe first series of measurements with the multiprobe sensor was carried out on sand containing 0 to 20% water with increments of 5%. From the reflection coefficient values of each probe and the transmissions between two respective probes, we were able to verify the variation related to the increase of the water content in the sand. This determination of the water content is made from the modulus of the reflection coefficient and the different cases of transmissions between two probes.\n\nIn conclusion, a new concept of a multi-probe sensor, for the determination of a soil moisture profile in the relatively loose and homogeneous sandy and clayey soil has been developed and tested. Thus, we were able to evaluate thresholds of water content in the sand of around 5% with this sensor. In order to continue the study of the sensor, we now plan to test more complex soils, but especially to extrapolate this multi-probe sensor to a system using a core drill to increase the depth of testing. This is a solution to characterize soils without sampling them. Especially, it is hoped that with the developed sensor a soil profile can be measured down to several meters in depth."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The sequential action of the pectinolytic enzymes had a direct effect on the molecular structure of pectin fractions.

The study area included\n9 sites in the eastern part of Poland. Agro-meteorological stations in each site allowed monitoring\nsoil moisture (SM). Satellite SM data (time series) for the years 2010–2016 (every week) obtained\nfrom the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite (SMOS L2 v. 650 datasets) were gridded using\nthe discrete global grid (DGG) with the nodes spaced at 15 km. Seven DGG pixels per each site\nwere considered in a way that the central one (named S0) containing the agrometeorological\nstation was bordered with 6 others (S1÷S6). The measurements of SM were performed at depths\nof 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 0.8 m once a day in April-July in plots of spring barley, rye and\nbare soil. The temporal dependence of the SMOS surface soil moisture was observed in S0÷S6\nwith the radius of autocorrelation time from 8.1 to 25.2 weeks. The smallest autocorrelation time\n(3 weeks ) was found in pixels with dominance of arable lands and the largest one - with\ndominance of wetlands (16.8 weeks) and forests (from 12 to 15.6 weeks). The autocorrelation\ntimes in S0 were much greater for ground-based SM data (11.1 to 43.1 weeks) than those for\nSMOS SM data. The autocorrelations enabled satisfactory predicting changes in SM forwards and\nbackwards using the kriging method and filling gaps in the SM time series. As to ground\nmeasurements the highest autocorrelation times were in the soil below the plough layer under rye\n(170 days) and the lowest in the surface soil under barley and bare soil (18 and 19 days). In the\nplot of rye with the highest soil density the autocorrelation radius was over 1.5 months. The fractal\ndimensions (D0) indicated a large randomness of the surface SMOS SM distribution (D0 1.86–1.95)\nand the ground SM measurements (D0 1.82–1.92). The D0 values clearly decreased with the depth\n(from 1.7 to 1.15) in plant-covered soil while in the bare soil they did not change much throughout\nthe profile (D0 1.7–1.8). The D0 values indicated that the temporal distribution of SM in the soil\nprofile was more random in bare than plant-covered soil. The results help to understanding\nautocorrelation time ranges in surface and deeper soil and spatial changes in soil moisture\ndepending on plant cover."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

In this study, a new, simple, accurate, and fast detection method was proposed based on the odor fingerprint obtained by measuring the volatile odors of edible vegetable oils with an electronic nose. The odor fingerprints were obtained for 8 different levels of sunflower and canola oil added to sesame oil, and the samples were analyzed simultaneously by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The chemometric methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Liner Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were used to analyze the signals from the electronic nose.According to results, low level fraud (25% sunflower oil to 75% sesame oil), which is difficult to detect using the GC-MS method, was detected with very high accuracy via the electronic nose. This indicates that the current approach has the potential to detect and quantify edible oil fraud to improve efficiency and monitoring and to ensure the safety of consumption of edible vegetable oils."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

All calculations to date have only been taking into account the ejection of solid phase material and were based on significant simplifications of the measured quantities. Therefore, the aim of the study was an improved calculation of the falling drop energy transferred to the ejected material, while considering that such material was a mixture of solid soil particles and water droplets and therefore, “two-phase”. Experimental variants included combinations of soils with different textures and initial moisture contents as well as various falling water-drop energies. Two complementary methods of i) splash cup measurements and ii) image analysis based on high-speed cameras were used for the calculation of quantities i.e. the number of ejected particles, their mass, and their ejection velocity. Based on the obtained results, it was stated that the kinetic energy of ejected particles, expressed as a percentage of falling drop energy, ranged from 1 % to 14 %. This percentage depended strongly on soil texture as well as initial moisture content. The highest values were obtained for soil with the largest amount of sand fraction and the lowest for the soil with the largest amount of finer fractions.

This paper focuses on developing and testing some techniques designed to identify automatically such microorganisms. More specifically, the recognition performed here deals with the specific five genera of soil bacteria. Their microscopic images are classified with machine learning methods using shape and image texture descriptors. Feature determination based on shape relies on interpolation and curvature estimation whereas feature recognition based on image texture resorts to the spatial relationships between chrominance and luminance of pixels using co-occurrence matrices. From the variety of modelling methods applied here the best reported result amounts to 97% of accuracy.

However, cheaper and more available alternative protein sources are being sought, and feed manufacturers more and more often turn their attention to the post-extraction meals of local oil plants, e.g., rapeseed. Therefore, the effect of fermented and non-fermented post-extraction rapeseed meal used as a feed additive for Japanese quails was investigated on the eggs’ quality. The study was performed on 280 females of Japanese quails fed with a mixture without rapeseed meal, with non-fermented post-extraction rapeseed meal (5%, 10% and 15%) and with fermented one (5%, 10% and 15%). During the experiment, eggs were collected from each group four times (every 4 weeks) and evaluated for their quality characteristics. The addition of 10% fermented rapeseed meal had the most beneficial effect on such eggs quality traits as egg weight, specific gravity, yolk index and color and albumen pH. However, in the majority of examined parameters, no significant differences were found between birds fed with soybean meal and those fed with fermented and non-fermented rapeseed meal (morphological elements proportions, yolk weight, albumen height and Haugh’s units, eggshell quality). This supports the thesis that the use of rapeseed meals instead of soybean meals may allow obtaining the proper quality of animal raw materials at a lower cost and with the use of local feed resources."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091be878c28a0473873e6","uid":"bjr0Fzhi6lCIBPIlgtZV-yQ","uuid":"4611b28a-6260-47b7-9d4e-91a956560cf1","name":"Instytut Biologicznych Podstaw Produkcji Zwierzęcej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709224878c28a0473908bf","6160fea975234017e050de24","5ebed79d752340254fc40c1a","5e709224878c28a047390944","5e709463878c28a0473bc0f7","62fdff824097076f7156acfd"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e7091be878c28a0473873ea","uid":"bYQKxifulEuEJLcUdbBIzPA","uuid":"61768707-7dd1-4777-87bb-ee42bb9201f9","name":"Katedra Biochemii i Toksykologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709225878c28a047390ac6"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Therefore, this research is aimed at the treatment of sunflower husk biochar (BC) by vitamin C, hydrogen peroxide or silver nanoparticles and the impact of this procedure on the biochar porosity, surface chemistry, and ability to remove tetracycline (TC). During the study, BC was produced by pyrolysis of sunflower husks at 650 °C. All solids were characterized using potentiometric titration, nitrogen adsorption/desorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, etc. The experimental adsorption data was described by kinetics equations: pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, and particle internal diffusion (IPD) models as well as by isotherms of Langmuir, Langmuir-Freundlich, and Redlich-Peterson. The obtained results indicated that the biochar upgraded by vitamin C (BCV) had the highest ability to attract antibiotic molecules and, as a result, the TC adsorption on its surface was the largest. Furthermore, the TC desorption from this material was minimal. The measured TC adsorbed amounts for the modified BCs were as follows: 47.75% (7.47 mg/g) for BCV, 37.35% (8.41 mg/g)-for biochar treated by hydrogen peroxide (BCH), and 42.04% (9.55 mg/g) for biochar modified by silver nanoparticles (BCA). The lowest adsorption level was noted for non-modified biochar, i.e., 34.17% (6.83 mg/g). Based on the presented results it can be stated that the upgraded biochars had a good potential to improve the tetracycline removal from aqueous media, e.g., groundwater."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

A profile probe can be a tool that can help in the analysis of topsoil moisture. However, in order to analyse phenomena at different scales, it is necessary to integrate many probes in one system.\n\nThe aim of this work was to develop a solution to collect soil moisture and temperature data and visualise them in a user-friendly way. The use of cloud technologies and the Internet of Things IoT provided easy integration to enable further scaling of similar solutions. The developed solution based on TDR probes and the PTDT profile probe allowed the collection of data for analysis for over a year. Tests indicate that the system can be used to study water transport (dynamic moisture changes) associated with precipitation, evaporation or capillary rise.

To gain a “clearer” picture, the water stability and wettability of artificial aggregates composed of soil silt and various proportions of pure minerals: kaolinite, montmorillonite, illite, zeolite and goethite, were examined. The wettability was attributed to contact angles measured goniometrically and to the water drop penetration time (WDPT). The water stability was measured by monitoring of air bubbling after aggregate immersion in water and the shrinking sphere model was used to analyse aggregates’ destruction kinetics. The rate of aggregate destruction in water increased with increasing mineral content and it slightly decreased for aggregates composed of all pure minerals except goethite. An apparent hydrophobicity period (a period where the bubbling stopped for some time), resulted most probably from the wavy shape of pores, was observed mainly for aggregates with low mineral proportions. Among all studied minerals, kaolinite increased the water contact angle and water repellency to the greatest extent. With increasing the mineral content in the aggregates up to 8%, contact angles decreased and then increased. Contact angles did not correlate with aggregates’ stability. Aggregates more rapidly penetrated by water (shorter WDPT) were destroyed faster. Water stability of aggregates containing all minerals except illite appeared to be higher for the more mechanically resistant aggregates."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The effects of phenolics produced by a noxious invader, Reynoutria japonica, on soil microorganisms have rarely been studied in experimental conditions. We performed a laboratory experiment to assess the influence of extracts from R. japonica on soil microbial activity, biomass, and community structure. Two types of extracts (shoots and rhizomes) were added in four concentrations (control—no extract, low—extract diluted 100 times, medium—extract diluted ten times, and high—undiluted extract) to soil collected under native plant species. Concentrations of 12 phenolic compounds, namely catechin, chlorogenic acid, emodin, epicatechin, hyperoside, quercetin, physcion, piceatannol, polydatin, procyanidin B3, resveratrol, and resveratroloside were analyzed in the extract and soil. We measured the activity of five enzymes, namely acid and alkaline phosphatases, β-glucosidase, phenoloxidase, peroxidase, the activity of bacteria on Biolog Ecoplates, as well as the biomass of bacteria, saprotrophic fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and microbial community structure using phospholipid (PLFA) and neutral (NLFA) fatty acid analysis. Many microbial parameters, namely phosphatase activities, total microbial, AMF, and G + bacterial biomass, were reduced following the addition of extracts. This was likely related to phenolics as concentrations of these compounds in soil increased with the concentration of extract added. In contrast, saprotrophic fungi and G- bacteria were largely positively affected by extract addition. Shoot and rhizome extracts had relatively similar effects on the soil properties. The changes in soil biota caused by R. japonica invasion may have implications for restoration of invaded areas."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

In 2016 a three-year two-factor field experiment was established, where the first factor was the fertilization variant and the second factor was the plant species (triticale, maize, sorghum). Fertilization was carried out on two dates: pre-sowing and top-dressing. The first variant consisted of nitrogen fertilization, exclusively mineral; in the second variant, plants were fertilized before sowing with digestate, and then top-dressed with mineral fertilizer; while in the third variant, in both terms, plants were fertilized with digestate. The quality of biomass was examined in terms of its chemical composition and as a raw material for biogas production. Regardless of the applied variant of fertilization, the plants tested were equally well supplied with nitrogen. Fertilization with digestate increased the C:N ratio in the biomass of sorghum (which deviated from the optimal value for effective anaerobic fermentation process), lowered the crude fibre content in the biomass of triticale, but also increased the content of cellulose in triticale.

Uniaxial compression test was performed for cylindrical soil aggregates prepared from four soils of various properties (very acidic Podzol, acidic Arenosol, neutral Fluvisol and alkaline Umbrisol) containing different proportions of two kinds of chitosan (CS1 of higher molecular mass and lower deacetylation degree, and CS2 of lower molecular mass and higher deacetylation degree), pretreated with 1 and 10 wetting–drying cycles. In most cases increasing chitosan rates successively decreased the mechanical stability of soils that was accompanied by a tendential increase in soil porosity. In one case (Fluvisol treated with CS2) the porosity decreased and mechanical stability increased with increasing chitosan dose. The behavior of acidic soils (Podzol and Arenosol) treated with CS2, differed from the other soils: after an initial decrease, the strength of aggregates increased with increasing chitosan amendment, despite the porosity consequently decreasing. After 10 wetting–drying cycles, the strength of the aggregates of acidic soils appeared to increase while it decreased for neutral and alkaline soils. Possible mechanisms of soil–chitosan interactions affecting mechanical strength are discussed and linked with soil water stability and wettability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Parameters measured included carbohydrate content, sugar level, and the toughness of the potatoes. Routine tests were carried out while the signals for each potato were measured, simultaneously, using an electronic nose. The signals obtained indicated the concentration of various chemical components. In addition to support vector machines (SVMs that were used for the classification of the samples, chemometric methods, such as the partial least squares regression (PLSR) method, the principal component regression (PCR) method, and the multiple linear regression (MLR) method, were used to create separate regression models for sugar and carbohydrates. The predictive power of the regression models was characterized by a coefficient of determination (R2), a root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP), and offsets. PLSR was able to accurately model the relationship between the smells of different types of potatoes, sugar, and carbohydrates. The highest and lowest accuracy of models for predicting sugar and carbohydrates was related to Marfona potatoes and Sprite cultivar potatoes. In general, in all cultivars, the accuracy in predicting the amount of carbohydrates was somewhat better than the accuracy in predicting the amount of sugar. Moreover, the linear function had 100% accuracy for training and validation in the C-SVM method for classification of five potato groups. The electronic nose could be used as a fast and non-destructive method for detecting different potato varieties. Researchers in the food industry will find this method extremely useful in selecting the desired product and samples."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The survey carried out across eight pedoclimatic zones in Europe and China was based on visual soil assessments (New Zealand VSA method) performed on soils subject to different soil management practices and nearby similar soils, under similar farming features, without the distinctive soil management practice (control). Fisher's exact test was used to test if the management treatment was independent of the score of each visual soil quality indicator and to test if the management treatment produced a higher frequency of the score ‘good’. The results showed a statistically significant (α < .05) higher frequency of the score ‘good’ for ‘soil structure and consistency’ and/or ‘soil porosity’ for six AMPs. For no-till AMP, the null hypothesis can also be rejected for ‘susceptibility to erosion’ and ‘soil stability’ and for ‘mulching + permanent soil cover’ AMP, for the ‘presence of tillage pan’ and ‘soil colour’. The hypothesis that the management treatment was independent of the score of each indicator was rejected for ‘soil structure and consistency’ of three AMPs, for ‘soil porosity’ of three AMPs, for ‘soil colour’ of one AMP and for the ‘presence of tillage pan’ of one AMP.

Conversely, it is impossible to neglect the supply of nitrogen needed as one of the essential ingredients for plant function. For organic agriculture, it is crucial to use alternative fertilizer management to reduce the harmful impacts and production costs of chemical fertilizers. In a one-year pot experiment, nitrate (NO−3) leaching and nitrogen efficiency of wheat were examined in relation to biochar (B) mixed with urea (U), legume residues (L), and azocompost (A), which represent chemical, green, and biological sources of N-fertilizers, respectively. Control (no biochar, no fertilizer), U (46 kg ha−1), A (5 t ha−1), L (5 t ha−1), B (10 t ha−1), UB, AB, and LB were the experimental treatments. Grain yield of wheat was enhanced by 337% and 312% with UB and UL, respectively. The LB produced the highest grain N yield, with a rise of 8.8 times over the control. L had the highest N-use efficiency, with an increase of 149% over the control. The highest N-harvest index and N-recovery efficiency were obtained by using LB, with values of 91 and 70 %, respectively. Nitrate leaching occurred in the following order: U > Control ≥ A ≥ L > UB > AB ≥ LB > B. Nitrogen is retained for the plant in the extensive specific surface of biochar when N-fertilizers are used in conjunction with them. This not only improves N-efficiency but also minimizes nitrogen loss through leaching. Additionally, the soil can benefit from the addition of leguminous organic fertilizer in a similar way as to urea fertilizer in terms of increasing wheat grain yield, particularly when combined with biochar."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

A frequently expressed opinion is the existence of the free-fall arch region and independence of the discharge rate on pressure. The objective of this study was to explore the impact of dynamic particle–particle contact interactions in the vicinity of the orifice on the discharge flow rate from a model silo by means of DEM simulations with special attention paid to the impact of the bedding height and bottom pressure. The DEM simulations were performed with an assembly of spherical particles poured on a flat bottom of the cylindrical model silo with a height-to-diameter ratio of 1.14. The bottom pressure was changed by changing the height of the bedding deposit and depositing an additional layer of very dense particles on the top of the bedding of primary particles. The results indicate that the discharge rate was affected by both the orifice diameter and mean bottom pressure during storage. The correction coefficient derived from the integral of the dimensionless acceleration of particles along the dimensionless movement path allowed obtaining very good approximation of the discharge rate using the well known Beverloo equation in the entire range of change of the orifice size and bottom pressure."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The objectives of the study were to assess the relationship between the sorption properties and the content of PAHs in bottom sediments and mussels. The PAH profile was dominated by higher-molecular hydrocarbons, which accounted for 73% of the total concentration of PAHs. Potentiometric studies revealed the steric-based PAH sorption mechanism that strongly depended on the presence of negatively dissociating structures such as carboxylic or phenolic functional groups. Based on the changes in Q8 values, the size-exclusion effect was more likely for 5- and 6-ring compounds. Pores < 5 µm, which had the largest share in the specific surface area, were the preferred sites for PAH sequestration and stabilization in bottom sediments.

Assessing the risk of various disposal techniques can be quite useful in recommending appropriate management. The preparation of sewage sludge biochar (SSB) and its impacts on soil characteristics, plant health, nutrient leaching, and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) are critically reviewed in this study. Comparing the features of SSB obtained at various pyrolysis temperatures revealed changes in its elemental content. Lower hydrogen/carbon ratios in SSB generated at higher pyrolysis temperatures point to the existence of more aromatic carbon molecules. Additionally, the preparation of SSB has an increased ash content, a lower yield, and a higher surface area as a result of the rise in pyrolysis temperature. The worldwide potential of SS output and CO2-equivalent emissions in 2050 were predicted as factors of global population and common disposal management in order to create a futuristic strategy and cope with the quantity of abundant global SS. According to estimations, the worldwide SS output and associated CO2-eq emissions were around 115 million tons dry solid (Mt DS) and 14,139 teragrams (Tg), respectively, in 2020. This quantity will rise to about 138 Mt DS sewage sludge and 16985 Tg CO2-eq emissions in 2050, a 20% increase. In this regard, developing and populous countries may support economic growth by utilizing low-cost methods for producing biochar and employing it in local agriculture. To completely comprehend the benefits and drawbacks of SSB as a soil supplement, further study on long-term field applications of SSB is required."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The understanding of the impact of high humidity hot air impingement blanching (HHAIB) on the changes in physicochemical properties of polysaccharides and phytochemicals of okra pods is of great importance because over-blanching may result in cell membrane disruption and changes in biologically active compounds under prolonged exposure to the thermal treatment. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of HHAIB on the changes in physicochemical properties of pectins and phytochemicals extracted from okra pods.\nRESULTS\n\nBoth the HHAIB time and method of extraction influenced their physicochemical characteristics and biological activity. Pectin fractions subjected to HHAIB were composed of polygalacturonic acid, rhamnogalacturonan, glucomannan, galactan, mannose, arabinose, rhamnose, calcium pectate and arabinogalactan. The contents of total phenolics, total flavonoids and antioxidant activity of extracts mostly increased during HHAIB (i.e. up to 19.0%, 13.2% and 35.3%, respectively). However, HHAIB reduced the chlorophyll-a (up to 55.7%) and lycopene (up to 52.6%) contents of okra pods.\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe acquired knowledge may be useful for better understanding and optimization of technologies based on HHAIB treatment. The HHAIB treated okra can be a promising natural alternative in different applications, including its use as a replacement of some ingredients in food or non-food systems as a result of richness in polysaccharides and polyphenols, as well as high antioxidant properties. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The present studies show effect of polyphenols differing in the molecular size (gallic, ellagic and tannic acids) on the structure of gluten network studied with FT- Raman spectroscopy. The model dough was supplemented with the polyphenols in the amount of 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2%. Farinographic studies showed that only gallic and ellagic acids led to dough breakdown, whereas tannic acid (the biggest molecule) stabilized the gluten network. Spectroscopic results indicate formation of covalent or hydrogen bonds between protein SH groups and polyphenol OH groups. Moreover, it was observed a strong negative band in all spectra that can be assigned to α-helices. It suggests that structural changes can concern mainly gliadins. When it comes to aromatic amino acids, the pattern of tyrosine hydrogen bonding was not affected by the polyphenols, whereas microenvironment of tryptophan changed considerably to more hydrophobic. It may indicate folding of polypeptide chains and development of more compact and ordered gluten network.

However, the transformation of AAS (plurality, commercialisation, fragmentation, decentralisation) brings new challenges for delivering advice to support soil health management. This paper asks: To what extent do agricultural advisory services have the capacity to support the transition to healthy soils across Europe? Using the ‘best fit’ framework, analytical characteristics of the AAS relevant to the research question (governance structures, management, organisational and individual capacities) were identified. Analysis of 18 semi-structured expert interviews across 6 case study countries in Europe, selected to represent a range of contexts, was undertaken. Capacities to provide soil health management (SHM) advice are constrained by funding arrangements, limited adviser training and professional development, adviser motivations and professional cultures, all determined by institutional conditions. This has resulted in a narrowing down of access and content of soil advice and a reduced capacity to support the transition in farming to healthy soils. The extent to which emerging policy and market drivers incentivise enhanced capacities in AAS is an important area for future research."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Additionally, PCA analysis was applied to find correlations between fluorescence and Raman parameters. The fluorescent dyes, regarded as model representatives of phenolic compounds, were added to model dough in six concentrations (0.05%–0.5%). Wet gluten samples and starch slurries (as a residue after washing out gluten) were excited by two wavelengths – one assigned to tryptophan, and the second to the particular dye. Fluorescence and UV-VIS analysis of starch slurries show that the dyes can be completely bound to gluten proteins because of their absence in the slurries. Analysis of the spectroscopic results indicate that fluorescein and rhodamine B interact with gluten proteins in different ways depending on the type of functional groups present in the dye structure. The fluorescein molecules, due to the presence of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups may incorporate into gluten network by forming hydrogen and/or covalent bonds, whereas rhodamine B with four methyl groups may be enclosed in hydrophobic pockets formed by gluten polypeptide chains. These differences can be related to the type of functional groups present in the dye structure (fluorescein has one hydroxyl group, rhodamine B has four methyl groups). PCA analysis showed correlations between dye fluorescent parameters (maximum wavelength and band intensity) and some structural parameters (presence or absence of bands assigned to α-helices, β-turns and Sdouble bondS bonds conformations). The PCA results also suggest that mechanism of interactions gluten – dye depends on type of functional groups present in the dye molecule."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Industrialization, however, requires higher energy usage. Greater energy demand brings about the issue of energy sustainability. In particular, the depletion of fossil fuels results in serious challenges in food production processes. On the other hand, the utilization of energy carriers is accompanied by environmental contamination. In this regard, evaluating energy consumption and environmental pollution in the production systems can be a proper approach to finding the energy consumption and pollution centers for presenting applicable solutions to decrease pollution. In this study, energy indices of ER, EP, SE, and NEG were assessed to evaluate the energy consumption of lettuce production. The results showed values of 0.4, 17.28 kg/MJ, 0.06 MJ/kg, and 29,922 MG/ha for ER, EP, SE, and NEG, respectively. Among the consumption inputs, diesel fuel and nitrogen fertilizer had the highest consumption rate. Pollutants were also explored by the life cycle assessment method. Accordingly, chemicals and agricultural machinery led to the highest contaminating emissions. To reduce environmental contaminants, lowering the application of chemical pesticides, using biological approaches to combat pests, determining the proper amount of chemical fertilizers, using animal fertilizers, and using the proper agricultural machines should be considered."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

In this season, the impact of precipitation on vegetation coverage should not be significant when LST is low, as was observed in the analysed case. In spring, the correlation between NDVI and ET and precipitation is positive and significant (R = 0.86 and 0.55, p-value = 0.05). In this season, the main factor controlling vegetation dynamics is precipitation, and LST's impact on vegetation coverage may be omitted when precipitation is much higher than usual. In the summer, the correlation between NDVI and ET is positive and significant (R = 0.70, p-value = 0.05), while the correlation between NDVI and LST is negative and significant (R = –0.45, p-value = 0.05). In this season, the main factor that controls vegetation coverage is LST. In the summer season, when precipitation is much higher than average, the impact of LST on vegetation growth is more pronounced. Also, higher than usual precipitation in the autumn is the reason for extended vegetation coverage in this season, which is mainly due to increased soil moisture"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091be878c28a047387588","uid":"bbvt8lvTI1NZvi77fsByItg","uuid":"cd4fea95-f38f-4655-8696-56c95dd99631","name":"Katedra Chemii Rolnej i Środowiskowej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709225878c28a047390a24"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Annually, it is generated in the amount of over 50 million tons. One of the ways of fly ash management is its conversion into porous structures, which then can be applied to capture other pollutants from the aquatic environment. This paper presents the adsorption capabilities of four products of hydrothermal reaction of fly ash (HC FA), i.e., zeolites (Na-X, NA-P1) and their composites with carbon (Na-X(C), Na-P1(C)). All five materials were characterized in terms of their structure and used as adsorbents of heavy metals (Pb(II), Zn(II) ions) and organic compounds (diclofenac – popular anti-inflammatory drug, poly(acrylic acid) – polymer commonly used in industry) from their mixed solutions. Adsorption–desorption, electrokinetic and stability measurements were performed to determine the mechanisms driving the formation of the mixed adsorption layers. It was found that Na-X zeolite adsorbed 322.1 mg/g of Pb(II), 332.5 mg/g of Zn(II) and 6.68 mg/g of DCF, whereas Na-P1 bounded 332.9 mg/g of Pb(II), 103.6 mg/g of Zn(II) and 21.19 mg/g of DCF. In the mixed systems of adsorbates, these values were different, but also satisfactory. For example, in the Zn(II) presence, the adsorption of DCF on Na-X increased from 6.68 to 12.86 mg/g and that on Na-X(C), from 8.49 to 21.95 mg/g. The adsorbed pollutants changed the structure of electrical double layer of zeolitic materials. Moreover, they affected the stability of the examined suspensions. The presented results are promising for the further application of obtained zeolitic materials for environmental remediation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The aim of this paper was to compare the adsorption mechanism of ionic polyacrylamides (PAMs)—anionic and cationic with different contents of functional groups, on the surface of clay minerals—montmorillonite (type 2:1) and kaolinite (type 1:1), without and with the presence of heavy metal ions (Cr(VI) or Pb(II)). The dependence of solution pH, structure of mineral, type of PAM, ionic form of heavy metal, as well as order of adsorbates addition on the adsorption efficiency and stability of the clay mineral-polymer-heavy metal system was determined. In addition to adsorption and stability studies, electrokinetic and potentiometric titration measurements were performed. It was shown that the mixed PAM+heavy metal adsorption layers modify the surface properties of clay minerals significantly, which in many cases leads to the effective destabilization of the solid suspension and its separation from the liquid phase. Moreover, the most important factor, which influences the adsorbed amount of ionic polyacrylamide, turned out to be the internal structure of layered aluminosilicates and the presence of inter-package spaces capable of adsorbate molecules accumulating. For this reason the obtained adsorption capacity of montmorillonite is about 100 times higher in comparison to kaolinite."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

It plays a key role in sustainable agriculture, horticulture and forestry. In contrast to the vast number of studies focusing on soil bacteria, the amount of research concerning soil fungal communities is limited. This is despite the fact that fungi play a crucial role in the cycling of matter and energy on Earth. Fungi constitute a significant part of the pathobiome of plants. Moreover, many of them are indispensable to plant health. This group includes mycorrhizal fungi, superparasites of pathogens, and generalists; they stabilize the soil mycobiome and play a key role in biogeochemical cycles. Several fungal species also contribute to soil bioremediation through their uptake of high amounts of contaminants from the environment. Moreover, fungal mycelia stretch below the ground like blood vessels in the human body, transferring water and nutrients to and from various plants. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing combined with bioinformatic tools have facilitated detailed studies of the soil mycobiome. This review discusses the beneficial effects of soil mycobiomes and their interactions with other microbes and hosts in both healthy and unhealthy ecosystems. It may be argued that studying the soil mycobiome in such a fashion is an essential step in promoting sustainable and regenerative agriculture."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

This study aims to select the best isotherm model and explore the correlation between physicochemical properties of humic acids isolated from forest soils and metal ion sorption parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The HA fractions of ten forest soils were initially isolated and well characterized. Afterward, the sorption of four metal ions (Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn) on the isolated HAs was investigated. The experimental data was initially fit to the three isotherm models to find the optimal model. Subsequently, the correlation between physicochemical HA properties and metal ion sorption parameters was explored using correlation and clustering analysis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Results showed that despite employing identical extraction procedures, isolated HAs from soils differed statistically in their descriptive characteristics. The adsorption data generally fit the Freundlich isotherm model best. However, isotherm model performance was affected by both metal ion and HA types. Six descriptive HA attributes including H/C and O/C molar ratio, the internal oxidation degree (ω), carboxylic acidity, E4/E6 ratio, and the Δlog-K were closely associated with sorption parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Since the performance of isotherm models was affected by both metal ion and HA type, the isotherm model should be selected with regard to target metal ions and HA type. Highly correlated variables with sorption parameters of HA-metal ions screened in this study could be reliably used to develop sorption predictive models for HA-metal ions in soil and aquifers."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The current article presents results of research on the technological development of an\nalternative natural sweetener of high biological value and improved organoleptic properties. Sorghum saccharatum\nstem juice is used in research. It is pre-clarified enzymatically with α-amylase and glucoamylase, clarified by\nultrafiltration, and concentrated by the direct contact membrane distillation in various temperature ranges. The study\nshows the efficacy of membrane methods for improving juice purity, total soluble solids (TSS), and total sugar (TS)\ncontent in the syrup obtained. Clarification depends on membrane characteristics at the beginning of the process, as\nthere are no differences at the end of it. Juice concentration at high-temperature differences allows to accelerate the\nprocess by approx. 60% comparing to low-temperature differences. A lower temperature difference (∆Т = 20–30°С) in\nthe concentration process results in a longer process and syrup acidisation, whereas a higher temperature difference\n(∆Т = 70°С) affects physicochemical properties of syrup due to local overheating and formation of Maillard reaction\nproducts. The juice concentration at ∆Т = 50–60°С allows to obtain high values of total soluble solids without\nsignificant degradation of physicochemical and organoleptic properties."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Extraction methods, 3DEEM fluorescence and UV–vis spectroscopies enabled to track the changes of HLAs and FLAs concentration, humification degree, lignin type compounds, biological index, aromaticity/aliphaticity, molecular weight and quality of fluorophores. Additionally, the feedstock and PT effect was discussed for the properties of the BioCs and the water extractable organic matter (WEOM). The results showed that the PT increase caused increase in the pH, ash, surface area and negative charge of the BioCs. Woody feedstock resulted in the BioCs with lower ash content, while the BioCs derived from straw revealed low content of organic matter and carbon but high surface area. The feedstock effect was not clear on structural parameters of HLAs and FLAs, however the BioC derived from litter at 750 °C placed HLAs in group of the strong humification. Woody parts in feedstock and increasing PT was the reason of lower humic-like substances content. It was relatively high after pyrolysis at 430 °C and decreased rapidly at higher PTs. The PT increase affected structure of organic fractions. For HLAs, thermal transformation lead to increase of the humification, molecular weight and content of aromatic structures. Changes for FLAs revealed opposite trend due to a greater susceptibility to the pyrolytic partitioning of molecules. PT elevation resulted also in decreasing contribution of protein- and aminoacid- like compounds and degradation of structures derived from lignin-rich feedstocks. These changes were accompanied by progressive decrease in the biological index of HLAs revealing gradual destruction of freshly produced compounds of microbiological origin. WEOM was enriched in organic compounds typical for HLAs fraction, and PT effect was similar to this predominant fraction."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Potato can be consumed in various forms. As customers expect safe and high-quality products, precise and rapid determination of the quality and composition of potatoes is of crucial significance. The quality of potatoes may alter during the storage period due to various phenomena. Soluble solids content (SSC) and pH are among the quality parameters experiencing alteration during the storage process. This study is thus aimed to assess the variations in SSC and pH during the storage of potatoes using an electronic nose and Vis/NIR spectroscopic techniques with the help of prediction models including partial least squares (PLS), multiple linear regression (MLR), principal component regression (PCR), support vector regression (SVR) and an artificial neural network (ANN). The variations in the SSC and pH are ascending and significant. The results also indicate that the SVR model in the electronic nose has the highest prediction accuracy for the SSC and pH (81, and 92%, respectively). The artificial neural network also managed to predict the SSC and pH at accuracies of 83 and 94%, respectively.

The obtained results showed that HC FA and Na-P1(C) had the greatest adsorption capacity towards DCF, i.e., 26.51 and 21.19 mg/g, respectively. PAA caused considerable decrease in the DCF adsorption due to the competition of both adsorbates of anionic character for active sites. For example, the adsorbed amount of DCF on Na-P1 without PAA was 14.11 mg/g, whereas the one measured with PAA was 5.08 mg/g. Most of prepared solids were effectively regenerated by the use of NaOH. Desorption degree reached even 73.65% in the single systems (with one adsorbate) and 97.24% in the mixed ones (with two adsorbates).

It defines the potential of these materials for remediation of degraded water and soil environments. The performed study included analyses of BC physicochemistry, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) release and ability to immobilize copper (Cu), tetracycline (TC) and carboxin (CB) in one- and two-adsorbate systems. The BCs were obtained with pyrolysis at 600 °C for 30 min in a nitrogen atmosphere. Their DOC was predominantly constituted of substances with large molecular weights and high aromaticity, meaning that both BCs can be safely applied as soil additives. Potato-biochar (P-BC) had a more developed surface than raspberry-biochar (R-BC). The specific surface area (SBET) of P-BC was 122 m2/g, whilst of R-BC was 87 m2/g. As a result, the efficiency of impurity adsorption in the one-adsorbate systems was higher for P-BC (61.75% for Cu, 73.84% for TC, and 54.43% for CB). In the two-adsorbate systems, organic impurities improved the immobilization of heavy metal ions on BCs. The efficiency of Cu adsorption on P-BC when TC was present was 88.29%. Desorption of Cu from BC was highest using HCl, whilst that of TC and CB was highest using NaOH. Maximum desorption was observed in a two-adsorbate system with TC + CB (up to 63.6% for TC). These results confirmed that potato and raspberry stems can be used to produce highly effective BCs with large application potential, especially for remediation of degraded soils and polluted waters."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Tis study aimed to evaluate the composition of thirty-seven honey samples of diferent botanical origins (14 multiforal and 23 uniforal) obtained from beekeepers located in the west region of Algeria. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) methods were used to determine the levels of 19 elements in honey (K, Na, Ca, Mg, Mn, Cu, Fe, Zn, V, Cr, Co, As, Ru, Rh, Cd, W, Pt, Au, and Pb). Ru, Rh, Pt and, Au were not detected in any of the tested honey samples. Te most abundant minerals were K, Ca, Na, and Mg ranging within 153.00–989.00 mg/kg, 33.10–502.00 mg/kg, 13.30–281.00 mg/kg, and 20.80–162.00 mg/kg, respectively. Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu were the most abundant heavy metals while Pb, V, Cr, W, Co, and Cd were the lowest ones (<1 mg/kg) in the honey samples surveyed. Several honey types, lavender, rosemary, mild white mustard, thyme, milk thistle, carob tree, orange tree, Euphorbia, Eucalyptus, camphor, jujube tree, sage, and harmal, were studied, and the statistical analysis was carried out using principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) techniques to evaluate the data. Te results showed that the analyses of mineral content were sufcient to determine the foral origin and their variability may be related to geochemical and geographical diferences. On other hand, all elements detected were at levels below safe thresholds."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091be878c28a047387593","uid":"bNZr2n2i3hCzJTLVuUiAwXQ","uuid":"0ab3c874-c919-45ed-b018-73d812460ef7","name":"Katedra Turystyki i Rekreacji","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f1878c28a0473c7839"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e7091bd878c28a047387291","uid":"b147wmKpuVuFIq2ojOinPoA","uuid":"cf66803e-5eb2-47ef-9a1d-9d06e351c431","name":"Katedra Analizy i Oceny Jakości Żywności","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709227878c28a047390ae7"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

This study compared the efficacy of free versus immobilized enzymes at different concentrations in promoting sludge disintegration. Pretreatment with 1,000 mg/L immobilized enzymes was more efficient in promoting sludge disintegration than free enzymes at the same concentration. Under the optimized conditions, volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were produced at 10.6 g/L, accounting for 85 % of total soluble chemical oxygen demand. Improved VFA production was attributed to the release of large amounts of polysaccharides and proteins from the enzymatically pretreated sludge. Released organic matter are the substrates for VFAs generated by the determined microbial community of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi. In this study, anaerobic fermentation was used to successfully convert organic matter in sludge into high-value-added VFAs. Therefore, this process can be selected as a strategy to reduce carbon emissions from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The simulations were experimentally validated based on splash images obtained with the use of a high-speed camera (2800 fps). Several variants of simulations with a varying drop size (in 0.10-mm steps) or drop velocity (in 0.025-m/s steps) were conducted.\n\nOur experiments showed the importance of even a slight underestimation/overestimation of the properties of a falling drop on the simulation of the size and dynamics of splash in an immiscible liquid system. On the other hand, correct simulation made it possible to analyse aspects of the phenomenon that were difficult or even impossible to achieve experimentally due to the limitations of the image analysis method. This concerned the determination of the cavity width, the moment of cavity disappearance, the moment of jet formation (still below the water level), and the height of the jet. In addition, based on the validated simulation of splash in immiscible liquids, the scale of the spread of petroleum contamination as a result of the impact of a single droplet was determined."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Assessment of genetic modifications of the activity of enzymes involved in the AGP biosynthesis is an efficient tool to study AGP functions. Thus, P4H (prolyl 4 hydroxylase) mutants, GLCAT (β-glucuronosyltransferase) mutants, and GH43 (glycoside hydrolase family 43) mutants have been described. We focused on the overview of AGPs modifications observed at the molecular, cellular, and organ levels. Inhibition of the hydroxylation process results in an increase in the intensity of cell divisions and thus, has an impact on root system length and leaf area. In turn, overexpression of P4H genes stimulates the density of root hairs. A mutation in GLCAT genes responsible for the transfer of glucuronic acid to the AGP molecule revealed that the reduction of GlcA in AGP disrupts the substantial assembly of the primary cell wall. Furthermore, silencing of genes encoding GH43, which has the ability to hydrolyze the AGP glycan by removing incorrectly synthesized β-1,3-galactans, induces changes in the abundance of other cell wall constituents, which finally leads to root growth defects. This information provides insight into AGPs as a crucial players in the structural interactions present in the plant extracellular matrix."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Imidacloprid (IMD) is a pesticide used worldwide. No information exists on how IMD impact the bees’ body bioelement balance, which is essential for bee health. We hypothesized that IMD disturbs this balance and fed the bees (in field conditions) with diets containing 0 ppb (control), 5 ppb (sublethal considered field-relevant), and 200 ppb (adverse) doses of IMD. IMD severely reduced the levels of K, Na, Ca, and Mg (electrolytic) and of Fe, Mo, Mn, Co, Cu, Ni, Se, and Zn, while those of Sn, V, and Cr (enzymatic) were increased. Levels of P, S, Ti, Al, Li, and Sr were also decreased, while only the B content (physiologically essential) was increased. The increase in Tl, Pb, and As levels (toxic) was alarming. Generally, IMD, even in sublethal doses, unexpectedly led to severe bioelement malnutrition in 69% of bioelements and to a stoichiometric mismatch in the remaining ones. This points to the IMD-dependent bioelement disturbance as another, yet unaccounted for, essential metabolic element which can interfere with apian health.

analysis","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"With regard to the differences between soil particle size distribution (PSD) obtained by sieve-sedimentation methods (SSMs), e.g., the sieve-pipette method (SPM) and the laser diffraction method (LDM), usually, the clay fraction content in LDM measurements is lower than in SSM. Two groups of reasons can be identified for this. Firstly, differences resulting from the features of the methods themselves. Secondly, differences resulting from the soil sample preparation (after sampling) and pretreatment (disaggregation). These differences not only cause difficulties in the PSDs comparability but also make it difficult, and sometimes even impossible, to apply the LDM results to soil texture classification. The solution to this difficulty may be to use pedotransfer functions and standardization of measurement procedures. The aim of this work was to validate the pedotransfer function proposed by Makó et al. (2017) on a Polish soil physics database for recalculating the results from LDM to compare them with SPM results and assess how the soil preparation and pretreatment influenced the obtained PSD and resulting soil texture classification. Using the pedotransfer function, 74 % accuracy was achieved, which is comparable with the results of other pedotransfer functions reported in the literature. Comparing the PSD results for the methods of sample preparation found in the literature after sampling (analysis of fresh, air dry and oven-dried – in 105 °C – soil) and pretreatment before the measurement (breaking soil aggregates chemically and physically) allows recommending the conducting of LDM PSD measurements using air dry soils and soil ultrasound disaggregation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047390f5e","5e70922b878c28a047390f5d"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d8ee","5e709347878c28a0473a63a8"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Their ascospores easily transfer between soil and crops; thus, Neosartorya poses a danger to horticulture and food production, especially to the postharvest quality of fruits and vegetables. The spores are known to cause spoilage, mainly in raw fruit produce, juices, and pulps, despite undergoing pasteurization. However, these fungi can also participate in carbon transformation and sequestration, as well as plant protection in drought conditions. Many species have been identified and included in the genus, and yet some of them create taxonomical controversy due to their high similarity. This also contributes to Neosartorya spp. being easily mistaken for its anamorph, resulting in uncertain data within many studies.

The research is based on a pot experiment which includes 4 different naturalization strategies and 5 different pathosystems. The application of environmental isolates of plant beneficial bacteria belonging to genera Arthrobacter, Pseudomonas, and Rhodococcus to the raspberry plant was performed in order to characterize their effect on the microbial communities surrounding the raspberry plant. The application of pathosystems consisting of fungal and fungal-like pathogens belonging to the Botrytis, Colletotrichum, Phytophthora, and Verticillium genera allowed for an analysis to be conducted with regard to the effect of naturalization treatments on microbial communities of raspberry plants infected with phytopathogens. Rhizosphere and shoots samples were subjected to a functional profiling analysis of their microbial communities with the use of Biolog® EcoPlates. Furthermore the DNA was isolated from the rhizosphere and shoots of raspberries and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. The application of a bacterial inoculum resulted in a decrease in the substrate stress index of raspberry shoots microbiota. Over 95 % of the fungal phyla found in the rhizosphere consisted of 3 phyla: Ascomycota, Mortierellomycota, and Basidiomycota. The results obtained indicated, that the application of plant beneficial bacteria to raspberry plants roots during planting, and afterwards during the watering, may be an important way of inhibiting the negative effect of plant pathogens and enhancing the functional abilities of microbial communities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

However, what is often not recognized is that they can also exhibit a high methane (CH4) uptake capacity that could be influenced by future increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and variations in temperature and water availability. While there is a wealth of information on C sequestration in grasslands there is less consensus on how climate change impacts on CH4 uptake or the underlying mechanisms involved. To address this, we assessed existing knowledge on the impact of climate change components on CH4 uptake by grassland soils. Increases in precipitation associated with soils with a high background soil moisture content generally resulted in a reduction in CH4 uptake or even net emissions, while the effect was opposite in soils with a relatively low background moisture content. Initially wet grasslands subject to the combined effects of warming and water deficits may absorb more CH4, mainly due to increased gas diffusivity. However, in the longer-term heat and drought stress may reduce the activity of methanotrophs when the mean soil moisture content is below the optimum for their survival. Enhanced plant productivity and growth under elevated CO2, increased soil moisture and changed nutrient concentrations, can differentially affect methanotrophic activity, which is often reduced by increasing N deposition. Our estimations showed that CH4 uptake in grassland soils can change from −57.7 % to +6.1 % by increased precipitation, from −37.3 % to +85.3 % by elevated temperatures, from +0.87 % to +92.4 % by decreased precipitation, and from −66.7 % to +27.3 % by elevated CO2. In conclusion, the analysis suggests that grasslands under the influence of warming and drought may absorb even more CH4, mainly because of reduced soil water contents and increased gas diffusivity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Their mutual relationships and functions in the cell wall can be better understood by means of conceptual models of their higher-order structures. Knowledge unified in the form of a conceptual model allows predictions to be made about the properties and behaviour of the system under study. Ongoing research in this field has resulted in a number of conceptual models of the cell wall. However, due to the currently limited research methods, the community of cell wall researchers have not reached a consensus favouring one model over another. Herein we present yet another research technique – numerical modelling – which is capable of resolving this issue. Even at the current stage of development of numerical techniques, due to their complexity, the in silico reconstruction of PCW remains a challenge for computational simulations. However, some difficulties have been overcome, thereby making it possible to produce advanced approximations of PCW structure and mechanics. This review summarizes the results concerning the simulation of polysaccharide interactions in PCW with regard to network fine structure, supramolecular properties and polysaccharide binding affinity. The in silico mechanical models presented herein incorporate certain physical and biomechanical aspects of cell wall architecture for the purposes of undertaking critical testing to bring about advances in our understanding of the mechanisms controlling cells and limiting cell wall expansion."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Through the inhibition test, we observed that the application of different dilutions of pyroligneous acid rarefied the growth of the fungal mycelium. Furthermore, we have seen through the metabolic profile that B. cinerea is not able to use pyroligneous acid as a resource or even grow in close contact with this resource.

Discrete element method simulations are an attractive approach to understanding mixing at the particle level within processing equipment. However, due to computational cost, particle shape is typically approximated as spherical despite most materials being non-spherical. In this paper, the combined effect of cohesion and particle shape using polyhedral particles is studied in a rotating drum. It was found that repose angle calibrated spheres were unable to reproduce the same percolation behaviour as polyhedra, leading to significantly different results with a better match in the case of highly cohesive paste like materials that diminish the particle scale effects. Symmetric polyhedral shapes exhibited the best mixing, while irregular shapes had the worst mixing. Mixing improves with increasing cohesive particle size due to the ability to percolate the finer non-cohesive material. Finally, equipment geometry and rotation speed had a significant effect on mixing, such that making conclusions on the general mixing of materials without the actual mechanical actions it is subjected to should be done with caution."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. In this study, a laboratory incubation experiment that included freeze–thaw cycles (FTC), freezing (F) and control (CK) treatments was performed on three typical Chinese upland soils, namely, fluvo-aquic soil (FS), black soil (BS) and loess soil (LS). A higher similarity in soil properties and bacterial community structure was discovered between FS and LS than between FS and BS or LS and BS, and the bacterial diversity of FS and LS was higher than that of BS. FTC significantly increased the denitrification potential and the proportion of N2O in the denitrification gas products in FS and LS but decreased the denitrification potential in BS. Accordingly, with the increasing number of freeze–thaw cycles, the bacterial community composition in the FTC treatments in FS and LS diverged from that in CK but changed little in BS. Taxa that responded to FTC or correlated with denitrification potential were identified. Taken together, our results demonstrated that the effects of FTC on N2O emissions are soil-type-dependent and that the shift in the microbial community structure may contribute to the elevated N2O emissions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

This study aimed to identify the patterns and location of the jet stream in southwest Asia during the days of widespread rainfall in Iran based on two criteria: “highest frequency of stations involved” and “maximum cumulative amount on the day of peak rainfall”. For this purpose, the daily precipitation data for 42 synoptic stations in Iran during the period 2006–2019 from the Meteorological Organization of Iran, the daily data at 500 hPa Geopotential Height (HGT), and U and V wind components at 500 and 300 hPa from NCEP/NCAR were gathered. Synoptic patterns were obtained based on daily precipitation data, daily maps at HGT 500 hPa, and U and V wind components at 500 and 300 hPa. The analysis of patterns showed that the position of precipitation cores is associated with the position and extension of jet stream centers at 300 hPa in winter, spring, and autumn. The main position of jet stream cores during flood-causing rainfall at 300 hPa was over the northern part of Saudi Arabia, the Mesopotamia basin, and southern Iran. This position seems to have provided the conditions for the convergence of the earth’s surface and the divergence of the atmosphere for the easy passage of moisture from the Red Sea, Aden Sea, and the Persian Gulf, and in the second rank, the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian Sea."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The analysis of the Raman spectra showed that the tested compounds caused changes in the secondary and tertiary structure of gluten proteins. These changes are mainly related to the molecular structure of flavonoids. Among the flavonoids, a slightly different type of changes was caused by hesperetin, which, apart from OH groups, has a OCH3 group in its structure. The changes caused by glycosides were related to the site of attachment of the glycosidic part to the aglycone. Additionally, the added polyphenols changed the conformation of the disulphide bridges. The greatest changes in the tyrosine environment were observed after the addition of quercetin and the formation of hydrogen bonds between tyrosine and this flavonoid.

The simulations have shown that for lower normal load and shearing velocity the deformation takes place in the whole volume of the sample. For the highest velocity, material undergoes shear deformation (plastic behavior) in the layer adjacent to motionless cover, while the layer adjacent to moving corrugated surface remains stiff.

The altimetric data from four remote sensing databases (TOPEX/POSEIDON and Jason 1, 2, and 3), the area of the lakes from the images of Landsat OLI and ETM + sensors, the vegetation from MOD13Q1-NDVI 250 m database, land surface temperature from LST-MOD11A1, and precipitation from GPM_3IMERGM product were used in this study to assess the changes occurring in the period of the last 20 years (2000–2019). The results showed that in the analyzed area the values of the land surface temperature and vegetation indices increased, whereas annual precipitation sums decreased. Although temperature and vegetation changes in all three countries were almost consistent with each other, changes in the water level and area of the studied lakes were different. The highest decrease in the water level was observed for Urmia lake. Although decreases in the water level were also observed in other lakes, their water level returned after a time to its initial level (1992). This was not the case for Urmia lake, where the water level after 1999 never returned to the initial value, finally lowering by 7 m. The fluctuations of the water level and area of Iran, Turkey, and Iraq lakes are however caused by factors other than only those related to climate, which needs more investigations to determine more precisely the changes in the water level of these lakes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The present study was focused on determination of changes in the biomass production, biochemical composition, accumulation and distribution of fatty acids in neutral lipids, glycolipids, phospholipids and biodiesel properties of soil microalga Eustigmatos calaminaris in response to various levels of nitrogen stress and indole-3-acetic acid supplementation. The highest growth rate, the highest lipid content and daily lipid productivity were noted at the nitrogen limitation up to 25% with IAA supplementation. The increase in NL was associated with nutrient stress. An increase in the level of GL and PL were recorded upon the reduction of the nitrogen content (25% N) and the addition of IAA. The gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis demonstrated that C16:0, C16:1, and C18:1 were the main fatty acids in E. calaminaris lipids. As shown by the lipidomic analysis, the IAA supplementation in the nitrogen limitation variants enhanced the content of TAGs in C18:1 and monounsaturated fatty acids. The current findings indicated a potential strategy to improve the fatty acid profile in neutral lipids and high potential of E. calaminaris for biodiesel applications."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

In order to protect and restore nature, finding solutions and technologies in the industrial and agricultural fields that simultaneously recycle organic waste biomass, revalorize and recover nutrients and natural compounds is continuously important. The production of the insect Hermetia illucens (Diptera: Stratiomyidae, Linnaeus, 1758) fits well within the framework of green policy. H. illucens larvae fed on various biomass. The redirection of leftovers from fruit and vegetable or food processing to feed the larvae allows to produce insect proteins and fat, which can be further used in the production of animal feed. Besides, the larvae are also able to feed on manure, biogas sludge, and municipal sewage sludge, which decreases its weight and thus offers entomoremediation of the waste. Insect frass is use as an organic fertilizer. Fats and insect biomass are suitable for biodiesel production and biogas generation. From insect exoskeletons, chitin and chitosan are extracted. Thus, insect production seems to create new and unique opportunities for the environment, people, and animal nutrition, and the large and growing number of publications on H. illucens puts it in the center of interest of various research communities."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

This paper focuses on developing and testing some techniques designed to identify automatically such microorganisms. More specifically, the recognition performed here deals with the specific five genera of soil bacteria. Their microscopic images are classified with machine learning methods using shape and image texture descriptors. Feature determination based on shape relies on interpolation and curvature estimation whereas feature recognition based on image texture resorts to the spatial relationships between chrominance and luminance of pixels using co-occurrence matrices. From the variety of modelling methods applied here the best reported result amounts to 97% of accuracy.

One such naturally occurring obstacle is the above-ground part of plants. This study presents the impact of a precipitation drop on three selected coniferous shoots that differ in morphology: the eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), the blue spruce (Picea pungens), and the Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris). The falling drops came from a generator and had a diameter of 4.2 mm with a kinetic energy of 0.49 mJ. From the high-speed camera footage, the number and size of droplets formed by the breakdown of an incident drop and the angle at which they travelled were determined. The average number of droplets into which an incident drop broke ranged from 74 to 308, with an average diameter of 0.31 to 0.35 mm, and depended on the species of plant on which the incident drop broke. It was also found that, in the case of the eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), the quantities depended on the location of the drop impact (on the branch or the needles). The size and speed of the droplets after breaking affect the quantity of the throughfall and the rate of water evaporation during falling and from the soil and plant surfaces. The characteristics of the breaking of raindrops into small droplets as a result of hitting branches and leaves can improve our understanding of the role that canopy interception plays in the water cycle."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The research aimed to quantify the correlations between soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total potassium, soil macropore parameters and water-stable aggregates under no-tillage and conventional tillage in Cambisol. The content of water-stable aggregates and macroporosity tended to increase in the following order: conventional tillage (returned residues) < conventional tillage (removed residues) < no-tillage (removed residues) < no-tillage (returned residues) in both fertilizations. The relationships between total nitrogen and various soil factors were investigated: soil organic carbon (r = 0.65, p < 0.05), total phosphorus (r = 0.65, p < 0.05), were statistically significant. Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen were positively correlated with water-stable aggregates (r = 0.81, p < 0.01 and r = 0.68, p < 0.05, respectively), whereas the relationship between total potassium and water-stable aggregates was negative. The relationship between total phosphorus and water-stable aggregates (r = 0.62, p < 0.05) was positive. The soil chemical properties, macropores and water-stable aggregates that were averaged across the residues and fertilizations were higher in no-tillage than in conventional tillage. Soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and total phosphorus all had a positive direct influence on the formation of water-stable aggregates under different tillage conditions. Since our results are largely based on correlations, the mechanisms of interaction between the soil chemical properties, water-stable aggregates and the formation of pores in the soil need to be explored further in future investigations."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The model dough was supplemented with phenolic acids at the following concentrations: 0.05%, 0.1%, and 0.2% (w/w). Results obtained from amide I band analysis, revealed that addition of phenolic acids to the dough resulted in formation of ß-turns and antiparallel-ß-sheets at expense of pseudo-ß-sheets and hydrogen-bonded ß-turns. Analysis of the amide III band showed that the ß-sheet structures content increased at the expense of α-helices and ß-turns. The changes occurring within the OH stretching region after the addition of phenolic acids were minor. UV–Vis analysis revealed that the gluten samples, which were modified by hydroxycinnamic acids, displayed stronger antioxidant activity than the gluten samples modified with hydroxybenzoic acids. An additional functional group in the form of a hydroxyl group (-OH) also displayed a significant effect on antioxidant properties. As the mixing of model dough progresses, hydrophobicity of the gluten network increases, however, the changes were minor. The changes in hydrophobicity after phenolic acid supplementation were also minor. Obtained data indicated that phenolic acid interacted more with glutenin fraction than with gliadins."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

However, the cladodes are often discarded, wasting the potentially useful mucilage in them. The mucilage is composed primarily of heteropolysaccharides, characterized by their molar mass distribution, monosaccharide composition, structural features (by vibrational spectroscopy, FT IR, and atomic force microscopy, AFM), and fermentability by known saccharolytic commensal members of the gut microbiota. After fractionation with ion exchange chromatography, four polysaccharides were found: one neutral (composed mainly of galactose, arabinose, and xylose) and three acidic, with a galacturonic acid content from 10 to 35%mol. Their average molar masses ranged from 1.8 × 105 to 2.8 × 105 g·mol−1. Distinct structural features such as galactan, arabinan, xylan, and galacturonan motifs were present in the FT IR spectra. The intra- and intermolecular interactions of the polysaccharides, and their effect on the aggregation behavior, were shown by AFM. The composition and structural features of these polysaccharides were reflected in their prebiotic potential. Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria were not able to utilize them, whereas members of Bacteroidetes showed utilization capacity. The obtained data suggest a high economic potential for this Opuntia species, with potential uses such as animal feed in arid areas, precise prebiotic, and symbiotic formulations, or as the carbon skeleton source in a green refinery. Our methodology can be used to evaluate the saccharides as the phenotype of interest, helping to guide the breeding strategy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

PAAG was synthesized by homophase radical polymerization with ground amber addition. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and rheological studies were used to characterize the materials. They showed that the synthesized hydrogels have physicochemical and rheological parameters similar to those of the standard agar media. The acute toxicity of PAAG-amber was estimated based on the influence of washing water on the viability of plant seeds (pea and chickpea) and Daphnia magna. It proved its biosafety after four washes. The impact on plant rooting was studied using the propagation of Cannabis sativa on synthesized PAAG-amber and compared with agar. The developed substrate stimulated the rooting of the plants to more than 98% in comparison to standard agar medium (95%). Additionally, the use of PAAG-amber hydrogel markedly enhanced metric indicators of seedlings: root length increased by 28%, stem length—by 26.7%, root weight—by 167%, stem weight—by 67%, root and stem length—by 27%, root and stem weight—by 50%.

During planting, the distance between two successive seeds in the row depends upon the technical parameters of the planter: the type of planting unit mounted on the frame, the forward speed, and the design and the type of planting mechanism drive. The measurements were realized in the laboratory and in field conditions according to the ISO 7256/1 Standard. The field experiments were conducted on loamy-sandy loamy soil where 30% of the soil aggregates were less than 0.01 mm and the soil moisture level was 19.4%. The experiments were conducted using two types of sugar beet cultivars – Roxana (calibration 3.5-4.75 mm) and Flair (calibration 3.5-4.5 mm). The paper is focused on making a comparison between the planting quality of two types of sugar beet planters equipped with different planting mechanisms. The first machine was a planter with an internal mechanism of gathering openings and the second machine was based on the vacuum principle. A sugar beet planter equipped with an air under vacuum pressure system caused more damage to the seeds during higher forward working speeds (5.4%). In the case of the planting mechanical system, the highest degree of seed damage was caused by forward working speeds of 1.0-1.5 m s–1."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Changes within gluten-acids complexes were correlated with chemical structures of acids belonging to hydroxybenzoic (4-hydroxybenzoic, protocatechuic, vanilic, syringic) and hydroxycinnamic group (p-coumaric, caffeic, ferulic, sinapic). Analysis showed that modification of gluten by hydroxybenzoic acids resulted in appearance of aggregated structures with simultaneous formation of hydrogen bonds between polypeptide chain and acid functional groups. It suggests that hydroxybenzoic acids are located between polypeptide chains. Therefore, after interaction with protein, a significant reduction in antioxidant activity of hydroxybenzoic acids was observed. Supplementation of gluten with hydroxycinnamic acids led to formation of a greater amount of pseudo-β-sheets. These acids can incorporate into gluten network less efficiently, therefore they exhibit higher antioxidant activity in the complexes, compared to hydroxybenzoic acids. Both groups of acids led to formation of greater amount of β-turns and α-helices within gluten structure which indicates that despite the fact that dough samples were taken after dough breakdown, gluten network is not completely destroyed. Basic secondary structures (β-turns and α-helices) can be stabilized by phenolic acids."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

In this study, Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ (ETM+), and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images were used to assess the dynamics of the spatiotemporal pattern of land use/land cover (LU/LC) and land surface temperature (LST) in the metropolitan city of Mashhad, Iran in the period between 1990 and 2019. The Markov chain model (MCM) was used to predict LU/LC and LST for 2030. In the analyzed LU/LC maps, three LU/LC classes were distinguished, including built-up land (BUL), vegetated land (VL), and bare land (BL) using the maximum likelihood (ML) classification method. The collected data showed different variations in the geographical pattern of Mashhad LST during the research period that impacted the LST in this metropolis. The study evaluated the variations in LU/LC classes and evaluated their impact on the LST. The value of the LST was positively correlated with the occurrence of the built-up land (BUL), and with the bare land areas, while it was negatively correlated with the occurrence of the VL areas. The analysis of changes observed over three decades with 10-year intervals and the prediction of the LU/LC and LST for 2030 constitute an important contribution to the delineation of the dynamics of long LU/LC and LST records.

In this work, fresh broccoli was added at varying levels (10, 20, and 30%) to potato-based pellets—a half-product for expanded ready-to-eat food snacks. The obtained results showed that the assessed variables: moisture content, screw speed, and amount of added fresh broccoli, have significantly affected the extrusion-cooking process and final product physical properties. Accordingly, increasing fresh broccoli by up to 30% induced higher efficiency of the extrusion-cooking process, lower energy consumption, a lower expansion index, lower bulk density values, and proper durability. Application of fresh broccoli may also significantly reduce water consumption during processing and save energy due to the omission of the vegetable drying step. We recommend the application of up to 30% fresh broccoli in newly developed extruded snack pellet formulations. Fresh broccoli, a valuable vegetable source of health-promoting substances, may be an attractive additive in snack pellet half-products with no negative effect on processing."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091c6878c28a047388f2a","uid":"bOE3NLuQPqI27n8RXtCXxkw","uuid":"48d2cf74-d3e1-4c4a-af1f-f9b11f674f8e","name":"Katedra Techniki Cieplnej i Inżynierii Procesowej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709466878c28a0473bc359","5e709463878c28a0473bc0e4","5eec2a517523404d1000ea1f","5e709225878c28a047390a49","5e709466878c28a0473bc35d","5e709227878c28a047390af9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e7091c6878c28a047388f26","uid":"brVq5KJkWMPTyxpzHNjLrBw","uuid":"4f708f15-f7c3-4891-9d8f-3e8f78424f41","name":"Katedra Inżynierii i Maszyn Spożywczych","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709225878c28a0473909d9"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The tested wheat variety was IS Laudis and an industrial milling station with several roll sections was employed to reach 30 passages of flour streams. Each mill stream fraction was analyzed separately. Several physiochemical (moisture, ash content, falling number, wet gluten content, gluten index, and damaged starch content) and rheological properties were evaluated by means of utilizing various test apparatus and techniques. The total content of non-starch polysaccharides and arabinoxylans, as well as soluble and insoluble fractions were investigated. Results showed significant differences between the mill streams in terms of the content of physicochemical parameters and rheological properties, as well as in soluble and insoluble fractions of non-starch polysaccharides and arabinoxylans. The relationships between the tested parameters and PCA analysis can be useful for millers who can then select and blend several flour streams to obtain a maximum amount of flour with specified characteristics. A better understanding of the origin and function of different fractions and the role of arabinoxylans and their fractions in the milling process will allow the development of wheat flour blends with the desired functionality. Flours from late reduction and sizing passages (C and R) as well as from sorting filter (V) streams showed high ash content as well as T-NSP and T-AX levels, so the final content of NSP in flour blends may be balanced by the application of the proper amount of C6–C7 and R5 stream flours."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091c6878c28a047388f2a","uid":"bOE3NLuQPqI27n8RXtCXxkw","uuid":"48d2cf74-d3e1-4c4a-af1f-f9b11f674f8e","name":"Katedra Techniki Cieplnej i Inżynierii Procesowej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709225878c28a047390a49","5ffeb0d2085dcb0e357dcc83"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Such mechanisms include the movement of chloroplasts inside cells and the quenching of electronic excitations in the pigment–protein complexes. Here, we address the problem of a possible cause-and-effect relationship between these two mechanisms. Both the light-induced chloroplast movements and quenching of chlorophyll excitations were analyzed simultaneously with the application of fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, wild-type and impaired in chloroplast movements or photoprotective excitation quenching. The results show that both regulatory mechanisms operate over a relatively wide range of light intensities. By contrast, impaired chloroplast translocations have no effect on photoprotection at the molecular level, indicating the direction of information flow in the coupling of these two regulatory mechanisms: from the photosynthetic apparatus to the cellular level. The results show also that the presence of the xanthophyll zeaxanthin is necessary and sufficient for the full development of photoprotective quenching of excessive chlorophyll excitations in plants."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The extremely water-repellent variant (dry_V) showed distinct differences, expressed primarily in the number of ejected particles, which was 2.5 times higher than in the four soils with lower levels of hydrophobicity. It was also observed that as a result of the drop impact onto an extremely hydrophobic soil surface, a form known as liquid marble was created inside the crater. Soil moisture content determined the manner, scale and dynamics of the splash erosion. In the case of wet soils, the phenomenon proceeded up to five times faster, and as a result of the drop impact, a large number of fine particles were ejected, which reached nearly twice the velocities and three times the displacement distances compared to the dry soil group.

Therefore, we investigated the capacity of an innovative phosphorus biofertilizer to enhance the activity and diversity of the soil microbiome inhabiting chemically degraded soil (type Abruptic Luvisol). The two-year field experiment comprised a control treatment (FC) devoid of microbial enrichment, an optimal dose of fertilizer containing beneficial microorganisms (FA100) and a dose of fertilizer that was 40 % below this optimal level and contained microorganisms (FA60). Phosphorus biofertilizer increased soil enzymatic activity immediately after application and between the corresponding treatments in subsequent sampling times, it alleviated the effects of metabolic stress, improved phytoavailable phosphorus content and increased maize yield. Identification based on the terminal restriction fragments size revealed the presence of microorganisms important for soil health such as phosphorus solubilizers, nitrogen fixers, biological control agents, entomopathogens, mycorrhizal fungi, bioremediators and plant growth promoters. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) showed that the application of phosphorus biofertilizer changed the relative abundance of different microbial phyla, classes and orders, increased the diversity of soil microorganisms and indicated that the composition of the soil microbiome was also dependent on the sampling time. The prediction of bacterial community function using PICRUSt demonstrated that the application of biofertilizer raised the number of functional sequences associated with metabolism and cell processes, including phosphorus compound pathways. FUNGuild showed that saprotrophic and symbiotrophic fungi were more abundant in microbiologically enriched treatments. Our results proved that the phosphorus biofertilizer used offers a sustainable and promising solution to the problem of reducing traditional mineral fertilizer inputs while ensuring soil microorganism welfare and enhancing land productivity, and, what is more, it can be effectively exploited in regenerative agriculture and as a factor used to enhance resilience to climate change."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Wheat flour and potato starch have been used in the experiment and loaded into a perforated container. A steel or polypropylene measuring rod has been placed in the middle, and 5 kPa and 10 kPa were loaded, respectively. The new method is based on measuring the force through a sensor when pulling out measuring rods from the powder sample. It was shown that higher strength values have been obtained for powders loaded with 10 kPa and that groove depth has not been significant for wheat flour. Additionally, a significant difference in the evolution of the pulling force with time has been observed for wheat flour and starch, revealing a slip-stick phenomenon in the latter one. The pull-based tester is characterized by fast measurement and easy analysis of the results. The tests performed for potato starch and wheat flour have provided significantly different temporal evolutions of the pulling force."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

These relationships should be studied and recognized, as they may form the basis of future sustainable agriculture. The aim of this study was to select relevant biological indicators for monitoring soil microbial diversity by revealing characteristic differences between the mycobiomes of various soil compartments (bulk and rhizosphere) and plant niches (roots and shoots) from 13 healthy and diseased organic strawberry farms. The results of this study show that α-diversity of the mycobiome is less important in shaping plant health than fungal trophic mode composition. Healthy soil niches and roots contain less core taxa, but more differentially abundant taxa, than unhealthy ones. The results also suggest that plant health was shaped by more than just the most abundant fungal taxa, indicating that rare taxa should not be neglected in the analysis of mycobiome structure. We also demonstrate that fungal communities in the soil and plant niches from healthy strawberry farms create more stable and steady networks as compared to those from unhealthy farms. Finally, we show that the mycobiome roots-shoot axis is an important trait to consider in unhealthy plants from strawberry farms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Soil water content regression models were also created, which took into account the soil water potential ranging from 98.1 J∙m-3 to 1554249 J∙m-3. Several machine learning algorithms were tested to create models of the soil water potential and the soil water content. It occurred that reflectance characteristics of the soils exhibit a high correlation with soil moisture. Gaussian Processes (GP) model was most suitable for the estimation of the soil water content, regardless if input data contained pure reflectance spectra (R=0.82), or if they were supplemented with selected physico-chemical soil properties and soil water potential (R=0.94). No improvement of the models’ accuracies was noticed when only the selected soil physical and chemical properties were included as inputs, which suggested that the soil surface spectral data contained in themselves information, which strictly belonged to specific soil physico-chemical properties. Among classification models of the soil water potential, the LOG method had the highest percentage of correctly classified cases. More than 65% of all cases were correctly classified if the spectral data, moisture, and other properties of the tested material were included, and more than 54% when the independent variables did not include soil moisture.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the impact of the course of infection on the viability of honeybee intestine cells. Methods and Results: Intestines isolated from healthy and N. ceranae-infected honeybees were stained using two dyes, SYTO 9 and propidium iodide, and analyzed under an Axiovert 200M fluorescence microscope immediately after the isolation of the intestines. The ImageJ program was used for the quantitative analysis of the cell structure parameters. Our study demonstrated for the first time that healthy bees have a higher number of live cells in their intestines than infected bees, and that the intestines of N. ceranae-infected honeybees contain dead cells concentrated in spots. The results obtained for these two cases differed significantly, and were confirmed by statistical tests. Conclusions: The intestines of infected honeybees contain dead cells concentrated in red/dead spots, which can lead to necrotic changes, the interruption of the host’s intestinal continuity, intestinal leaking and the increased mortality of the host."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Growers must comply with several regulations in the field of food and environmental safety. In the production of apples, it has been observed that financial losses are related to the occurrence of latent storage diseases caused by phytopathogenic fungi of the genus Neofabraea (bull’s eye rot). Therefore, investors in this sector require new solutions supporting rational apple management, with a particular focus on pro-ecological methods of controlling Neofabraea sp. pathogenic representatives and methods for the early detection of these pathogens, especially when there are no symptoms of disease in the apple. This review summarizes the activities being undertaken to increase sustainable production in horticulture. What is more, the up-to-date significance of apple production and the various ways of counteracting bull’s eye rot were also described. Next, biopreparations based on microorganisms in horticulture applications are characterized, with special attention being paid to the preparations preventing the development of Neofabraea spp. The various methods used to detect fungal phytopathogens are explored towards Neofabraea spp. detection using genetic markers. Finally, expectations and future directions in the quest for new biotechnological solutions in the area of the biocontrol and molecular diagnostics of Neofabraea spp. in apples were presented. In particular, the need for targeted biocontrol biopreparations and an early detection method of Neofabraea spp. in apples to evaluate the risk of the occurrence of apple bull’s eye rot was highlighted."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"6179f6387523400564d461a2","uid":"bt0jXOafCLfe-43ix6kUpPA","uuid":"c6afa098-d817-46ca-8966-7752ef49b3ce","name":"Instytut Produkcji Ogrodniczej","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709224878c28a047390979"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

of the wet part of the soil water retention curve: a European interlaboratory comparison","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The soil water retention curve (SWRC) is a key soil property required for predicting basic hydrological processes. The SWRC is often obtained in the laboratory with non-harmonized methods. Moreover, procedures associated with each method are not standardized. This can induce a lack of reproducibility between laboratories using different methods and procedures or using the same methods with different procedures. The goal of this study was to estimate the inter- and intralaboratory variability of the measurement of the wet part (from 10 to 300 hPa) of the SWRC. An interlaboratory comparison was carried out between 14 laboratories, using artificially constructed, porous reference samples that were transferred between laboratories according to a statistical design. The retention measurements were modelled by a series of linear mixed models using a Bayesian approach. This allowed the detection of sample-to-sample variability, interlaboratory variability, intralaboratory variability and the effects of sample changes between measurements. The greatest portion of the differences in the measurement of SWRCs was due to interlaboratory variability. The intralaboratory variability was highly variable depending on the laboratory. Some laboratories successfully reproduced the same SWRC on the same sample, while others did not. The mean intralaboratory variability over all laboratories was smaller than the mean interlaboratory variability. A possible explanation for these results is that all laboratories used slightly different methods and procedures. We believe that this result may be of great importance regarding the quality of SWRC databases built by pooling SWRCs obtained in different laboratories. The quality of pedotransfer functions or maps that might be derived is probably hampered by this inter- and intralaboratory variability. The way forward is that measurement procedures of the SWRC need to be harmonized and standardized."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The addition of the polysaccharides to the bacterial growth environment changed the composition of the films by incorporating characteristic monosaccharides. BC-based films contained up to 26.7 % of non-cellulosic polysaccharides. The applied modification had a clear impact on water sorption and caused a decrease in the thermal stability of most BC films, which was connected with the depletion of geometrical dimensions of cellulose nanofibers observed with AFM. The FT-IR and Raman spectra demonstrated a decrease in % Iα of cellulose films, most notably for xyloglucan and glucomannan, as well as a change in their degree of crystallinity and the length of cellulose chains.

In this study the effect of short-term oxidative stress conditions on the physiology of apple fruit was investigated. Apple fruit of three cultivars were exposed to hypoxic storage conditions of various lengths to induce anaerobiosis. The response of apple fruit to short-term oxidative stress was evaluated by means of cell wall immunolabeling and atomic force microscopy. In addition, the antioxidant capacity and antioxidative activity of apple peels was assessed. Through various techniques, it was shown that short-term oxidative stress conditions promote specific enzymatic activity that induces changes in the cell wall of apple fruit cells. Exposure to short-term stress resulted in the remodeling of cell wall pectic polysaccharides, observed as an increase in the size and complexity of extracted oxalate pectin. Structural changes in the cell wall were followed by an increase in Young’s modulus (compressive stiffness of a solid material, expressed as the relationship between stress and axial strain) of the cell wall material. The data presented in this paper show in a novel way how storage under short-term oxidative stress modifies the cell wall of apple fruit at the molecular level."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398355"],"parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

During maize growing season water reserves were assessed based on the climatic water balance. The optimum precipitation for every month of the maize growing season was determined by means of the method offered by Klatt. Precipitation deficits and excess were calculated on the basis of the average monthly air temperatures and monthly atmospheric precipitation totals for moderately firm soils. The trends method with linear regression equations was applied in order to determine changes in the examined parameters. In central-eastern Poland, during the maize growing seasons in 2001-2021, water deficits were most frequent in May (on average 12 events occurred throughout the study period). The highest values for the precipitation deficits occurred in the Pułtusk area. The average deficit from May to September was 135 mm. Maize water demand was most satisfactorily met in the Terespol area.

The addition of TP and PB influenced the farinograph characteristics, increasing water absorption, dough development, and softening while reducing stability time. However, the changes in bread quality, including baking yield, loss, volume, and crumb porosity, were not significant. The texture properties, such as hardness, chewiness, and cohesiveness of the crumb, showed no significant changes within the supplemented levels up to 9%. Additionally, the TP and PB had a significant impact on the color of the bread crumb, increasing redness and yellowness, particularly with PB. Fortification with TP and PB up to 9% resulted in baking characteristics comparable to 100% wheat bread. The addition of TP and PB changed nutrient content, particularly dietary fiber, without significantly altering the caloric value of the bread. However, semi-consumer sensory evaluation indicated a decrease in aroma and taste when PB exceeded 9%, and a similar effect on taste was indicated when TP exceeded 9%. In conclusion, TP and PB at supplementation levels up to 9% can enhance the nutritional profile of bread and maintain its baking quality."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"6179f6ea7523400564d488c1","uid":"bMeHbWYmcGScDrE5DejBGnA","uuid":"07bc5a05-7652-4ed5-ae2b-dd5f13a6ae3b","name":"Katedra Technologii Żywności Pochodzenia Roślinnego i Gastronomii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709225878c28a047390a52","5e70925e878c28a0473948a6","5e7093d8878c28a0473b1d8e","61cbd6397523401fc10d790c"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e7091c6878c28a047388f23","uid":"bOkbuBOL5N6cFVjxnMZg_FA","uuid":"8d34b156-a076-4b5e-aa68-918736926999","name":"Katedra Biologicznych Podstaw Technologii Żywności i Pasz","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70941c878c28a0473b679e"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

These devices mimic the mammalian olfactory sense, comprising an array of multiple non-specific gas sensors. An array of sensors creates a unique set of signals called a “gas fingerprint”, which enables it to differentiate between the analyzed samples of gas mixtures. However, appropriate advanced analyses of multidimensional data need to be conducted for this purpose. The failures of the wastewater treatment process are directly connected to the odor nuisance of bioreactors and are reflected in the level of pollution indicators. Thus, it can be assumed that using the appropriately selected methods of data analysis from a gas sensors array, it will be possible to distinguish and classify the operating states of bioreactors (i.e., phases of normal operation), as well as the occurrence of malfunction. This work focuses on developing a complete protocol for analyzing and interpreting multidimensional data from a gas sensor array measuring the properties of the air headspace in a bioreactor. These methods include dimensionality reduction and visualization in two-dimensional space using the principal component analysis (PCA) method, application of data clustering using an unsupervised method by Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, and at the last stage, application of extra trees as a supervised machine learning method to achieve the best possible accuracy and precision in data classification."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

A beneficial way of managing sunflower waste biomass could be its use as a feedstock for biochar production. Biochar is currently being considered as an additive for improving soil parameters, including the ability to oxidise methane (CH4) – one of the key greenhouse gases (GHG). Despite the high production of sunflower husk, there is still insufficient information on the impact of sunflower husk biochar on the soil environment, especially on the methanotrophy process. To fill this knowledge gap, an experiment was designed to evaluate the effects of addition of sunflower husk biochar (produced at 450–550 °C) at a wide range of doses (1–100 Mg ha−1) to Haplic Luvisol. In the presented study, the CH4 oxidation potential of soil with and without sunflower husk biochar was investigated at 60 and 100% water holding capacity (WHC), and with the addition of 1% CH4 (v/v). The comprehensive study included GHG exchange (CH4 and CO2), physicochemical properties of soil (pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrate nitrogen (NO3−-N), WHC), and the structure of soil microbial communities. That study showed that even low biochar doses (5 and 10 Mg ha−1) were sufficient to enhance pH, SOC, DOC and NO3−-N content. Importantly, sunflower husk biochar was significant source of NO3−-N, which soil concentration increased from 9.40 ± 0.09 mg NO3−-N kg−1 for the control to even 19.40 ± 0.26 mg NO3−-N kg−1 (for 100 Mg ha−1). Significant improvement of WHC (by 11.0–12.4%) was observed after biochar addition at doses of 60 Mg ha−1 and higher. At 60% WHC, application of biochar at a dose of 40 Mg ha−1 brought significant improvements in CH4 oxidation rate, which was 4.89 ± 0.37 mg CH4–C kg−1 d−1. Higher biochar doses were correlated with further improvement of CH4 oxidation rates, which at 100 Mg ha−1 was seventeen-fold higher (8.36 ± 0.84 mg CH4–C kg−1 d−1) than in the biochar-free control (0.48 ± 0.28 mg CH4–C kg−1 d−1). CO2 emissions were not proportional to biochar doses and only grew circa (ca.) twofold from 3.16 to 6.90 mg CO2–C kg−1 d−1 at 100 Mg ha−1. Above 60 Mg ha−1, the diversity of methanotrophic communities increased, with Methylobacter becoming the most abundant genus, which was as high as 7.45%. This is the first, such advanced and multifaceted study of the wide range of sunflower husk biochar doses on Haplic Luvisol. The positive correlation between soil conditions, methanotroph abundance and CH4 oxidation confirmed the multifaceted, positive effect of sunflower husk biochar on Haplic Luvisol.

The promotion of biomaterials synthesis could potentially lead to the replacement of synthetic products and improve soil fertility, protect plants from pathogen attacks, and enhance the productivity of the agricultural sector resulting in less environmental pollution. Microbial bioengineering involving the use and improvement of encapsulation using polysaccharides has the required potential to address environmental issues and promote green chemistry. This article describes various encapsulation techniques and polysaccharides which have an immense applicable capability to encapsulate microbial cells. The review elucidates the factors that may result in a reduced viable cell count during encapsulation, particularly using the spray drying method, where a high temperature is required to dry the suspension, this may damage the microbial cells. The environmental advantage of the application of polysaccharides as carriers of beneficial microorganisms, which do not pose a risk for soil due to their full biodegradability, was also shown. The encapsulated microbial cells may assist in addressing certain environmental problems such as ameliorating the unfavourable effects of plant pests and pathogens, and promoting agricultural sustainability."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Nitrogen deficiency causes a significant decrease in chlorophyll concentration in plant leaves regardless of water availability. Five different classification algorithms were used to discriminate between nitrogen concentrations in plants at different levels of water availability. Several statistical parameters, including kappa and overall classification accuracy for calibration and prediction, were used to determine the efficiency and accuracy of the models. The Random Forest model had the highest overall accuracy of over 81% for sugar beet and over 78% for celery. Additionally, characteristic electromagnetic wavelengths were identified in which reflectance correlated with nitrogen and water content in plants could be recorded.

In this study, the contents of organic N and C fractions in soils obtained using acid and alkaline hydrolysis under two crop rotations (faba bean vs. wheat rotation) were investigated. Black fallow served as a control. The mean total N increased in the order: black fallow, wheat rotation, faba bean rotation, total C and SOM were higher in the cropped soils than in black fallow. Hydrolysable-N (1-step acid hydrolysis) reached 83.7% total N, amino acid-N and threonine+serine-N were the highest in faba bean rotation and the lowest in black fallow, ammonia-N and aminosugar-N were lower in black fallow than in cropped soils. Hydrolysable-N (2-step sequential fractionation) reached 85.3% total N and significant differ­ences were noted between the cropped soils and black fallow, with respect to both the N and C contents. 15N was mainly accumulated in the N soluble and easily hydrolysable N compounds, and these fractions were greater in cropped soils than in black fallow. N in the humic com­pounds increased from black fallow to faba bean rotation. A PCA analysis showed that crop rotation and soil sampling terms had a substantial influence over cluster formation. An ANOSIM test revealed significant dif­ferences between the crop rotation and term treatments. The results indicated that soil with faba bean rotation is richer in N compounds than soil with wheat as a forecrop and this may result in a reduction in N fertilizers for the succeeding crop."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","uid":"bz_6XXECFL3_CFkpms5BsDQ","uuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","name":"Uniwersytet w Siedlcach","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709294878c28a047398496","5e70945e878c28a0473bba14","5e709294878c28a047398505","5e7091f7878c28a04738dc32"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","parentUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","rootUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Plasticizers of the BC fibre network allow to reduce its brittleness and improve flexibility by reducing the intermolecular forces and increasing the chain mobility, while the opposite effect was observed for the antiplasticizing additives. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of hemicellulose addition on the elasto-plastic response of BC-hemicellulose composite films depending on the specific type of hemicellulose and its concentration. BC-hemicellulose composite films were produced by K.xylinum bacteria strain in the hemicellulose-modified medium. The presence of xylan and arabinoxylan in the culturing medium resulted in an increase in the plastic deformation of the composite films, its maximum stress and maximum strain, which was opposite to the effects of glucomannan and xyloglucan. Spectral studies revealed that the deformation of the hemicellulose polysaccharides played a minor role in opposing of applied loads. The contribution of the hydrogen bond network in opposing of applied loads was comparable to that of the glycosidic bonds. Stretching vibrations of the structural bonds of BC-hemicellulose composite films determined elastic deformation most, compared to other bonds."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

However, this is not straightforward, as each strain sometimes behaves differently under the experimental conditions adopted. To analyse the trophic overlap of two species, it is necessary to refine diagnostic techniques and exclude variables that may interfere with the measurements. A protocol for establishing the suitability of chromogenic dyes in the analysis of filamentous fungi with phenotype microarrays is described here. The research goal was to determine the most suitable redox dye indicator and its optimal concentration that reacts quantitatively to the respiratory activity of both Verticillium spp. and Trichoderma spp. isolates in the presence of a nitrogen source. The commercial BiologTM Redox Dye Mixes D, E, and F and also TTC (2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride), INT (2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyl-2H-tetrazolium chloride), and MTT solutions were evaluated in selected concentrations. Both their nutritive and toxic effects were quantified. Results showed that 1% “F” and 0.5% “D” BiologTM dyes were appropriate for the functional evaluation of isolates belonging to the Verticillium and Trichoderma genera. They can be used in BiologTM PM-nitrogen plate respiratory assays for a comprehensive functional characterisation of these organisms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

In contrast, leukemic cells cannot synthesize L-asparagine due the absence of L-asparagine synthetase and should obtain it from circulating sources for protein synthesis and cell division processes to ensure their vital functions. L-ASP catalyzes the deamination process of L-asparagine amino-acid into aspartic acid and ammonia, depriving leukemic cells of asparagine. This leads to decreased protein synthesis and cell division in tumor cells. However, using L-ASP has side effects, such as hypersensitivity or allergic reaction, antigenicity, short half-life, temporary blood clearance, and toxicity. L-ASP immobilization can minimize the side effects of L-ASP by stopping the immune system from attacking non-human enzymes and improving the enzyme's performance. The first strategy includes modification of enzyme structure, such as covalent binding (conjugation), adsorption to the support material and cross-linking of the enzyme. The chemical modification of residues, often nonspecific, changes the enzyme's hydrophobicity and surface charge, lowering the enzyme's activity. Also, the first strategy exposes the enzyme's surface to the environment. This eliminates its performance and does not allow targeted delivery of the enzyme. The second strategy is based on the entrapment of the enzyme inside the protecting structure or encapsulation. This strategy offers the same benefits as the first. Still, it also enables reducing toxicity, prolonging in vivo half-life, enhancing stability and activity, enables a targeted delivery and controlled release of the enzyme. Compared to the first strategy, encapsulation does not modify the chemical structure of the enzyme since L-ASP is only effective against leukemia in its native tetrameric form. This review aims to present state of the art in L-ASP formulations developed for reducing the side effects of L-ASP, focusing on describing improvements in their safety. The primary focus in the field remains to be improving the overall performance of the L-ASP formulations. Almost all encapsulation systems allow reducing immune response due to screening the enzyme from antibodies and prolonging its half-life. However, the enzyme's activity and stability depend on the encapsulation system type. Therefore, the selection of the right encapsulation system is crucial in therapy due to its effect on the performance parameters of the L-ASP. Biodegradable and biocompatible materials, such as chitosan, alginate and liposomes, mainly attract the researcher's interest in enzyme encapsulation. The research trends are also moving towards developing formulations with targeted delivery and increased selectivity."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

AGPs demonstrate structural diversity due to the presence of a protein domain and an expanded carbohydrate moiety. Considering their molecular structure, the modification of glycosylation is a primary factor contributing to the functional variety of AGPs.\nMain body\n\nImmunocytochemical methods are used for qualitative and quantitative analyses of AGPs in fruit tissues. These include in situ techniques such as immunofluorescence and immunogold labelling for visualising AGP distribution at different cellular levels and ex situ methods such as Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunoenzymatic assays (ELISA) for molecular characterisation and quantitative detection of isolated AGPs. The presented techniques were modified by considering the structure of AGPs and the changes that occur in fruit tissues during the development and ripening processes. These methods are based on antibodies that recognise carbohydrate chains, which are the only commercially available highly AGP-specific tools. These probes recognise AGP epitopes and identify structural modifications and changes in spatio-temporal distribution, shedding light on their functions in fruit.\nConclusion\n\nThis paper provides a concise overview of AGP research methods, emphasising their use in fruit tissue analysis and demonstrating the accessibility gaps in other tools used in such research (e.g. antibodies against protein moieties). It underscores fruit tissue as a valuable source of AGPs and emphasises the potential for future research to understand of AGP synthesis, degradation, and their roles in various physiological processes. Moreover, the application of advanced probes for AGP visualisation is a milestone in obtaining more detailed insights into the localisation and function of these proteins within fruit."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

In this work, a new approach to the synthesis of such solids using an environmentally friendly, two-step preparation method is presented. A series of hybrid porous silica-containing carbon composites was synthesized, namely: metal free (C/SiO2), enriched with manganese (C/Mn/SiO2), as well as iron (C/Fe/SiO2). The effect of additives on the structure and morphology of the composites was evaluated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), nitrogen adsorption/desorption and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The as-synthesized carbons were used as effective adsorbents for the simultaneous removal of heavy metals, including lead (Pb(II)) and zinc (Zn(II)) ions. In particular, it was determined that C/Mn/SiO2 sample demonstrated the highest adsorption capacity towards Pb(II) and Zn(II) ions. It was equal to 211.60 mg/g for Pb(II) and 74.95 mg/g for Zn(II). Zeta potential and surface charge density of the solids, with and without metals, were investigated to determine electrical double layer structure, whereas stability studies and aggregate size measurements were performed to estimate solid aggregation under selected conditions. It was established that solids with adsorbed metals formed suspensions with lower stability than those without ions. This, in turn, facilitates their separation from aqueous solutions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The methanotrophic enrichment culture was predominantly composed of methanotrophs from the genera Methylomonas (48.848%) and Methylomicrobium (15.636%) with methane oxidation rates from 3.353 ± 0.105 to 4.200 ± 0.505 µmol CH4 mL−1 day−1."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","uid":"boRt8XbJIJxFX3j3lPkVVng","uuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","name":"Instytut Uprawy Nawożenia i Gleboznawstwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6654","5e70929f878c28a04739964b"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","parentUuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","rootUuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

We tested the rapid response of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in fertilized soil to biochar addition under the freeze-thaw cycle. The soil (at a moisture of 55% water holding capacity) was enriched with biochar at a rate of 20 t ha-1, frozen at -20°C for 12 h and thawed at 20°C. The control was soil without biochar and with biochar incubated at temperature of 20°C. Unfrozen soil was a CO2 and N2O source and a weak sink for CH4. The GHG fluxes were not significantly altered by biochar, although biochar-treated soil emitted CH4. The frozen soil emitted all the tested GHGs during the thawing period. A pulse of CO2 and CH4 emissions (and N2O in soil with biochar) occurred in the period of rapid temperature growth, while GHG fluxes reached levels similar to unfrozen soil after temperature stabilization at 20°C. In frozen soil, the addition of biochar significantly increased the CH4 and N2O peak only in the first phase of thawing with a dynamic temperature growth. Biochar changed microbial parameters, therefore we assume that both physical and biological mechanisms could be responsible for GHG emissions in frozen soils."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

It greatly diversifies the experimental results and shadows individual effects of organic amendments. Therefore, to look for a clearer view, we examined the impact of HCl-washed clay-size organic species: peat, humic acids, residue after humic acid extraction, and two biochars, all derived from the same peat and having similar particles, on the structure and strength of artificial soil silt aggregates using mercury intrusion porosimetry, bulk density measurements, SEM, and uniaxial compression. Bulk density increased due to humic acid addition and decreased for the other amendments. The total pore volumes behaved oppositely. All organic substances except humic acid decreased the pore surface fractal dimension, indicating a smoothening of the pore surface. Humic acid appeared to occupy mostly the spaces between the silt grains skeleton, while the other species were also located upon silt grains. The latter effect was most evident for 600 °C heated biochar. Humic acid, peat, and the residue after humic acid extraction improved mechanical stability, whereas both biochars weakened the aggregates, which means that bulk density plays a smaller role in the mechanical stability of granular materials, as it is usually considered. A new equation relating maximum stress and the amount of the organic additives was proposed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Modern agriculture does not only take into account soil moisture measurements obtained once at selected points in the field, but also focuses on moisture monitoring. Knowledge of the variability over time and analysis of the variation in readings caused by heavy rainfall or strong sunshine and high soil temperature changes is very important for future modelling, prediction and automated irrigation. The aim of this paper is to present a developed soil moisture monitoring system for a soil profile up to 34 cm depth incorporating Internet of Things technologies. The system was built based on an eight-channel time domain reflectometer to measure soil moisture based on dielectric properties. The developed system integrates both dielectric moisture measurement and innovative web-based server and visualisation services. The autonomous station was equipped with a long-range wireless communication and a solar-charged battery. Analysis of the results enabled us to observe the subtle deviations of moisture content of the upper soil layer during diurnal cycles. The designed station can be used in the future to integrate a high accuracy automatic field irrigation system and acquire data for precision agriculture."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Gliadins and glutenins were extracted from gluten samples obtained from overmixed dough. The changes in the gliadin secondary structure depended on the amount of phenolic acid added to the dough. Higher acid concentrations (0.1% and 0.2%) led to a significant reduction in the amount of α-helices and to the formation of aggregates, non-ordered secondary structures, and antiparallel β-sheets. After the addition of acids at a lower concentration (0.05%), the disaggregation of pseudo-β-sheet structures and the formation of β-turns, hydrogen-bonded β-turns, and antiparallel β-sheets were detected. In the case of glutenin, most of the phenolic acids induced the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the polypeptide chains, leading to glutenin aggregation. When phenolic acids were added at a concentration of 0.05%, the process of protein folding and regular secondary structure formation was also observed.

Aside from being a significant economic issue, it is a concern in terms of health issue, quality and consumer rights. As food fraud methods have become more sophisticated, due to complexity of fraudulent practices, highly efficient and reliable adulteration detection techniques are needed. In many food fraud detection methods, sample preparation and analysis involve detailed steps that require advanced technologies, making the process tedious and time-consuming. Therefore, the development of non-destructive and rapid methods for detecting food fraud has attracted considerable attention. Recently, electronic nose (e-nose) systems have evolved to detect adulteration of food products reliably and quickly. E-nose detects VOC in a samples and create unique fingerprint, which can be analyzed using chemometrics to identify fraud in foods. This review aims to provide a brief overview of e-nose systems, chemometrics methods, and their application to the detection of adulteration in plant and animal products based on review articles. As fraud in the food industry increases, more research is needed to protect consumers from health risks and producers from economic loss. Therefore, this paper discusses the challagens associated with using e-nose technology for detecting food fraud."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

For more than three decades, researchers have been studying the factors that produce and influence the aroma of rice. An electronic nose can be used to detect the volatile compounds of rice, while an olfactory machine is capable of classifying and detecting the variety, origin, and storage time of rice with a high degree of efficiency. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of electronic noses and other chemometric methods such as principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and the Artificial Neural Network as a cost-effective, rapid, and non-destructive method for the detection of pure and adulterated rice varieties. Therefore, an electronic nose equipped with nine metal oxide semiconductor sensors with low power consumption was used. The results showed that the amount of variance accounted for by PC1 and PC4 was 98% for the samples used. Also, the classification accuracy of the linear discriminant analysis and Artificial Neural Network methods were 100%, respectively. The Support Vector Machines method (including Nu-SVM and C-SVM) was also used, which, in all its functions except the polynomial function, produced 100% accuracy in terms of training and validation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

In the current study, silicon nanoparticles are used to mitigate the harmful effects of root rot disease caused by Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn on the growth of A. sativa. In vitro (Petri plates) and in vivo (pots experiment) were performed to measure the various physiological and biochemical parameters i.e. osmotic potential, chlorophyll, proline content, growth parameters, sugar, fresh and dry weight, and disease index. Results revealed that physiological and biochemical parameters were reduced under fungal stress with silicon nanoparticles treatment as compared to the control group. Si nanoparticles helped to alleviate the negative effects caused by fungus i.e. germination percentage upto 80%, germination rate 4 n/d, radical and plumule length was 4.02 and 5.46, dry weight 0.08 g, and relative water content was (50.3%) increased. Fungus + Si treatment showed the maximum protein content, i.e. 1.2 µg/g as compared to Fungus (0.3 µg/g) treated group. The DI was maximum (78.82%) when the fungus directly attacked the target plant and DI reduced (44.2%) when the fungus was treated with Si nanoparticles. Thus, silicon nanoparticles were potentially effective against the stress of R. solani and also used to analyze the plant resistance against fungal diseases. These particles can use as silicon fertilizers, but further studies on their efficacy under field conditions and improvement in their synthesis are still needed."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The influence of different crosslinking agents on the structure and functional properties of the obtained films was investigated. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetry (TG), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and polarized light microscopy (POM) analyses showed the key importance of the crosslinking agent on the chemical interactions between the individual components of system. A series of phase transitions related to the melting of lipid fractions have been observed, which occur in a cascade with increasing temperature. Thermomechanical analysis (TMA) indicated that the obtained samples show a rapid change in dimensions as a function of temperature. Measurements of the impedance spectroscopy demonstrated that foil’s electrical parameters change as a function of temperature. Both shape and conductivity changes are related to processes occurring in the pectin-glycerol-lipid system. It was found that the pectin glass transition, lower critical solution temperature (LCST) and lipid melting had the most pronounced effect on the operational properties. Taking into account the obtained results, the developed apple foils may have potential applications as thermosensitive smart materials for example in active packaging as sensing materials."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922e878c28a047391386"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Microalgal cell wall and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are known to interact with As, but their roles in the As resistance, accumulation and speciation in microalgae remain unclear. Here, we used two strains of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, namely CC-125 (wild type) and CC-503 (cell wall-deficient mutant), to examine the algal growth, EPS synthesis, As adsorption, absorption and transformation under 10–1000 µg/L As(III) and As(V) treatments for 96 h. In both strains, the As absorption increased after the EPS removal, but the growth, As adsorption, and transformation of C. reinhardtii declined. The CC-125 strain was more tolerant to As stress and more efficient in EPS production, As accumulation, and redox transformation than CC-503, irrespective of EPS presence or absence. Three-dimension excitation-emission matrix (3D-EEM) and attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) analyses showed that As was bound with functional groups in the EPS and cell wall, such as -COOH, NH and -OH in proteins, polysaccharides and amino acids. Together, this study demonstrated that EPS and cell wall acted as barriers to lower the As uptake by C. reinhardtii. However, the cell wall mutant strain was more susceptible to As toxicity due to lower EPS induction and higher As absorption."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The primary objective of this study is to map flood hazards and evaluate habitat suitability within the Mond Protected Area (MPA), near the Mond River. This region is particularly important as it serves as a habitat for the vulnerable gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa). Through field surveys and information gathering, the study examines the effects of flooding on the mortality, distribution, and abundance of this gazelle population.The MaxEnt approach was used to assess habitat suitability, while flood hazard zoning was conducted using the HEC-RAS model. Field studies and the resulting flood hazard map identified three specific locations \"Barid,\" \"Rudbor,\" and \"Cham Sheikh\" where floodwaters infiltrate the protected area. This infiltration is attributed to riverbank erosion and the absence of protective vegetation in the above areas. The extreme flood on March 20, 2017, significantly increased gazelle mortality rates.By analyzing the maps integrating flood zoning, gazelle distribution, and population aggregation within the MPA, along with field surveys, practical and significant operational measures to enhance the gazelle habitat have been identified. One key measure includes establishing low-elevation platforms in areas where gazelles congregate.

Therefore, the main goal of this study is to comprehensively identify circulation patterns during the occurrence of the summertime Extended Area Precipitation Event (EAPE) in southeastern Iran. The data used in this study encompass precipitation rates from synoptic and rain gauge stations, Geopotential Height (GPH), omega (upward motion speed), u-wind (east-west), and v-wind (north-south) components at different atmospheric levels, along with satellite images from the visible spectrum. In this research, both subjective and objective clustering methods have been utilized to identify synoptic circulation patterns based on 500-hPa GPH data. Summer precipitation was chosen for analysis because its characteristics and relationships with large-scale circulation patterns are less understood compared to those of winter precipitation. Examination of the 500-hPa GPH data for sixty-two identified cases of EAPE over southeast Iran revealed that the causative factors for these events are comprised of five recurring patterns (referred to here for convenience as AP, BP, CP, DP, and EP). Three of these patterns (AP, BP, and DP) significantly contributed to 71% of all EAPE cases. It was evident that the five patterns responsible for creating the EAPE in southeastern Iran had distinct directions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The frequently measured small surface areas of biochars contrast with their high sorption and cation exchange capacities. We hypothesised that water adsorption provides a better tool for estimating the surface area of biochars. Although adsorption energy also appears to be a valuable surface characteristic, there is a lack of studies on this subject. We studied the surface areas and adsorption energies of three waste deposits – peat, willow dust and biochar prepared from these materials at different temperatures – using nitrogen and water vapour adsorption isotherms. The BET model accurately described all water vapour adsorption isotherms but failed for some nitrogen isotherms. Alternative methods for estimating surface areas and adsorption energies were proposed in cases where the BET model did not apply. Nitrogen adsorption was typically much lower than water vapour adsorption, and the estimated surface areas reflected this. However, nitrogen adsorption energies were significantly higher.

The variations in the normalized difference vegetation index, precipitation, and temperature over 22 years (2001-2022) were analyzed annually, seasonally, and monthly using remote sensing data. The relationship between normalized difference vegetation index changes and precipitation and temperature was evaluated using Kendall’s correlation. The findings reveal a significant correlation between vegetation, surface temperature, and precipitation in the Yangtze river basin. Additionally, a significant (at p-value = 0.05) downward trend of vegetation coverage in the entire basin was observed for the classes between 0.2 and 0.5 (indicating poor and moderate vegetation). Conversely, a significant (at p-value = 0.05) upward trend in the area covered by denser vegetation (normalized difference vegetation index exceeding 0.5) was observed during the studied period in the Yangtze river basin. The largest vegetation coverage area was observed in middle basin, while the lowest values were seen in upper basin in 2008, middle basin in 2001, and lower basin in 2005. The highest vegetation coverage area in all three basins was recorded in 2021. In general, a significant (at p-value = 0.01) upward trend in vegetation coverage was observed in all three basins between 2001 and 2022. Finally, the results demonstrate that temperature exhibits a stronger correlation with increased vegetation cover in the Yangtze river basin, compared to precipitation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Using size exclusion chromatography cRG-I was fractionated and pooled in fractions (PF1–6). All fractions contained the same RG-I monosaccharides and similar glycosidic linkages although in varying relative amounts. The main differences were in rhamnose substitution, arabinan- and galactan side chain length and in levels of acetylation and methyl esterification. Atomic force microscopy showed either spheric or elongated structures for cRG-I and its derived fractions. To gain insight in the structure-function relationship of cRG-I, the immunomodulatory effect of the six fractions and their saponified derivatives was assessed in vitro. All fractions, except PF2, dose-dependently stimulated TNFα, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8 and IL-10 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of three healthy donors. Cytokine levels were largely influenced by the Mw and degree of esterification of the individual fractions. Notably, the highest Mw fraction (100 kDa) displayed the most potent activity, which was strongly reduced after the removal of ester residues by saponification.

Understanding pathological processes occurring in dental tissues and their reactions to various substances, including dental materials, are crucial for the development of new dental technologies.\n\nThe aim of the study was to check the similarities in the chemical and morphological structure of enamel and dentine powders in various groups of permanent teeth, as well as differential chemical analysis for both grinded tissues tested.\n\nThe extracted non-carious and non-pathological human permanent teeth were divided into four groups: incisors, canines, premolars and molars. Each tooth was sectioned to thick slices. Enamel and dentine were mechanically separated and ground in an agate mortar and pestle. FT-Raman and FTIR spectroscopy methods were used for the analysis of biological tissues. SEM method was applied to visualise hard dental tissues structures present on the surface and within the particles.\n\nThe morphological structures were the same within the analysed tissues and did not depend on the analysed group of teeth. A comparison of the mineral-to-organic ratios of enamel and dentine in each tooth group showed that the bands related to PO43- were clearly higher in content for enamel than for dentine. Higher absorbance measured at the region of 2800–3700 cm−1 and at 1500–1800 cm−1 for dentine as compared to enamel samples were indicative of a higher content of organic structures. The highest contribution of phosphates was in canine enamel samples.The studies showed that the carbonate-to-phosphate ratio was higher for dentine (0.20 - 0.48) compared to the values obtained for enamel (0.13 - 0.22), however, minor differences were found in each group of enamel or dentine samples.\n\nThe lack of significant differences between the enamel and dentine powders of incisors, canines, premolars and molars may prove that each extracted tooth, regardless of the tooth group, is an excellent substrate for their substitution."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The diluted alkali-soluble pectin (DASP) fractions that result from the stepwise extraction of apples and carrots were studied to evaluate their structural and rheological properties. Homogalacturonan and rhamnogalacturonan I, in different proportions, were the main pectin domains that composed DASP from both materials. Atomic force microscopy revealed that the molecules of apple DASP were longer and more branched. A persistence length greater than 40 nm indicated that the pectin molecules deposited on mica behaved as stiff molecules. The weight-averaged molar mass was similar for both samples. Intrinsic viscosity values of 194.91 mL·g−1 and 186.79 mL·g−1 were obtained for apple and carrot DASP, respectively. Rheological measurements showed greater structural strength for apple-extracted pectin, whereas carrot pectin was characterized by a higher linear viscoelasticity limit.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to determine changes in the secondary structure of the individual gluten network proteins: gliadins and glutenins, after addition of selected phenolic acids to the model dough. Phenolic acids were added to the model dough at the following concentrations: 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2% (w/w). The phenolic acids induce changes in the secondary structure of the gliadins and glutenins. The degree of interaction depends on the structure and concentration of the added phenolic acid. In most cases, these interactions lead to the formation of disordered structures in both gliadins and glutenins. From the results obtained, it can be concluded that the inclusion of certain phenolic acids in the dough affects the hydrogen bonding in gliadins and glutenin, and that phenolic acids interact non-covalently with these gluten proteins. The findings could potentially be applied to food chemistry and may have an impact on the allergenic properties of gluten, particularly in relation to the reduction of the β-turn content within glutenins."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The use of a ground-installed passive L-band radiometer ELBARA at the Bubnów-Sęków test site in the east of Poland gave a possibility to provide reference soil moisture data from the area with a radius of 100 m. In addition, the test site comprised three different land cover types that could be investigated continuously with one day resolution. The studies were focused on the evaluation of the ω-τ model coefficients for three types of land cover, including meadow, wetland, and cropland, to allow for the assessment of the soil moisture retrievals at a medium scale. Consequently, a set of reference time-dependent coefficients of effective scattering albedo, optical depth, and constant-in-time roughness parameters were estimated. The mean annual values of the effective scattering albedo including two polarisations were 0.45, 0.26, 0.14, and 0.54 for the meadow with lower organic matter, the meadow with higher organic matter, the wetland, and the cropland, respectively. The values of optical depth were in the range from 0.30 to 0.80 for the cropland, from 0.40 to 0.52 for the meadows (including the two investigated meadows), and from 0.60 to 0.70 for the wetland.

The impact of the initial mixture ingredients on the structural and textural properties of bentonite-coal sorbents (BCSs) has been studied using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, optical microscopy, and nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis. For determining the sorption capacity of BCSs, a standard model substance methylene blue (MB), was applied. It was revealed that the maximum adsorption amount of MB was 5.3 mg∙g−1 during 2 h of contact. Prolonging the contact time to 24 h allowed for more extensive diffusion of dye molecules into the sorbent’s pores, increasing the adsorption capacity to 13 mg∙g−1. It was demonstrated that BCSs could be regenerated by strong oxidizing agents such as sulfuric acid and hydrogen peroxide, with sulfuric acid proving more effective. Regeneration fully restores sorption properties, particularly at low dye concentrations (up to 0.2 mg∙ml−1). Despite slight reductions in adsorption capacity over multiple regeneration cycles, the sorbents maintain their structural integrity and durability. It is shown that compared to imported expensive activated carbon, the gross profitability of the in-house production of such granular BCSs within the territory of Uzbekistan increases from 48 to 78%, while the net income increases almost three times."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The aim of the work was to identify cell wall components that are related to the response to low oxygen conditions in fruit and to determine the effects of such conditions on the ripening process. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruits at different stages of the ripening process were stored in an anoxic and hypoxic environment, at 0% and 5% oxygen concentrations, respectively. We used comprehensive and comparative methods: from microscopic immunolabelling and estimation of enzymatic activities to detailed molecular approaches. Changes in the composition of extensin, arabinogalactan proteins, rhamnogalacturonan-I, low methyl-esterified homogalacturonan, and high methyl-esterified homogalacturonan were analysed.\nResults\n\nIn-depth molecular analyses showed that low oxygen stress affected the cell wall composition, i.e. changes in protein content, a significantly modified in situ distribution of low methyl-esterified homogalacturonan, appearance of callose deposits, disturbed native activities of β-1,3-glucanase, endo-β-1,4-glucanase, and guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), and disruptions in molecular parameters of single cell wall components. Taken together, the data obtained indicate that less significant changes were observed in fruit in the breaker stage than in the case of the red ripe stage. The first symptoms of changes were noted after 24 h, but only after 72 h, more crucial deviations were visible. The 5% oxygen concentration slows down the ripening process and 0% oxygen accelerates the changes taking place during ripening.\nConclusions\n\nThe observed molecular reset occurring in tomato cell walls in hypoxic and anoxic conditions seems to be a result of regulatory and protective mechanisms modulating ripening processes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

However, a critical question that remains inadequately addressed is whether fungal necromass can be utilized to offset the effects of warming on plant nutrient demand, helping to sustain plant growth in changing climates. In this study, two maize varieties, including a wild-type and root-hair-defective rth3 mutant, were grown in phosphorus (P) deficient soil at temperatures of 20 °C and 30 °C to detect the mechanisms driving the fungal necromass turnover under warming effects and plant root genotypes. By applying in situ zymography, we observed that the percentage of hotspot area in the rhizosphere increases by 65–82 % with a 10 °C temperature rise. However, when fungal necromass was introduced to the soil, the hotspot percentage at 20 °C was 44–116 % higher compared to 30 °C. Additionally, the addition of necromass significantly enlarged the hotspot percentage as compared to zero necromass treatment, particularly at 20 °C. The shorter turnover time of soil organic matter (SOM) at 30 °C compared to 20 °C, following the addition of fungal necromass, clearly indicated that the combined effects of warming and added necromass-derived C and P compounds accelerated SOM decomposition. The formation of a fish-bone root structure in the maize mutant could be a compensatory strategy in response to the absence of root hairs under warming conditions. These fish-bone roots potentially enhanced the acquisition of labile C and P from the added fungal necromass. Furthermore, the unchanged Km but increased Vmax in necromass-treated soil under 30 °C suggested that microorganisms allocate their energy resources to synthesizing more enzymes rather than increasing enzyme efficiency in response to warming stress. Overall, as an easily decomposed substances, fungal necromass mediates the response of the dynamic interactions between plants and microorganisms to rising temperature by enlarging the hotspot percentage by 88 % but shortening duration of organic matter decomposition up to 125 %. Therefore, these processes can be considered as the adaptation of agro-ecosystems to global warming."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Due to experimental difficulties in studying and interpreting the interaction between these polysaccharides, this research presents a numerical model based on coarse-grained molecular dynamics that evaluates the mechanical properties of fiber composites. To validate the model and explain the structural and mechanical role of hemicelluloses, bacterial cellulose (BC) was synthesized in the presence of different concentrations of xylan, arabinoxylan, xyloglucan, or glucomannan and subjected to nano- and macroscale structural and mechanical characterization. The data obtained were used to interpret the effects of each hemicellulose on the mechanics of the BC–hemicellulose composite based on the sensitivity of the model. The mechanical properties of the resulting simulated networks agreed well with the experimental observations of the BC–hemicellulose composites. Increased xylan and arabinoxylan contents increased the macroscale mechanical properties, fiber modulus (xylan), and fiber width (arabinoxylan).

The structure of soil microbial communities differed due to crop type as well as depth of soil layer. Additionally, some basic physicochemical properties (e.g. total organic carbon - TOC, total nitrogen - TN, dissolved organic carbon - DOC, dissolved nitrogen – DN, pH, clay content) as well as mass and morphological parameters of the plant roots were determined. The highest clay content was noted in illuvial (Bt) horizons (in all profiles). The content of the studied C and N forms was the highest in the Ap horizon and in some subsurface layers and generally decreased with depth. Generally, the highest TOC, TN and DOC content was noted in the orchard profile, while the lowest occurred in the vineyard profile. The opposite trend was found for available Mg content. In turn, the highest DN was determined in the winter wheat profile. Overall, the decrease of the abundances of the most dominant phyla with depth was observed. Using a holistic approach via microbiome investigation of bacterial and fungal communities along soil horizon in a long-term land use with different plant cultivation, we showed that land management not only affect α-diversity but also shift the structure and the composition of bacterial and fungal communities in response to land use, in particular we identified the highest values of biodiversity indicators were found under lucerne and the lowest under vineyard.

Additionally, the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) were employed to discern various degrees of drought and pluvial years within the Atrak basin. The study revealed that the years 2008, 2014, 2017, and 2021 exhibited the lowest vegetation coverage, while the years 2010, 2016, and 2019 showcased the most extensive vegetation extent. Notably, it was revealed from the VCI index that the year 2008 was the driest, and the year 2016 was the wettest. Furthermore, based on the SPI index findings, the years 2007, 2019, and 2020 were identified as pluvial years, while in the years 2008, 2014, and 2021 drought conditions occurred. All other years were classified as exhibiting normal conditions. Regarding seasonality, the observations ascertain that the spring season substantiates the most extensive vegetation cover, and a high correlation between spring precipitation and vegetation coverage was observed. Additionally, the anomaly detection outcomes indicate that the eastern regions of the basin have experienced an upward trend compared to the average of the first decade of the studied period."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

In the case of gliadins, these changes concerned mainly α-helices. Quercetin induced a different type of structural changes compared to naringenin and hesperetin, which was probably due to the presence of a double bond on the C ring and an additional OH group on the B ring in the structure of this molecule. On the other hand, the interactions of glycosides with gliadins were affected by the place of attachment of the sugar part in the structure of the glycoside.

This plant is capable of establishing a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with Rhizobium leguminosarum symbiovar trifolii strains. To date, no comparative analysis of the symbiotic properties and heterogeneity of T. pratense microsymbionts derived from two distinct geographic regions has been performed. In this study, the symbiotic properties of strains originating from the subpolar and temperate climate zones in a wide range of temperatures (10–25 °C) have been characterized. Our results indicate that all the studied T. pratense microsymbionts from two geographic regions were highly efficient in host plant nodulation and nitrogen fixation in a wide range of temperatures. However, some differences between the populations and between the strains within the individual population examined were observed. Based on the nodC and nifH sequences, the symbiotic diversity of the strains was estimated. In general, 13 alleles for nodC and for nifH were identified. Moreover, 21 and 61 polymorphic sites in the nodC and nifH sequences were found, respectively, indicating that the latter gene shows higher heterogeneity than the former one. Among the nodC and nifH alleles, three genotypes (I–III) were the most frequent, whereas the other alleles (IV–XIII) proved to be unique for the individual strains. Based on the nodC and nifH allele types, 20 nodC-nifH genotypes were identified. Among them, the most frequent were three genotypes marked as A (6 strains), B (5 strains), and C (3 strains). Type A was exclusively found in the temperate strains, whereas types B and C were identified in the subpolar strains. The remaining 17 genotypes were found in single strains. In conclusion, our data indicate that R. leguminosarum sv. trifolii strains derived from two climatic zones show a high diversity with respect to the symbiotic efficiency and heterogeneity. However, some of the R. leguminosarum sv. trifolii strains exhibit very good symbiotic potential in the wide range of the temperatures tested; hence, they may be used in the future for improvement of legume crop production."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Machine learning methods were used to develop a set of predictive models calibrated and validated against the respiration rate of two apple fruit cultivars measured with the flush system. The model with the highest performance used three variables: the speckle pattern relaxation time (τRED or τIR), fruit mass, and categorical variables describing apple varieties. This model provided satisfactorily low values of mean absolute prediction errors of 6.04%. Data from laser light scattering measurements combined with modern machine learning algorithms provided a nondestructive and fast method for estimating the apple fruit respiration rate. The developed solution has the potential for a wide range of industrial applications, especially in fruit storage, where the fruit respiration rate indicates optimal storage conditions."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The minerals underwent characterization based on specific surface area, particle size distribution, zeta potential, and the presence of functional groups. The influence of PEI addition on the stability of the soil mineral suspension was evaluated by turbidimetry. Mineral-boron and mineral-boron-PEI interactions were explored under varying conditions, including pH, initial boron concentration, and mineral quantity, with all adsorption experiments conducted over 24 hours. Using the Langmuir isotherm, the maximum adsorption capacity of the studied minerals was determined for boron both without and in the presence of PEI. For gibbsite, kaolinite and montmorillonite, it was 30.63, 24.55 and 26.62 mg g-1, respectively, while in the presence of PEI, it increased to 33.11, 26.61 and 45.47 mg g-1, respectively.

The synthetic zeolite was characterized by a well-developed surface area of 728 m2/g and a pore diameter of 1.73 nm, while the carbon composite exhibited 268 m2/g and 7.37 nm, respectively. Na-X was found to be more efficient than the carbon composite (75–212 mg/g) in adsorbing heavy metal ions in both single and bimetallic systems (322–333 mg/g). In turn, the C/Mn/SiO2 composite was more effective in removing Pb(II) ions from the systems that simultaneously contained DCF or PAA (480 and 476 mg/g, respectively). The Na-X zeolite demonstrated the greatest stability in all the systems studied. The highest stability was observed in the DCF + Pb(II) mixture, in contrast to the carbon composites where the stability was much lower. To evaluate the possibility of regeneration of the solids, HCl proved to be the best desorbent for heavy metal ions (efficiency of 99%). In general, both adsorbents offer promising potential for solving environmental problems."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The biostimulants had the greatest effect on the antioxidant content (16% - 20% increase) and capacity in the Delniwa raspberry fruits from the first season. A positive correlation was found between the activity of the β-galactosidase enzyme and ferric reducing power. In the second season, a decrease in the activity of pectin esterase and α-L-arabinofuranosidase and an increase in the degree of methylation of pectin were noted.

Among several adsorption models tested, the best fit was obtained for the Redlich-Peterson isotherm. Moreover, the linear vs. the branched structure and the size of the hemicelluloses have an influence over the extent of the adsorption to cellulose. The Fourier Transform Infrared and Raman spectra showed that a rather weak interaction took place between the hemicelluloses and cellulose. Also, the differential scanning calorimetry and the light scattering method results showed that after adsorption, cellulose has less mobility. Moreover, the mechanical properties of cellulose films changed after the addition of the chosen hemicelluloses and the films became less elastic but more resistant to a breaking force."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Existing technologies have struggled to detect these diseases during this period, leading to potential food loss and consumer distrust. Biospeckle has emerged as a promising discriminator of the internal state of the fruit by utilizing laser-induced scattered light patterns. Pigment interference is minimized by employing lasers with wavelengths of 532 and 650 nm. This study focuses on the ability of biospeckle to distinguish between healthy and diseased fruit based on characteristic values, specifically the Fujii index and cumulative amplitude (Cum. amp.) at 2–3, 3–4, 4–5, and 6–7 Hz. The t-test results demonstrated significant differences in these values, particularly for water-soaked and reddish-pulp disorders. Biospeckle outperforms other non-destructive methods by identifying the symptoms pre-storage. These results indicate that Cum. amp. at 3–4, 4–5, and 6–7 Hz may be more useful in identifying water-soaked fruit than the Fujii index and Cum. amp. at 2–3 Hz. Red lasers are more effective in detecting reddish-pulp disorders than green lasers, which are hindered by pigment absorption. This finding highlights the potential of biospeckle in precise symptom identification, which is crucial for ensuring food quality and consumer confidence."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

However, the mechanisms behind air bubble formation and liquid separation remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the interaction between new and old wetting liquids and the mechanism that traps air bubbles, isolating old water. Using a grain-based pattern micromodel, we examined these processes during a repeated wetting cycle (wetting-drainage-evaporation-wetting). To enhance visualization and evaporation, we used dyed alcohol solutions as the wetting phase, with air as the non-wetting phase. Results indicate that a liquid film on grains plays a crucial role in old liquid entrapment, influenced more by soil wettability than initial liquid content. Strong wettability resulted in significant film development, allowing old and new liquids to connect and potentially mix. In contrast, weak wettability led to air bubble entrapment, isolating old water and preventing its displacement. The findings highlight that soil wettability and wetting film development are key factors in the interaction between new and old wetting liquids."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Given DASP’s richness of rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I), RG-I acetyl esterase (RGAE), rhamnogalacturonan endolyase (RGL), and arabinofuranosidase (ABF) were employed in various combinations for targeted degradation of RG-I pectin chains. Enzymatic degradations were followed by structural studies of pectin molecules using atomic force microscopy (AFM) as well as measurements of rheological and spectral properties. AFM imaging revealed a significant increase in the length of branched molecules after incubation with ABF, suggesting that arabinose side chains limit RG-I aggregation. Structural modifications were confirmed by changes in the intensity of bands in the pectin fingerprint and anomeric region on Fourier transform infrared spectra. ABF treatment led to a decrease in the stability of pectic gels, while the simultaneous use of ABF, RGAE, and RGL enzymes did not increase the degree of aggregation compared to the control sample. These findings suggest that the association of pectin chains within the DASP fraction may rely significantly on intermolecular interactions. Two mechanisms are proposed, which involve side chains as short-range attachment points or an extended linear homogalacturonan conformation favoring inter-chain interactions over self-association."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The use of waste-derived adsorbents for this purpose has additional benefit – the possibility of managing undesirable and dangerous by-products. Thus, the main aim of the study was to explore immobilization mechanism of metals (Cd, Cu), metalloids (As, Se), and herbicides (diuron, glyphosate) on zeolite Na-X free of ash residue, coming from waste solution after high carbon fly ash (HiC FA) conversion, under specific conditions – in multicomponent solutions as well as after solid modification with polymers. Immobilization strength was assessed based on adsorption/desorption studies, whereas the solid surface was investigated by XPS, FTIR, SEM-EDS, etc. The results obtained for Na-X was compared with those measured for its precursor, HiC FA. It was found that Na-X was a good adsorbent of Cu(II) and Cd(II) cations – it bound 195.8 mg/g (58.7 %) of Cd(II) and 126.9 mg/g (38.1 %) of Cu(II) mainly in the form of hydroxides. The Na-X modification with polymers made its adsorption capacity towards metalloid anions and herbicides higher. Anionic polyacrylamide increased the Se(IV) adsorption from 0.2 to 67.5 mg/g. Cationic polyacrylamide contributed to higher immobilization of glyphosate and diuron by 43.9 % and 46.4 %, respectively."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f5878c28a0473a00c2"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6c","uid":"bdnPLFswu7CLH3zqfWKU3YA","uuid":"ac18272d-83a2-4141-aa4e-01e904b4a061","name":"Wydział Biologii i Biotechnologii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f5878c28a04739ff4e"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

This paper presents an assessment of the effect of zeolite modifiers combined with four soils of Polish and Slovakian origin on their hydrophysical properties. Under laboratory conditions, the characterization of the applied soil additives was carried out along with particle soil analysis. In addition, the prepared soil mixtures were examined using contact angle and saturated hydraulic conductivity. The results suggest that the increase in hydrophobicity occurred mainly after the application of fly ash, and the values for Polish Silty clay soil and Slovak soils: Sandy soil, Silt loam soil, and Silty clay soil compared to the control changed from 73.02° to 96.22°; 8.67° to 24.88°; 29.23° to 33.94° and 19.9° to 26.16° respectively. The increase in hydrophobicity could be explained by the higher CaO content of the high-carbon fly ash compared to the other materials. The parameters of saturated hydraulic conductivity were reduced after the application of all zeolite materials in the case of Polish Silty clay and Slovak Sandy soils. By filling the space between the soil particles, the porous soil additives decreased the hydraulic conductivity. In Slovak soils such as Silty loam soil and Silty clay soil, the opposite effect was observed. The soil additives increased the number and size of pores, which resulted in faster filtration of water and thus an increase in the saturated hydraulic conductivity value."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The study explored soil microbial properties including the enzymatic activity of dehydrogenases (tested by colorimetric reaction with 2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride), metabolic profile (using Biolog™ ECO Plates), metataxonomy structure (Next Generation Sequencing using Illumina®), followed by physicochemical properties (pH, N, P, K, microelements concentrations, organic matter, and Corg content). The hypothesis was that different land management practices would influence soil microbial properties, with cultivated orchards expected to show significantly lower dehydrogenases activity, and higher substrate-based respiratory than biomass response, within substrate stress occurrence, when testing metabolic profiles, but also different composition and lower relative abundances of specific microbial taxa and different biomarker genera, compared to other treatments. We aimed to identify practices promoting diverse microbial substrate-based metabolic and taxa diversity responses, with a focus on Bacillus and Trichoderma abundances, which are potential biological agents against fungal pathogens. As expected the presented research revealed significant statistical variations in microbial communities among different land management practices in soil beneath apple trees. It was accordingly noted that cultivated orchards, but also green belts, clearly exhibited reduced microbial activity (3.59 and 4.76 TPF kg−1 d−1, respectively) compared to gardens and uncultivated orchards (12.08 and 9.89 TPF kg−1 d−1). Cultivated orchards notably showed higher respiration levels and substrate stress compared, especially to forests and other land management practices represented by a clear separation of observed according to Sneath's criteria in cluster analysis. Different land management practices induce unique stress responses in microbial communities: forests struggled with B-Methyl-d-Glucoside, gardens with Serine and Putrescine, cultivated orchards with d-Glucosaminic Acid and Cyclodextrin, and bounds with 2-Hydroxy-Benzoic Acid. Substantial differences were also observed in the relative abundance of the top ten bacterial and fungal orders, and biomarker genera representatives. In cultivated orchards, there was a significant decrease in the relative abundance of many bacterial taxa such as e.g. Rhizobiales, Burkholderiales, Vivinamibacterales, and fungal taxa including Eurotiales, and Saccharomycetales. Notably, no significant differences were noted for Bacillus abundance among tested management practices. Forests favored Trichoderma abundance the most among tested practices (relative abundance 0.05 %). In turn, Trichoderma representatives were revealed as biomarker genera in gardens with animals. Williamsia representatives, as found in uncultivated orchards were suggested to be a biomarker of less disturbance, resulting from area restoration. Overall, the study discussed how different land management practices influence soil microbial communities and their functional roles, emphasizing the potential impacts of use on soil health and biodiversity within its implications. The most important recommendation bullet points:\n\n    • using Williamsia representatives as a soil biomarker microorganism to indicate successful area restoration processes in apple orchards,\n    • using d-Glucosaminic Acid metabolic stress test to reveal early difficulties in controlling fungal pathogens in soil microbial communities,\n    • promoting diverse plant covers and reasonably reduced agrochemical inputs in apple orchards for enhancing soil microbial resilience,\n    • preserving habitats of wild apple trees in forests or green belts, as these environments exhibit reduced metabolic stress and support the occurrence of fungi like Trichoderma, in the context of locations from which such isolates should be sought for further biocontrol use."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Their combination with biochar (BC), a product of biomass pyrolysis, can result in obtaining specific composites characterized by the advantages of both initial materials. The BC introduction into HG can double its swelling degree and increase their sorption capacity by more than threefold compared to the pure HG. Furthermore, the composites are able to increase plants biomass (up to 160%), even under heavy metal contamination, and are characterized by lower nutrient release rate (up to 25%) in comparison to the pure hydrogels. This review explores the properties of biochar-filled hydrogel composites, including swelling degrees and ability to absorb heavy metals and other toxic compounds. Additionally, it discusses their agricultural applications as soil conditioners and slow-release fertilizers, covering their effects on water and nutrient retention in the soil, soil microbial activity, as well as plant performance under contamination and drought stress.

However, the successful application of DCA requires precise and reliable sensors of the oxidative stress of the fruit. In this study, respiration rate and chlorophyll fluorescence (CF) signals were evaluated after introducing a novel predictors of apples' hypoxic stress based on laser speckle imaging technique (LSI).\nResults\n\nBoth chlorophyll fluorescence and LSI signals were equally good for stress detection in principle. However, in an application with automatic detection based on machine learning models, the LSI signal proved to be superior, due to its stability and measurement repeatability. Moreover, the shortcomings of the CF signal appear to be its inability to indicate oxygen stress in tissues with low chlorophyll content but this does not apply to LSI. A comparison of different LSI signal processing methods showed that method based on the dynamics of changes in image content was better indicators of stress than methods based on measurements of changes in pixel brightness (inertia moment or laser speckle contrast analysis). Data obtained using the near-infrared laser provided better prediction capabilities, compared to the laser with red light.\nConclusions\n\nThe study showed that the signal from the scattered laser light phenomenon is a good predictor for the oxidative stress of apples. Results showed that effective prediction using LSI was possible and did not require additional signals. The proposed method has great potential as an alternative indicator of fruit oxidative stress, which can be applied in modern storage systems with a dynamically controlled atmosphere."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of the following SICS: liming (L), leguminous catch crops for green manure (LU), farmyard manure (M), and liming + leguminous catch crops for green manure + farmyard manure together (LLUM), and the control (C) on temporal changes in the three properties simultaneously in a field experiment on sandy soil established in 2016 in Poland. The monitoring was performed using TEROS 12 sensors in the soil layers of 5–10, 20–25, and 30–35 cm from 25 April 2019–30 April 2020 with spring wheat as the main crop. The results showed that the average WC over the entire investigation period in the 5–10 cm layer was 0.206 m3 m–3 in the control and increased in the L, LU, M, and LLUM variants to 0.245, 0.219, 0.241, 0.262 m3 m–3, respectively. The highest WC was recorded in the LLUM system during most of the investigation period. The average T in the 5–10 cm layer increased in L, LU, and M by 0.221–0.262 °C and in LLUM by 0.052 °C. The average monthly soil temperature amplitudes in the soil layer 5–10 cm tended to be higher under all SICS vs. C except LLUM vs. C. The average EC in the 5–10 cm layer in variant C (0.066 mS cm–1) increased in the L, LU, M, and LLUM systems to 0.067, 0.090, 0.151, and 0.107 mS cm–1, respectively. The shapes of the temporal variability of WC and EC were similar in all SICSs, while the increase in the response to the combined effects of the SICSs and precipitation during the growing season was greater for the EC. The temporal variability of all soil properties in response to the SICSs and weather course and their averages declined with depth. The amplitudes of soil T in all treatments were lowest in the 30–35 cm layer.

While the role of cellulose and hemicelluloses in the formation of the PCW scaffold is undeniable, the mechanisms of how hemicelluloses determine the mechanical properties of PCW remain debatable. Thus, we produced bacterial cellulose–hemicellulose hydrogels as PCW analogues, incorporated with hemicelluloses. Next, we treated samples with hemicellulose degrading enzymes, and explored its structural and mechanical properties. As suggested, difference of hemicelluloses in structure and chemical composition resulted in a variety of the properties studied. By analyzing all the direct and indirect evidences we have found that glucomannan, xyloglucan and arabinoxylan increased the width of cellulose fibers both by hemicellulose surface deposition and fiber entrapment. Arabinoxylan increased stresses and moduli of the hydrogel by its reinforcing effect, while for xylan, increase in mechanical properties was determined by establishment of stiff cellulose–cellulose junctions. In contrast, increasing content of xyloglucan decreased stresses and moduli of hydrogel by its weak interactions with cellulose, while glucomannan altered cellulose network formation via surface deposition, decreasing its strength. The current results provide evidence for structure–dependent mechanisms of cellulose–hemicellulose interactions, suggesting the specific structural role of the latter."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Metal-incorporated carbon-mineral composites (Ni/Mn-CMC and Ni/Fe-CMC) described in this paper can certainly be applied for this purpose. They were synthesized by combining mechanochemical and pyrolytic processes and their physicochemical properties were investigated using numerous methods (SEM-EDS, N2 adsorption/desorption, XRD, surface charge, FTIR). Adsorption capacity towards diuron and carboxin with and without impurities commonly detected in natural ecosystems, cadmium ions or arsenite, was measured. The obtained results indicated that Ni/Fe-CMC is more efficient adsorbent of pesticides due to its well-developed surface. It was able to bind 158.34 mg g−1 of diuron and 133.58 mg g−1 of carboxin in the solutions, where only one pesticide was present. In turn, these values for the Ni/Mn-CMC sample were 126.49 mg g−1 and 102.08 mg g−1, respectively. It should be noted that the composites maintained their high adsorption capacity in the multicomponent solutions, i.e., containing both pesticide and metal ions. Then, the maximum reduction in pesticide adsorption was only 8.36. Ni/Mn-CMC and Ni/Fe-CMC were successfully regenerated with ethanol without changing their structure and adsorption capacity. Also, the extracts from investigated materials did not have negative impact on plant growth. This confirmed suitability of carbon-mineral composites for repeated multiple use without toxic effects to organisms."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Density-dependent dielectric permittivity characteristics of soils for the entire range of obtained density, and thus for a significant parameter of soil properties corresponding with ideal conditions for plant growth as well as those inhibiting their growth were presented. Measurements were carried out for three soil types with different moisture content using an open-ended antenna probe (OE-A), operating in the frequency range of 20 MHz–1.2 GHz and a coaxial cell system in frequency range of 20 MHz–3 GHz.

Therefore, evaluation of the content and structure of polysaccharides is crucial to understanding and controlling their functionality. Vibrational spectroscopy has already proven to be very useful in studying wall-based compounds. Here, it was proposed to use the FT-IR and FT-Raman spectra combined with PCA analysis to discriminate and distinguish pectic and hemicellulosic fractions isolated from apple parenchyma as an example. Reference measurements have been done on commercially available polysaccharides in order to identify relevant fingerprint bands. The similarities of different polysaccharide fractions from apple: water, imidazole, dilute alkali-soluble polysaccharides (WSP, ISP, DASP, respectively), and polysaccharides soluble in three potassium hydroxide concentration (KOHs) to the reference polysaccharides were found. In the case of both types of spectroscopy, the region below 1800 cm−1 was used to differentiate the samples. The results showed that the WSP, ISP, and DASP fractions have band patterns similar to the pectic polysaccharides, but also contain bands characteristic of polysaccharides containing arabinan and galactan. While the KOH fractions showed the greatest similarities to the hemicellulose polysaccharides, especially the glucomannan and xyloglucan. The results showed that FT-IR and FT-Raman spectra supported by PCA can be useful for studying the structure of polysaccharide fractions directly isolated from plant cell wall material."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

One of the methods of maintaining high-quality fruit is using ecological preparations defined as biostimulants, which also eliminate the usage of pesticides and support a sustainable agriculture approach. The effectiveness of microbial preparations used as biostimulants was studied in our experiment. The use of preparations containing Bacillus subtilis and Paenibacillus polymyxa strains and bioactive substances (K4, K5 and K6) delayed the ripening processes of the Honeoye and Rumba strawberry, which resulted in a brighter colour of the skin as compared to the control (K1 I, K1 II). After applying the biopreparations, the taste was improved and the nutritional value of the strawberries increased. An average of a 14 % increase in the soluble solid content (SSC) content was observed for Honeoye strawberries treated with K4 and K6 and also the Vibrant variety treated with K6, compared to the control samples (K1 I, K1 II). The antioxidant capacity, which was determined in terms of the DPPH level in the three cultivars of the strawberries (Honeoye, Rumba and Vibrant) treated with the tested preparations, was similar and ranged between 83 and 90 %. The greatest differences in the content of antioxidants were found for anthocyanins, whose content increased by an average of 27 % in the Vibrant (K5, K6) and Rumba (K3, K5, K6) strawberries. Together, these results show that the selected preparations improve the quality of strawberries of the Honeoye, Vibrant and Rumba varieties."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Most of the work to date related to erosion has been on large-scale studies based on rainfall events or laboratory investigations with the use of simulators, where the displaced mass of soil was determined. However, there is a lack of studies providing information about splash erosion on slopes in relation to single-drop impact methodology, that allows for the examination of the basic processes of the phenomenon. Thus, the aim of this study was a quantitative description of the splash phenomenon on a simulated slope affected by a single drop impact, with respect to the influence of slope incline on the number of ejected particles and their characteristics. The investigation was carried out using three types of soil with different textures in moistened conditions (i.e. pressure head corresponding to 1.0 kPa) and three variants of slope incline: 5°, 15°, and 30°. A drop with a diameter of 4.2 mm was allowed to fall freely on soil surface with kinetic energy equal 1.42 mJ. The splash phenomenon was registered by a set of three synchronized high-speed cameras and combined with PTV software (Particle Tracking Velocimetry) to identify and track displaced particles. The methodology used made it possible to observe the course of the phenomenon and determine the following quantities: the number and size of ejected particles, ejection velocity and angle, displacement range, and also the contribution of the kinetic energy of the falling drop transferred to the ejected particles. The measured quantities were specified for the particles ejected in upslope and downslope directions. It was found that: (i) the interaction between different slope inclines and the particle size distribution of the soils influenced the surface conditions, which had a significant effect on the course of the splash phenomenon; (ii) the number of ejected particles decreased with the increasing slope, which was directly related to limited ejection in the upslope direction; (iii) the influence of slope incline was mostly visible in the ejection angle, range of displacement and sizes of ejected particles; (iv) the portion of the falling drop energy transferred to ejected particles decreased with increasing slope. The obtained results could enhance the development of physical models of splash erosion. A more thorough understanding and better recognition of the mechanisms governing this phenomenon at all stages could contribute to the development of more effective methods for protecting soil against erosion."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

This study aimed to show the interrelations of the soil hydraulic parameters on a large scale with both the inherent soil properties and the genetic type. The measured van Genuchten parameters originated from soil water retention curves determined in 100 pedons at 4 depths corresponding to the main soil diagnostic horizons. The results showed that the effect of soil texture on the van Genuchten hydraulic parameters was greater than that of the genetic soil type. The van Genuchten hydraulic parameters were in general significantly higher in fine-textured than coarse-textured soils. The vertical distribution of the hydraulic parameters was more discontinuous in fine- than in coarse-textured soils. The van Genuchten equation fits well to measured soil water retention (R2 > 0.885) and thereby can predict the soil water retention curve for a variety of soils with acceptable uncertainty and improve soil water conservation on a large regional scale."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

This makes sustainable, environmentally friendly production methods into non-chemical plant protection products against pathogens, including microbial biopreparations, increasingly important among farmers. Strawberry fruits (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) are often negatively affected by fungal pathogens. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of five combinations of newly developed microbial biopreparations (from K2 to K6) on fungal pathogens and the yield of three strawberry cultivars. The research was conducted on a certified organic strawberry plantation in Poland in 2020–2021. In the first year of the study, no statistically significant positive impact of tested treatments on strawberry yields have been found. At the same time, yields of ‘Honeoye’ treated with K4 combination showed a tendency (with no statistical significance) to have higher yields than the control object by about 33%. In the second year of the study, yields of ‘Honeoye’ and ‘Rumba’ treated with K4 combination (containing Bacillus sp. Sp116AC*, Bacillus sp. Sp115AD, Bacillus sp. AF75BC and Bacillus subtilis AF75AB2, humic acids, yeast culture effluent, micronized dolomite, and mustard and rapeseed oil) significantly increased by 79% and 49%, respectively. Fruit infestation by fungal pathogens was reduced under some microbial treatments; however, the effect varied between years, cultivars, and tested biopreparations. The K2 combination showed a tendency (with no statistical significance) to limit B. cinerea infestation rate by 23% in 2020 and 21% in 2021, C. acutatum by 16% in 2021, and P. cactorum infestation rate by 30% in 2021. Tested microbial biopreparations showed a positive impact on the yield of strawberries and (to some extent) on disease infestation, with an impact on pathogen infestation strongly dependent on the year, variety, and biopreparation tested."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","uid":"boRt8XbJIJxFX3j3lPkVVng","uuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","name":"Instytut Uprawy Nawożenia i Gleboznawstwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63d0a2397523407151529b51","5e70929c878c28a047399199","5e70947c878c28a0473be18d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","parentUuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","rootUuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The agricultural sector acts as a financial injection to the rural economy and society. In this context, one of the most well devised agricultural policies is young farmers' schemes, aiming at generational renewal in EU rural areas. Since young farmers are the people who directly receive the induced effects of these policies, policy makers have to listen carefully to what “message” young farmers can convey. Nevertheless, after almost four decades of implementing young farmers' schemes, there is still limited information regarding their attitudes, beliefs and perceptions towards the form of the related policy schemes. Using this as a starting point, the present study attempts to identify young farmers' attitudes and beliefs towards the current young farmers' scheme of the Rural Development Program (RDP) with overarching scope to identify the needs of young farmers better and thus inform policy makers about the appropriate policy that should be put forward. Results indicate that the current young farmers' scheme acts as a helpful instrument for a considerable percentage of young farmers. Nevertheless, further streamlining is required to provide incentives, especially to new entrants, to be engaged in the farming profession.

These are mechanically damaged slices that are not commercially available and are rejected at the sorting stage. The concept of its development was to use it to produce extruded corn snacks. Waste pieces of whole meal wheat crispbread were used for this research, and the final snack was produced using an extrusion method. The investigation of the final snack included the determination of water activity, geometric density, pycnometric density determined in a helium pycnometer, porosity, the water solubility index, WSI, the water adsorption index, WAI, sorption properties, and instrumental texture, as well as a sensory analysis. It was shown that the addition of ground crispbread caused a slight increase in density and a decrease in open porosity. A decrease in water content and water absorption coefficients (WAI) and water solubility (WSI) was observed. Texture studies including mechanical and acoustic texture determinants showed that a small addition of ground crispbread improves the texture features (the most beneficial was found with an addition of 25%). It has been shown that it is possible to rationally manage waste generated during the production of crispbread. A product with favorable physical properties and high sensory acceptability was obtained. The technology described in the paper makes bread production more sustainable and generates less waste."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

It was demonstrated that the chemical modifications resulted in notable alterations to the chemical properties of the composites compared to pure DT and mixtures of DT with BC, DL, and BN. An increase in negative charge was observed in all variants. The addition of BC introduced valuable chemically and thermally resistant organic components into the composite. Among the chemical modifications, composites with the addition of perlite exhibited the lowest values of negative surface charge, which was attributed to the dissolution and transformation of silicon compounds and traces of kaolinite during their initial etching with sodium hydroxide. The materials exhibited varying efficiencies in metal immobilization, which is determined by both the type of DT additive and the type of chemical modification applied. The greatest efficacy in reducing the mobility of heavy metals was observed in the PFS with the addition of DT and BC without modification and with the addition of DT and BC after the modification of H2SO4 and H2O2: Cd 8% and 6%; Cr 71% and 69%; Cu 12% and 14%; Ni 10% and Zn 15%; and 4% and 5%.

For these reasons, they are common organic contaminants in raw wastewater. The purpose of the presented studies was to compare the adsorption capacity of three carbon-silica composites – metal-free C/SiO2, iron-enriched C/Fe/SiO2 and manganese-enriched C/Mn/SiO2 towards diclofenac. The studies were carried out in single, and mixed systems in the presence of poly(acrylic acid) polymer. Adsorption, desorption and kinetics of the adsorption process were investigated. The concentration of diclofenac in the supernatants was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. The solids were also characterized with an ASAP apparatus using low-temperature nitrogen desorption adsorption isotherms at liquid nitrogen temperature. In addition, potentiometric titrations and electrophoretic mobility measurements, as well as stability tests of the studied suspensions were carried out. The most efficient composite among investigated ones proved to be C/Fe/SiO2 removing diclofenac at the level of 46.68 mg/g for its initial concentration of 90 ppm. The results obtained clearly demonstrated that the carbon-silica composites are effective in separation of drugs from aqueous solutions and can be successfully used in the future for the removal of organic pollutants from water environment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

An example of such a plant is radish (Raphanus sativus var. sativus), an economically important crop in Poland, a quick-growing vegetable with intensified harvest throughout the season. The aim of this study was to determine changes in biodiversity of soil under radish cultivation and to compare the research methods applied. The monoculture practice affected soil pH, but the organic carbon content remained stable. 16S RNA-seq analysis revealed changes in soil microbial population, with the dominant phyla Proteobacteria (37.3%), Acidobacteria (19%), and Actinobacteria (16%), and the dominant taxa Gaiella (1.59%), Devosia (1.51%) and Nocardioides (1.43%). These changes have not fully expressed in the number of culturable microorganisms, where only fungal abundance changed significantly. However, the physiological state of microbial cells (λ) indicated that oligotrophs and copiotrophs were in a vegetative (λ > 3.0) state at the beginning of the season and fungi at the end of the year. Changes in the biodiversity of soil microorganisms were visualised using Community Level Physiological Profiling, where an oscillation in Average Well Colour Development (OD560 = 0.78–1.48) was observed in successive months of radish culture, with biodiversity indices (Shannon and Substance richness) remaining similar. The greatest variation in the influence of monoculture practice on soil factors was observed for the soil enzymes activities (for dehydrogenase and peroxidase activities – 0.5 μg TPF/h/g DW and 1.5 μmolPYGL/h/g DW respectively). Alkaline phosphatases predominated among this group of enzymes, and the activity of carbon metabolism enzymes decreased over the season, except for invertases, where an increase in activity of up to 50 μg Glc/h/g DW was observed.

However, their impact on soil microbes and their relationships with soil chemical variables during the subsequent crop growth is not understood enough. In this study, we analyzed the changes in bacterial and fungal communities structure through 16S rRNA and ITS amplicon sequencing, respectively, across crop rotation with faba bean (faba bean-wheat-triticale, F) and without faba bean (wheat-wheat-triticale, W). Rhizosphere and bulk soil samples were taken during the triticale growth stages (stem elongation and maturity). Soil enzymatic activity and chemical properties were also determined. Study factors (crop rotation, soil compartment, growth stage) affected N, C, and P transformations, as indicated by the activity of soil enzymes, and F was more beneficial than W for protease, urease, and acid phosphomonoesterase activities, as opposed to cellulase activity. Changes in the chemical properties led to the shift in soil microbial communities with different bacterial and fungal communities' responses. F treatment enhanced the abundance of the bacterial genera representatives such as Streptomyces and Candidatus Udaeobacter while suppressing the abundance of Jatrophihabitans and Terrabacter. Crop rotation significantly influenced fungal genera and a greater abundance of Helgardia, Pseudogymnoascus, Monocillium, Fusarium, Chaetomium, and Vishniacozyma under F than W was noted and the adverse situation was noted for Peziza and Rhizopus. Rotation type significantly affected the alfa-diversity of the fungal, but not bacterial community. Beta-diversity analyses (nMDS, cluster) indicated that the main factor grouping samples were soil compartment and growth stage for the bacterial and fungal microbiome, respectively. The PERMANOVA results revealed significant effects of all factors on bacterial and fungal microbiomes. Different soil chemical variables governed bacterial and fungal communities. Corg, pH, P, Mg, and Corg, pH were the most important soil factors regulating bacterial and fungal community structure by crop rotation, respectively. Bacterial and fungal communities were more related to the content of Ntot in rotation with than without faba bean. The findings of this study contribute to a deeper insight into the relation between the faba bean in cropping sequence and soil microbiome, and modulation crucial soil conditions for the productivity of the successive crop."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Understanding land surface temperature (LST) changes is crucial in mitigating and adapting to the effect of urban heat islands, and ultimately addressing the broader challenge of global warming. This study estimates LST in the city of Yazd, Iran, where field and high-resolution thermal image data are scarce. LST is assessed through surface parameters (indices) available from Landsat-8 satellite images for two contrasting seasons—winter and summer of 2019 and 2020, and then it is estimated for 2021. The LST is modeled using six machine learning algorithms implemented in R software (version 4.0.2). The accuracy of the models is measured using root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square logarithmic error (RMSLE), and mean and standard deviation of the different performance indicators. The results show that the gradient boosting model (GBM) machine learning algorithm is the most accurate in estimating LST. The albedo and NDVI are the surface features with the greatest impact on LST for both the summer (with 80.3% and 11.27% of importance) and winter (with 72.74% and 17.21% of importance). The estimated LST for 2021 showed acceptable accuracy for both seasons. The GBM models for each of the seasons are useful for modeling and estimating the LST based on surface parameters using machine learning, and to support decision-making related to spatial variations in urban surface temperatures. The method developed can help to better understand the urban heat island effect and ultimately support mitigation strategies to improve human well-being and enhance resilience to climate change."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The high accuracy and repeatability of the measurements confirmed the suitability of the pull-based tester for assessing the degree of caking in food powders. The pull-based tester allows for the measurement of strength parameters of agglomerates under various consolidation loads while simultaneously wetting the powder, introducing a novel approach to assessing the mechanical properties of powders. The analysis of force oscillation during the withdrawal of the measuring rod from the powder facilitates the identification of the slip-stick effect in these materials and the determination of parameters characterizing that phenomenon.

The aim is to analyse the relationship between aridity, vegetation, and rainfall. Moreover, additional emphasis was placed on exploring the impact of these dynamics on agricultural land cover thereby contributing to our understanding of the environmental dynamics in the Gavkhouni catchment. Methods: The study made use of MODIS data, including the Enhanced Vegetation Index and Vegetation Condition Index, along with monthly rainfall statistics from Chirps. Analytical methods include time series analyses using correlation and regression analysis. Results: Throughout the study period, the average spring vegetation cover was 9276.33 km². The years 2001 and 2018 had the lowest degree of vegetation (15.53, and 17.3% of the watershed area). Conversely, 2013, 2019, and 2020 had the most coverage (27.4, 26.8, and 26.3%). The Enhanced Vegetation Index highlighted the arid years (2001, 2008, 2011, and 2018) and the years with the lowest drought prevalence (2006, 2007, 2010, 2013). Enhanced Vegetation Index correlated with spring rainfall. Cropland cover declined over the study period, and a close correlation was found between winter rainfall and spring agricultural coverage."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The biochar was derived from wheat straw at 650 °C. An inorganic modification was performed using ammonia hydroxide, whereas an organic modification, using citric acid. The ammonia hydroxide and citric acid changed the biochar nature and surface chemistry by introducing amino and ester groups. The lowest DOC release was from ammonia–biochar (BCN) and the highest, from citric acid–biochar (BCC). The adsorption data were better described by pseudo–II order equation and Marczewski–Jaroniec isotherm. Results showed that BCN exhibited the highest efficiency in adsorption of E and Ag–NPs. It also improved the adsorptive abilities and saturated hydraulic conductivity of M.

However, there has been little investigation into the impact of PEF on the biomolecular components of plant tissues. This study assesses the influence of PEF at low (1.5 kJ/kg) and medium (151 kJ/kg) intensities on the physicochemical parameters of pectin fractions isolated from green and red tomatoes. Monopolar exponential decay pulses of 1.0 and 10.0 kV/cm were delivered to alcohol-insoluble residue (AIR) recovered from mature green and ripe red tomatoes. Topography and recognition imaging were performed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) on three pectin fractions: water-soluble pectin (WSP), chelator-soluble pectin (CSP), and diluted alkali-soluble pectin (DASP). Image analysis has been used to characterize the geometrical properties of pectin. PEF treatments generated considerable structural alterations in all pectin fractions. The effect varied depending on the stage of tomato ripening and the energy input applied. The average length of WSP fibres in red tomatoes decreased dramatically (up to 50% shorter) as the intensity of the electric field increased. Green tomatoes showed the opposite effect, with the length of the WSP fibres increasing as the applied electric field increased. The monosaccharide composition revealed that PEF decreased pectin linearity independent of the fruit ripening stage. The data obtained on PEF-pectin interactions might assist in building tailored food processes that rely on pectin’s functional qualities and a better understanding of the effect of the ripening stage on PEF efficacy."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The consolidation pressures corresponded to the vertical pressures acting on the layers of the bulk material bed in medium-slender and low silos. Chromatographic determinations of volatile organic compounds were performed as reference tests. The investigations confirmed the correlation of the electronic nose response with the quality degradation of the groats as a function of storage time.

Because of these interactions, their real concentrations can also be underestimated. Here we studied the nature, intensity, and strength of the interactions between bisphenol A and nano-sized natural organic matter. The bioavailability and toxicity of the complexed bisphenol A were tested with human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines. Results show that that interaction of bisphenol A with organic matter reduces bisphenol A cytotoxicity. Moreover, the bisphenol A-organic matter interaction is weak in the first hour then very stable after 24 h. Once formed, the bisphenol A-organic matter complex escapes detection and, as a consequence, the levels of pollutants in organic-rich media is most probably underestimated. The mechanism of interaction involves hydrophobic and π-stacking forces inside the core of nano-sized organic matter."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

In this study, the impact of the micronization process using a ball mill on the properties of micronized powders derived from wild rose petals of the rugosa variety (Rosa rugosa Thunb.) was examined. The micronized rose powders were subjected to an investigation regarding their particle size, color, molecular characterization (FTIR), electronic nose procedure and antioxidant potential. The study found that micronization considerably reduced d50 particle dimensions from 98.6 µm to 39.9 µm. An FTIR analysis revealed the presence of characteristic (2980, 1340, and 1225 cm−1) bands. The hydrolysable tannins are the most abundant polyphenolic chemicals in rose powders, followed by anthocyanins. Rose powders are an extremely valuable antioxidant raw material due to their high total phenol content (71.8 mg GAE/g), which increased by approximately 26% after micronization. The antioxidant activity, as determined by ABTS•+, DPPH• and FRAP, is likewise very high.

The knowledge about the interaction of TiO2 NPs with food components is limited to proteins or polyphenols. The present paper is the first to report on interactions between TiO2 NPs and high molecular pectins that form gels in boluses and are remain nearly intact during digestion until they reach the colon. Direct interactions were studied using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy while indirect ones were monitored by measuring the “absorption” of TiO2 using a 0.2 microfiltration membrane, during in vitro digestion in a model of the gastro-intestinal tract. The FT-IR spectra registered for pectin-TiO2 NPs solutions confirmed changes in band intensities at 1020, 1100, 1610, and 1740 cm−1, suggesting interactions taking place mainly via the COO– groups. Furthermore, the I(1020)/I(1100) ratio was decreased (C-O stretching vibrations), suggesting partial blocking of the skeletal vibrations caused by interactions between pectin and TiO2. The modelled in vitro digestions confirmed that the “availability” of Ti was reduced when TiO2 NPs were combined with pectin, as compared to TiO2 NPs “digested” alone."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","uid":"bt6mbuLY9Vpc_KWGkV1Lk4w","uuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Lublinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709225878c28a047390a14","5e7094f6878c28a0473c8129"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

However, there is still a lack of a faster, more efficient and eco-friendly way for sustainable production. In this study, we proposed a method to accelerate the production of AHS from cotton stalks by mild pyrolysis and H2O2 oxidation in only 4 hours, and investigated the formation of AHS during biomass transformation. We found that the process increased the aromatic matrix and facilitated biomass transformation by enhancing the depolymerization of lignin into micromolecular phenolics (e.g., guaiacol, p-ethyl guaiacol, etc.). The optimum conditions of pyrolysis at 250 °C and oxidation with 6 mL H2O2 (5 wt%) yielded up to 19.28 ± 1.30 wt% artificial humic acid (AHA) from cotton stalks. In addition, we used iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) to catalyze biomass transformation and investigated the effect of FeOOH on the composition and properties of AHS. 1.5 wt% FeOOH promoted the increased content of artificial fulvic acid (AFA) in AHS from 10.1% to 26.5%, eventually improving the activity of AHS. FeOOH raised the content of oxygen-containing groups, such as carboxylic acids and aldehyde, and significantly increased polysaccharide (10.94%–18.95%) and protein (1.95%–2.18%) derivatives. Polymerization of amino acid analogs and many small-molecule carbohydrates (e.g., furans, aldehydes, ketones, and their derivatives) promoted AFA formation. Finally, carbon flow analysis and maize incubation tests confirmed that AHS were expected to achieve carbon emission reductions and reduce environmental pollution from fertilizers. This study provides a sustainable strategy for the accelerated production of AHS, which has important application value for waste biomass resource utilization."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

To restore utility or natural values to degraded ecosystems, various compounds are applied. In this study, the impacts of additives of various origin and composition on Polish (Eutric Cambisol) and Bulgarian (Epicalcic Chernozem) soils were compared. The main goal of the study was to make a comprehensive assessment of the validity of using popular soil additives in a real context.\nMaterials and methods\n\nPhysicochemical and hydrophysical parameters including pH, variable surface charge, porosity, specific surface area, wettability, sorption capacity relative to trace metals, and water retention of soils were taken into account. Surface charge and porosity of soils were determined using potentiometric titration and nitrogen adsorption/desorption method, respectively. Wettability was measured by sessile-drop method, whereas water retention, using different matric potentials (pF curves). Sorption study on trace metals included isotherm and kinetics determination as well as experimental data modeling.\nResults and discussion\n\nThe most positive effect on soil surface charge, porosity, wettability, and cadmium (Cd) sorption was observed for synthetic zeolite, zeolite-carbon composite, and vermicompost. This effect was noted only for Polish soil characterized by poor porosity, low content of organic carbon, and moderately acidic reaction. For eroded Bulgarian soil, the condition of which was definitely better, the impact of modifiers was not spectacular. Among tested amendments, only divergan increased water retention properties of both examined soils significantly.\nConclusions\n\nZeolite, zeolite-carbon composite, and vermicompost can be apply for degraded soils of low organic carbon content, poor porosity, and moderately acidic pH to improve their physicochemical parameters and sorption ability toward trace metals. Divergan should be used to improve water retention of degraded soils during their reclamation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

In addition, a specific chitinous waste in the form of insect larvae and pupae exuvia is also left. Recent research tries to manage it, e.g., by producing chitin and chitosan, which are value-added products. The circular economy approach requires testing new, non-standard management methods that can develop products with unique properties. To date, the possibility of biochar production from chitinous waste derived from insects has not been evaluated. Here we show that the puparia of <jats:italic>Hermetia illucens</jats:italic> are suitable for biochar production, which in turn exhibits original characteristics. We found that the biochars have a high nitrogen level, which is rarely achievable in materials of natural origin without artificial doping. This study presents a detailed chemical and physical characterization of the biochars. Moreover, ecotoxicological analysis has revealed the biochars’ stimulation effect on plant root growth and the reproduction of the soil invertebrate <jats:italic>Folsomia candida</jats:italic>, as well as the lack of a toxic effect on its mortality. This predisposes these novel materials with already built-in stimulating properties to be used in agronomy, for example as a carriers for fertilizers or beneficial bacteria.</jats:p>"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The samples were synthesized by physical adsorption of poly(dimethylsiloxane) onto P-MWCNTs surfaces in the amount from 5 to 20 wt%. The effect of different content of adsorbed polymer on the structure and properties of the prepared nanocomposites was studied in detail using ATR-FTIR, SEM, TEM, XRD and RS techniques. XPS results showed that with the increase of adsorbed PDMS onto the MWCNTs surfaces, the Si 2p atomic percentage increased from 1.5 to 5.0 at. %. The investigation of thermal properties using TGA/DSC techniques in air atmosphere revealed that polymer adsorption on the MWCNTs surfaces enhances the thermo-oxidative stability of the nanocomposites to a great extent. The WCA of MWCNTs@PDMS-1000(20) nanocomposite reached 138.9° while this value was 81.8° in the case of the P-MWCNTs. The electrical characterization of the examined samples demonstrated a non-linear current–voltage behaviour and the invariance of the electrical current value with the increasing polymer content in the nanocomposites. The results suggest that the obtained nanocomposites have multi-functional surfaces and are promising for integration into a silicon-based polymer matrix for the development of new materials for electronic devices."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","name":"Wydział Chemii","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f7878c28a0473a023c","5e7092f8878c28a0473a02ee"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Legume-cereal intercropping for dual seed production could offer environmental and economic advantages. However, barriers hinder widespread adoption by farmers. This study analyzes the results of seven focus groups with 220 diverse stakeholders. Barriers, enabling factors, and strategies for the adoption of grain legume-cereal intercropping were assessed to determine food system transition strategies. The five strategies for intercropping support related to farm, food, advice, governance, and network systems. Farmer-led, institutionally supported, and research-informed advice systems, effective governance, and increased networking would enable strategic pathways for regional food and feed production through intercropping."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The effect of operational parameters such as the concentration of SA as well as the poly condensation time on the structural and morphological properties of resorcinol‐formaldehyde resins (RFR) and carbon‐derived composites was investigated for further use as adsorbents. The synthesised composites were characterised by FTIR, SEM, Raman spectroscopy and N2 adsorption/desorption technique. It was found that the morphology, specific surface area (SBET~347‐559 m2/g), volume and particle size distribution (~0.5–4 μm) and porosity (Vpor=0.178‐0.348 cm3/g) of the composites were influenced by the concentration of SA and the synthesis technique and determined the adsorption properties of the materials. It was found that the surface of the filled chars was found to have an affinity for heavy metals and has the ability to form chemical bonds with cadmium ions. The maximum sorption capacities for Cd(II), i.e. 13.28 mg/g, were observed for the sample synthesised with the highest SA content.

The main aim of the work was to find an adequate replacement of the chemical toxic cross-linking agent MBAAm (N,N'-methylene-bis-acrylamide) by using non-toxic—natural clay MMT for synthesis of pAAm gels, which are planned to be used as soil conditioners. A series of hydrogels based on acrylic monomers (acrylamide (AAm), acrylonitrile (AN), acrylic acid (AA)) physically cross–linked by MMT and chemically cross-linked were synthesized. For the synthesized gels, the influence of the synthesis method on the formation of the structure and the mechanism of thermal destruction in the presence of air was analyzed using a set of physicochemical methods: FTIR, XRD, SEM, DSC and TG/DTG. According to FTIR and XRD data, pAAm-MMT and pAAm-AN-MMT samples formed an intercalated/exfoliated structure, whereas pAAm-AA-MMT had an intercalated structure.

We initially tested the antifungal effect of six natural extracts against 20 isolates of Neosartorya spp. using a traditional inhibition test on Petri dishes. Tested isolates did not respond uniformly, creating 5 groups of descending sensitivity. Ten isolates best representing of the established sensitivity clusters were chosen for further investigation using a Biolog™ MT2 microplate assay with the same 6 natural extracts. Additionally, to test for metabolic profile changes, we used a Biolog™ FF microplate assay after pre-incubation with marigold extract. All natural extracts had an inhibitory effect on Neosartorya spp. growth and impacted its metabolism. Lavender and tea tree oil extracts at a concentration of 1000 µg mL−1 presented the strongest antifungal effect during the inhibition test, however all extracts exhibited inhibitory properties at even the lowest dose (5 µg mL−1). The fungal stress response in the presence of marigold extract was characterized by a decrease of amino acids and carbohydrates consumption and an uptake of carboxylic acids on the FF microplates, where the 10 studied isolates also presented differences in their innate resilience, creating 3 distinctive sensitivity groups of high, average and low sensitivity.

Light-roast coffee beans, referred to as the Cinnamon roast, were obtained at 198°C. In turn, American roast beans were obtained at 212°C before the second crack, and dark beans classified as the Italian roast were obtained in a roasting process carried out at 228-230°C. The content of bioactive compounds in green coffee beans was determined as well. The ‘Typica’ cultivar of Arabica coffee originating from a plantation located at an altitude of 1680 m a.s.l. in Huehuetenango Department, Guatemala, was used in the study. The analyses showed that the different parameters of coffee bean roasting (Cinnamon, American, and Italian roast) resulted in differences in the levels of phenolic compounds, caffeine, and tocopherols. The American roast style was shown to be the most balanced type of roasting in terms of the content of bioactive compounds as well as the chemical groups and profile of volatile compounds. This roasting type also exhibited the highest intensity of emission of volatile compounds, which is expected by the consumer. The study also demonstrated that the coffee bean roasting process generated different levels of phenolic compounds, caffeine, and tocopherols."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0f","uid":"br7hcJFLf6iH-raneJQQ4Eg","uuid":"ca2a2d0a-202a-4189-8c9c-3f9d36488fba","name":"Instytut Technologiczno-Przyrodniczy - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709224878c28a0473908ef"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0f","parentUuid":"ca2a2d0a-202a-4189-8c9c-3f9d36488fba","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0f","rootUuid":"ca2a2d0a-202a-4189-8c9c-3f9d36488fba","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","uid":"bt6mbuLY9Vpc_KWGkV1Lk4w","uuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Lublinie","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709224878c28a047390979"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6432","5e709345878c28a0473a625f"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Three different amendments were tested: cellulose waste, biochar, and dolomite. The efficiency of metal immobilization in mixtures was dependent on pH, which increased with concentrations of amendment. The higher negative charge observed for dolomite and cellulose waste corresponded with greater attraction of cations and enhanced metal sorption. For cellulose waste, the highest values of the Q parameter were attributed to the presence of OH groups, which corresponded with the highest immobilization of metals. Biochar reduced the negative surface charge, which highlights the importance of additional factors such as high specific surface area and volume of pores in metal immobilization. All amendments increased the SSA and VN2, indicating a higher number of sorption sites for metal immobilization. Most bioassays established a reduction of the ecotoxicity for amendments. Mixtures with dolomite (25%, 45% doses) and biochar (45% dose) were low toxic. Mixtures with cellulose waste were toxic or highly toxic. The mobility of metals from contaminated sediments can be limited by reused industry side products, which could contribute to further closing the circular economy loop."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

In most cases, BCs and Zs are characterized by well-developed specific surface area, high porosity, and excellent sorption properties, which is highly helpful in soil reclamation or conditioning. This literature review compares impact of BCs and Zs on the physicochemical properties of various soils as well as economic aspects of their synthesis.\nMaterials and methods\n\nThe review was prepared based on the articles published in the last 5 years (2018–2023). The articles were selected from the ScienceDirect® database using the keywords: ‘biochar/zeolite impact on soil physicochemical properties’, ‘biochar/zeolite impact on water retention of soil’ and ‘biochar/zeolite economic aspects’.\nResults and discussion\n\nBased on the available data, it can be stated that both BCs and Zs have good sorptive properties, which usually contributes to better growth of crops. Comparing them and choosing which one is more promising depends on the specific purpose and type of soil to which they are to be applied. BCs usage contributes mainly to providing organic matter and improving soil structure, while Zs enhance soil water retention. The profitability of BCs/Zs production depends largely on the precursor as well as the synthesis method.\nConclusions\n\nDue to the fact that impact of synthetic Zs on the soil environment is much less frequently investigated than that of BCs, the research using Zs and various soil types is especially needed.

Most of the focus has been on their ability to sequester atmospheric CO2, while there is less information on the two other major greenhouse gases (GHGs), N2O and CH4. We examined the GHG budgets of ten forest soils in Poland, considering all three major GHGs, where no previous long-term measurements had been made, which encompassed different tree species, stand age, and contrasting edaphic conditions. In addition to the quantification and assessment of seasonal variability in the major soil GHG fluxes over two years, the aims of the present study were (i) the identification of the main drivers of the soil-based GHG fluxes, (ii) the determination of the contribution of each gas to the Global Warming Potential (GWP), and (iii) to assess the mitigation potential of these fluxes over different forest systems. All the forest soils were sources of CO2 and N2O and sinks for atmospheric CH4 with pronounced seasonal variations in CO2 and CH4 driven by soil moisture and temperature. The soils showed significant differences in annual GHG fluxes, with average values of 16.7 Mg CO2 ha−1, − 3.51 kg CH4 ha−1, and 0.95 kg N2O ha−1. The annual total GWP ranged from 13.1 to 22.0 Mg CO2 eq ha−1 with CO2 making the highest contribution, and forest-specific CH4 uptake resulting in a reduction in GWP, ranging from − 0.08% (in the youngest forest) to -0.97% (in the oldest forest). Mixed forests showed the greatest potential for climate change mitigation, with the highest soil C sequestration, and the lowest GWP values when compared to sites with monocultures. The results suggest that a mixture of tree species could eventually be incorporated into management plans to increase the effectiveness of forests in climate change mitigation."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Fruit Grown in an Organic Farming System","otherTitles":[],"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Non-chemical methods of fertilisation and protection have been gaining importance in recent years. This trend is closely linked to current European Union (EU) agricultural policy and the growing consumer awareness of the impact of nutrition on health. Newly developed biopreparations have to be tested for their agricultural efficiency alongside a quality assessment of the resulting food. The aim of this study was to determine whether the use of newly developed microbially enriched fertilisers in organic strawberry cultivation had an effect on fruit chemical composition and heavy metal accumulation. In the research, five biopreparations (K2–K6 combinations) containing selected Bacillus strains and plant extracts were tested in 2021 and 2022 on three strawberry cultivars: ‘Honeoye’, ‘Rumba’, and ‘Vibrant’. After the vegetation period, the collected fruit samples were frozen, freeze-dried, and subjected to chemical analyses to determine the total carbon and nitrogen content, as well as the concentration of microelements (Mn, Fe), macroelements (Na, Mg, K, Ca, P) and heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn). The application of the tested biopreparations did not significantly impact the total carbon content of strawberry fruit. For most of the tested traits, cultivars reacted differently to the tested preparations. A higher total nitrogen content was found for treatments treated with biopreparations, especially for the ‘Vibrant’ cultivar—ranging from 15.2 g·kg−1 K2 (BacilRoots) to 16.3 g·kg−1 K3 (BacilRoots + BacilExtra) and K5 (BacilRoots + BacilExtra + BacilHumus)—being about 10–18% higher than on the control object (K1). The content of sodium, phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium did not change significantly under the influence of biopreparations. The use of the K3 and K5 treatment resulted in significantly lower iron contents when compared to those of the control (strawberries sprayed with water with no biopreparations added)—respectively, by 16.1% and 17.9%. ‘Vibrant’ treated with water (control treatment) showed the highest contents of iron, copper, and zinc when compared to those treated with biopreparations. No exceedances of the permissible heavy metal content were found in the samples tested."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","uid":"boRt8XbJIJxFX3j3lPkVVng","uuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","name":"Instytut Uprawy Nawożenia i Gleboznawstwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709349878c28a0473a6693","63d0a2397523407151529b51","5e70929c878c28a047399199","5e70947c878c28a0473be18d"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","parentUuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","rootUuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

This energy plant, which is known for its many uses, was examined in terms of the location and differentiation of sclerenchyma fibres. They are present in the stem and are arranged in two rings formed by bundles with variable thickness. The structure of sclerenchyma fibres is typical of strengthening tissue. A characteristic trait of the studied species is the presence of various terminal fragments of dead cells in the sclerenchyma tissue. The surface of sclerenchyma fibres was examined using atomic force microscopy (AFM) for the first time. The analyses showed a varied surface sculpture of the fibre surface, depending on the method of preparation of the fibres before analyses.

An effect of this phenomenon, in addition to the detachment and displacement of soil particles, is also the deformation of the soil surface. Climate change (including the occurrence of periods of very high temperatures) can affect the intensity of soil erosion processes. The aim of this work is to determine the influence of selected temperature conditions on soil surface deformation caused by the splash phenomenon at the initial stage of erosion. The goal was achieved by measuring the morphology of craters formed by the impact of a single drop. The research included the use of three soils varying in particle size distribution: loamy sand, sandy loam, and silty loam. Additionally, the work took into account two variants of initial soil moisture and three temperature conditions (including various temperatures of soil, air, and drop-forming water). The measurements were taken with a 3D scanner, determining depth, equivalent diameter, volume of the craters, and a dimensionless parameter α (depth-to-diameter ratio). Temperature effects were observed in silty loam, where craters became wider (from average diameter of 9.41 ± 0.31 to 10.47 ± 0.21 mm for pF = 1) but shallower (from average depth of 1.28 ± 0.05 to 1.00 ± 0.05 mm for pF = 1) with increasing temperature, and in loamy sand, where temperature influenced the differences in diameter and volume of craters formed between varying moisture conditions. The differences in crater morphology could be due to the influence of temperature on the viscosity and surface tension of water, which may have led to a change in susceptibility to deformation. The results provide an opportunity to better understand the evolution of erosion in the context of different thermal conditions and thus in some perspective on the impact of climate change.\n\n    Previous article in issue"}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

An increase in the amount of the APL fibre, characterised by higher hydration potential than CRB, and the moisturising treatment were associated with greater dynamics of gluten hydration (PhH) and dehydration (PhD) processes, which in turn contributed to the earlier initiation of the development of the dough gluten network (PDT), its chemical dehydration (ChDp2 and ChDp3 assigned to dehydration peaks p2 and p3), and mechanical disruption (MD) as well as flattening of the destructive effect of mixing (FF). Concurrently, the speed of these processes increased and their duration was shortened.

Considering the great differences between P. lingam and P. biglobosus, we hypothesized their metabolic capacities vary to a great extent. The experiment was done using the FF microplates (Biolog Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) containing 95 carbon sources and tetrazolium dye. The fungi P. lingam and P. biglobosus subclade ‘brassicae’ (3 isolates per group) were cultured on PDA medium for 6 weeks at 20 °C and then fungal spores were used as inoculum of microplates. The test was carried out in triplicate. We have demonstrated that substrate richness, calculated as the number of utilized substrates (measured at λ490 nm), and the number of substrates allowing effective growth of the isolates (λ750 nm), showed significant differences among tested species. The most efficient isolate of P. lingam utilized 36 carbon sources, whereas P. biglobosus utilized 60 substrates. Among them, 25–29 carbon sources for P. lingam and 34–48 substrates for P. biglobosus were efficiently used, allowing their growth. Cluster analysis based on Senath criteria divided P. biglobosus into two groups and P. lingam isolates formed one group (33% similarity).

Antibiotic resistance profiles showed minimal resistance genes, reducing environmental risks. Sensitivity to fungicides was assessed, with T. koningiopsis sensitive to Siarkol and B. velezensis to Zato and Luna fungicides, supporting their compatibility with orchard practices.

Additionally, an analysis of phenolic acids and flavonoid compounds using UPLC-MS/MS was conducted, alongside an evaluation of the pasta’s cooking characteristics. The findings revealed that the inclusion of freeze-dried strawberry powder significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced the pasta’s ash and fiber content, while the levels of protein and fat were reduced. Furthermore, the enrichment process led to an increase in the redness of both raw and cooked pasta, while the lightness and yellowness were diminished. Freeze-dried strawberry also caused increase deformation up to the rapture point but without a significant change in force during the stretching of cooked pasta. The incorporation of strawberries into the pasta formulation led to a significant increase in phenolic content, antioxidant activity, and cooking loss.

A silo model was designed, and discrete element method (DEM) simulations were performed to analyze an influence of the depth and wavelengths of corrugations on mass flow rate, wall pressures, location of the shear band and effective wall friction coefficient. The dimensions of the geometry adopted correspond to one of the vertical sections of the silo model with corrugated steel walls instrumented by the authors. This silo model consisted of a square cross section (0.45 x 0.45 ) and 0.75 m in height, a flat bottom with a centric, square outlet (0.06 x 0.06 ), corrugated lateral steel walls, and smooth, transparent methacrylate front and back walls. The bulk material was pinewood pellets, whose mechanical and numerical properties had been previously obtained by the authors. The numerical results show an influence of the depth of corrugation and the wavelength on the velocity of the granular particles and the friction forces against the wall. The initial position of the shear band was found to be placed between 1 and 3.5 times the average size of the particles from the vertical line connecting two consecutive corrugation peaks closest to the silo outlet. The effective wall friction coefficient for corrugated walls depends on the wavelength and the depth of the corrugations, varying in the range of 0.42 to 0.9, in opposition to the single theoretical value of 0.78 proposed by Eurocode EN 1991-4, for a sinusoidal profile, regardless of the geometrical parameters."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The experiment, employed a randomized complete block design with three replicates of poultry droppings, cow dung, cocoa pod husks and a no fertilizer control. Soil fertility was significantly enhanced due to increased organic carbon, exchangeable Ca, K, Mg, total N, and available P. Poultry droppings exerted the most significant impact. This improvement in soil quality translated into notable growth parameters for cucumber. Poultry droppings resulted in the highest vine length (168 cm), leaf number (25), and branch number (12), while the control exhibited the lowest values. Cucumber yield significantly increased with poultry droppings the highest (11.3 t/ha) and the control the lowest (5.5 t/ha). Cucumber fruit length was influenced by the treatments, with the longest in poultry droppings (20 cm) and the shortest in the control (12 cm). Strong correlations were observed between cucumber yield and total nitrogen (r = 0.98995), available phosphorus (r = 0.99393), and potassium (r = 0.84688).

Seven different varieties of beans and lentils were used to extract total phenolic content using 50% (v/v) aqueous ethanol. In samples of germinated seeds, the legumes showed significantly (p<0.05%) higher total phenolic content, 2-2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazine, and antioxidant activity. However, the analysis revealed an increase in the total phenolic content content in sprouted beans and lentils and decreased activity in dried beans.

It is a crucial task to evaluate and boost their growth intensity and metabolic activity through an efficient and accurate method with novel nutritional sources. In the current study, Biolog MT2 microplates were used to evaluate the T. atroviride G79/11 growth intensity and metabolic activity in the presence of polysaccharide additives such as pectin fractions (water-soluble pectin-WSP, diluted alkali-soluble pectin-DASP, and oxalate soluble pectin-OSP) and bacterial cellulose (BC), fortified with inorganic salts. Pectin, as a significant component of fruit and vegetable industry waste, and bacterial cellulose, which has an exceptional water retention capacity, were used for the first time to stimulate the growth of T. atroviride G79/11. The highest metabolic efficiency of T. artoviride G79/11 was observed in WSP and OSP fractions supplemented with Ca, Zn, Mg and Fe. Glucose was recorded as a dominant constituent of BC composition, whereas galacturonic acid was detected with the highest amount of 84.53 %, 7.56 %, and 71.70 % of OSP, WSP, and DASP fractions, respectively. Applied polysaccharide solutions significantly differed in viscosity, which was also influenced by the sterilization process. The strain showed significantly high growth intensity and metabolic activity in potato dextrose broth amended with WSP, BC, ZnCl2, saccharose, glucose, starch, and a combination of OSP with CaCl2 additive as compared to its respective groups and combinations as well as FF-IF. This study emphasizes that natural polysaccharides and their possible composites can boost the growth intensity and metabolic activities of the fungal strain."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Hence, we explored the potential of innovative microbiologically enriched NPK fertilizer (called biofertilizer) to stimulate the activity and diversity of soil microbial communities in two degraded soils - Brunic Arenosol (BA) and Abruptic Luvisol (AL), under maize cultivation. The two year field experiments included the following treatments - standard, optimal dose of mineral fertilizer without microbial enrichment (PC/PK) designed to meet the nutritional requirements of maize and serving as the control treatment, optimal dose amended with beneficial bacterial strains (PA100/PW100) and a dose containing 40 % less NPK fertilizer but enriched with microorganisms (PA60/PW60). The application of biofertilizer stimulated the activity of key enzymes involved in carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus biotransformations in the soil, modified the metabolic profile of soil microorganisms and changed the genetic diversity of bacteria, archaea and fungi. We observed the increased number and the presence of specific terminal restriction fragments pointing on the higher diversity within microbial communities. Next Generation Sequencing revealed that biofertilizer modified the community composition at different taxonomic levels, increased number of functional sequences assigned to metabolic processes of various compounds and higher relative abundance of fungal trophic modes and ecological guilds important for soil health. The obtained results showed that microbiologically enriched NPK fertilizer exhibits multifarious actions and has a potential to improve soil microbiome quality and diversity, as well as influencing yield of maize production."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The tested wheat variety was IS Laudis and an industrial milling station with several roll sections was employed to reach 30 passages of flour streams. Each mill stream fraction was analyzed separately. Several physiochemical (moisture, ash content, falling number, wet gluten content, gluten index, and damaged starch content) and rheological properties were evaluated by means of utilizing various test apparatus and techniques. The total content of non-starch polysaccharides and arabinoxylans, as well as soluble and insoluble fractions were investigated. Results showed significant differences between the mill streams in terms of the content of physicochemical parameters and rheological properties, as well as in soluble and insoluble fractions of non-starch polysaccharides and arabinoxylans. The relationships between the tested parameters and PCA analysis can be useful for millers who can then select and blend several flour streams to obtain a maximum amount of flour with specified characteristics. A better understanding of the origin and function of different fractions and the role of arabinoxylans and their fractions in the milling process will allow the development of wheat flour blends with the desired functionality. Flours from late reduction and sizing passages (C and R) as well as from sorting filter (V) streams showed high ash content as well as T-NSP and T-AX levels, so the final content of NSP in flour blends may be balanced by the application of the proper amount of C6–C7 and R5 stream flours."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918c878c28a04737e08c","uid":"bbip_kWUjcRWwim80LuSB4g","uuid":"92447067-30f0-4cec-82d0-68fd4d6f1c81","name":"Wydział Inżynierii Produkcji i Energetyki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f7878c28a0473b4177"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","parentUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","rootUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The models consider technical variables such as stiffness, k, tool depth-to-width ratio, d/w, tool movement speed, v, and soil moisture content, MC, which have not been thoroughly analysed in the literature. The correlation coefficients for predicting Fx and Fy values were 0.4996 and 0.6227, respectively. Statistical analysis confirmed the significant effect of these parameters on the forces acting on the tools, with the variables d/w and v having the most critical impact on Fx and Fy. The SLSQP (sequential least squares programming) optimisation method was used to determine the optimal values of technical variables. The maximum value of Fx was 438.55 N, and the minimum was 98.98 N, with variable values at the edges of the studied ranges. Similarly, Fy values of 135.25 N and −84.55 N, respectively, were obtained. The optimisation results showed good fitness with experimental results, and the negative relative errors (from −1.72% do −4.81%), indicating overestimating, confirmed the accuracy of the model’s predictions.

The magnetic behavior of fuel leads to a change in the interaction of hydrocarbon and oxygen molecules. This study aimed to evaluate the fuel consumption and engine vibration (time domain) of the Perkins A63544 diesel engine using magnetized fuel. The vibration of an internal combustion engine can cause failure in engine components and discomfort and injury to users. Engine vibration behavior changes due to changes in fuel types and engine combustion. Therefore, in this study, the vibration behavior of the tractor engine (Perkins model, four-stroke, direct injection diesel) was evaluated in stationary mode at different engine speeds due to changes in fuel types. Three accelerometers (CTC AC102 model) were used to measure the vibration acceleration. The fuels used included diesel as a normal control and fuels that had been subjected to magnetic field intensities of 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 gauss. The longitudinal, vertical, and lateral vibration signals with 5 levels of engine speed were measured. The results illustrated that the vibration root mean square (RMS) values were essentially (p < 0.01) affected by the engine speed, fuel type, and their interactions. It was found that for the 4000-gauss magnetized fuel, the average vibration acceleration using the five velocity settings reduced by 15%, 15.30%, 12.40%, 12.35%, and 15.38% compared to the respective control fuels. The results showed that engine fuel consumption and specific fuel consumption decreased by 2.3% using the 4000-gauss magnetized fuel compared with the normal control fuel."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918c878c28a04737e08c","uid":"bbip_kWUjcRWwim80LuSB4g","uuid":"92447067-30f0-4cec-82d0-68fd4d6f1c81","name":"Wydział Inżynierii Produkcji i Energetyki","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60409dc59543c711bc6ea70d","5e7093f7878c28a0473b4177"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","parentUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","rootUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The research examines the influence of incorporating carbonated fly ash on the protective properties of the concrete cover for steel reinforcement, along with an analysis of the mechanical behavior of the specimens, resistance to weathering carbonation, and the modeling of the service life of reinforced concrete structures. The results indicate that the compressive strength of concrete specimens decreases with the addition of carbonated ash, though by no more than 9% after 90 days. The carbonation rate of concrete increases with the addition of ash; however, a roughly 4% lower rate was observed for carbonated ash compared to non-carbonated ash. No significant impact of ash carbonation on chloride diffusion or the corrosion process of reinforcement in mortars was detected. As a result, the estimated service life of concrete containing both ash and carbonated ash is over 20 times longer than that of the reference concrete."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

This is particularly relevant to the current situation where we are struggling with environmental degradation, exacerbated by human activities related to various types of industry and intensive agriculture. Goethite is a common and widespread mineral occurring in in many regions of Poland; it is also present in the USA, Germany, Great Britain, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Algeria, Morocco, Canada, and Russia. During the experiments, goethite was coated with polymer (polyelectrolyte) layers, which allowed to create new adsorbent materials with different properties. One anionic polymer – poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) and one cationic polymer – poly(diallyldimethylammonium) (PDADMAC) were selected for this purpose. Both polyelectrolytes are popular and readily available, making the application potential of this research relatively high. The coating process was monitored based on the changes in the zeta potential of the goethite suspensions. For these measurements, the zeta potential analyzer „Zeta Plus” (BROOKHAVEN INSTRUMENTS CORPORATION) was used. Moreover, to adjust the appropriate pH of the system for the coating process a lab pH meter (METROHM 827) with combined micro electrode 6.0234.100 3M KCl was used. The change in the sign of zeta potential of goethite observed after the adsorption process confirmed the formation of polymer layer on the surface of solid particles. For example, at pH 5 the zeta potential of the goethite sample without polyelectrolyte was equal to +20.9 mV, with adsorbed PSS – -57.3 mV, whereas with PSS+PDADMAC layers – +53.4 mV. This type of research can contribute to the development of adsorbents based on natural solids with much better properties than uncoated minerals."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Among this large group of phenolic compounds, two large groups were distinguished: phenolic acids and flavonoids. Due to their antioxidant properties, they can have a positive effect on the human body. One of the ways to deliver polyphenols to the body can be enriching food. Bread, which for many is one of the main diet components, may be a suitable carrier of these compounds. However, supplementation of a wheat dough with different substances can disturb proper structure of the gluten network and thus deterioration of the quality of bread. The gluten network, which consists of two types of proteins: gliadins and glutenins, maintains the appropriate consistency and structure of the dough during its fermentation and baking. The aim of the research was to examine the effect of selected flavonoids (quercetin, hesperitin ) and their glycosides (rutin, hesperidin) on the structure and properties of the gluten network. These compounds were added in concentrations of 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2% to the model flour consisting of wheat starch and wheat gluten in a proportion 80:15 (w/w). The samples obtained as a result of dough mixing, gluten washing out and lyophilization were tested using FT-Raman spectroscopy. FT-Raman spectroscopy allows to study the secondary and tertiary structure of gluten proteins by analysis of amide I and band associated with disulfide bridges region (490-560 cm-1), respectively. In addition, this method allows the study of the environment of two aromatic amino acids – tyrosine (800-880 cm-1) and tryptophan (740-780 cm-1). Analysis of the results showed that addition of flavonoids and their glycosides to model dough causes changes in the gluten network structure. These changes are probably related to the structure of the added polyphenols. Quercetin and rutin contain only hydroxyl groups in their structure and cause similar changes. Hesperetin and hesperidin cause other changes that are probably related to the presence of a methyl group. In the presence of quercetin and its glycoside, the number of disulfide bridges in the conformation of g-g-g (most stable energy) decreased.

They are used to increase water retention and prolong the release of mineral fertilizers and pesticides. Hydrogels could be crosslinked via chemical (covalent bonds) and physical (van der Waals forces, hydrogen, and ionic bonds) interactions. Clays can be used as crosslinkers due to their layered structure: monomers can penetrate between clays layers, increase the interplanar distance and connect polymer chains. After polymerization both intercalated and exfoliated nanocomposites can be obtained. Clays can also improve the mechanical properties and thermostability of hydrogels. The research aimed to determine the effects of the structure of monomer and clay, as well as their ratio on the resulted hydrogel structure formation and the swelling and sorption properties of composites. Three composites with montmorillonite (MMT) were synthesized by radical polymerization of monomers from aqueous solutions: (i) homopolyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogel; (ii) PAM copolymers with acrylonitrile; (iii) PAM with acrylic acid. Analysis of the FTIR spectra of composite hydrogels showed that the band attributed to Si-O bonds occurring at 990 cm-1 for montmorillonite was shifted to 1020 cm-1 for composites which confirmed the formation of intercalated structure. The swelling capacity is a key characteristic of hydrogels, which can also influence their fertilizer release behaviors. Water uptake was maximal for composites with 5-15 % wt. MMT. Further increasing clay content in hydrogel leads to a higher crosslinking degree and decreased swelling ability. The highest absorption (up to 140 g/g) was obtained for acrylic acid copolymer due to the presence of carboxylic groups and the lowest (20 g/g) one for acrylonitrile copolymer owing to its hydrophobic properties. All synthesized MMT-hydrogel composites exhibited higher swelling degrees than chemically-crosslinked analogs (up to 45 g/g for acrylic acid copolymer cross-linked with N,N’-methylenebisacrylamide)."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

In this study, we demonstrate the utility of glycine-derived designer micelles, N-lauroyl-N-(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)glycine (PyN12G), as a capping agent to prepare black bismuth oxide nanoparticles (Bi2O3 NPs). The obtained Bi2O3 NPs were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that the Bi2O3 NPs are crystalline, with a quasi-spherical morphology and an average size of 42.3 nm, which are further corroborated by powder X-ray diffraction studies to be monoclinic. Fourier transform infrared spectra revealed that the surface of Bi2O3 NPs was stabilized by PyN12G and that the –COOH group of the micelles was involved in surface functionalization. The application of Bi2O3 NPs in environmental remediation was demonstrated by degrading a toxic dye, Congo red (CR). Bi2O3 NPs catalyze sodium borohydride-mediated CR degradation with an efficiency of 88.8% in 15 minutes and a rate constant of 1.92 × 10−3 s−1. Besides CR, Bi2O3 NPs catalyzed the degradation of methylene blue, bromophenol blue, Coomassie blue, crystal violet, and rhodamine B with efficiencies of 95%, 92%, 95%, 90%, and 86%, respectively. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis reveals that CR is degraded into smaller molecules. The disclosed dye degradation process eliminates the hazardous feature of the dye, which was proven by the seed germination assay. Furthermore, toxicology experiments revealed that Bi2O3 NPs do not affect bacterial growth or seed germination, proving that the NPs are non-toxic and safe to use as a chemocatalyst to eliminate toxic dyes without affecting the environment."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

This study investigates the nutritional and digestive implications of enriching wheat dough with RuBisCO, in comparison to pea protein-enriched and gluten-enriched doughs. The protein quality and digestibility of these enriched doughs were analysed through dough characterization, in vitro digestion experiments and biochemical analysis of digesta. Our findings indicate that an enrichment at 10% of RuBisCO or pea proteins improves the chemical score and the in vitro PDCAAS (IV-PDCAAS) score of wheat dough as compared to the control dough. Digestibility assays suggest that RuBisCO introduction modifies the protein hydrolysis kinetics: the nitrogen release is lower during gastric digestion but larger during intestinal digestion than other samples. The analysis of the protein composition of the soluble and insoluble parts of digesta, using size-exclusion chromatography, reveals that the protein network in RuBisCO-enriched dough is more resistant to gastric hydrolysis than the ones of other doughs. Indeed, non-covalently bound peptides and disulfide-bound protein aggregates partly composed of RuBisCO subunits remain insoluble at the end of the gastric phase.

The composition and structure of cell walls change considerably during growth, storage and shelf life. The study of the mechanical properties at the cellular level of fruit tissues could aid in determining the impact of cell wall structure changes. To this end, a hydromechanical model based on discrete element modeling (DEM) is under development, for which quantitative measures of the cellular stiffness were be obtained. To quantify the stiffness of pome fruit tissues, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed on apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) and pear (Pyrus communis L.) tissues. The Youngs modulus was identified from tissue samples of 3 different maturities: young fruits (60 to 70 days after full bloom), mature fruits (130 to 140 days after full bloom) and mature fruits kept in shelf life conditions (20°C, 12 days). The Sneddon model was used for extracting the Youngs modulus from the indentation curves. The results showed an exponentially decaying distribution of Youngs modulus values for all time points. For apple, the AFM measurements suggest an increase in stiffness of the cells from the early stage toward maturity, and a softening after shelf life conditions. For pear on the other hand, the average Youngs modulus decreased until maturity, and decreased rapidly even further during shelf life. These results provide physiological parameters for use in hydromechanical models of pome fruit tissues during growth and postharvest handling."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Using of broadband dielectric spectroscopy measurements, it was found out that the percolation threshold of composite films lies in the MWCNTs concentration range of 0.5 - 1.5 wt. % in polymer matrix. For nanocomposites above to the percolation threshold, the impedance response showed a shift from conductive to dielectric-like behavior as frequency is increased.

Photosynthetic efficiency, directly impacts biomass production, is dependent on both water availability and the quality and quantity of light. Understanding how these factors interact is crucial for improving crop yields. Many overlapping signalling pathways and functions of common bioactive molecules that shape plant responses to both water deficit and light have been identified and discussed in this review. Separate or combined action of these environmental factors include the generation of reactive oxygen species, biosynthesis of abscisic acid, stomatal functioning, chloroplast movement and alterations in the levels of photosynthetic pigments and bioactive molecules. Plant response to water deficit depends on light intensity and its characteristics, with differentiated impacts from UV, blue, and red light bands determining the strength and synergistic or antagonistic nature of interactions. Despite its significance, the combined effects of these environmental factors remain insufficiently explored.

To improve polyphenols stability during food processing and storage, they could be encapsulated in colloidal systems e.g. via complexation with proteins. The process of gliadin protein and phenolic acids complexation was investigated with application of fluorescence spectroscopy. Strong fluorescence quenching of gliadin was observed as a result of phenolic addition and two types of quenching mechanism were determined: dynamic (for coumaric acid) and static (for caffeic, ferulic and sinapic acid). This result indicates that coumaric acid, unlike to other analysed acids, does not form complexes with gliadin. The binding constant for caffeic, ferulic and sinapic acid – gliadin interaction is between 0.4 and 8.7 x 103 M-1. These three acids induced changes in protein conformation and tryptophan microenvironment. The calculated number of binding sites suggests that caffeic, ferulic and sinapic acids interact with gliadin to form 1:1 complexes. Analysis of thermodynamic parameters suggested that van der Waals and/or hydrogen bonding interactions play major role in the interactions between caffeic, ferulic as well as sinapic acid and gliadin."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The purpose of this study was to reveal the relationship between the surface properties of coals and the intrinsic microbial communities involved in methane formation. The material examined included nine coals varying in maturity and methane-bearing capacity. Compilation of data on wettability (θw) (measured by a sessile drop method) and microbial community composition (next-generation sequencing (NGS)) revealed that the occurrence of Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and methanogenic Euryarchaeota was significantly, positively (P < 0.05) correlated with θw of coal. The dependence was the opposite for Actinobacteria. These results suggest that the groups of microorganisms responsible for the decomposition of organic matter in bituminous coals (hydrophobic) and lignites (hydrophilic) differ, which may impact methane formation in the seams. This is because Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes stimulate this process, while the influence of Actinobacteria is the opposite. Our work demonstrates for the first time the links between the surface properties of coals, geotectonic conditions, microbial ecophysiology and the methane-bearing capacity of the coals.\n."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709227878c28a047390b19"],"parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Their specific properties at different stages of the fruit ripening programme make AGPs unique markers of this process. An important function of AGPs is to co-form an amorphous extracellular matrix in the cell wall-plasma membrane continuum; thus, changes in the structure of these molecules can determine the presence and distribution of other components. The aim of the current work was to characterise the molecular structure and localisation of AGPs during the fruit ripening process in transgenic lines with silencing and overexpression of SlP4H3 genes (prolyl 4 hydroxylase 3). The objective was accomplished through comprehensive and comparative in situ and ex situ analyses of AGPs from the fruit of transgenic lines and wild-type plants at specific stages of ripening. The experiment showed that changes in prolyl 4 hydroxylases (P4H3) activity affected the content of AGPs and the progress in their modifications in the ongoing ripening process. The analysis of the transgenic lines confirmed the presence of AGPs with high molecular weights (120–60 kDa) at all the examined stages, but a changed pattern of the molecular features of AGPs was found in the last ripening stages, compared to WT.

In this study, hepatic concentrations of 21 elements (metals and metalloids) in 11 species of birds, representing various foraging habitats (such as aquatic, aquatic/terrestrial, and terrestrial) and migration modes (migratory and sedentary) representing various foraging guilds (omnivores, piscivores, and molluscivores), were analyzed. The samples (N = 84) were collected during the autumn migration period in Poland. The concentrations of elements determined in this study exhibited high inter-species variability, reflecting the diversity in contamination levels depending on food resources used by specific bird groups. Many of the investigated individuals from different species showed exceeded levels of subclinical toxicity and moderate clinical poisoning due to Cd and Hg. Higher concentrations of As, Hg, and Ba and lower V concentrations were found in migratory birds as compared to sedentary birds. Species foraging in terrestrial habitat had different concentrations of some elements compared to aquatic and aquatic/terrestrial species. Some specific inter-species differences in hepatic elemental concentrations were found. Differences in elemental concentrations among various groups can primarily be attributed to their foraging guilds, with certain elements, particularly As, V, and Hg, playing a significant role in the dissimilarity of elemental concentrations between foraging habitat groups and migratory mode groups. The data collected confirmed the limited ability of As to enter ecosystem pathways. The results of this study contribute to understanding the year-round exposure of migratory birds to environmental contamination, which can have carry-over effects on their performance in wintering and breeding grounds."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709249878c28a0473931a1"],"parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","type":"AUTHOR"},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

This process is affected by modifications in the cell wall structure, particularly in the composition of polysaccharides and proteins. The cell wall assembly is a network of polysaccharides and proteoglycans named the arabinoxylan pectin arabinogalactan protein1 (APAP1). The complex consists of the arabinogalactan protein (AGP) core with the pectin domain including arabinogalactan (AG) type II, homogalacturonan (HG), and rhamnogalacturonan I (RG-I). The present paper aims to determine the impact of a disturbance in the synthesis of one constituent on the integrity of the cell wall. Therefore, in the current work, we have tested the impact of modified expression of the SlP4H3 gene connected with proline hydroxylase (P4H) activity on AGP presence in the fruit matrix. Using an immunolabelling technique (CLSM), an immunogold method (TEM), molecular tools, and calcium mapping (SEM-EDS), we have demonstrated that disturbances in AGP synthesis affect the entire cell wall structure. Changes in the spatiotemporal AGP distribution may be related to the formation of a network between AGPs with other cell wall components. Moreover, the modified structure of the cell wall assembly induces morphological changes visible at the cellular level during the progression of the ripening process. These results support the hypothesis that AGPs and pectins are required for the proper progression of the physiological processes occurring in fruits."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The aim of this work was to investigate the impact of three trophic modes on the growth parameters, productivities of individual cell components, and biochemical composition of Chlorella sorokiniana, Chloroidium saccharofilum, and Chlorella vulgaris cells with special consideration of protein profiles detected by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. Mixotrophic conditions with the use of an agro-industrial by-product stimulated the growth of all Chlorella species, which was confirmed by the highest specific growth rates and the shortest biomass doubling times. The mixotrophic cultivation of all Chlorella species yielded a high amount of protein-rich biomass with reduced contents of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids, and carbohydrates. Additionally, this work provides the first information about the proteome of Chloroidium saccharofilum, Chlorella sorokiniana, and Chlorella vulgaris cells cultured in molasses supplementation conditions. The proteomic analysis of the three Chlorella species growing photoheterotrophically and mixotrophically showed increased accumulation of proteins involved in the cell energy metabolism and carbon uptake, photosynthesis process, and protein synthesis, as well as proteins involved in intracellular movements and chaperone proteins."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

OPs exhibit high resistance to abiotic degradation, excellent chelating properties and high biological activity. Despite the huge and increasing scale of OP production and use worldwide, little is known about their transportation and fate in the environment. Available data are dominated by information concerning the most recognised organophosphonate – the herbicide glyphosate - while other OPs have received little attention. In this paper, a comprehensive review of the current state of knowledge about natural and artificial OPs is presented (including glyphosate). Based on the available literature, a number of knowledge gaps have been identified that need to be filled in order to understand the environmental effects of these abundant compounds. Special attention has been given to GHG-related processes, with a particular focus on CH4. This stems from the recent discovery of OP-dependent CH4 production in aqueous environments under aerobic conditions. The process has changed the perception of the biogeochemical cycle of CH4, since it was previously thought that biological methane formation was only possible under anaerobic conditions. However, there is a lack of knowledge on whether OP-associated methane is also formed in soils. Moreover, it remains unclear whether anthropogenic OPs affect the CH4 cycle, a concern of significant importance in the context of the increasing rate of global warming. The literature examined in this review also calls for additional research into the date of OPs in waste and sewage and in their impact on environmental microbiomes."}],"affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.
