There was are duction in their levels in the horizontal well (HW) with drains located below the river bot tom, averaging 17%. Significantly higher reductions (53–71%) were observed in vertical wells (VWs). Mixing, sorption and biodegradation were distinguished as processes conditioning the reduction of pharmaceuti al compounds along flow paths from the river to the wells. Their reduction in the HW occursdue to sorption ontofine sedi ents with high organic matter content and aerobic biodegradation, while in the VWs it is the ef fect of aerobic biodegradation and wa ter mixing with un polluted ground water. Sorption on riverbed fine sediments can also occur, especially during low water levels in the river. Biodegradation de velops in oxic conditions with aerobic bacteria. VWs located at  similar distances from  the  river  yielded  different  concentrations  of  pharmaceutical  compounds,  because  of  differences  in geological  structure,  hydrogeological  conditions  and  well operation parameters."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058064816","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"66","pagesFromTo":"1635","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.7306/gq.1635","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"620b8dbf2467f07b3c5b044a","name":"Roksana","lastName":"Kurć-Fijałkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cb58c0d6-2b5f-41be-b736-c77b5d20f5a5"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afc4e","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Drożdżyński","uuid":"40BA917A3CA3D142DA1068376D39AD2BCAE66E00985DDA0F1CBCCB25E20B3F37E1053BA96AC2882CF5C8CDF5087C393AE744828D07992EB3783FE446BD812A0F","orcidId":"0000-0002-7587-7961","documentHash":"606c6be4-8c28-418e-b499-31ca3645e415"},{"objectId":"5e709310878c28a0473a2388","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Dragon","uuid":"2E985E5D7083769A6F07B5D7BB488B61BA0FCB52A934688C04686C1B885DCFB3F2C5CEAF4997AF260330D4854005CE01349426092701C5FCFA90A670799A73C6","orcidId":"0000-0001-5767-0783","documentHash":"7c5f1a0f-b511-4eb0-b56b-292c69aef8df"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-1-108-49238-6","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"The Cambridge handbook of the philosophy of language","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":null,"translationFromPolish":null,"bookProjectNCN":null,"bookProjectFNP":null,"bookProjectNPHR":null,"bookProjectUE":null},"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61df36362467f0500b7f4318","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058064828","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb74e","mniswId":"400","name":"Cambridge University Press","documentHash":"6b085549-ce64-488e-922d-4c5c19b192f2"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.worldcat.org/title/cambridge-handbook-of-the-philosophy-of-language/oclc/1228316358","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Proposed Model (PM model)","Clostridioides difficile","CDI","infection risk management"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Application of a novel PMmodel to assess the risk level of clostridiodes difficilein medical facilities as a tod improving the quality ofhealth services and patients softy","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","doi":null,"issn":"1661-7827","eissn":"1660-4601","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e236e16e-7430-4ac3-800c-033637860e22"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61dee56b2467f0772e68d907","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709248878c28a047392f26","658156134097076c14b60b3b","658156134097076c14b60b3c","658156134097076c14b60b3d","658156134097076c14b60b3e","658156134097076c14b60b3f"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Infections with multi-drug resistant microorganisms associated with the provision of health services have become an acute problem worldwide. These infections cause increased morbidity as well as mortality and are a financial burden for the healthcare system. Effective risk management can reduce the spread of infections and thus minimize their number in hospitalized patients. We have developed a new approach to the analysis of hazards and of exposure to the risk of adverse events by linking the patient’s health record system to the entire infrastructure of the hospital unit. In this study, using the developed model, we focused on infections caused by the Clostridioides difficile bacterium, as they constitute a significant number of nosocomial infections in Poland and worldwide. The study was conducted in a medical facility located in the central part of Poland which provides tertiary care. In the proposed PM model, a risk analysis of hospital acquired infections at the Intensive Care and Anesthesiology Unit combined with the hospital’s technical facilities and organizational factors was conducted. The obtained results indicate the most critical events which may have an impact on potential hazards or risks which may result from the patient’s stay at the specific ward. Our method can be combined with an anti-problem approach, which minimizes the critical level of infection in order to determine the optimal functioning of the entire hospital unit. Research has shown that in most situations the spread dynamics of nosocomial infections can be controlled and their elimination may be attempted. In order to meet these conditions, the persons responsible for the daily operation of the medical facility and its individual wards have to indicate potential events and factors which present a risk to the hospitalized patients. On the basis of a created spreadsheet directions for improvement may be finally established for all potential events, their frequency may be minimized, and information may be obtained on actions which should be undertaken in a crisis situation caused by the occurrence of a given phenomenon. We believe that the proposed method is effective in terms of risk reduction, which is important for preventing the transmission of multi-drug resistant microorganisms in the hospital environment."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058064833","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"658156134097076c14b60b3f","name":"Michał","lastName":"Michałkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"228ad04e-d212-4665-85db-3191ff7e39ee"},{"objectId":"658156134097076c14b60b3e","name":"Michał","lastName":"Zawadzki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"46031808-27cf-4a71-81a0-38e709a479fb"},{"objectId":"658156134097076c14b60b3d","name":"Aleksandra ","lastName":"Sierocka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f384408d-0166-4110-9d97-0b2135764e2d"},{"objectId":"658156134097076c14b60b3c","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Lemiech-Mirowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"469e631d-17ab-4a81-ba3a-56fe04c0d517"},{"objectId":"658156134097076c14b60b3b","name":"Zofia","lastName":"Kiersnowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2d519b3b-36af-4765-900d-da66a95f8f52"},{"objectId":"5e709248878c28a047392f26","name":"Michał","lastName":"Marczak","uuid":"2A5895F5DB35E471FAC42844B9151D2F47C05208A22928EFB2B28711CA8BEFF17362DCBA9E2ECAC4F7E297F8E1E18690BAC51CD6BA4C9B592D49D1ECF5E9C183","orcidId":"0000-0001-6262-0529","documentHash":"b8e9ddc7-a513-4cae-8958-765f13810c70"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19010441"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","uid":"bRRT1dnyPJtioT7xTLQBnOQ","uuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","parentUuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","rootUuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","name":"Centrum Badań Molekularnych i Makromolekularnych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70934c878c28a0473a6a7f","5e7094a2878c28a0473c0c08","5e70934a878c28a0473a68ed"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Modulation of the Directionality of Hole Transfer between the Base and the Sugar-Phosphate Backbone in DNA with the Number of Sulfur Atoms in the Phosphate Group","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789a1","mniswId":"12285","title":"Journal of Physical Chemistry B","doi":null,"issn":"1520-6106","eissn":"1520-5207","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"3ef059cd-df5a-4b8d-a9e3-d604d4e486e5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620a4d4f2467f06a1edbc121","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["620a4d4f2467f06a1edbc123","620a4d4f2467f06a1edbc124","620a4d4f2467f06a1edbc125","620a4d4f2467f06a1edbc126","620a4d4f2467f06a1edbc127","620a4d4f2467f06a1edbc128","620a4d4f2467f06a1edbc129","620a4d4f2467f06a1edbc12a","620a4d4f2467f06a1edbc12b","620a4d4f2467f06a1edbc12c","620a4d4f2467f06a1edbc12d","5e70934c878c28a0473a6a7f","5e70934a878c28a0473a68ed","5e7094a2878c28a0473c0c08"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This work shows that S atom substitution in phosphate controls the directionality of hole transfer processes between the base and sugar-phosphate backbone in DNA systems. The investigation combines synthesis, electron spin resonance (ESR) studies in supercooled homogeneous solution, pulse radiolysis in aqueous solution at ambient temperature, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations of in-house synthesized model compound dimethylphosphorothioate (DMTP(O-)= S) and nucleotide (5'-O-methoxyphosphorothioyl-2'-deoxyguanosine (G-P(O-)= S)). ESR investigations show that DMTP(O-)= S reacts with Cl-2(center dot-) to form the sigma(2)sigma(*1) adduct radical -P-S(SIC)Cl, which subsequently reacts with DMTP(O-)= S to produce [-P-S(SIC)S-P-](-). -P-S(SIC)Cl in G-P(O-)= S undergoes hole transfer to Gua, forming the cation radical (G(center dot+)) via thermally activated hopping. However, pulse radiolysis measurements show that DMTP(O-)= S forms the thiyl radical (-P-S-center dot) by one-electron oxidation, which did not produce [-P-S(SIC)S-P-](-). Gua in G-P(O-)= S is oxidized unimolecularly by the -P-S-center dot intermediate in the sub-picosecond range.

It also complements the author's previous monograph, published in Polish.\nComposite materials are currently the fastest-developed and particularly attractive construction materials that are used in many industries as well as in special-purpose devices (including military ones) used in  air, on land, in water and in space. Composite components and technologies of their connections are selected in order to obtain required performance characteristics of a given structure. By using these materials, for example, a lower weight, a stronger connection, higher resistance to shock and energy dissipation can be obtained than in  case of the use of metals.\nAlong with the development of the composite materials manufacturing technology, requirements for assessing their quality are increasing. Therefore, it is necessary to develop methods, techniques and equipment for diagnostic tests as well as monitoring the processes of manufacturing materials, products and semi-finished products. Use of non-destructive testing methods is becoming more and more widespread, and the information obtained as a result of them is getting extensive. One of the most effective technology in non-destructive testing of composites is infrared thermography.  Infrared thermography is a field of knowledge and technology in which properties of infrared radiation have been used for non-contact temperature measurement. Due to their properties, fibre-reinforced composites are the most effective composite materials in both civilian and military applications."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058064866","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":"1","volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d774f92878c284eaa45d01f","mniswId":"75900","name":"Wydawnictwo Wojskowego Instytutu Technicznego Uzbrojenia","documentHash":"18ba2ed9-48d3-4e27-b69b-3bdd13b64553"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://wydawnictwo.witu.mil.pl/monografia.html?id=WITU_21","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473aef9a","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Świderski","uuid":"FEF6A366C49B7567A6DF133BD7512FA00630C1ED27523AAFC96941F99F8992299B7FD08766BBCAE766660AD4BA9507F26D0C69C43C046C378AEC34E3B81ED40F","orcidId":"0000-0003-4040-2197","documentHash":"bf607b05-9569-42de-91f7-21ec61551ca8"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["frequency-domain response","linear combination","mode decomposition","peak characteristics","structural health monitoring (SHM)"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Constrained mode decomposition method for modal parameter identification","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547984d","mniswId":"18983","title":"Structural Control and Health Monitoring","doi":null,"issn":"1545-2255","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"234b2590-20ef-4b53-a50d-ea64e36fdb0e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61dee4722467f05d596d9788","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70927e878c28a047396aa0"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Many mode decomposition methods suffer from aliasing effects and modal distortion. This paper proposes a constrained mode decomposition (CMD) method that directly addresses these problems. The CMD is based on a linear combination of structural-free responses. The decomposed response is thus ensured to have a physical meaning and to satisfy the structural equation of motion, which improves the accuracy of mode decomposition and identification. The decomposition aim is to obtain a single-mode response. The CMD defines the corresponding natural frequency as the target frequency, while other natural frequencies are defined as constrained frequencies. The proposed method combines the measured physical responses in such a way that the constrained frequency components are selectively suppressed, while the amplitude of the target frequency component is selectively retained above a predefined level. The result is the intended single-mode free response, which can be used to clearly extract the corresponding modal parameters. For well-separated modes, the criterion for selective suppression is based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) peak amplitude. For separation of closely spaced modes, a criterion based on FFT derivative is proposed to avoid modal distortion. The accuracy and applicability of the CMD method is tested in a numerical simulation and using a four-story lab frame structure. The experimental data are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed CMD method and to compare it with two other widely used mode decomposition methods."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058064869","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"e2878-1-24","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396aa0","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Jankowski","uuid":"89DC7A2ED0D795689EA87C298C87385DE00178610260A051E43EDBF9A5CAB238F36DB84948CE001D169D1075C9FEB63E5EF76B22CC155074909A8B13B689958F","orcidId":"0000-0002-9773-0688","documentHash":"d3709e31-7ad5-46da-89a6-7d2c3512ea04"}],"doi":"10.1002/stc.2878"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Aquatic fern","duckweed","industrial area","phytoextraction","pleustophytes","Trace metals"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d4878c28a0473b178f","5e70922e878c28a0473914ef","5e709232878c28a047391769"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Comparative analysis of trace and macro-element bioaccumulation in four free-floating macrophytes in area contaminated by copper smelter","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478297","mniswId":"9257","title":"International Journal of Phytoremediation","doi":null,"issn":"1522-6514","eissn":"1549-7879","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ed4c123e-4c73-419c-b41b-e1780589cc13"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620a0fd52467f01c2156326d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922e878c28a0473914ef","5e7093d4878c28a0473b178f","5e709232878c28a047391769"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This is the first study that comprehensively compares <i>Salvinia natans, Lemna minor</i>, <i>Lemna trisulca</i>, and <i>Azolla filiculoides</i> growing in the field; industrially affected conditions in respect of elements contents, water-plant transfer, and bioaccumulation using statistical analyses and indexes and their suitability for phytoremediation was considered.

However, these BMGs have few applications in industrial productions because of their brittleness at room temperature. This study is focused on the effect of cooling rate on the mechanical properties (especially toughness) in the Fe41Co7Cr15Mo14Y2C15B6 BMG. For this aim, two samples with the mentioned composition were fabricated in a water-cooled copper mold with a diameter of 2 mm, and in a graphite mold with a diameter of 3 mm. The formation of crystalline phases of Fe23(B, C)6, α-Fe and Mo3Co3C based on XRD patterns was observed after the partial crystallization process. To determine the toughness of the as-cast and annealed samples, the indentation technique was used. These results revealed that the maximum hardness and toughness were depicted in the sample casted in the water-cooled copper mold and annealed up to 928°C. The reason of it can be attributed to the formation of crystalline clusters in the amorphous matrix of the samples casted in the graphite mold, so that this decrease in the cooling rate causes to changing the chemical composition of the amorphous matrix."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058064895","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.67","pagesFromTo":"251-254","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.imim.pl/files/archiwum/Vol1_2022/33.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62063b632467f04995f29b24","name":"Amir","lastName":"SEIFODDINI","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0c37e096-10a1-477e-b5bc-0dab21d3b818"},{"objectId":"62063b632467f04995f29b23","name":"Saeed","lastName":"HASANI","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e14fe465-6f49-4c47-85fe-a7bfb02d2a1d"},{"objectId":"62063b632467f04995f29b22","name":"P.","lastName":"MOOSAVI","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8b87992b-a273-41e9-b15f-bf9b9aeb8e5f"},{"objectId":"62063b632467f04995f29b21","name":"H.","lastName":"REDAEI","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4146ec61-6461-4da4-9a36-d05dd97cbf49"},{"objectId":"62063b622467f04995f29b20","name":"Parisa","lastName":"REZAEI-SHAHREZA","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c3449ffd-a97a-48fa-bfa4-0028cce1ab9d"},{"objectId":"5e7093da878c28a0473b1e8b","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Jeż","uuid":"55FBCFFD2851D0FEAF7D5313E2C5E4469F82ACE251E433A077E87C930F6E000BBCB77E5D705F24CB3AF61FD9E0AD27C5CAE39D8245CC1DB57DB204B0DD650C19","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"31c9a862-48cc-4821-96d6-83caeb21cbec"},{"objectId":"5e709202878c28a04738e819","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Nabiałek","uuid":"B6683A886EE45C142C3D096D666C6805871EDF54B78A7ABB053076A7D0C31C86328EBF60FFC58BB47843F30A65752F47774B5C5611BD07C40763A99E89A0E64A","orcidId":"0000-0001-6585-3918","documentHash":"971ad9a7-cf09-448f-aa4b-8a312585d7cf"}],"doi":"10.24425/amm.2022.137498"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092c4878c28a04739c4ae","5e7092d3878c28a04739d788"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Resilience of Coastal Lake Barriers in Poland in Light of Geological and Bathymetric Data and Hydrodynamic Simulations","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dcb1","mniswId":"22508","title":" FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2296-7745","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"57e7b9cc-ffe0-45b0-8d0d-9a60df59321d"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2022-02-09","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620a523b2467f06a1edbdb2a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d788","5e7092c4878c28a04739c4ae"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper presents a study on the insufficient resilience of three coastal lake barriers at the central part of the Polish Baltic Sea coast. Environmental qualities of those lakes belonging to the NATURA2000 network dictate efforts aimed at their conservation through the maintenance of the barriers. The use of recently elaborated high resolution geological surveys demonstrated previously underestimated severe sand scarcity and indicated high threats of enhanced erosion, breaching and overtopping of the barriers. Next, the investigation of alongshore variation of nearshore wave energy dissipation, basing on the available bathymetric records and the concept of ordinary and empirical equilibrium profiles, identified potential erosion hot spots along the barriers. Finally, the XBeach model was applied to simulate the effects of rare, heavy storms with the recurrence period of 20 years with and without climate change induced sea level rise. Overall, the results demonstrated high susceptibility of the barriers to frequent fragmentation and allowed for recommendations of protection measures minimizing interference into the natural landscapes. The novelty of the paper consists in the assessment of aftermaths of extreme events by combining recent advances in coastal geology and climate change effects."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058064903","journalIssue":{"objectId":"620a523b2467f06a1edbdb2f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"9","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"17b56cb2-5e8f-41ce-a89d-d4b387701e78"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"9","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2022.815405/full","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d788","name":"GRZEGORZ","lastName":"RÓŻYŃSKI","uuid":"1A2E1D08420262EA31BBB75945DDD4BC9BC182679758D171C1952081AC88F6CCB5F8F90140400923DF7FAAF7409CE4E3CA481F107E580269BB558289D3DDB5AE","orcidId":"0000-0001-9822-9847","documentHash":"f3d94f10-4403-4e16-8f0f-d897433bade0"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c4ae","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Cerkowniak","uuid":"59961B05C254534949F8FCBEF00C04E41CC4F1008E72D31B3B91BDFEEA3BBF05EC156793EBF2D77C0ABAB0FC29DAA04E5EA33F38F4C32F30875BD31DB4389284","orcidId":"0000-0001-6743-6640","documentHash":"dbc9fb45-930d-4ca9-bf50-89743743d9f7"}],"doi":"10.3389/fmars.2022.815405"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bond strength","dental porcelain","metal-ceramic system","surface treatment","titanium 99.2"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Influence of Sandblasting and Chemical Etching on Titanium 99.2–Dental Porcelain Bond Strength","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":"10.3390/ma","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"8475d9fb-a844-4cfe-87c7-25090cd02fd3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-24","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620b9b3e2467f07b3c5b8182","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709202878c28a04738e80e","5e70943c878c28a0473b895f","5e709202878c28a04738e81e","5e709202878c28a04738e827"]},"issue":"Iss.1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The metal–ceramic interface requires proper surface preparation of both metal and ceramic substrates. This process is complicated by the differences in chemical bonds and physicochemical properties that characterise the two materials.

In this paper, the authors present the results of a study determining the effect of mechanical and chemical surface treatment (sandblasting and etching) on the strength and quality of the titanium-low-fusing dental porcelain bond. To evaluate the strength of the metal-ceramic interface, the authors performed mechanical tests (three-point bending) according to EN ISO 9693 standard, microscopic observations (SEM-EDS), and Raman spectroscopy studies. The results showed that depending on the chemical etching medium used, different bond strength values and failure mechanisms of the metal-ceramic system were observed. The analyzed samples met the requirements of EN ISO 9693 for metal-ceramic systems and received strength values above 25 MPa. Higher joint strength was obtained for the samples after sandblasting and chemical etching compared to the samples subjected only to sandblasting."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058065007","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.15","pagesFromTo":"brak","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/1/116","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70943c878c28a0473b895f","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Jasiński","uuid":"D5226E35C753C8D74B91C6E46998AB44D62D04B5A65BF01F810E018B50D748A693AC36A80439796819CD9391950A66D4B3BF33D396F48BC5CE3255FE03274E5F","orcidId":"0000-0002-7372-5788","documentHash":"f6bdc10b-744d-4ab5-910c-34e9c4252b01"},{"objectId":"5e709202878c28a04738e827","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Przerada","uuid":"C869AEC3901DDD36F010BA2F2E48FCE46953BE7BA3F47949A8C0F7BBF7AA8C176E6850F22243AE6BBFAEABE4E690ADF9EF93E1292A53C9F4F7471BD0D0604C59","orcidId":"0000-0001-5137-8044","documentHash":"51aa8efa-53a0-4b6a-bb51-273c42f79186"},{"objectId":"5e709202878c28a04738e81e","name":"Anna","lastName":"Zawada","uuid":"EB26D7AA2CDCEDA2FE464D64ED41701FFB1C728DB36EB2AB65D6C716E8665790BC2A23C5FF85EDAADA6429501A43F62288698FD160CA4CBD5FBB49404DF5D3A2","orcidId":"0000-0001-9506-9972","documentHash":"9f61d689-1d0b-4afa-b7eb-1f3128104bc6"},{"objectId":"5e709202878c28a04738e80e","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Lubas","uuid":"F0A9C1AC238E37074CFB1E32809AE62EC0C34C65AB887A92535DE66661E2EB1DB079AE72C05E9483EB5D73FBF0821C8F7CFB908219E23D94F494DC1107169A01","orcidId":"0000-0003-3213-3978","documentHash":"ef85f02c-ec9b-464d-a263-5f971edfa790"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15010116"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dede","uid":"bdoAFCGTorZ9N_5NoE6bisA","uuid":"d86ce494-55e8-4d01-929c-48a2908e6e5a","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dede","parentUuid":"d86ce494-55e8-4d01-929c-48a2908e6e5a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dede","rootUuid":"d86ce494-55e8-4d01-929c-48a2908e6e5a","name":"Instytut Łączności - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b9e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Stop-band optical filters protecting from harmful infrared radiation: wavelength-scale electromagnetic modelling by the method of single expression","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547910a","mniswId":"15482","title":"OPTICAL AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS","doi":null,"issn":"0306-8919","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"f7f979ba-3efd-4143-9428-092198b734a4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62063cc72467f04995f2a622","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62063cc72467f04995f2a624","62063cc72467f04995f2a625","62063cc72467f04995f2a626","62063cc72467f04995f2a627","62063cc72467f04995f2a628","5e709252878c28a047393b9e"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper is devoted to the wavelength-scale electromagnetic modelling of stop-band multilayer optical filters protecting from harmful high-intensity laser radiation in near-infrared range.

field experiment was carried out in 2013 and 2014 as part of a long-term experiment to test the influence of different soil tillage systems (conventional, reduced, direct sowing) on (a) the yield of summer pea (Pisum sativum L.) and (b) the amount of biologically reduced atmospheric nitrogen (N), which was determined using the 15N dilution method (ID15N). Spring barley was used as a reference plant. Climatic conditions did not have a significant influence on the yield of pea seeds (mean value 4.56 t ha−1), post-harvest residues (3.76 t ha−1) and total biomass (8.33 t ha−1). Soil tillage system was found to have a significant impact on all components of the pea yield in years of experiment, with the highest average seed yield values observed with the conventional system (5.19 t ha−1) and significantly lower values observed with reduced tillage (4.34 t ha−1) and direct sowing (4.17 t ha−1). The content of total N was greatest in the pea biomass that was harvested in the conventional system (202 kg ha−1) and lowest with direct sowing (155 kg ha−1). Nitrogen accumulated in the pea seeds from three sources: atmosphere (mean value 35.2%), fertilizers (6.8%) and soil (57.9%), equating to 48.6, 9.9, and 85.4 kg ha−1, respectively. Soil tillage system was found to have a significant impact on the amount of N that was fixed from the atmosphere by the peas: 17.7% in conventional tillage, 37.9 in reduced system and 50.2% in direct sowing, which equates to a harvested seed yield of 28.9, 52.0 and 64.4 kg ha−1, respectively. In the post-harvest residues, the amount of N fixed from the atmosphere by the pea crop was also modified by the soil tillage system in range: 20.2% in conventional tillage and 32.6% in direct sowing (which equates to 7.4 and 8.5 kg N ha−1, respectively), but the difference was not significant."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058065106","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62026fd82467f069467a364d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"52209a99-1c5b-47da-bd71-0065e154d8d6"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/2/352/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"620a462c2467f06a1edb42be","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Kalembasa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ecf94e03-7b3d-43aa-ac5e-f552a4a2922c"},{"objectId":"5e70940c878c28a0473b56a0","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Ratajczak","uuid":"188C4563C611D434660CC1E227D74668472045E01A9BF4436AEA6290EF636C6084AFD590F5944B0C20A8EEC500E99580469FFD34C683905111B26DD386995971","orcidId":"0000-0002-4465-9697","documentHash":"55b41c87-2d43-4f64-822b-c6ca3152ab63"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a64a0","name":"Grażyna","lastName":"Szymańska","uuid":"1E32E612A724AC738705FF27F0807206BA92A18C314CABF3E0DD03DE5436D35C81D90506563564A5699A78EC4020001AC2BD1AF6DC2303A710E9FE3CD8D2DE61","orcidId":"0000-0003-2358-9068","documentHash":"d27d2b0a-15fe-4b0a-ba7b-171c8366f2d1"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6405","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Skrzypczak","uuid":"5036FE0CD95FAD731F4AEEC6B68EAAD2F39CCAD75B44B3664C480DAC42863B84FA739F19C11BB068C988797DFDBAFC38328E8CB1E6C6582037B3676A503FC416","orcidId":"0000-0002-5433-583X","documentHash":"0a371758-f875-4d20-8a95-f24385c788a3"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a63ba","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Panasiewicz","uuid":"7263EB7FF13E408F04AB2A06ECEE9882D6EE1D71A74634D64B83FF7B956012B83FE118C0A45D783CEA159C7F9C42E752E38794A6BB8491E60EBC54E19A59D52E","orcidId":"0000-0001-6447-9557","documentHash":"cfd18df3-b64f-4f3b-aeba-441d1b3277ab"},{"objectId":"5e709345878c28a0473a6280","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Faligowska","uuid":"37E023E7625356DE489EEA63CC27D0ABE30B46354F4594DDFB147A826C799A34169A3AE45CAE13C38F46B26CDF8EB1F9AB7CAF96F99A1F8DE9740F49863AD37B","orcidId":"0000-0002-6908-2812","documentHash":"0806e49a-f062-4952-9e03-927979c38e1a"},{"objectId":"5e709294878c28a047398505","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Kalembasa","uuid":"A40197CFC6C7A9F83150004EC9FA4A057AAAF86B568BB9270A31399ACABEBA5F95E194AA20A8E4D4F02EB0C144A39BB381B628E1C7FA59202D471613A300D9B5","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"49b1478e-8247-46cc-9aa9-c6d8f4645c57"}],"doi":"10.3390/agronomy12020352"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["gestational diabetes mellitus","epigenetics","microbiota"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092c7878c28a04739c731","5e7094f6878c28a0473c80c3"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Epigenetic Links between Microbiota and Gestational Diabetes","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","doi":null,"issn":"1422-0067","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"850accc5-0c0e-4f6c-9a84-eaa108a84f20"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-06","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6204e2342467f04219cf9d69","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094f6878c28a0473c80c3","6204e2342467f04219cf9d6c","5e7092c7878c28a04739c731"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is considered a significant and increasing worldwide\nproblem.

The prevalence of elevated BP is growing among adolescents. There is a need to investigate effective ways of decreasing excessive blood pressure in this age group. The study aim was to determine the effect of 10-weeks High-Intensive Interval Training (HIIT)—Tabata protocol—introduced in physical education (PE) lessons on resting blood pressure in adolescents. The sample included 52 boys aged 16.23 ± 0.33 years body height176.74 ± 6.07 (m), body weight 65.42 ± 12.51 (kg), BMI 20.89 ± 3.53 (kg/m2) and 89 girls aged 16.12 ± 0.42 years, body height 164.38 ± 6.54 (m), body weight 56.71 ± 10.23 (kg), BMI 20.93 ± 3.08 (kg/m2) from secondary school. Based on resting BP, the fractions of boys and girls with normal BP and high BP were identified and divided into experimental (EG) and control (CG) groups. EG completed a 10-weeks HIIT program (three cycles of Tabata protocol) implemented in one PE lesson during a week. The duration of the effort was 14 min. The intensity was at 75–80% of maximal heart rate. Changes in systolic and diastolic BP after the experiment were examined. The results indicated the improvement in SBP in EG with high BP compared to the rest of the groups (average reduction of 12.77 mmHg; p < 0.0001). The EG normotensive had a statistically significant higher reduction of SBP comparing CG normotensive (average decrease of 1.81 mmHG; p = 0.0089). HIIT effectively decreases BP in adolescents. Implementing HIIT in PE lessons in secondary school is recommended to improve BP parameters."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058065183","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6204e9a22467f04219d00aa3","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"6f277079-92a2-4906-a3fd-56acdd571480"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"art. 1974","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06017-w.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a7d6","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Koźlenia","uuid":"ACFEDD630F150BD26BEE9B72C1817BF2D7D9C77B56487D83A0E1D8F2AF5690A1293C57DF1B385CFE0B6E13AE7FF53B8A32E6BF69D794003794B16E40DA43B945","orcidId":"0000-0002-5304-7879","documentHash":"69baf409-c652-4ac0-ae79-a87ccf277d85"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047395016","name":"Marek","lastName":"Popowczak","uuid":"DE2FFD2E114AF925ABE9D24F8C06CA2FD73A79025D5767995E3FD2C685E5BA083AFF477FDF71FFE51E1C42D4B5C41182DAF66404B4AA8E1CC11F522C5AF34748","orcidId":"0000-0002-3895-6206","documentHash":"c35d6b0a-e5bb-4350-bb15-1213ac3ee9a6"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047394fec","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Domaradzki","uuid":"CEAC11E0295750434309ABE0B6D490373768A5109983A617965CC2E373E7267D43D78A93E57DA4914835CCB737A7A7471A8BDD2F7A5A313B8C0074A0ECA3C4A5","orcidId":"0000-0001-8057-3033","documentHash":"31b3d6c1-c09c-4f26-8399-6d6ff4fcf145"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047394fd7","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Rokita","uuid":"BB088FBBA908D24FC179EDFB6638E13A4CAD828196AD72FE4591D983AFA88A776C79955C94F5F203D20DBDFA89044E9267E5718EBFE4D71BCC4C9627DEA602BB","orcidId":"0000-0001-5281-811X","documentHash":"026d8d14-4f21-4960-b134-351863e2b536"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-022-06017-w"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mechanical engineering; internal combustion engines; air pollution; engine component wear; power loss"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b5878c28a047385c19","uid":"bzPZmmp8S2zN3FIBGmhP2-A","uuid":"2f4b58f0-ff22-4767-bf70-4a4950ffa081","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Instytut Pojazdów i Transportu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602de82d9543c7410626e7e0","5e70929e878c28a04739948d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A Study on the Effect of Inlet Air Pollution on the Engine Component Wear and Operation","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1073","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620b9acb2467f07b3c5b8109","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929e878c28a04739948d","602de82d9543c7410626e7e0"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper systematically reviews the research progress in the field of the influence of air pollutants in the engine inlet on the accelerated wear of the elements of the association: piston, piston rings, cylinder liner (P-PR-CL), and plain bearing (journal–panel). It was shown at the outset that the primary component of air pollution is road dust. Its main components are dust grains of hard minerals (SiO2, Al2O3), which penetrate the oil film area between two frictionally mating surfaces causing their abrasive wear. Therefore, the effect of three dust parameters (grain size and hardness, and dust concentration in air) on the accelerated wear of the friction pair: piston, piston rings, cylinder liner(P-PR-CL), and plain bearing (journal–pan) is presented extensively. It was noted that the wear values of the same component were obtained by different researchers using different testing techniques and evaluated by different indices. It has been shown that the greatest wear of two frictionally cooperating surfaces is caused by dust grains with sizes equal to the thickness of the oil film at a given moment, which in typical combustion engine associations assumes varied and variable values in the range of 0–50 µm. The oil film thickness between the upper ring and the cylinder liner varies and depends on the crankshaft rotation angle, engine speed and load, and oil viscosity, and takes values less than 10 µm. It was shown that the maximum wear of the cylinder liner, resulting from the cooperation with the piston rings, occurs in the top dead centre (TDC) area and results from unfavorable (high temperature, low piston speed) operating conditions of these elements. From the extensive literature data cited, it follows that abrasive wear is caused by dust grains of specific dimensions, most often 5–20 µm, the greater the wear the greater the hardness of the grains and the sulfur content of the fuel. At the same time, it was shown that the main bearing, crankshaft bearing, and oil ring experienced maximum wear by a different range of particle size, respectively: 20–40, 5–10, and 20–80 μm. It was shown that the mass of dust that enters the engine cylinders and thus the wear of the components is determined by the concentration of dust, the value of which is definitely reduced by the air filter. However, it was pointed out that the low initial filtration efficiency and the presence of large dust grains in the purified air in the initial period of the filter operation (after replacement of the filter element with a new one) may have an impact on the accelerated wear of mainly (P-PR-CL) association. The next stage of the paper presents the effects of excessive wear of the cylinder liner and piston rings of the engine, resulting from actual vehicle operation and bench tests on the decrease in compression pressure and engine power, increase in the intensity of exhaust gas blow-by into the oil sump and increase in oil consumption and exhaust gas toxicity. This paper addresses the current problem of the effect of engine inlet air contaminants on the performance of the air flow meter, which is an essential sensor of the modern internal combustion engine. The phenomenon of deposition of contaminants (mineral dust, salt, carbon deposit, and moisture) on the measuring element (wire or layer anemometer) of the air flow meter has been analyzed. The empirical results presented show that the mineral dust layer on the measuring element of the air flow meter causes a 17.9% reduction in output voltage, and the dust and oil layer causes a 46.7% reduction in output voltage. This affects the decrease in engine power and exhaust toxicity."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058065208","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-50","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/3/1182","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602de82d9543c7410626e7e0","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Dziubak","uuid":"A3360528183F87B26898BCA72E91004E3CD0B7C3858F9BE2953BB97C63AA60053CF789609AA595FB4B14FB82090E797656C159453ECE08F6F9B155830F0E355B","orcidId":"0000-0002-8033-8444","documentHash":"d173f181-be20-492b-805d-db748bbc1c7e"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a04739948d","name":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Dziubak","uuid":"E5ED48A59EAB21E93EE4D5B207902380461240E8E7AD5925B32E2DA9863591B1B6BA06E57594A350665F62C710A54786EEEF54119D441C728571857E831F2A68","orcidId":"0000-0002-1609-3518","documentHash":"ba0e60fb-9075-4f53-86e1-b060bdef5521"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15031182"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Covid-19","food","food narratives","identity","narratives"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Fiat panis: identity representation and identity change in food narratives","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454777d5","mniswId":"4345","title":"Consumption Markets and Culture","doi":null,"issn":"1025-3866","eissn":"1477-223X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f50b375b-9c07-417c-879f-e9420b5714cd"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620a4ad92467f06a1edbb8e5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094ec878c28a0473c6f4d"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Covid-19 pandemic has affected the food production, distribution,\r\nand consumption industries in unprecedented ways.

Among these records, small mammals are one of the most reliable for understanding how faunal assemblages responded to the climate shifts. One of the key regions for this epoch in the European framework is the north-eastern Italian Peninsula, which was long considered as an ecotonal zone and crossroad between Central and Mediterranean Europe.\n\nIn this region, Rivoli Veronese (Verona, north-eastern Italy), an Early Pleistocene site with a highly diversified assemblage, has always been considered one of the most important sites for the biochronology of the Italian Peninsula. Here we present the taxonomic study of the Early Pleistocene insectivores, bats, and rodents from this site, as well as the environmental and climatic reconstruction using the Taxonomical Habitat Index, the Habitat Weighting, and the Bioclimatic model.\n\nIn the rich Rivoli Veronese assemblage, composed of 27 taxa, important biochronology markers, such as Mimomys pitymyoides, Mimomys tornensis, and Mimomys pliocaenicus were recognized. The earliest occurrences in Europe of Sorex praealpinus and Dinaromys genus were also documented as well as a new fossil mole species, Talpa sp. nov. Comparison with other European small mammal assemblages of the Early Pleistocene have allowed us to relate Rivoli Veronese to the early Late Villanyian Age.\n\nThe persistence of Pliocene relicts, such as Rhagapodemus cf. frequens, and Pliopetaurista cf. pliocaenica, together with Early Pleistocene species is a remarkable feature of this site. This is also reflected in the environment which was still mainly forested but with spreading open areas and wetlands mainly in the form of water streams. The climate values show that the conditions were similar to the current ones but the comparison with the near and recent Monte La Mesa assemblage, dated to Early Biharian (beginning of the Calabrian Stage), and the appearance of several taxa related to open landscapes show that a cooling and arid trend in climate was already settled in the region during the Gelasian."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058065235","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6227c7da2467f06c17676d4f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"5f02e78c-673d-45d1-a222-b6f0ecaffacc"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"633","pagesFromTo":"134-153","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1040618221005668?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62062db62467f04995f22c8c","name":"Benedetto","lastName":"Sala","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ebdaf7c9-f664-407c-bb7c-c051b4cf4f75"},{"objectId":"62062db62467f04995f22c8a","name":"Marco","lastName":"Marchetti","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"163a1db8-656a-4435-8227-a7ad138f8863"},{"objectId":"62062db62467f04995f22c89","name":"Elisa","lastName":"Luzi","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9410-5940","documentHash":"a4fc2cdb-5f72-4e49-88e8-a5be4505da45"},{"objectId":"5e7094f3878c28a0473c7cd9","name":"Claudio","lastName":"Berto","uuid":"129AAE9CCCC7FAFE06A108DB18A07BA33E53E7375FFD8106495FA45245410DF3CA21AF82D36C77D8409727192AAF6E4CB800FD8E8BA1AA037CF196AF4FD366AD","orcidId":"0000-0002-3354-582X","documentHash":"fe5bfc93-f087-41ae-9753-40f647c12f43"},{"objectId":"5e70943b878c28a0473b8783","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Pereswiet-Soltan","uuid":"B76045EC86EB2EAD392E6006CC79BD5FA0140AEACDF48659A156F6D8EBF337176F4851AB3B2DCC6F78730909BD1AC895549A95C04C82DE0ECC52CA673510A1D0","orcidId":"0000-0002-2083-0648","documentHash":"8671ce97-916c-4810-be94-b4133a9a170c"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.quaint.2021.11.025"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Bacillus anthracis","bacteriophages","complete genomic sequence","siphovirus","Wbetavirus","endolysin","receptor-binding protein","arbitrium system","phage tail"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df01","uid":"b9Kh7wVIXJf5RFdoScAr8ag","uuid":"25fa4f1b-b4e7-430f-9d9b-6d0c24ccd9c8","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df01","parentUuid":"25fa4f1b-b4e7-430f-9d9b-6d0c24ccd9c8","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df01","rootUuid":"25fa4f1b-b4e7-430f-9d9b-6d0c24ccd9c8","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Higieny i Epidemiologii im. gen.

The bacteria dwell in the soil of certain regions, as natural flora. Bacteriophages or their lytic enzymes, endolysins, may be an alternative for antibiotics and other antibacterials to fight this pathogen in infections and to minimize environmental contamination with anthrax endospores. Upon screening environmental samples from various regions in Poland, we isolated three new siphophages, J5a, F16Ba, and z1a, specific for B. anthracis. They represent new species related to historical anthrax phages Gamma, Cherry, and Fah, and to phage Wbeta of Wbetavirus genus. We show that the new phages and their closest relatives, phages Tavor_SA, Negev_SA, and Carmel_SA, form a separate clade of the Wbetavirus genus, designated as J5a clade. The most distinctive feature of J5a clade phages is their cell lysis module. While in the historical phages it encodes a canonical endolysin and a class III holin, in J5a clade phages it encodes an endolysin with a signal peptide and two putative holins. We present the basic characteristic of the isolated phages. Their comparative genomic analysis indicates that they encode two receptor-binding proteins, of which one may bind a sugar moiety of B. anthracis cell surface."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058065238","journalIssue":{"objectId":"620bd5c92467f07b3c5c8b84","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"8e57629b-37e4-43ed-a551-cf2eb7b89185"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"213 (1-22)","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/14/2/213","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094d7878c28a0473c5194","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Nakonieczna","uuid":"6F05C824C4825A3315BE03030BE15FD4C9320287D39046B10B065FD4C78E5DFBBE825055B91160588F8E45F4FF1AFCC13E10FF32ECDA878CF50CA65B9960EE5C","orcidId":"0000-0002-5184-3687","documentHash":"90adea9e-43cb-4072-a1f1-fc4e26506797"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a7a","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Fedorowicz","uuid":"8FB0CB22E959C8FCB1E2BC3D3B3FEFAB4B30E962D128372D9751E4979EC4EC3CB97843ADF2B56D2E98F5549C4CC217462619EBDB835CD844335799D7214093B6","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"910a5820-45e9-4f04-bcfc-50f978c58939"},{"objectId":"5e7093d4878c28a0473b17a6","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Mizak","uuid":"2133166F3FD9F9586CB87C0039C77EF3C65C68A61E2B10702E5E952144D71BFD6F14E3CEE5D967870FC985110F3A2F0B04B7DABFF8861060DC0BA0B654B4CB65","orcidId":"0000-0002-1382-6683","documentHash":"00482e51-3201-4394-b35f-a5424a7a4d53"},{"objectId":"5e7093d4878c28a0473b1782","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kwiatek","uuid":"74DBCD39E035EB1FB568694A13597B65BC0A583C4FC7FC6C2C49DF5431FFFF2E64A1E183F14CFB2F7A5669A14E55F3BD0EFED2DB0718B8B837DD3B096BB54BC9","orcidId":"0000-0002-6319-9411","documentHash":"09c9cad4-8c11-44d2-bb78-7a25dc7da64d"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5e5f","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Rutyna","uuid":"556A14944E7380350E20FA5C1D473F6CE433FBDD0C811AAFC30DDF894FE1BF80271FCACC333218BB2D692D2F9D6F6F76905B466840A7C4BB29EF5B3B027F88C9","orcidId":"0000-0002-3735-5011","documentHash":"b4bae6a2-121c-4f80-a155-5dd142d41cb2"},{"objectId":"5e709257878c28a047394135","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Łobocka","uuid":"8FD3426C84143CE254662B163C3305F13F9987248529F51BF67B91E2DA21E58BFDC47F01287739DC609FF8DF04352BBF7898B229E716D5F928496A91EE13C19E","orcidId":"0000-0003-0679-5193","documentHash":"19406e8e-c4de-4c16-a4d0-ffb81912266c"}],"doi":"10.3390/v14020213"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ageing","functional fitness","Senior Fitness Test","social welfare homes","community-dwelling elderly"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Selected Elements of Lifestyle and the Level of Functional Fitness in Older Women","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","doi":null,"issn":"1661-7827","eissn":"1660-4601","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e236e16e-7430-4ac3-800c-033637860e22"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-12","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620b91192467f07b3c5b1f65","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923a878c28a047391fad","660662c340970762633cb80c","660662c340970762633cb80d","660662c340970762633cb80e","660662c340970762633cb80f"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: The appropriate level of functional fitness is a very important element for seniors to maintain self-reliance in daily life. The aim of this research was to assess sociodemographic differences, selected elements of lifestyle, and functional fitness in the older residents of social welfare homes and community dwellers Methods: The analysed group comprised 693 women aged 65–79, including 173 subjects living in social welfare homes and 520 community-dwelling women. Basic anthropometric features were measured, and functional fitness was assessed using the Senior Fitness Test. Basic sociodemographic characteristics, as well as data on health self-assessment and selected elements of lifestyle, were also collected. Results: The female residents of social welfare homes were found to have a lower body mass index (BMI), and they came from smaller cities, compared with community-dwelling older women. Furthermore, almost a third of them had no children and completed primary or vocational education. They also reported smoking, poor health conditions, and lack of physical activity. The functional fitness of women living in social welfare homes was significantly lower than in community-dwelling women.

consequences in offspring's health, including neurodevelopmental outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between simultaneous prenatal exposure to metals [lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg)] and micronutrients [selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu)] and neurodevelopmental outcomes in school-age children from the Polish Mother and Child Cohort (REPRO_PL). Metals and micronutrients concentrations were measured in cord blood (Pb, Cd, Se, Zn, Cu) and in maternal hair (Hg) collected during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. Behavioral and emotional problems, as well as children's cognitive and psychomotor development, were assessed in 436 school-age children using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ, filled in by the mothers) and the Polish adaptation of the Intelligence and Development Scales (IDS, administered by trained psychologists). Multivariate regression models were applied after imputation of missing values, using two approaches: (i) a joint analysis taking into account all metals and micronutrients simultaneously, and (ii) an ExWAS study (single-exposure model). In the SDQ, Hyperactivity/Inattention problems and Total difficulties were associated with higher Hg concentrations in maternal hair (0.18, 95% CI: 0.05; 0.3; and 0.14, 95% CI: 0.01; 0.3, respectively), whereas Emotional symptoms were inversely associated with Se and Zn levels in cord blood (-0.13, 95% CI: -0.3; 0.004; and -0.10, 95% CI: -0.2; 0.02, respectively). In the IDS, cord blood Pb levels were found to be negatively associated with Fluid and Crystallized IQ (-0.12, 95% CI: -0.3; 0.02; and -0.14, 95% CI: -0.3; 0.007, respectively) as well as Mathematical skills (-0.15, 95% CI: -0.3; 0.01). The current research has been able to simultaneously assess the exposure to various interacting chemicals during the prenatal period. We demonstrate that prenatal co-exposures to Pb, Hg, Zn and Se have long-term influences on the neuropsychological outcome of school-age children."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058065265","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"204","pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001393512101344X?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"658e79734097076c145c5b55","name":"Gemma","lastName":"Calamandrei","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"08fe4b1f-831f-4671-afdc-6824ba35b254"},{"objectId":"658e79734097076c145c5b54","name":"Anna

phenomenon called inclusiveness has been widely discussed in the context of tourism. It refers to all tourist groups which might be marginalised due to their age, physical or mental condition, and different types of disabilities. The catering industry that serves both tourists and local communities, has also recognised the need of providing access to all customers groups. In the up to now literature on inclusive tourism, issues of catering services have rarely been addressed and have usually focused on a selected group of consumers. The aim of the study was to determine the scale of inclusivity for the catering industry on the example of Krakow – one of the oldest and most touristic cities in Poland. The following research questions have been raised: What types of activities in the area of inclusivity are undertaken by catering premises in Krakow and which of these activities are dominant? The survey method has been used to carry out the research by means of a questionnaire in paper form. 169 restaurants took part in the research. They are located in the area of the most touristic districts, which has been divided into three parts. To illustrate the degree of diversification of activities regarding the inclusiveness in the gastronomy industry in the researched area, the E.C. Amemiya (η) Economic Base Diversification Index has been adopted and used. From the obtained results it can be concluded that the phenomenon of inclusiveness in the surveyed restaurants in Krakow does occur and that the degree of differentiation of inclusive activities of the catering premises in Krakow is high.

In the case of spreading of plastic streams or bypassing obstacles in the form of cores in the mould, the joining lines run down. Most often, the strength of the moulded part is the lowest in these areas and the resulting lines can cause cracking. The aim of the research presented in the publication was to evaluate the properties of particular parts of mouldings obtained from an experimental injection mould equipped with 4 weld line areas. The tests were performed using the method of thermal analysis by Dynamic Mechanical Analysis DMA. Tensile tests were performed on the parts with weld areas and the maximum crack force was determined. The morphology of the obtained fractures was observed using an optical microscope."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058065290","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.67","pagesFromTo":"325-331","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.imim.pl/files/archiwum/Vol1_2022/44.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"620b63db2467f07b3c5a04f7","name":"Roman","lastName":"HUMIENNY","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"05dd6bd9-2a74-43f7-9804-4887d8720d2b"},{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b6788","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Kalwik","uuid":"BD6C0E9E6F2F9E80133CED25DA0A57F78B9079DD16FA1EDE0F5AA941F726BFD5CB6EBA2408C162AF3DDA68FA1D45B1BB9FE54782BE96D1C0DFC000D1FE1AB614","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cb7330f3-0c21-4e6d-ac5c-e385956d81d2"},{"objectId":"5e709213878c28a04738f757","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Postawa","uuid":"3F1B944244B93137A2AD803088510BD4044BF8435F4AA2A41F7E47DE0D032E88D88FD19B7AE42889F4117659B0EECC695CE96D1D734171465EF82F3976E3C333","orcidId":"0000-0001-7654-2963","documentHash":"6073f53b-debb-41a8-8d49-554ec752f642"}],"doi":"10.24425/amm.2022.137762"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","uid":"btSYdQGYDtmYBdiC2rKR_nQ","uuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","parentUuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","rootUuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","name":"Instytut Fizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ad878c28a0473c17a8","5e7094ad878c28a0473c17a6","61b41b397523402a58ca0e65","5e709386878c28a0473abd6d","5e7092bc878c28a04739baaa","5e7094cd878c28a0473c40f3","5e7092ba878c28a04739b8cf","5e7092b1878c28a04739adc4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Nanoscale Morphology of Short-Period {CdO/ZnO} Superlattices Grown by MBE","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547784f","mniswId":"4571","title":"CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN","doi":null,"issn":"1528-7483","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"470c3d73-da97-467e-86d1-59626f4a93e0"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-27","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620cc7a52467f01217ad9091","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092bc878c28a04739baaa","5e7094ad878c28a0473c17a6","5e7094cd878c28a0473c40f3","5e7092ba878c28a04739b8cf","61b41b397523402a58ca0e65","5e7094ad878c28a0473c17a8","5e709386878c28a0473abd6d","5e7092b1878c28a04739adc4"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The nanoscale morphology of short-period {CdO/ZnO}n superlattices (SLs) grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy on m-oriented sapphire substrates is studied. The SL structures consist of 25 repetitions of subsequently deposited ZnO and CdO layers. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microcopy (TEM) studies confirm the presence of 2D SL structures with the wurtzite phase of ZnO sublayers and the rocksalt structure of CdO sublayers. For thicker ZnO sublayers, the (11̅.3) twinning was observed. The SL periods are calculated based on high-resolution XRD and TEM analyses. By varying the thickness of the CdO and ZnO sublayers, it is possible to control the energy gap in these quasi-alloys. These results suggest the promising potential of their optical properties for light emission and/or applications in the detection of visible to ultra-violet

To evaluate whether Dex treatment, swimming, and combining these factors act on analyzed data, rats were randomly divided into four groups: saline treatment non-exercise and exercise and Dex treatment non-exercised and exercised. Animals in both exercised groups underwent long-lasting swimming. The concentration of lipids metabolites, glucose, and lactate were measured in skeletal muscles and blood according to standard colorimetric and fluorimetric methods. Also, activities of enzymes related to aerobic and anaerobic metabolism were measured in skeletal muscles. The results indicated that Dex treatment induced body mass loss and increased lipid metabolites in the rats’ blood but did not alter these changes in skeletal muscles. Interestingly, prolonged swimming applied after 9 days of Dex treatment significantly intensified changes induced by Dex; however, there was no difference in skeletal muscle enzymatic activities. This study shows for the first time the cumulative effect of exercise and Dex on selected elements of lipid metabolism, which seems to be essential for the patient’s health due to the common use of glucocorticoids like Dex."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058065368","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23020748","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"658d6ee14097076c145828c1","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Ziółkowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"740da4be-c175-40a9-b1d0-95d2c45a42ec"},{"objectId":"658d6ee14097076c145828c0","name":"Andzelika","lastName":"Borkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bf9f8311-a08a-41ad-8b8c-c97ff9149e91"},{"objectId":"658d6ee14097076c145828bf","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Jost","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"228535ff-3826-45f6-9ef5-227568db67db"},{"objectId":"658d6ee14097076c145828be","name":"Ewa Aleksandra","lastName":"Rodziewicz-Flis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e31b8ba2-3254-49ce-bf4f-2d943f3d4104"},{"objectId":"658d6ee14097076c145828bd","name":"Emilia Gabriela","lastName":"Bialobrodzka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6906c000-b62c-46d9-a421-341cce35e887"},{"objectId":"658d6ee14097076c145828bc","name":"Damian Józef","lastName":"Flis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c930ba4a-175a-4faa-963c-c7f05ec603ff"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738f9f7","name":"Jan","lastName":"Kaczor","uuid":"99BAC09C49E8CF15DA2F37E37CA602FD1153422A73A5B71AA0E366DB24AB2F3F7B09A6A3427796D711B840F88A6561F1CB4414E8E7AAC09366F4FB9560370470","orcidId":"0000-0002-6370-2160","documentHash":"1aac4424-8d8e-410f-8119-d5a8a87e1a36"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms23020748"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["metal-matrix composites","powder metallurgy","plasma vapor deposition","imperfect interface","thermal conductivity","numerical modeling"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Thermal conductivity of Cu-matrix composites reinforced with coated SiC particles: Numerical modeling and experimental verification","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478210","mniswId":"8974","title":"International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer","doi":null,"issn":"0017-9310","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d1e8b705-cc73-4928-b256-a9d9aa277f41"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620a142a2467f06a1eda2844","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70927e878c28a047396c00","5e70927d878c28a047396a5f"]},"issue":"","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Copper-matrix composites reinforced with silicon carbide (SiC) particles are heat sink materials with potential application in the electronic industry. A major challenge in the manufacturing of these materials, involving sintering process, is to prevent the decomposition of SiC and the subsequent dissolution of silicon in the copper matrix. This is overcome by coating SiC particles with metallic layers. In this study, a combined experimental and computational micromechanics approach was used to investigate thermal conductivity of Cu-matrix composites reinforced with silicon carbide particles coated with chromium, titanium, or tungsten layers. Plasma Vapor Deposition (PVD) was used to produce the metallic layers on SiC particles, while Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) to consolidate the powder mixtures of copper and coated silicon carbide. Thermal conductivities of the fabricated three-phase composites Cu/SiC/Cr, Cu/SiC/Ti and Cu/SiC/W were evaluated using the Laser Flash technique. Finite Element Method (FEM) and Variational Asymptotic Method (VAM) based homogenization techniques were used for computational modeling of thermal conductivity. In the numerical models complex material microstructures were accounted for using micro-CT images of the sintered compacts. Comparison of the experimental results with simulations highlighted the importance of including the effect of imperfect interfaces to accurately model thermal conductivity of the investigated composites."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058065403","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"188","pagesFromTo":"122633-1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396c00","name":"Witold","lastName":"Węglewski","uuid":"D4E71EA081193D7DC95058664993A58489EEE738E084A2953793749631CEA45348BC15654AC0843CAB646B787FA785E600F824F8B296590605A6CBD81A9F1BEF","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"81340106-caa1-47c8-a728-9ff927a3f2ec"},{"objectId":"5e70927d878c28a047396a5f","name":"Michał","lastName":"Basista","uuid":"55D4990DE618D6B768F800690B50AC245C0108D03B6DADE528350FA06948E2170C51EA7749AB7D953AF638F56604199DC928727AA97CFAB3B2B3AE45A0A06189","orcidId":"0000-0002-6308-3267","documentHash":"b3fb2347-1725-45da-9076-3f78e2be77ab"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2022.122633"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["szkoła","przedszkole","obwód szkoły","sieć szkół","oświata"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["school","nursery school","school district","school network","education"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd41","uid":"bc81RPyqL4Br7M4bOIzt-xA","uuid":"2d00d06e-140e-46c4-be04-bf77ae1c73ca","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd41","parentUuid":"2d00d06e-140e-46c4-be04-bf77ae1c73ca","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd41","rootUuid":"2d00d06e-140e-46c4-be04-bf77ae1c73ca","name":"Akademia Ekonomiczno-Humanistyczna w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70937f878c28a0473ab45e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Charakter prawny uchwał w przedmiocie ustalenia sieci (planów sieci) publicznych przedszkoli, szkół podstawowych oraz ponadpodstawowych podejmowanych na podstawie art. 32 ust. 1 oraz art. 39 ust. 2 i 7 ustawy - Prawo oświatowe","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a47a","mniswId":"497444","title":"SAMORZĄD TERYTORIALNY","doi":null,"issn":"0867-4973","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"5babd99a-bd71-4ffd-ac00-dcdf3f59bbe2"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":true,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62078f7f2467f0513632d1bb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70937f878c28a0473ab45e"]},"issue":"1-2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Przedmiotem opracowania jest szczegółowa analiza charakteru prawnego uchwał, na podstawie których tworzone są sieci oraz plany sieci publicznych szkół podstawowych oraz publicznych przedszkoli.

Despite the obligation arising directly from the Education Law to publish these resolutions in the voivodship official journals, their classification as acts of local law is not unambiguous.The doctrinal premises qualifying a territorial self-government unit’s resolution as an act of local law constituted the starting point for the analysis. Next, the role that these resolutions play in the educational system was defined, including their impact on the implementation of the education obligation and the school obligation. It was proved that only resolutions creating networks of state-run primary schools constitute acts of local law. In the other cases, the acts in question should only be qualified as other acts of law that are subject to promulgation under a specific regulation. In justifying the above, itwas demonstrated that only the legal regulations contained in the above resolutions constitute – indirectly – the grounds for issuing administrative decisions individually concretizing rights or obligations with respect to the citizens."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058065412","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62078fe42467f0513632d214","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"1-2","doi":"","documentHash":"1c20737c-2a57-4021-89e7-a3e3bacbd98a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"82-93","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://sip.lex.pl/komentarze-i-publikacje/artykuly/charakter-prawny-uchwal-w-przedmiocie-ustalenia-sieci-planow-sieci-151406500","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70937f878c28a0473ab45e","name":"JAKUB","lastName":"MROŻEK","uuid":"953024ED5BF08D4D172D2FF69B1067B974CECC66C7C305DA8C9A900330BD9CFB219C4E7455A7974A6EE220DED5B96DFDE9BECDC3220F3C9B38C385151F9DF3A0","orcidId":"0000-0002-1018-5163","documentHash":"182a5215-421a-49d5-8ee9-27316549e9d8"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","uid":"bRRT1dnyPJtioT7xTLQBnOQ","uuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","parentUuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","rootUuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","name":"Centrum Badań Molekularnych i Makromolekularnych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709349878c28a0473a6852","5e7093fc878c28a0473b4675"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Molecular dynamics between amorphous and crystalline phases of e-beam irradiated piezoelectric PVDF thin films employing solid-state NMR spectroscopy","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479326","mniswId":"16358","title":"Polymer Degradation and Stability","doi":null,"issn":"0141-3910","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"770963d8-da9d-4bc1-9775-34ad7423735f"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620a537a2467f06a1edbeb9e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["620a537a2467f06a1edbeba0","620a537a2467f06a1edbeba2","620a537a2467f06a1edbeba3","620a537a2467f06a1edbeba4","5e709349878c28a0473a6852","5e7093fc878c28a0473b4675"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Piezoelectric bi-axially and uni-axially stretched PVDF films subjected to e-beam irradiation doses of 5 kGy, 500 kGy and 1 MGy and films not irradiated have been studied. It was found that the piezoelectric responses of both untreated and e-beam irradiated PVDF films under strain strongly depends on their initial manufacturing processing. The initial structural differences were mainly based on crystalline phase composition, notably the alpha to beta polymorph ratio. F-19 MAS Solid State NMR measurements performed with fast sample spinning (31.25 kHz) allow us to accurately determine the proportion of crystal and amorphous phases. Considering only the crystalline phases, it was concluded that the uni-axial ((beta)-PVDF) film was almost composed of 100% of beta-phase while the biaxially-oriented ((alpha-beta)-PVDF) was composed of 81% beta-phase and 19% of alpha-phase. It was also shown that the changes of local dynamic processes of PVDF chains in kHz timescale enable to reflect the degradation of both the crystalline and amorphous phases. Presence of small molecular-weight chemical compounds was evidenced by Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) H-1 MAS NMR experiment. The degradation process was in agreement with melting peak decrease registered by DSC. F-19/H-1 T-1 rho relaxation times and analysis of cross-polarization (CP) buildup curves are discussed. Significant scatter of relaxation parameters (F-19 T-1 rho and H-1 T-1 rho) suggested an important degradation of polymer structure. The H-1 T-1 rho values for PVDF samples irradiated at 1 MGy mainly imply chain scission mechanisms of degradation rather than cross-linking processes. SS NMR spectroscopy data supported assumption that e-beam irradiation brings flexibility to piezoelectric PVDF films which improved their piezoelectric voltage output generated by deformation up to doses of 500kGy. Above this dose range, degradations were very important and affected severely PVDF films mechanical properties."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058065420","journalIssue":{"objectId":"620a537a2467f06a1edbeba8","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"195","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"6f363855-046c-4a6b-9059-f13be5408c28"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"195","pagesFromTo":"Article number: 109786","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0141391021003050?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"620a537a2467f06a1edbeba4","name":"Marie-Claude","lastName":"Clochard","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c7ce21e9-aba2-4341-a39b-2b6872ccdcec"},{"objectId":"620a537a2467f06a1edbeba3","name":"Jean-Eric","lastName":"Wegrowe","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"17fc5b27-a7bb-4735-847e-742c1177e3eb"},{"objectId":"620a537a2467f06a1edbeba2","name":"Olivier","lastName":"Cavani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4ad21f14-7e9d-43ab-9ccc-9d5ceae58366"},{"objectId":"620a537a2467f06a1edbeba0","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Potrzebowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3115e1e8-5344-4145-8956-3f74b590aaab"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b4675","name":"Marek","lastName":"Potrzebowski","uuid":"8315B610BC61F8688EBAE3C69AFDC8B021EAF73A4DAEE361F0941C232D7A98FBB105B633516FF529F9BF3179EDEE0D687ECF8BD0C00AC1AD30139B4669A91050","orcidId":"0000-0001-5672-0638","documentHash":"d426d891-c43f-44b2-be29-0bd544b24867"},{"objectId":"5e709349878c28a0473a6852","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Kaźmierski","uuid":"F7D0F828A1C9C5717BF13E0F482183EDD7B3097CD00512A63D581D7963E7490A463D4783387346AB12925057FAC65BC09AF83864F55204425D5B31CEC26B0583","orcidId":"0000-0002-5904-2630","documentHash":"e88b20bf-d78e-4171-9b49-a35b86f9aab9"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2021.109786"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Juncus efusus L.","De-icing salts","trace metals","rare earth elements","Bioavailability"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","uid":"b_ZPtKgtv4v90uInHkYp6dg","uuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","parentUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","rootUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Kochanowskiego w Kielcach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928c878c28a047397b86","5e70928c878c28a047397b70","5e7092ef878c28a04739f6cf","5e70928e878c28a047397c95"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Bioavailability of selected trace and rare earth elements to Juncus effusus L.: the potential role of de-icing chlorides in the roadside environment","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792b0","mniswId":"16181","title":"Plant and Soil","doi":null,"issn":"0032-079X","eissn":"1573-5036","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"45653d95-a24e-4822-8d59-b8505dadf43b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-06","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620b9a372467f07b3c5b8056","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928e878c28a047397c95","5e70928c878c28a047397b86","5e70928c878c28a047397b70","5e7092ef878c28a04739f6cf"]},"issue":"1-2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background and aim\nThe presence of chlorides in soils, e.g., from de-icing salts may change metal availability to plants.\nMethods\nTo assess the role of de-icing chlorides on bioavailability of metals, the samples of the rhizosphere soils, roots and shoots of Juncus effusus L. were collected monthly from April to June of 2019 in the vicinity of roads and analyzed for trace (Ag, Cd, Co, Cu, Pb, Zn) and rare earth elements (from La to Lu).\nResults\nConcentrations of Cl− were distinctly higher in the shoots than in the roots. Apart from Cd, the concentration sequence of the other metals was as follows: rhizosphere soils>roots>shoots. The bioaccumulation and translocation factors indicated that Cd was the most preferably transported to the shoots as opposed to Ag, Co, Pb and REEs that showed a very low translocation potential. Negative correlations, which were noted between Cu and Co in the shoots and Cl− in soils, revealed their role in salinity stress alleviation. All soil samples showed a positive anomaly of Ce and a negative anomaly of Eu, whereas the shoots showed in turn a negative anomaly of Ce and a distinct positive anomaly of Eu. The lowest salinity factors (K/Na, Ca/Na) of the shoots resulted from an increase of salinity in J. effusus by higher sodium concentrations derived from de-icing NaCl.\nConclusions\nDe-icing agents may change the uptake of other elements. In natural habitats, the factors affecting this process include: type of element, soil metal concentrations and interactions, and individual plant features."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058065424","journalIssue":{"objectId":"626669804097071c15d92e44","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"472","number":"1-2","doi":null,"documentHash":"e5217e38-fc32-4c55-8cf7-984c1107b522"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"472","pagesFromTo":"641-658","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11104-021-05278-0.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092ef878c28a04739f6cf","name":"Karina","lastName":"Krzciuk","uuid":"0E02A04243E334976713337BBC32ECCC81B9FB7B69289163147C03C907851986FA3D2C9F21E8867C6513E98464E7B4D1F86CEB39880DA2263F3B5444CC7C02F6","orcidId":"0000-0002-9821-7667","documentHash":"2efb1a32-979f-4258-8eed-030041bd2443"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397c95","name":"Sabina","lastName":"Dołęgowska","uuid":"96DB19BE91C42878670E217BFAB14ACF0FB710D2BB3CA52061DA8A3D9E13C1899D95A136EAD92FA0B7FE2E68569DF905D9FE617B39F1477212800C5F875F1016","orcidId":"0000-0001-7797-1292","documentHash":"44a914d3-e4d4-484b-9c6e-4effae8c1f9d"},{"objectId":"5e70928c878c28a047397b86","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Gałuszka","uuid":"5A5943670563926E4139405886C61BF6FEC47BF924872C0F8D64E747955B2A398FB5EEF8B68E07DAAC34316E89F9EA64785285E8ACBB25C8A4BE55D6B874227F","orcidId":"0000-0002-2497-2627","documentHash":"0dec5c68-d827-421f-bb42-10c1ac3b2e67"},{"objectId":"5e70928c878c28a047397b70","name":"Zdzisław","lastName":"Migaszewski","uuid":"92ECBB799AE2C9F43FB995DED0DF11A4B81620F7EA9CCA1618E57393A0AD5D3D4A4692B0660D72DA96E30AAACDB10931491A77EFEDBDDE8A5833349D517DD3FC","orcidId":"0000-0001-5549-6224","documentHash":"bc765a18-ec83-448d-9869-f9c50ca06bb6"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11104-021-05278-0"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Enfluran","Narażenie zawodowe"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee3","uid":"bnX0HoKbxpGTrsHNBITsQWQ","uuid":"bdc6f547-9a9a-42e0-baaa-e9556955346a","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee3","parentUuid":"bdc6f547-9a9a-42e0-baaa-e9556955346a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee3","rootUuid":"bdc6f547-9a9a-42e0-baaa-e9556955346a","name":"Instytut Medycyny Pracy im. prof. dr. med.

Zastosowano metodę zbierania dowodów na podstawie przeglądu internetowych baz danych czasopism naukowych. Enfluran należy do wziewnych środków ogólnie znieczulających. Obserwowano, że u pacjentów powodował on złośliwą hipertermię, napady padaczkowe, zaburzenia rytmu serca, depresję ośrodka oddechowego i niedociśnienie tętnicze. Nieliczne dane wskazują na możliwość uszkodzenia wątroby czy niewydolności nerek na skutek narkozy. Narażenie zawodowe na enfluran może występować u pracowników opieki medycznej. Narządem docelowym dla enfluranu jest ośrodkowy układ nerwowy, a skutkiem krytycznym pogorszenie sprawności psychomotorycznej. W badaniach z udziałem ochotników rekrutowanych spośród personelu medycznego sal operacyjnych narażonego na enfluran wykazano istotne pogorszenie wyników w Teście czasu reakcji prostej. Grupy eksperckie na świecie za najniższy poziom działania szkodliwego (lowest observed adverse effect concentration – LOAEC) dla pogorszenia wyników testów psychomotorycznych przyjmują stężenie na poziomie 5–10% minimalnego stężenia w powietrzu pęcherzyków płucnych w trakcie znieczulania (minimal anesthetic concentration – MAC), tj. 6342–12 684 mg/m3. Ocena potencjalnego działania nefrotoksycznego enfluranu wykazała, że jest ono mało prawdopodobne, gdyż biotransformacja enfluranu u ludzi skutkuje niskim szczytowym stężeniem fluorku w surowicy, średnio 15 µmol/l. Wczesne doniesienia przypisujące uszkodzenie wątroby u pacjentów nie zostały potwierdzone. Badania epidemiologiczne dotyczące narażenia zawodowego wzbudziły obawy co do wpływu mieszanin gazów znieczulających na częstość poronień, rozwój płodu i wady wrodzone u dzieci, jednak w żadnym z tych badań nie określono szczegółowo rodzaju i stężenia stosowanych gazów znieczulających. W badaniu rakotwórczości i mutagenności uzyskano wyniki negatywne. W Polsce nie monitoruje się narażenia zawodowego na enfluran, ponieważ nie ustalono dla niego wartości normatywnej w powietrzu środowiska pracy. Konieczne jest szybkie wprowadzenie tego anestetyku wraz z obowiązującą wartością dopuszczalną do wykazu NDS (najwyższe dopuszczalne stężenie)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058065475","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62050dbb2467f04219d143df","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"73","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"edb7d74b-3a9d-4ba6-b36b-1b2d6a8512e9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"73","pagesFromTo":"51-69","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://medpr.imp.lodz.pl/pdf-144151-72453","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b80ef","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kupczewska-Dobecka","uuid":"7C14674BBFA60ACC3C356857B6240BEFD231BCD43FD87DAB549895A6141FB12DB3E4B5D060891667ACEF4B559E34D4D4FA9B18595FEFD9F183A39B45255D51BF","orcidId":"0000-0001-9633-9428","documentHash":"d97ff892-df62-4360-82b0-833ff1a33c15"}],"doi":"10.13075/mp.5893.01204"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Celuloza","Hemiceluloza","Lignina","Tytanit","Włókno kwaśno-detergentowe","Włókno neutralne detergentowe","Wartość paszowa"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","uid":"bz_6XXECFL3_CFkpms5BsDQ","uuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","parentUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","rootUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","name":"Uniwersytet w Siedlcach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709294878c28a04739848b","5e709420878c28a0473b6adc"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Effect of Tytanit on Fibre Fraction Content in Medicago x varia T.

This test was carried out to characterize the dynamic-mechanical properties as a function of frequency, temperature and time. Additionally, microscopic analyses of the surfaces of the tested printouts were performed in order to assess the changes after electrolysis."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058065559","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.67","pagesFromTo":"333-339","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.imim.pl/files/archiwum/Vol1_2022/45.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b6788","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Kalwik","uuid":"BD6C0E9E6F2F9E80133CED25DA0A57F78B9079DD16FA1EDE0F5AA941F726BFD5CB6EBA2408C162AF3DDA68FA1D45B1BB9FE54782BE96D1C0DFC000D1FE1AB614","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cb7330f3-0c21-4e6d-ac5c-e385956d81d2"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473aefdc","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Redutko","uuid":"C93D6A713F0604738324C98B9E52606F16223CE9F3095AE37C0271545034358308396A8304FEFE6DB8D728C17F526A97D9DBFF24D1F48E8FA2708F83FB635D06","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"02bfbdb9-bbc9-4692-a076-1d9022e7e414"},{"objectId":"5e709211878c28a04738f741","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Szarek","uuid":"7A2F169B1D1965E7D5B168D40A70F82AF40F62049330590B5960FE3CE9B91F2B8BB975A8A4AE6C2A604117C85CC639C749DF4C3EDD9741FAA36C82CB44696ACD","orcidId":"0000-0002-5910-0554","documentHash":"73c19034-e6ae-4931-81c2-f0465d959e75"}],"doi":"10.24425/amm.2022.137763"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee9","uid":"btl1TUFZ-RmtE1VFT09EDlQ","uuid":"f68cdefe-93d4-402f-94e1-bd2ef1f8616a","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee9","parentUuid":"f68cdefe-93d4-402f-94e1-bd2ef1f8616a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee9","rootUuid":"f68cdefe-93d4-402f-94e1-bd2ef1f8616a","name":"Instytut Ochrony Roślin -

The rise in population creates many chances for businesses, but also generates potential costs, like depleting of natural resources and overcrowding. It also causes shifts of power in the global economy. In light of this rapid growth, the sustainable development megatrend was created with the purpose of leading the business and consumer world to care for the natural environment, and poor and marginalized people, bringing the social equilibrium to light and drawing the attention of global society to the advantages of sustainable economic growth. Regarding the megatrend of technology, the chapter describes the vision of the development of artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, the Internet of Things, and digitalization’s future as foreseen by new research findings and publicly available information."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058067618","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"223-237","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003204343-102/looking-ahead-2030-rafa%C5%82-%C5%9Bliwi%C5%84ski-%C5%82ukasz-pu%C5%9Blecki?context=ubx&refId=ed3a1518-cc1b-4b4e-a223-ade6eb797f35","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393a3d","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Śliwiński","uuid":"0DF85E81B4AC926266642109C4AF623D2412012D74C1D6DB226A687068C11ADAF5FFE73EC1066E638B9C235E7B9F84D5F1767E612E21E104A31D39F59B713E46","orcidId":"0000-0001-6650-9764","documentHash":"fee90605-2887-47c7-9c38-9fb4810a134f"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393a23","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Puślecki","uuid":"0BD901E74E0EED5A659BEBCE6E925D235827B8D14CC72742071D248E272ED44BFC40014A78D2CB9668DA283E448BA11D88BB7FF7761D1F067C175C6A9985BA4B","orcidId":"0000-0003-1062-8312","documentHash":"1129b3f5-c26a-4689-8c12-ff1212f2e8ed"}],"doi":"10.4324/9781003204343-102"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hardening","reinforced concrete structures","reinforcing steel","thermal strengthening"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Specifics of Physico-Mechanical Characteristics of Thermally-Hardened Rebar","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa83c9aff2974850cd45","mniswId":"29557","title":"Production Engineering Archives","doi":null,"issn":"2353-5156","eissn":"2353-7779","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"4a8d124e-dc48-4e00-9068-cca22b4ed7f4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2022-02-12","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6214e1532467f02f1e61f4a8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6214e1532467f02f1e61f4a9","5e709203878c28a04738e8e9","6214e1532467f02f1e61f4ab"]},"issue":"Iss.1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Thermal hardening is widely used nowadays for modification of steel bar properties and obtaining effective reinforcing material. Strength and deformation characteristics of thermally hardened reinforcement is the complex indicator of reinforcement efficiency. Therefore, reliable assessment of physico-mechanical characteristics of thermally hardened rebar is topical and important issue. This article is intended to the analysis of physico-mechanical characteristics of thermally hardened rebar on the basis of experimental data. Thorough statistical processing of experimental data was made and specific features of strength parameters were identified. Analytical model of strength characteristics is proposed, which enables to take into account inhomogeneous strength properties of the rebar along its cross-section. It could be stated that assessment of physico-mechanical characteristics of thermally hardened rebar is topical and important issue, which is the prospective area of further research."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058067623","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.28","pagesFromTo":"73-81","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/article/10.30657/pea.2022.28.09","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6214e1532467f02f1e61f4ab","name":"Yaroslav","lastName":"BLIKHARSKYY","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4d29c6d7-ae19-4b63-96b8-c49ed7b789a1"},{"objectId":"6214e1532467f02f1e61f4a9","name":"Nadiia","lastName":"KOPIIKA","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9d0ee4a3-1c5d-4429-a539-3f843cea4714"},{"objectId":"5e709203878c28a04738e8e9","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Selejdak","uuid":"9A373E3E27BB155462A13647BB2DDF511926758A94EC6C2EE3267CB6B10C229D9874A32EE8D56F39D511A5665A91CB271B96916396886B2B69E22053EEAAE0C7","orcidId":"0000-0001-9854-5962","documentHash":"c792c16c-7e10-4b5d-9226-a57f5589f200"}],"doi":"10.30657/pea.2022.28.09"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Electromyography, SEMG, Larynx, Singers, Phonation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b0878c28a047384dc0","uid":"bVyqrRKyfiKxfiyIqfIvjmw","uuid":"1306e042-f103-4b72-aa6e-0dd3cea395b5","parentId":"5e7091b0878c28a047384dc0","parentUuid":"1306e042-f103-4b72-aa6e-0dd3cea395b5","rootId":"5e7091b0878c28a047384dc0","rootUuid":"1306e042-f103-4b72-aa6e-0dd3cea395b5","name":"Instytut Fizjologii i Patologii Słuchu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["620e3f802467f02b135e19cf","5e709365878c28a0473a8be1","5e7094dd878c28a0473c599e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Electromyographic Assessment of the External Laryngeal Muscles of Opera Singers During Phonation and Non-Phonation Tasks","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bea","mniswId":"13179","title":"Journal of Voice","doi":null,"issn":"0892-1997","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"6663b1c9-3fbd-46de-8309-a6429fc3bae4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620e3f802467f02b135e19cb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094dd878c28a0473c599e","5e709365878c28a0473a8be1","620e3f802467f02b135e19cf"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction. The surface EMG technique (sEMG) gives valuable assessment of vocal tract as well as diagnosis or outcome assessment in dysphonia. There are very few papers on the use of sEMG in vocal professionalists.\nAim. The aim of this study was to evaluate the electromyographic characteristics of selected external laryngeal and neck muscles in professional opera singers.\nMaterial. The study material consisted of 50 subjects. Twenty-six opera professional singers and 24 healthy non-singers.\nMethod. Each person underwent otolaryngologic and phoniatric examination, laryngeal videostroboscopy, hearing testing, multiparametric acoustic voice analysis (multidimensional voice program) and sEMG of submen-talis, cricothyroid and sternocleidomastoid muscles.\nResults. Statistical analysis of the values of the amplitudes of the submentalis and the cricothyroid muscles showed significant differences between the vocalists and the control group. Moreover, during vowel phonation and glissando, significantly greater differences in the asymmetry of sternocleidomastoid muscles amplitudes were observed in singers compared to the control group. In most subjects, the studied muscles did not show asymmetry during saliva swallowing.\nConclusions. Laryngeal muscle function should be assessed during different phonation and non-phonation tasks. Singers have different SEMG characteristics than non-singers. Knowledge of the patient's history and endoscopic studies is needed to interpret EMG recordings."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058067636","journalIssue":{"objectId":"620e3f802467f02b135e19d1","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"4e9c8a98-b399-4667-ac4b-fa2ec55ba6fa"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0892199722000029?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"620e3f802467f02b135e19cf","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Milewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cd069dcf-34e0-48f6-91ac-23172ad9d6f0"},{"objectId":"5e7094dd878c28a0473c599e","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Krasnodębska","uuid":"DB65F78129E1BD9115E50865069B7A5A6B2BAD132CC015A2EBB1E168B409C227CA686FFC7362BFD6A5CADE948BB5248A58031A69D21783EB0743CFD44AE577CF","orcidId":"0000-0003-4551-282X","documentHash":"ba68d991-0447-4a1e-8f26-5c68d678ace3"},{"objectId":"5e709365878c28a0473a8be1","name":"Agata","lastName":"Szkiełkowska","uuid":"F56FDE721132C047083CD3673B9DFF0725CDEA2B307F54326B045004E7F771825A0BFAD7735C386B501BC37690EC617E85A380B7B3D95ED1F9D947E54562198F","orcidId":"0000-0003-2122-7872","documentHash":"5f17fca9-cb65-45a4-9a62-788624bf39d1"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jvoice.2022.01.002"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","uid":"bX41kHc85ivocrWE0ISfROw","uuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","parentUuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","rootUuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","name":"Politechnika Wrocławska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602c919b9543c7410626e020","5e709381878c28a0473ab724","5e7091fc878c28a04738e18e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Engineering and manufacturing technology of green epoxy resin coatings modified with recycled fine aggregates","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454782a0","mniswId":"9271","title":"International Journal of Precision Engineering and Manufacturing -

The mentioned region is the group of countries where changes related to the move to green energy are most visible (in addition to some countries from other regions, such as Singapore, New Zealand, or countries of the Arabian Peninsula). The research assumed the hypothesis that over the years since the Paris Conference the themes of mergers and acquisitions have changed from motives close to the views related to energy generation in traditional systems (black energy in large, monopolistic systems) to motives close to green energy (the research hypothesis). This was confirmed in the research, as business risk diversification (defined as diversification of the power sources from black to green) was the most popular M&A motive. In addition to emphasizing the direction of changes in the M&A motives, the authors of this study decided to check whether since 2015 (when the Paris Conference was organized) the motives behind the M&A transactions conducted by companies operating in the electrical energy generation sector have changed, making their motives close to the green energy dominant in Western Europe. Apart from verification of the abovementioned hypothesis, the aim of the research was to check whether there are any characteristic directions of changes in M&A motives across companies from particular Western European countries. The motives are changing from positional approaches to motives closer to resource approaches (green economy).

All materials were synthesized by the traditional melt-quenching technique. The glass stability (GS) parameters (Krg, ∆T, KW, KH) were determined. The effect of the addition of B2O3 on the GS, liquation phenomenon, crystallization process, and the type of crystallizing phases were examined using SEM-EDS, DSC, XRD, and Raman spectroscopy imaging methods. It was observed that the addition of B2O3 increased the tendency of the glass to crystallize. Both phosphates (e.g., Ca9MgK(PO4)7, Mg3Ca3(PO4)4), and silicates (e.g., K2Mg5(Si12O30), CaMg(Si2O6), MgSiO3) crystallized in the studied system. The Raman spectrum for the orthophosphate Mg3Ca3(PO4)4 stanfieldite type was obtained. Boron ions were introduced into the structures of crystalline compounds at high crystallization temperatures. The type of crystallizing phases was found to be related to the phenomenon of liquation, and the order of their occurrence was dependent on the Gibbs free enthalpy."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058067749","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"867","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/3/867","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"673d956cfdbe832d85e00e62","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kijo-Kleczkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1266dbad-d286-4146-851c-3d85597cd8fb"},{"objectId":"673d956cfdbe832d85e00e60","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Łagowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"27772d22-27a6-496b-87ef-a37e0bdaea4a"},{"objectId":"602df6619543c7410626e91c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Berezicka","uuid":"41B233912510DFE289B1705998B01D8B62CC0F1C35D388CB6E6C413EB2C3041FB2A78DD462E8EA5788CA884191FA1766B310A9020EDBA8972ED0074FE14C9507","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b66efafa-b1ff-4e25-b06a-0a67b3023b35"},{"objectId":"5e709472878c28a0473bd43c","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Jeleń","uuid":"1956FA2A1345E9961216FE825BE5D82104A2656DC044D9A5803EB38B045F1E23AF3111EF6C88892466F0D7064813F4D3E1DD6C6F71D582FE162E5BBBB033FA33","orcidId":"0000-0003-2905-6078","documentHash":"e27d043c-5c3e-4df5-a84c-188546649f69"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b80e2","name":"JUSTYNA","lastName":"SUŁOWSKA","uuid":"5842406FF91586EF6DFCD5EABEC4BC4FCFCCE0F88CA9EF1176925D652A5779CDFAB4BC45123D61D3FE42217C5D3225D0CA1A0C18A13E910844622563C7181DF6","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c65a98c8-2620-44b3-abdf-0b23f135933b"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af200","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Lach","uuid":"A7F908CCF6E7CA090FD9664057D7CDFA8CD99E834E6D829786D00F617AC4979FAD93F643FE5F86F2D98968A2649F1A38134FAA642E3499CD2F0526FDED11DC8A","orcidId":"0000-0001-8513-6780","documentHash":"3709b64b-6de1-4377-8613-f3b3bef5be96"},{"objectId":"5e7092cf878c28a04739d288","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Olejniczak","uuid":"50CF045978EF38896BEEA77C1541481818DA924B3B19631D29FE858F02DF2A65703A5AC50051FE8FCC840625342055E51DD9EFB83A20647B9FB9F7963184CA36","orcidId":"0000-0001-9303-3028","documentHash":"574724bc-f728-4fd9-8839-0f3dc1629001"},{"objectId":"5e70920b878c28a04738f00e","name":"MAGDALENA","lastName":"SZUMERA","uuid":"A164FA7E4A3957F5559FF0E9E0D015E608997C8ADC2F4ED7E2B5E3D5729017435DDEE8443611F93884AF94B16F5953CA7DBE4FEA9C7A2876A26FBE8B3E02F8C8","orcidId":"0000-0002-5692-8161","documentHash":"ed64dd6e-eac9-426f-a077-d796e820ccd6"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules27030867"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["rozwiązania oparte na przyrodzie","zmiany klimatu","zrównoważony rozwój","Polska"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["nature based solutions","climate change","suistainable development","Poland"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Nature-Based Solutions in Poland against Climate Change","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1073","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-04","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61e6acc02467f00287f180e0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924f878c28a0473938f7","5e70924f878c28a047393887"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"One of the currently promoted methods of counteracting climate change is nature-based climate solutions, which harness the power of nature to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable management of ecosystems is a guarantee for sustained human well-being. This underestimated, but extremely efficient and cheap method of integrating nature resources into the urban fabric is an economic “injection” for communal authorities. These “green” benefits should be standard in land-use planning in the era of anthropocentrism. Solutions based on nature were the reason for investigating their perception by Polish municipalities. The survey covered the entire country (all 2477 municipalities) from 20 July to 31 August 2021 through an electronic survey, obtaining 2128 responses (85.9% return rate). In the final result, data were obtained that support the hypotheses posed in the study. The main objective of the research was to check the level of activity of municipalities in Poland in the field of proecological activities using nature-based solutions (NbS). The survey results confirmed little knowledge of nature-based solutions, at the same time giving it an educational dimension. Half of the respondents declared that they learned about NbS only from the survey. Polish decision makers and municipal authorities introduce some solutions based on nature without being aware of their European classification and adequate nomenclature. Environmental awareness in Poland remains largely the domain of urban municipalities, with higher current budget revenues per capita and in the central and western parts of the country. NbS are marginal in rural municipalities, which can be explained by the lack of ecological specialists, less car traffic and more single-family houses and thus modest public areas. The following surveys covering the entire territory of Poland are the first to be carried out on such a large scale."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058067760","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/1/357","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a0473938f7","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Małecka-Ziembińska","uuid":"B23949EF0DF6FAC29D62345C76BB6C1CC9B80BEB4B14A2B0287D1B9107B5F80DDD8504EB4F3448263885556BAA182F409002ED40CB8CDB845A081CC2694D8F6E","orcidId":"0000-0002-3398-809X","documentHash":"888027e9-b5ea-4f57-9e2e-934addf393fb"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a047393887","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Janicka","uuid":"1ADA3EBC8344B8A1C74A8EFC60DDCDCB3170272E694138BEC1EB89F8586AD4DE8EF8C86EAB89C9267427B0CC1571ED5EF7EA536CB684EC0304A6F4F8BA62D6AA","orcidId":"0000-0003-4620-1935","documentHash":"2469b16b-a7a8-40ed-80f2-c69da73db8cc"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15010357"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","uid":"bRRT1dnyPJtioT7xTLQBnOQ","uuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","parentUuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","rootUuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","name":"Centrum Badań Molekularnych i Makromolekularnych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a1878c28a0473c0b2e","5e7094a1878c28a0473c0b21","5e70934c878c28a0473a6a7c","5e70934a878c28a0473a68ee","5e7094a1878c28a0473c0af0"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Catalysis in polymerization of cyclic esters.

The neuropeptide phoenixin (PNX) and its receptor (GPR173) are potential key factors involved in the proliferative and inflammatory regulation of the reproductive system in females. This study aimed to evaluate the expression of PNX and GPR173 by qPCR, western blot and immunofluorescence assays in the endometrium of bitches suffering from CEH or pyometra compared to clinically healthy females. Additionally, PNX and progesterone (P4) plasma concentrations were analysed. The results showed a significantly lower expression levels of PNX and GPR173 (mRNA and protein production) in bitches with the CEH or pyometra groups compared to healthy animals. Immunofluorescence staining examination also confirmed a lower concentration of PNX and GPR173 signals in bitches with pathological uteri. Moreover, a lower concentration of PNX blood levels in bitches suffering from pyometra was observed. The PNX concentration was negatively correlated with P4 but only in healthy bitches. These results illustrate that the development of canine uterine disorders may cause a lower expression of PNX and its receptor GPR173."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058067790","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62120f912467f077c36ab38b","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"238","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"f8de0107-51fb-4bde-ae7e-5be92c9815b1"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"238","pagesFromTo":"art. no 106931 (1-13)","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0378432022000100?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62120f912467f077c36ab387","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Błaszczyk-Cichoszewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4d10d3e3-099d-4691-bfc5-183d390c6c65"},{"objectId":"62120f912467f077c36ab383","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kubiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c23563c0-682f-40d1-be0a-95c1f13debce"},{"objectId":"5e7094df878c28a0473c5b0e","name":"Anna","lastName":"Łukomska","uuid":"B26E2EAF7A370D9475C27C75C94F3ED56B131F6AF01B6AB0422E63491462C0BE2F9DF94448B29F802563E89204E7A445665CF6DC19B0923529383EE00C09B2D7","orcidId":"0000-0001-5046-7416","documentHash":"2772ecda-553c-4fe5-99e4-7f6822ba68b9"},{"objectId":"5e7094c0878c28a0473c316c","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"858312226ECE716D8609BE25EFFD3666F435CF525E2979A5A3AA645C9ED034D771ACCA17A1FB93CC3BEAE3E35EFC9407B44BF7648E9B525F14344E04F04AE39A","orcidId":"0000-0002-1820-5202","documentHash":"e45e039a-cb16-45aa-a4d4-7246c3bed109"},{"objectId":"5e709409878c28a0473b53f7","name":"Marek","lastName":"Skrzypski","uuid":"42A1797AFD19A9277D6359ECF629A9162085BEB50A3503652A42FEC44977ED2D7D8A0650F6F8CD596FEADBEF09747EDCA654A4BAFAB18995D61A1659C05CEA61","orcidId":"0000-0003-4059-1362","documentHash":"4674d6eb-5bbf-43cf-ad11-f67ef56ad0bc"},{"objectId":"5e709409878c28a0473b5377","name":"Marta","lastName":"Rybska","uuid":"0126602BCE44A8CB6C2F3561CA5EDB312BC7B23955751A45E75872590CC4CBC54F23400F1DA3498E5E150C52DB529EE3243151CC9309533BDB869C082149ABB9","orcidId":"0000-0002-4563-3798","documentHash":"7ff46036-6707-46a3-ac85-7fcc14c0b088"},{"objectId":"5e7093e2878c28a0473b28dc","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Woźna-Wysocka","uuid":"7FFC12545486F853B50279DEF707EED359EFEE9B384BE3D7DEACE2AA8FA53944C937D0621155FE780A1B7A491A6E69213D587EFA64970E32514600914E515907","orcidId":"0000-0003-2993-7000","documentHash":"2d1765eb-65c7-4a64-afbf-453974880527"},{"objectId":"5e7093e2878c28a0473b28cb","name":"Maria","lastName":"Billert","uuid":"3A1B4F534AFC318748C610572F6DB22ECC9A07FCD56009B8DE3311C555594B65FF4169DAFBB926510C88ED1D03AEA7AA16CE05A9C631DF8DD43AEAC424F33BD0","orcidId":"0000-0002-2198-6046","documentHash":"422ecc11-2e63-4627-b789-451e04c83c90"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afb73","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Wąsowska","uuid":"AECE7258B2E1135409B11F4421C3D70F2F5E76461FB39DC54E62A25B4B20EA5D4376A6ABAB91AEBA675B85425AA99C49AD16D5A19AB717122735CFFE83ADF50F","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d58264bb-1003-48b1-a92b-a1f68342c0c6"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d2d","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Pomorska-Mól","uuid":"3663DFB5079C125EB89157B9DE39D1AD156445BA79396812A4DD949A1C4D6BBD65613E1079394FCF4966F34EA069D8E6514C3AE9C8DF267E172DCE2BFEEE18E6","orcidId":"0000-0003-2220-2730","documentHash":"a0c850ff-8ead-4532-bd2c-e0a6ce45fc45"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.anireprosci.2022.106931"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet Warszawski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602e2c6a9543c7410626edd2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Programy dobrowolnych odejść a zwolnienia grupowe.

chapter focuses on the financial determinants of the development of local government units. Under conditions of limited financial possibilities, public entities wishing to develop are faced with the necessity of rational and effective allocation of resources, which requires an efficient system of local financial management. The limited possibilities to use foreign capital to finance investment projects force local governments to generate an increasing operating surplus, which, together with property revenues, constitutes free funds that determine the degree of self-financing. Therefore, the main objective of the research is to assess the financial potential of development of gminas (gminas are principal units of territorial division in Poland) located in the Silesian Voivodeship, especially urban, rural and mixed urban-rural gminas. Against the background of theoretical aspects concerning financial determinants of the possibilities of development of local government units, the study evaluated financial liquidity, financial independence, level of debt and self-financing, investment activity and operational activity and total capability of gminas in the Silesian Voivodeship to develop. The research was conducted based on reports on the implementation of budgets, annual reports of the regional accounting chambers and the Ministry of Finance in a dynamic perspective in the years 2012–2017, which allowed to assess the direction and pace of changes in the analysed indicators. Furthermore, the ratios studied were related to the arithmetic mean for gminas in Poland in total, which made it possible to conduct the analysis using the comparative background."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058067821","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"103-116","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-81663-6_7","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709203878c28a04738e890","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Łukomska-Szarek","uuid":"DC5CF496E1B99E1C39398998B7C46457DFCB5D2DCF352A2CEF7B2CEE87E1C8AE7E013EE0E7797A5BD273D26141093745320B190C1BD3DB4401A449623F4D19EA","orcidId":"0000-0001-5521-9294","documentHash":"c7ca7cf3-2915-475c-9816-4a2eba33e87c"}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-81663-6_7"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["business interruption","COVID-19","operating performance","risk disclosures","text mining"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"620e37da2467f02b135dcd50","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-88374-4","title":"Risk Management.

In this respect, this study provides a better understanding of the directions for effective system interventions that could support business recovery and potentially reduce the macroeconomic impacts resulting from the anxieties of the business community. To draw these conclusions, we first conceptually consider the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak as an interruptive power. Furthermore, we study the key messages behind several global surveys that examined the business community outlook shortly after the lockdown.

In this paper, emissions of NOx (NO, NO2, N2O and their precursors, such as NH3 and HCN), SO2 and CO during conventional and oxy-fuel combustion of three kinds of biomass (agro, woody and energy crop) and a reference coal are presented and discussed. Combustion tests were conducted at 850 °C in the laboratory-scale circulating fluidized bed (CFB) reactor in air and O2/CO2 atmospheres. A FTIR spectrometer was used to measure instantaneous concentrations of all pollutants in the flue gas. Emissions of SO2, N2O and CO for the combustion of biomass in all atmospheres were lower than those for the combustion of reference coal. It was found that oxidation of nitrogen species released with volatile matter was responsible for high emissions of NOx during combustion of biomass fuels in air and mixtures of O2 and CO2. The lowest NO emissions for tested fuels were detected in oxy-21 atmosphere (21% O2/70% CO2). Oxy-combustion of biomass in O2/CO2 mixtures at 30% and 40% O2 caused a decrease in emissions of N2O and CO while NO and SO2 emissions increased. The results of this study show that the tested biomass fuels are ideal renewable energy resources both in conventional and oxy-fuel conditions with a minor potential for environmental pollution."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058067842","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.15","pagesFromTo":"brak","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/3/706","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"620e09472467f02b135c9e8f","name":"Adam","lastName":"LUCKOS","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"596a00cd-69b8-4768-94f2-28087883733e"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e77e","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kosowska-Golachowska","uuid":"B8A12BDD0D74F0F9AE1B9F41B7512A3208ABCA62BD534C06E33B8A26A2E6CA8E54553D610FC1F3EE568102658D9D23B2BDC1F6EA1E3B8CFAB8D72F5E9DEF2113","orcidId":"0000-0001-8719-1783","documentHash":"6fd205b5-dc44-4f96-9350-ffcd27bb3bc1"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e743","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kijo-Kleczkowska","uuid":"EB9C520B18E9D1E698E3DDDA56DA6AB5B37EC7B5EEA3F3A224EE9CE82217AB559123202D07CE34A21970A3C1168190857BB24FA6FBB530A207EF456F7DCBBF1D","orcidId":"0000-0001-8382-3093","documentHash":"80205906-67ec-45be-9df9-527783ffc170"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15030706"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["polimery

programming (GP) is applied to the discrete and continuous version of multi-criteria optimization. Recently, some essential analogies between multi-criteria decision making under certainty (M-DMC) and scenario-based one-criterion decision making under uncertainty (1-DMU) have been revealed in the literature. The aforementioned similarities allow the adjustment of GP to an entirely new domain. The aim of the paper is to create a new decision rule for mixed uncertain problems on the basis of the GP methodology. The procedure can be used by pessimists, optimists and moderate decision makers. It is designed for one-shot decisions. One of the significant advantages of the novel approach is related to the possibility to analyze neutral criteria, which are not directly taken into account in existing classical procedures developed for 1-DMU."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058067873","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/1/51","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393ae1","name":"Helena","lastName":"Gaspars-Wieloch","uuid":"80B4DDC2C767793911A0535C94E311AC4C633B1A60CE81421554E563252F5534788787726428DCACCA99D439C1411AEED8DB798EA95A1ED6DA3F71938865C47A","orcidId":"0000-0003-0033-3836","documentHash":"ae2c3f8a-46e3-4c08-8204-acc15c86602e"}],"doi":"10.3390/e24010051"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["allowable stress","buckling","Rao algorithms","size and shape optimization","tower structures"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Optimization of Spatial Truss Towers Based on Rao Algorithms","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479850","mniswId":"18986","title":"Structural Engineering and Mechanics","doi":null,"issn":"1225-4568","eissn":"1598-6217","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"eaf838a9-b441-4444-9d39-85b8547a0916"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620e33012467f02b135db592","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709200878c28a04738e67f"]},"issue":"nr 3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, combined size and shape optimization of spatial truss tower structures are presented by using new optimization algorithms named Rao-1, and Rao-2.

We study the following aspects of the connectedness: the amount of information transmitted across the markets (spillover index) and the velocity of its spread (frequency connectedness on various frequency bands), as well as the dependency structure of their joint distribution (quantile coherency). We prove that, in the investigated period, oil shocks did not affect European financial markets very strongly (and vice versa). Yet, the situation changed during economic crises or turbulence on the oil market. Tensions in financial markets resulted in the increase of the cross-correlation and causality from the stock exchanges to Brent futures, while oil-related episodes were raising causality from the oil market, not affecting the correlation. The news was almost fully incorporated into both markets within the first two-five days after the shock occurrence.

As-received, the tested steel is characterised by an austenitic structure with twins and NbX precipitates. The conducted studies showed that the operation resulted in precipitation processes, mainly at grain boundaries, where M23C6 carbides and σ phase precipitates were observed. Single M23C6 particles were visible at twin boundaries. NbX precipitates were observed inside the grains. After operation, the yield strength (YS) of the tested steel was lower than in delivery condition, which was related to the over-ageing of the alloy. The fine-grained microstructure and the presence of relatively numerous twins in the steel structure allowed maintaining relatively good plastic properties and impact energy."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058067929","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.195","pagesFromTo":"brak","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308016121002672","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709404878c28a0473b4e1f","name":"Hanna","lastName":"PURZYŃSKA","uuid":"4A3B8DCECEE73564F64C456585A0C6DA61B967313FB630EF0ECD92683F38B9DA72E2A064781A6E6B5A2D6D030C63D4D0F7C480F43F2BFAE602F862FF5EAAADCF","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a21d2a80-afe8-4b88-9632-8044a8987cfe"},{"objectId":"5e709202878c28a04738e825","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Golański","uuid":"CF31CBCA5C0781D5AD419D326AE9CEE2DDE0BA44F82CD7CF73102EB7F33B64A07CCEFD5EC5DDD4A09B8F3B45788AD68E56852F0799896DB07D0C55D01CB7433B","orcidId":"0000-0002-2093-4674","documentHash":"e0b72527-79e0-48d4-b54f-52e531925ae7"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ijpvp.2021.104574"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["doctor's responsibility","law in surgery","law in the COVID-19 pandemic","samaritan clause","surgeon's criminal liability"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd5c","uid":"bT6SF6NUzNfZ5gtHBpUg4ag","uuid":"f8ccf691-8784-48da-819a-014977855cd1","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd5c","parentUuid":"f8ccf691-8784-48da-819a-014977855cd1","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd5c","rootUuid":"f8ccf691-8784-48da-819a-014977855cd1","name":"Uczelnia Łazarskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e3878c28a04739ebbe"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Changes within the scope of criminal liability of healthcare professional as introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a2c0","mniswId":"16306","title":"Polish Journal of Surgery","doi":null,"issn":"0032-373X","eissn":"0032-373X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"69b101e6-1332-4883-8ac4-02edbee996ad"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2022-02-21","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6213b45d2467f012be933fdb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092e3878c28a04739ebbe","6213b45d2467f012be933fde","5e709256878c28a047394005"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic has markedly affected the life of people worldwide.

The drilling of wells in prospective shale gas areas supplies numerous physicochemical measurements from rock and reservoir fluid samples. The objective of this paper is to present the method that has been developed for finding similarities between individual geological structures in terms of their hydrocarbon generation properties and hydrocarbon resources. The measurements and geochemical investigations of six wells located in the Ordovician, Silurian, and Cambrian formations of the Polish part of the East European Platform are used. Cluster analysis is used to compare and classify objects described by multiple attributes. The focus is on the issue of generating clusters that group samples within the gas, condensate, and oil windows. The vitrinite reflectance value (Ro) is adopted as the criterion for classifying individual samples into the respective windows. An additional issue was determining other characteristic geochemical properties of the samples classified into the selected clusters. Two variants of cluster analysis are applied—the furthest neighbor method and Ward’s method—which resulted in 10 and 11 clusters, respectively. Particular attention was paid to the mean Ro values (within each cluster), allowing the classification of samples from a given cluster into one of the windows (gas, condensate, or oil). Using these methods, the samples were effectively classified into individual windows, and their percentage share within the Silurian, Ordovician, and Cambrian units is determined."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058067974","journalIssue":{"objectId":"620cc2722467f01c21719b52","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"15","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"7cb5f55f-7e55-4a8e-87b8-b667f7de677f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1464","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/4/1464/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709485878c28a0473beddf","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Miziołek","uuid":"88D81047E95662F40EDAEA288F0F4E5CC2874924BEB7A263257DBEC1D7B7B6E022B93FBBE96DEC29679F124380EBAA36B7BFA3C10A02DD6080BB3CEC255D3E16","orcidId":"0000-0002-6936-8570","documentHash":"fa9ab717-c838-42e2-950a-85d7aa89529c"},{"objectId":"5e709485878c28a0473bed9e","name":"Bogdan","lastName":"Filar","uuid":"686845D3159BB1DFAD0D69080273605E0414E68BAD6CFB5A7521B5F3CF84EC7A7D379500E538ABBB9E23DCDEA298B02E803DED7B998E5DEE427CE83F530268D7","orcidId":"0000-0002-5806-8732","documentHash":"40c63ad8-e6ff-495c-b4f0-8af87ff37246"},{"objectId":"5e7093b3878c28a0473af67f","name":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Kwilosz","uuid":"F7E3605BCD373B8A7888BFE07CC96D4DE9CC4A297DBCA98F8F783806604B6A4E432D143B774210B63EC9A3FAC316643C8AF7ED526D0F8B4697A59EC512692D68","orcidId":"0000-0003-0404-2155","documentHash":"fc058528-e40e-4826-9e49-eb987dd1edcd"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15041464"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Współpraca międzygminna","Rozwój lokalnego biznesu","Stopa bezrobocia","Ważona metoda najmniejszych kwadratów","Inverse-probability of treatment weighting","Polska"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Inter-municipal cooperation","Local business development","Unemployment rate","Weighted least squares","Inverse-probability of treatment weighting","Poland"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Does inter-municipal cooperation help improve local economic performance? – Evidence from Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454794e7","mniswId":"17111","title":"Regional Science and Urban Economics","doi":null,"issn":"0166-0462","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"7e8b0460-bfea-4851-aa8d-1b5b5495cac4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6214dce82467f01c2115bc46","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709431878c28a0473b7ec9","5e7093db878c28a0473b202e","6409aa0a40970770356bf4b3","6409aa0a40970770356bf4b4"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper aims at testing whether inter-municipal cooperation (IMC) in policies to promote local business development has a positive impact on local economic performance.

We use the unemployment rate, the number of firms per 1000 inhabitants and the rate of population growth as proxies for local economic performance. To control for selection into treatment and the role of time-varying covariates, we apply weighted least squares based on inverse-probability of treatment weights as well as two-way fixed effects models with analogous weights. We do not find IMC to impact the number of firms per 1000 inhabitants or the rate population growth. But IMC is found to reduce local unemployment rates by 0.4 percentage points.

This problem domain has not been reflected in the scientific literature. Sustainable managers are the ones who are fully prepared to implement the principles of sustainability in energy companies, respecting the principles of sustainable management. Their activity can, to a considerable extent, accelerate sustainable development. According to the model profile, a sustainable manager should be sensitive to ecological and social problems; be knowledgeable about sustainability and demand the same from subordinates; comply with ethical standards; implement pro-environmental and pro-social innovations; and also plan, organize, motivate, and control the contribution, in this way, to sustainable development. Research was conducted aimed at discovering the views/opinions of energy companies’ managers pertaining to the above-specified model profile of a sustainable manager. As the research demonstrates, managers assign various significance to the analyzed traits and actions. The largest number of managers recognized the following to be the most important for them: compliance with ethical standards (86.1%), planning and organizing in accordance with the principles of sustainable development (52.8%), and being knowledgeable about sustainable development (38.9%). The paper contributes to the trait theory of leadership and the theory of sustainable management. It is also of practical value—it can prove useful in the processes of educating, recruiting, and evaluating sustainable managers."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058067983","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.15","pagesFromTo":"brak","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/4/1363","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092db878c28a04739e2db","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Pabian","uuid":"DEC7B3DBADA4CDA7CB88DDBDF7A3FD176455A97CA0E8B7235416D91102686E555D73D62FCD9081A9E396B4F906F27D7E49897433B058EB24FBACAFE17F0E9738","orcidId":"0000-0003-3059-6733","documentHash":"357ab6ee-4d6e-45f8-b58d-b39cda0e5feb"},{"objectId":"5e709203878c28a04738e96b","name":"Arnold","lastName":"Pabian","uuid":"98D75542508C2D51EADD6C1D6DFA9795CED5AA9B871B6F38B21928988BC088EA8D13E9C7D442D0C49102545E7AE0A9CCBD0F81D72D89B1488B099AE7D9B92C91","orcidId":"0000-0002-1224-9167","documentHash":"f708fd6a-26fd-4e32-bc66-c2bfa1cf92f3"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15041363"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-957703-6-4","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[],"type":"BOOK","title":"Historia medycyny i farmacji: szkice i eseje","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":240,"publicationPlace":"Wrocław","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620e045f2467f02b135c8718","editors":[{"objectId":"6168e7a875234017e053d4fd","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Smakosz","uuid":"B9EBC569576F5A6EC73B4D2E99B2E4C046C5DB9CA8382F5FEE733E28141A9D0A97C01110418828ABE3EF09D755E6457EB1898D5856E2C1F23400E3045C25485A","orcidId":"0000-0001-8458-6413","documentHash":"16e66617-9fe8-4723-8869-5474a707e7d8"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["6168e7a875234017e053d4fd"],"AUTHOR":["6168e7a875234017e053d4fd","6157c42975234017e04d67a4"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Współcześnie podział kompetencji lekarzy, farmaceutów i innych zawodów medycznych jest ściśle określony. Jednak aż do XIII w. ten podział wcale nie był tak ostry. W 1241 r. Fryderyk II Hohenstauf — cesarz rzymski, książę Szwabii, król Jerozolimy i Sycylii — opublikował edykt (Magna Charta), regulujący ówczesny system medyczny (tzw. Konstytucje Sycylijskie). Dokument ten zakazywał dzielenia kompetencji zawodowych aptekarzom i lekarzom. Poza tym regulował ceny leków prostych (simplicium), koszty produkcji środków leczniczych, a także zarządzał organizację urzędników, którzy mieli oceniać jakość usług oferowanych w Officina sanitatis, oraz czy oferowane leki są odpowiedniej jakości. Edykt opisywał miejsce Apotheca, czyli magazyny do przechowywania gotowych leków. Farmaceuci wykonujący leki byli nazywani Confectionarii, a sprzedający je — Stationariii W związku z tym apteka, w znaczeniu miejsca do sprzedaży medykamentów, została nazwana Stationes. Obie grupy pracowników aptek musieli być licencjonowani przez Szkołę Medyczną  w Salerno. Na końcu wygłaszali oni przysięgę, która mówiła, że będą oni wykonywać leki zgodne z Antydotarium Szkoły w Salerno. Podobnie, aby określać siebie „lekarzem” trzeba było ukończyć powyższą uczelnię. Apteki mogły być otwierane tylko w głównych miastach; w każdym z nich miało być dwóch „inspektorów aptekarskich”, którzy koordynowali ich pracę  i wykonywanie niektórych leków, jak powidełek (Electuaria) i syropów (Syrupi). Jeżeli powyższe środki były wykonywane niezgodnie z zasadami sztuki, należało je konfiskować. Jeżeli władze wykryły, że „nadaptekarz” jest w zmowie z nierzetelnym pracownikiem apteki i pozwala na fałszowanie leków, był skazywany na śmierć.\nCelem praktyki lekarskiej miała być odtąd diagnoza, leczenie chorych i udzielanie pacjentom informacji na temat farmakoterapii i leczenia. Farma-ceuci zaś, mieli wykonywać i sprzedawać leki. Chociaż receptę lekarską znano już w starożytności, to dopiero w XIII w. wprowadzono regulacje, które pozwalały na sprzedaż leków tylko na podstawie przepisu od lekarza. W śre-dniowieczu handlowano w aptekach także innymi produktami (wina, nalewki, przyprawy, pierniki, kleje, farby etc.), jednak nie miały one natury leków, w związku z tym pracownicy mogli udzielać o tych towarach informacji. Wkrótce podobne regulację wprowadzono w innych krajach europejskich. Wymagano, aby aptekarz posiadał rzemieślnicze wykształcenie, zakończone stosownym egzaminem i uzyskaniem koncesji na prowadzenie swojego sklepu.\nW kolejnych latach powyższy status quo ulegał zachwianiu. Farmaceuci coraz częściej wykonywali drobne zabiegi „cyrulickie” — leczyli rany, amputowali kończyny, pomagali przy balsamowaniu zwłok. Podczas epidemii mogli oni pełnić również rolę „burmistrza powietrznego” — głównego specjalisty ówczesnego „centrum zarządzania kryzysowego”. Do jego zadań należała organizacja opieki nad chorymi, organizacja wywozu zwłok, zarządzanie izolacji, egzekwowanie praw, kontrola przygotowywania leków.\nWspółcześnie również obserwujemy podobny trend. Coraz mniej jest absolwentów farmacji, którzy chcą pracować w aptekach. Szukają oni pracy w instytucjach, przemyśle farmaceutycznym, kosmetycznym i chemicznym. Coraz częściej pracują oni w badaniach klinicznych. Od niedawna farmaceuci mogą w Polsce i innych krajach szczepić na COVID-19 oraz grypę.\nPublikacja, którą trzymają Państwo w ręce, jest wynikiem pracy wielu osób — farmaceutów, lekarzy, antropologów, aromaterapeutów, historyków medycyny i naukowców. Celem tej pracy jest propagowanie historii medycyny i farmacji. Artykuły poruszają wiele mało znanych problemów związanych z historią kultury medycznej, pokazują  jakie czynniki miały wpływ na zmiany w farmakoterapii i przedstawiają historyczne aspekty wykorzystania surowców pochodzenia naturalnego w lecznictwie.\nCzęść prac była już wcześniej opublikowana w czasopiśmie Pharmacopola, jednak zostały one na nowo zredagowane oraz rozszerzone.

A combination of femtosecond (fs) laser, as a pumping light source and a high-accuracy polarimeter with low power probing laser, is used to investigate the light-induced optical anisotropy (OA) in these glass materials. The light-induced birefringence (LIB) exhibits slow relaxation tendency up to about 10 s suggesting on anisotropic photorefractive effect evidently dominated fast Kerr effect. This behavior is evaluated in the light of other results reported recently and is explained by the glass polymerization mechanisms. The photorefractive birefringence increases with increase of the quantity of NiO up to 0.8 mol% and it is attributed to the enhanced degree of depolymerization of the glass network due to the hike in the concentration of Ni2+ ions that occupy octahedral (Oh) positions. Further increase of NiO content ( > 0.8 mol%) causes, however, a certain decrease of the photorefractive birefringence. Notable change in concentration trend is interpreted by rising of phonon losses due to increasing portion of the nickel ions occupying tetrahedral (Th) sites that facilitates the polymerization of the glass network. The doped glasses with the NiO content of about 0.8 mol% may be considered as optimal in the sense of photorefractive efficiency. Relevant samples exhibit largest magnitudes of the photorefractive birefringence and appear to be favorable for potential applications."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058068004","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.123","pagesFromTo":"brak","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925346721010582","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"620e13d52467f02b135ce058","name":"N.","lastName":"VEERAIAH","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"05532d3d-318f-4de4-b778-39086a686ac5"},{"objectId":"620e13d52467f02b135ce057","name":"Valluri","lastName":"RAVI KUMAR","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9b8fea73-0441-498f-a437-b4ade621b268"},{"objectId":"620e13d52467f02b135ce056","name":"Anatoliy","lastName":"ANDRUSHCHAK","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"77d0591c-1041-4a85-aaa3-aacd1cdf2aef"},{"objectId":"620e13d52467f02b135ce053","name":"Nalluri","lastName":"PURNACHAND","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9e8bb941-e03e-444b-8416-a856846d036e"},{"objectId":"620e13d52467f02b135ce050","name":"A.","lastName":"SIVA SESHA REDDY","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c3a1811-2e95-4d1d-8186-db36b866eec3"},{"objectId":"5e709453878c28a0473ba7d6","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Jędryka","uuid":"746BECE6CBD9950D91EE77BB08FA8FA294E53EA8D38551845F7309A03346624924BFE2A18F5632978412D575753DE1629A8145A8F22155C6AB3396733676F333","orcidId":"0000-0002-7047-6624","documentHash":"d9cade59-cb26-400e-bec5-0fa182d56407"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e6f8","name":"Andriy","lastName":"Kityk","uuid":"6D2A35CCCBBA9208186DEE80852A0EE234510054EE0AE6282EF807BD8925274D10867B3D714A08C37C69066EA6F50D8EC33D8EC967E457F92BBCC34F24E8F4A1","orcidId":"0000-0002-4823-3220","documentHash":"80785798-14e8-4ff3-84f3-5a01ec709412"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e6c7","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Rakus","uuid":"E07C1C0605A28F3496B1303C30FC74982C73BFB559EF9BD96C1E419A473C825FB362108396B27B4C4E5AD4A943452111F5C34A9C32FC4422734B896FA9253647","orcidId":"0000-0003-3524-1472","documentHash":"2f1aeef9-1109-4833-9504-3a979ccc3bd2"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e6bb","name":"Artur","lastName":"Wojciechowski","uuid":"68F9079079500658878EFE1FA229D7885735C2EC9A191B71F418486289C4AD744E2D584A46A94CD58CF0126BBCF73257029BD40EB4D25103D0F28B16F76CFD5C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0071-2468","documentHash":"d3c4e6cd-cd75-48b0-984c-4baaae098273"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.optmat.2021.111858"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["radionuclides; toxic metals","polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","polychlorinated biphenyls","Honey; pesticides;"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709334878c28a0473a4db8"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Review of harmful chemical pollutants of environmental origin in honey and bee products","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547782e","mniswId":"4519","title":"Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition","doi":null,"issn":"1040-8398","eissn":"1549-7852","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"47505ed5-6e24-430c-a48d-53e0bbc57553"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2021,"releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":24},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61e6e6822467f030e8c4063f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709334878c28a0473a4db8","6734704cfdbe830349f99b5e"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Honey is a natural food with many pro-health properties, which comprises a wide variety of valuable ingredients.

In the present work, overview of recent literature data on chemical pollutants in honey/bee products originating from the environment was performed. Their MLs, MRLs and EDI were discussed. It can be concluded that huge amount of research concerned on the presence of TMs and pesticides in honey. Most of the studies have shown that honey/bee products sampled from urban and industrialized areas were more contaminated than these sampled from ecological and rural locations. More pollutants were usually detected in propolis and bee pollen than in honey. Based on their research and regulations, authors stated, that most of the toxic pollutants of environmental origin in honey/bee products are at levels that do not pose a threat to the health of the potential consumer. The greatest concern relates to pesticides and TMs, because in some research MLs in individual samples were highly exceeded."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058068010","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6734704cfdbe830349f99b5d","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"63","number":"21","doi":null,"documentHash":"4e1ac134-8d8a-440a-ad86-e122cd2e1454"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"63","pagesFromTo":"5094-5116","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6734704cfdbe830349f99b5e","name":"Ireneusz","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f6e661ea-b40f-49eb-80ad-c1ed39d0f54c"},{"objectId":"5e709334878c28a0473a4db8","name":"Adriana","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"032889A75EDA850857E4DE165559727A87565F8A121626212CA1922F21BCA3B4FA0648F629B047DDDFF1344597D9A8F843EB1D89B35A5C313E9434432F71E190","orcidId":"0000-0002-1865-4833","documentHash":"43cd8768-0f29-4bac-8153-bd62d8737122"}],"doi":"10.1080/10408398.2021.2012752"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Aging","NLRP3 inflammasome","Pro-inflammatory cytokines","Physical activity","Aerobic exercise"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","uid":"bqEBivGW4eOgmsFFDSCuw-g","uuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","parentUuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","rootUuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego i Sportu im.

Since exercise has known anti-inflammatory effects, we investigated the effect of Nordic walking training on inflammasome activation and downstream effectors in elderly women. A population of elderly women was divided into EXP (n = 29) that completed 12 weeks of the moderate-intensity aerobic training program and CTRL (n = 29), performing no activity. Blood samples were taken before and after the first (T1-pre and T1-post, respectively) and last (T2-pre and T2-post, respectively) exercise unit. Inflammasome activation status was assessed by whole blood NLRP3 and TLR4 expression by RT-qPCR. Serum levels of IL-1b, IL-6, TNFa, and IL-18 cytokines were assayed by multiplex fluorescent beads-based immunoassays or ELISA. NLRP3 and TLR4 levels were reduced 2 folds between T1-pre and T2-pre and induced at T2-post, compared to T2-pre, by 2.6- and 2.9-fold, respectively. A single exercise bout elicited a 1. 38-, 1. 5-, and 1.36-fold rise of IL-1b, TNFa, and IL-6 concentration, respectively, although not significant, at the beginning of the training (T1-pre vs. T1-post), a 1.4-fold decrease for IL-1b and TNFa at the end of the training (T1-pre vs. T2-pre), and a 2-, 1.8- and 1.26-fold increase after the last exercise session (T2-pre vs. T2-post) for the three cytokines. When stratifying the population based on BMI in normal weight (NW) and overweight (OW), NLRP3 and TLR4 expression was affected only in NW. As for inflammatory cytokines, IL-1b was modulated in NW at the beginning of the training, whereas in OW at the end of the training; for TNFa, this time-dependent modulation was significant only in OW. Applied aerobic training affected the resting expression of inflammasome constituents (NLRP3 and TLR4) and levels of downstream effectors (IL-1b, TNFa, and IL-6). However, at the end of the program, participants acquire an acute inflammatory response to exercise that was absent at baseline. Future studies would have to define the molecular mechanisms associated with, and how to potentiate, the exercise-associated inflammatory response."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058068028","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62149f192467f02f1e609b99","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"fc58aa34-2a77-405e-beae-264a42d104b9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"792859","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2022.792859/full","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62149f192467f02f1e609b95","name":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Banfi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1ce5d6cf-4732-474f-a42f-e99c5abd7100"},{"objectId":"62149f192467f02f1e609b94","name":"Silvia","lastName":"Perego","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7aecf329-4f06-4002-9d23-01ec536ef9c6"},{"objectId":"62149f192467f02f1e609b92","name":"Martina","lastName":"Faraldi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0f840f65-05e8-42c3-993d-b615862c64ce"},{"objectId":"62149f192467f02f1e609b90","name":"Marta","lastName":"Gomarasca","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cacb172b-513f-4f18-80c2-ee9a3e6b168b"},{"objectId":"5e7094e9878c28a0473c6b88","name":"Giovanni","lastName":"Lombardi","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8365-985X","documentHash":"e9e6ed7a-432a-48b7-8b43-22ef1bb14480"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a047398679","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ziemann","uuid":"180ABF1652C0D58C1FDB55A63E161459D42E549180FB7FB1FA2097FFC5B042005420603B20E3C2C8F70D39284FDC62756E8B8D7D5C4F9F38568D9D53AB4D0E37","orcidId":"0000-0002-6361-0020","documentHash":"31bd62c6-1a3c-4299-8606-741efa64294d"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398357","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Micielska","uuid":"8624453C3E1AA20E9A8ECE5CFDA1518FCA8EAAABCF6DDE1383A6209EC6D25C1924D1B980845E81F4B9C616E6065B87F5C40BA5FBFB1589B00A8E614760078CA4","orcidId":"0000-0002-1707-8678","documentHash":"71e31973-2e9d-43b3-9623-42ee1810f12b"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a0473979cf","name":"Marta","lastName":"Flis","uuid":"8115999889286AB45734FE9EFC963C73D02FB2AE0116FF5348A781842891DDC5500A49C5E8A411AC1914E68DFFC5507BE58923E331C5BFDF1C872C39A64C3FFC","orcidId":"0000-0001-5466-3377","documentHash":"abc9c2fc-297e-4fb1-a7cb-33fbf4d6488e"}],"doi":"10.3389/fphys.2022.792859"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet

behavior of massive quantum fields in the general plane wave spacetime and external, non-plane, electromagnetic waves is studied. The asymptotic conditions, the 'in' ('out') states and the cross sections are analysed. It is observed that, despite of the singularities encountered, the global form of these states can be obtained: at the singular points the Dirac delta-like behavior emerges and there is a discrete change of phase of the wave function after passing through each singular point. The relations between these phase corrections and local charts are discussed. Some examples of waves of infinite range (including the circularly polarized ones) are presented for which the explicit form of solutions can be obtained.

We formulate a methodology for calculating the approximation coefficients involving a large number of mesh points leading to very high-order formulas, e.g., 20th or 30th order. The main emphasis is on the first and second order derivative occurring in the Navier-Stokes equations governing fluid flow problems. Contrary to most studies on compact schemes in which the computational stencils employed in the discretization are narrow and consist of only a few mesh points K, in the presented paper we consider wide stencils that in practice are limited only by the overall number of the nodes in a computational grid. We analyze the features of such wide stencil based schemes in physical and spectral space. It is shown that the solutions obtained applying the schemes of the same order but involving different number of the mesh points characterize significantly different accuracy. This is presented by direct comparisons of the analytically derived formula for the leading terms of the truncation errors as well as in practical simulations. The test cases include a second order ordinary differential equation with variable coefficients, 1D Burgers equation and three typical benchmark problems used in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), i.e., inviscid vortex advection, convected Taylor-Green vortices and a double jet flow. The obtained results are compared with available analytical solutions and the solutions obtained with the help of a pseudo-spectral method. We found that very high-order compact schemes reach the spectral accuracy characterized by the error decrease proportional to O(hK).

To date, research activity on breath isoprene focused on mass spectrometry-based measurement techniques, which are not portable and require skilled operators. Here, we show, for the first time to our knowledge, selective isoprene monitoring in exhaled breath (148 breath samples, 60–1250 parts-per-billion, ppb) with an inexpensive, user-friendly and compact filter–sensor device. This detector is based on a previously developed concept comprising a sorption filter of activated alumina that removes hydrophilic volatiles ahead of a micro gas sensor consisting of chemoresistive Si-doped WO3 nanoparticles to quantify the isoprene down to few ppb concentrations. When tested on humans during exercise and at rest, the detector accurately followed breath isoprene dynamics in linear (Pearson’s coefficient 0.89) correlation to proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry measurements. Most importantly, the output from the device is not interfered by high and variable concentrations of other breath volatile compounds, specifically acetone, ethanol and methanol. This isoprene detector can be readily applied for online monitoring of physical activity."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058068079","journalIssue":{"objectId":"621495742467f02f1e606329","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"357","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"81f34554-48ce-4358-a44f-b3cf41b47914"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"357","pagesFromTo":"[1-6], [poz.] 131444","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0925400522000867?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"621495742467f02f1e606327","name":"Sotiris E.","lastName":"Pratsinis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a0a10f69-0358-42ec-92e3-71a2145b4054"},{"objectId":"621495742467f02f1e606326","name":"Andreas T.","lastName":"Güntner","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a73d1563-8452-424f-b2c6-45c0274e4c6a"},{"objectId":"621495742467f02f1e606325","name":"Chris A.","lastName":"Mayhew","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"266e0eb3-6ac5-4afd-a250-b2c9c17e4697"},{"objectId":"621495742467f02f1e606324","name":"Arno","lastName":"Schmidt-Trucksäss","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ede5d8da-b89c-47ca-9f62-b7d80c2e170a"},{"objectId":"621495742467f02f1e606323","name":"Karl","lastName":"Unterkofler","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"904cb215-9634-4da6-b87d-3d03c8129390"},{"objectId":"621495742467f02f1e606322","name":"Wang Chang","lastName":"Ting","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1abebddc-c5fd-4e7a-ac0c-61e7c2a3a422"},{"objectId":"621495742467f02f1e606321","name":"Karsten","lastName":"Königstein","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1b00ad85-373b-45d8-b1cd-0bb5d2ddfef1"},{"objectId":"621495742467f02f1e60631f","name":"Jan","lastName":"van den Broek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e8913233-8930-4654-afe5-575869cf96e3"},{"objectId":"5e7092cf878c28a04739d285","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Mochalski","uuid":"9E4B9F44F720EDB9AF61A206A21B1B693CEB0905A51C99FF916477961C0EFDD86379EA578DDE3F5763B40583102649F66A999219D7371DBD1ECDF09C923A82D7","orcidId":"0000-0002-6934-1562","documentHash":"8c2c529b-0a85-4a4b-92e2-8c024c957782"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.snb.2022.131444"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)","sliding mode observer","fault detection","robust fault reconstruction"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709268878c28a0473952f2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Generalized Sliding Mode Observers for Simultaneous Fault Reconstruction in the Presence of Uncertainty and Disturbance","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1073","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"FEBRUARY","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620df8a52467f02b135c6812","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709268878c28a0473952f2","67372dfafdbe832d85af9c59","67372dfafdbe832d85af9c5a","67372dfafdbe832d85af9c5b"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, a generalized sliding mode observer design method is proposed for the robust reconstruction of sensors and actuators faults in the presence of both unknown disturbances and uncertainties. For this purpose, the effect of uncertainty and disturbance on the system has been considered in generalized state-space form, and the LMI tool is combined with the concept of an equivalent output error injection method to reduce the effects of them on the reconstruction process. The upper bound of the disturbance and uncertainty are minimized in the design of the sliding motion so that the reconstruction of the faults will be minimized. The design method is applied for actuator faults in the generalized state-space form, and then with some suitable filtering, the method extends as sensors and actuators coincidentally faults. Since in the proposed approach, the state trajectories do not leave the sliding manifold even in simultaneous sensors and actuators faults, then the faults are reconstructed based upon information retrieved from the equivalent output error injection signal. Due to the importance of the robust fault reconstruction in the wind energy conversion system (WECS), the proposed approach is successfully applied to a 5 MW wind turbine system. The simulation results verify the robust performances of the proposed approach in the presence of unknown perturbations and uncertainties."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058068095","journalIssue":{"objectId":"620cc2722467f01c21719b52","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"15","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"7cb5f55f-7e55-4a8e-87b8-b667f7de677f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1411","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/4/1411","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67372dfafdbe832d85af9c5b","name":"Kaveh","lastName":"Hooshmandi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6c3a2290-facd-4d56-80f3-cd264adca43f"},{"objectId":"67372dfafdbe832d85af9c5a","name":"Farhad","lastName":"Bayat","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c123b4de-b47a-428a-a9f8-d941057583ef"},{"objectId":"67372dfafdbe832d85af9c59","name":"Ashkan","lastName":"Taherkhani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e7a98c21-e05a-4a9b-b952-70542b945f99"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a0473952f2","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Bartoszewicz","uuid":"15683B4402876B5A1E1139C584B5EF0BA982EE6EF21C3BD2F90E7C2653952B78E1B6BF14D8CDBC290DDC42F1BE6A832956D3C224CE6BA8FD0EDBC0C8FA24F52C","orcidId":"0000-0002-1271-8488","documentHash":"68de0644-9491-49f4-ac8f-a6d74fd9f04c"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15041411"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Postrzeganie konsumentów","Obróbka mikrofalowa","Nastroje konsumentów"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Consumer perception","Microwave processing","Consumer sentiment"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The confrontation of consumer beliefs about the impact of microwave-processing on food and human health with existing research","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454799d5","mniswId":"19787","title":"Trends in Food Science and Technology","doi":null,"issn":"0924-2244","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"40b75573-7907-4980-b159-eee504bed756"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-03","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2021,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61e6acac2467f00287f17f65","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709392878c28a0473ad23c","6409aaf240970770356bfb5b","6409aaf240970770356bfb5c","6409aaf240970770356bfb5d","6409aaf240970770356bfb5e"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Currently, consumer opinions are often shaped by information in the media such as on television or the Internet. This information, however, is not always compatible with scientific evidence. Despite the increasing awareness of consumers, there are still many concerns about the health and safety of using domestic microwave ovens. Scope and approach: In this study, the sentiments of consumers related to the use of microwave ovens were examined. Although most sentiments were found to be neutral and positive, still, a relatively large number of consumers perceive microwave treatment negatively, which is the result of fear regarding the use of this tech-nology. As shown by the results, the most frequent beliefs that could discourage consumers from using micro-wave processing for food were the negative impact of microwaves on the food product safety and its nutritional quality, on the food safety due to its packaging and on the surrounding environment. The aim of this manuscript was to confront the current state of scientific knowledge with consumer perception. Key findings and conclusions: A  literature review showed that, in most cases, microwaves can be an attractive alternative method to conventional food processing methods in terms of its nutritional quality, mainly due to shorter processing time. Microwaved food is also safe if it is heated in packaging intended for this purpose, and the microwave ovens do not pose a  threat to human surroundings. The results of this article may help form targeted educational strategies to mitigate the inappropriate consumer beliefs about the use of microwaves within the food industry."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058068111","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"119","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924224421006117","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6409aaf240970770356bfb5e","name":"Władysław","lastName":"Migdał","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3ade3f2b-eb46-4878-9b18-ef6be69a6b1b"},{"objectId":"6409aaf240970770356bfb5d","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Zając","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"69e057af-9e08-4837-bbaa-7f881e17284c"},{"objectId":"6409aaf240970770356bfb5c","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kulawik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f39e4956-557b-481a-9e0f-c5c315e9d725"},{"objectId":"6409aaf240970770356bfb5b","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Guzik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8076aa71-6551-4eb8-ad67-8534bee7ff5e"},{"objectId":"5e709392878c28a0473ad23c","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Szymkowiak","uuid":"DC456DE7153E088B898C07DB78656F7529B3BCA3DDEACEDF34D2D9CF306D50E57D69A0126886E81B9808B22A32B1973FB5CA76BD6800FF3FB621796C6211AF06","orcidId":"0000-0001-5673-7093","documentHash":"4abc8c1c-077d-4d6f-a0dc-3d30c4f7bec5"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.tifs.2021.11.011"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["wartość","rzeczywistość rozszerzona","marketing"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["value","augmented reality","marketing"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"61e6acd52467f00287f183bf","doi":"10.4324/9781003204343","title":"Competition, Strategy, and Innovation.

Based on the business and management literature review, the chapter then indicates the perceived importance of experiential value when interacting with AR technology. Experiential value is underpinned by hedonic, utilitarian, and co-creation values. The originality of the chapter lies in focusing on the values delivered by AR technology and the possibility of their implementation in the marketing activities of companies.\r\n\r\nThe main theoretical contribution of the chapter is twofold: first, the systematization of main types of values perceived by consumers when interacting with AR technology, and second, the conceptualization of the influence of AR on companies’ marketing activities achieved thanks to the different values perceived by consumers.\r\n\r\nPractical implications refer to values that help companies to be more competitive in the market and fulfill consumers’ needs. These values should be kept in mind when introducing AR technology into products, services, or their offering processes and can form the basis for product and service customization.\r\n\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058068127","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"105-132","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003204343-4/understanding-consumer-perceived-value-augmented-reality-implications-marketing-activities-ma%C5%82gorzata-bartosik-purgat-milena-ratajczak-mrozek?context=ubx&refId=875aef56-8d2c-4d82-b02e-9bcb773b61c9","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393a2b","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Bartosik-Purgat","uuid":"ACC2D9F83F3AD027E374A8D1342454ACE00F72292D4B9115906034E6BCBC2EB9EE8FFC7E8E95514D47E513B3AA0FFF63E9CE258E3421001A108AA0FE1E6C35E7","orcidId":"0000-0003-3517-3617","documentHash":"160205a7-187b-421a-9309-24b758752dbf"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393a24","name":"Milena","lastName":"Ratajczak-Mrozek","uuid":"59C74DED20306B863DAA548E33F2FDA6696E67BB2FED481F635E593617A1EA72C0247866182E9C5F6757A85A2FA24F3D8D8CAC437357A9DF9859ED4B72D31A7A","orcidId":"0000-0003-4432-5459","documentHash":"1e6bf470-21f8-4064-8a45-3443595cc71b"}],"doi":"10.4324/9781003204343-4"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Ellagitannins · Kinetics · Rosaceae · Pomace · Extraction · HPLC–DAD-MS"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709269878c28a0473953ed","5e709269878c28a0473953e1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Kinetics of Two‑Step Ellagitannin Extraction from the By‑products of Selected Processed Fruits of the family Rosaceae","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477d04","mniswId":"6678","title":"Food Analytical Methods","doi":null,"issn":"1936-9751","eissn":"1936-976X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"55a27d70-5f12-44ee-aa96-95b7e8e48393"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"AUGUST","releaseDateYear":2021,"releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":3},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61e6a3ec2467f030e8bce43e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709269878c28a0473953ed","5e709269878c28a0473953e1","67370eccfdbe832d85aef780"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper presents the kinetics of two-step ellagitannin (ET) extraction with an aqueous acetone solution from two technological types of pomace from selected berry fruits of the Rosaceae family.

paper presents the synthesis of a hydroxyapatite/iron oxide composite utilizing the wet chemical method, as well as the comparison of several selected material characteristics. As follows from the literature reports, hydroxyapatite is a common mineral possessing numerous significant properties. Nowadays, there is an increase in the amount of research on possible modifications of this compound. The promising way to improve hydroxyapatite features is its combination with iron oxide. Particularly, there can be two forms that are distinguished, namely Fe3O4 and γ-Fe2O3. These oxides exhibit valuable properties, particularly magnetism. A combination of the mentioned materials leads to multifunctional composite formation with many potential applications, as follows from several studies. However, this area of science is not fully developed. There are still many aspects to be examined. The synthesized composite and its components were analyzed by employing the following methods. The X-ray diffraction analysis revealed formation of hydroxyapatite and Fe2O3 crystalline phases. Moreover, porosimetry proved a larger specific area for the composite sample in comparison with other materials. The results obtained using the SEM method confirmed an external layer of hydroxyapatite and spherical shapes of internal Fe2O3 particles. Furthermore, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data presented characteristic peaks of Fe, Ca, P, and O atoms in all samples. The Fourier Transform Infrared spectra displayed all the specific vibrations typical of the analyzed materials. What is more, the Vibrating Sample Magnetometer method confirmed the paramagnetic nature of the samples. It could be concluded that the synthesized composite has intermediate properties between the components used in the formation process. The results suggest that these composites are superparamagnetic. This type of material architecture would be well suited for biomedical applications."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058068175","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/3/1139","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"659fc1be4097076c144aa814","name":"Adrianna","lastName":"Biedrzycka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4edd4210-a4d6-48ff-a1ec-f40d55687756"},{"objectId":"5e709428878c28a0473b7506","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Osypiuk","uuid":"71A7191D249425EA888DC70B2705EB91BFC566C41BE22AD80B09704EFF3E40D3221C630FA1F7704A5ECAEC0B846676453A99850EFF0FC77A2129148737CF2E78","orcidId":"0000-0003-0171-7380","documentHash":"7145ea6d-365c-49b0-bf21-d609fc21a466"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a00ae","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Skwarek","uuid":"F4B4F341A862B223B07676F9DAEE29101F80823A6B9F55086BB829C78744BD0E51FB1A67977D371E57D77BCA891B4EBB2302FF937A389AFF7A3FAF1E7746372F","orcidId":"0000-0003-4721-8704","documentHash":"a12325ea-7eea-465e-ad67-ce968fcd25d5"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a04739feb8","name":"Beata","lastName":"Cristóvao","uuid":"033C4D23379C46F29ED3004C60EDF84D60552EEC44B02E5490DBF9361DF0F3EA7DF57554158EC465C2E6DE3B574AF4F918C097A8614CDE1877E6A54456DE0463","orcidId":"0000-0001-5080-2413","documentHash":"d95534b2-0b75-439f-be73-7cdc02d99ae8"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15031139"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","uid":"bRRT1dnyPJtioT7xTLQBnOQ","uuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","parentUuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","rootUuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","name":"Centrum Badań Molekularnych i Makromolekularnych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fb878c28a0473b45c7","5e709474878c28a0473bd5b6","5e7093fc878c28a0473b4737"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Nucleophilic Substitution at Heteroatoms—Identity Substitution Reactions at Phosphorus and Sulfur Centers: Do They Proceed in a Concerted (SN2) or Stepwise (A–E) Way?","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":null,"issn":"1420-3049","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"85ea3d3d-2670-4384-98ee-1b5b44edab21"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-18","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6213662d2467f012be919dee","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6213662d2467f012be919df0","5e7093fc878c28a0473b4737","5e7093fb878c28a0473b45c7","5e709474878c28a0473bd5b6"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The mechanisms of three selected identity substitution reactions at phosphorus and sulfur occurring with stereospecific inversion have been investigated using density functional theory (DFT). The first identity reaction between methoxyl anion and methyl ethylphenylphosphinate 1 reported in 1963 has been shown to proceed in a stepwise fashion according to the addition-elimination (A–E) mechanism involving formation of a pentacoordinate phosphorus intermediate (TBI-1). In contrast, the results of DFT studies of the identity chloride exchange reaction in (ethoxy)ethylphosphonochloridothionate 3 in acetone solution provided evidence that it proceeds synchronously according to the classical Ingold's SN2-P mechanism. DFT calculations of the methoxyl-methoxy exchange reaction at sulfur in methyl p-toluenesulfinate 4 catalyzed by trifluoroacetic acid in methanol revealed that it proceeds stepwise (A–E mechanism), involving the formation of the high-coordinate sulfurane intermediate. In both identity transesterification reactions, 1 and 4, the transiently formed trigonal bipyraimdal intermediates with the two methoxyl groups occupying apical positions (TBI-1 and TBI-4) have higher free energy barriers for the Berry-type pseudorotation than those for direct decomposition to starting phosphinate and sulfinate ensuring stereospecific inversion of configuration at the phosphinyl and sulfinyl centers. Thus, the DFT method proved its usefulness in the distinction between both mechanisms that are often indistinguishable by kinetic measurements."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058068180","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61f3da412467f061bc10e18c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"27","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"a0dda249-25df-4f6c-bb49-6666d6edee45"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"599","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/3/599/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6213662d2467f012be919df0","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Kowalczewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cbf8fcbf-f236-4238-9ed6-5601d79a99f8"},{"objectId":"5e709474878c28a0473bd5b6","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Gostyński","uuid":"1847BC6A02ED960CB63FCBCA1738AFD2CEF26B0E179E9B010261C2210D90839BF18761E27034EFC5ECC241F9791DC984BF7EA7A7F018BEAE9098829E79D1BA8D","orcidId":"0000-0001-6862-116X","documentHash":"0f542f55-089e-4d52-9a45-c2d6f117f3c6"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b4737","name":"Marian","lastName":"Mikołajczyk","uuid":"44AA1BA67613A10E0EA4CD1DB8FD3037101B786735DAD16411AC8D62553509CD90020386810F24C740CE57B3C3A38BEC9903728685D3C75405497649A95F9264","orcidId":"0000-0003-4919-9930","documentHash":"7703260a-3a4c-481c-a47e-2b4ec4783d7b"},{"objectId":"5e7093fb878c28a0473b45c7","name":"Marek","lastName":"Cypryk","uuid":"8D22D26C4DCC40A82EE9787D2A5E065C51FEBDB3DBC02D01A43CDE4C0174573D461CF0176E462CBC40CFB67B8764131ED8D139E8547D794D9FA2A298E986D874","orcidId":"0000-0003-2799-1767","documentHash":"e357b02c-2cb9-4e1a-b25a-9135dc7e52f9"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules27030599"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["coordination polymerization","biodegradable polymers","functional polymers","ring opening polymerization","chelate complexes"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737e9dc","uid":"bhuAmiQSz4rgvQiZB33W38w","uuid":"fee3c56b-eccc-4eb9-bca2-5913db555e88","parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9dc","parentUuid":"fee3c56b-eccc-4eb9-bca2-5913db555e88","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9dc","rootUuid":"fee3c56b-eccc-4eb9-bca2-5913db555e88","name":"Centrum Materiałów Polimerowych i Węglowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709434878c28a0473b81f1","5e7093b5878c28a0473af866","5e709434878c28a0473b817d","5e70923e878c28a04739253c","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3ee2","5e709498878c28a0473c013a"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","uid":"bHvub0W7DW61k4FKLYJQ3Zw","uuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","parentUuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","rootUuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Długosza w Częstochowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709240878c28a04739263f","5e70923e878c28a04739253c","60a4a1f39543c758682b6367"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Synthesis of Polyacids by Copolymerization of l-Lactide with MTC-COOH Using Zn[(acac)(L)H2O] Complex as an Initiator","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479331","mniswId":"16369","title":"POLYMERS","doi":null,"issn":"2073-4360","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"75c28aac-8cdb-4fcc-8756-104cf361c90b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-27","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6214e4d22467f02f1e62069e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709434878c28a0473b817d","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3ee2","5e7093b5878c28a0473af866","5e709498878c28a0473c013a","5e709240878c28a04739263f","60a4a1f39543c758682b6367","5e70923e878c28a04739253c","5e709434878c28a0473b81f1"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This work presents the results of research on the preparation of bioresorbable functional polyestercarbonates containing side carboxyl groups. These copolymers were synthesized in two ways: the classic two-step process involving the copolymerization of l-lactide and a cyclic carbonate containing a blocked side carboxylate group in the form of a benzyl ester (MTC-Bz) and its subsequent deprotection, and a new way involving the one-step copolymerization of l-lactide with this same carbonate, but containing an unprotected carboxyl group (MTC-COOH). Both reactions were carried out under identical conditions in the melt, using a specially selected zinc chelate complex, with Zn[(acac)(L)H2O] (where: L—N-(pyridin-4-ylmethylene) phenylalaninate ligand) as an initiator. The differences in the kinetics of both reactions and their courses were pictured. The reactivity of the MTC-COOH monomer without a blocking group in the studied co-polymerization was much higher, even slightly higher than l-lactide, which allowed the practically complete conversion of the comonomers in a much shorter time. The basic final properties of the obtained copolymers and the microstructures of their chains were determined. The single-step synthesis of biodegradable polyacids was much simpler. Contrary to the conventional method, this made it possible to obtain copolymers containing all carbonate units with carboxyl groups, without even traces of the heavy metals used in the deprotection of the carboxyl groups, the presence of which is known to be very difficult to completely remove from the copolymers obtained in the two-step

The urban space is often the main cause of conflicts, at the heart of which lie conflicting interests, attitudes and needs relating to the way this space is utilized. The\naim of the research described in this article is to identify the intensity of conflicts between residents, tourists and the tourism sector. The research was conducted in 2020. The statistical analysis of the obtained data included questionnaires from 386\nrespondents. Analysis was conducted of the conflicts that arose among tourism sector players, who were classified into groups – tourist entrepreneurs, residents, and local authorities. Respondents often indicated conflict arising between tourists and\nresidents, and between tourist sector entrepreneurs and residents.

TMDCs have different enzymatic properties due to their unique nano-architecture, high surface area, and semiconducting properties with tunable band gaps. Furthermore, the compatibility of TMDCs with various chemical or physical modification strategies provide a simple and scalable way to engineer and control their enzymatic activity.

CdS crystal can exist in either zinc-blende or hexagonal (wurtzite) structures under normal conditions, depending on the growth conditions. These crystals remain an important research field because of their wide application in various fields of optoelectronic devices. From this point of view, the study of structural properties and the dynamics of electronic spectra of CdS crystal under the action of external pressures is of fundamental interest for studying the process of stabilization in compounds.\nWe have investigated the effect of pressure on the electronic band structure of CdS crystal using the density functional theory. In this approach, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the Purdue-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBEsol) parameterization were used for the exchange-correlation potential calculation. The ground-state properties were determined for the bulk material (CdS) in zinc blende structure. Structural and electronic properties were studied in the range of hydrostatic pressures between 0 and 90 GPa. The electron band-energy structure and density of states were calculated at different pressures. The equilibrium structural parameters, bulk modules and bandgaps were calculated and compared with the available experimental data and other theoretical results. The effect of pressure on the energy gap, total energy, and lattice parameters of CdS crystal has been determined and compared with other known data."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058068230","journalIssue":{"objectId":"620fa6692467f0419c5b1d5a","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"26","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"962dc1e1-f1f8-458e-a08f-b1826dddbf57"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"26","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.30970/jps.26.1701","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"620fa6692467f0419c5b1d57","name":"R.

Two dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC) in the multiple heart-cutting mode was compared with regular 1D chromatographic separations of MEL and its oxidative metabolites. Our results showed that the use of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) as mobile phase modifier was required to obtain a satisfactory resolution and peak shapes particularly for c3OHM. As TFA is not compatible with ESI ionization the application of the MHC mode was mandatory for a proper chromatographic separation. We evaluate also different internal standardization approaches based on the combined use of a surrogate standard (5-methoxytryptophol) and an internal standard (6-methoxytryptamine) for MEL quantification in cell culture samples obtaining unsatisfactory results both by 1D- and 2D-LC-ESI-MS/MS (from 9 ± 2 to 186 ± 38%). We demonstrate that only the application of isotope dilution Mass Spectrometry through the use of an in house synthesized 13C isotopically labelled analogue provided quantitative MEL recoveries both by using 1D- and 2D-LC-ESI-MS/MS (99±1 and 98±1.

Machine learning (ML), a branch of artificial intelligence, has recently emerged as a powerful technology in optoelectronic devices for the prediction of various properties and rational design of materials. Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have been at the centre of attraction owing to their outstanding photophysical properties and rapid development in solar cell application. Therefore, the application of ML in the field of MHPs is also getting much attention to optimize the fabrication process and reduce the cost of processing. Here, we comprehensively reviewed different applications of ML in the designing of both MHP absorber layers as well as complete perovskite solar cells (PSCs). At the end, the challenges of ML along with the possible future direction of research are discussed. We believe that this review becomes an indispensable roadmap for optimizing materials composition and predicting design strategies in the field of perovskite technology in the future.

The processes that are accompanied by the accumulation of adsorbate molecules on the surface are different from absorption, which is related to absorbing molecules into the whole mass and requires diffusion into the interior. If both processes can occur simultaneously, this phenomenon is called sorption. The aim of the present study was to characterize the sorption properties of selected sorbents and to assess the possibility of their application to support the treatment of coking wastewater from ammonium nitrogen, phenol, and TOC. The scope of the study included the examinations of sorption properties of selected sorbents (coal dust, coke dust, biochar), physicochemical tests of coking wastewater after biological treatment, as well as the examinations aimed to determine the dose of adsorbents and time needed to establish the equilibrium state of the process. The results obtained were analyzed for the effect of dose and contact time on the pollutant removal efficiency. The literature describes the efficiency of ammonium nitrogen removal from wastewater using chemical processes. However, there is a lack of studies on the removal of ammonium nitrogen, phenol, and TOC from industrial (coking) wastewater.

Serum concentration of acute phase proteins (APPs) may be helpful to assess general health status in wildlife and potentially useful in selecting animals for elimination. Since there is a lack of literature data regarding concentration of APPs in European bisons, establishment of the reference values is also needed.\r\nMethods: A total of 87 European bison from Polish populations were divided into two groups: (1) healthy: immobi  lized for transportation, placing a telemetry collar and routine diagnostic purposes; and (2) selectively culled due to the poor health condition. The serum concentration of haptoglobin, serum amyloid A and α1-acid-glycoprotein were determined using commercial quantitative ELISA assays. Since none of the variables met the normality assumptions, non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used for all comparisons. Statistical signifcance was set at p < 0.05. Statisti  cal analyses were performed using Statistica 13.3 (Tibco, USA). \r\nResults: The concentration of haptoglobin and serum amyloid A was signifcantly higher in animals culled (euthan  ised) due to the poor condition in respect to the clinically healthy European bison. The levels of α1-acid-glycoprotein did not show statistical diference between healthy and sick animals. \r\nConclusions: Correlation between APPs concertation and health status was proven, therefore the determination of selected APPs may be considered in future as auxiliary predictive tool in assessing European bison health condition."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058068254","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"1-7","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12917-021-03133-z","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63cfb03c4097076d2679e4dc","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Larska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dcf66e78-b729-4a8b-80db-e9eabd6fa4fb"},{"objectId":"63cfb03c4097076d2679e4db","name":"Kacper

next industrial revolution, which coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, is prompting a different look at the issue of supply chain change management. A new perspective should take into account the aspect of supply chain efficiency at multiple levels. Efficient logistics is green and energy-saving, both of which need to be systematically integrated with the logistical planning processes. The dynamic changes on the demand and supply side resulting from social, political, and economic transformations have significantly influenced the shaping of long-term supply chains. The development of new manufacturing and logistics technologies prompts the development and implementation of new integrated planning methods to support supply chain management processes. Modern supply chains are oriented towards operations in a dynamically changing socio-economic environment. The new methods are capable of incorporating dynamic adaptation of logistics infrastructure which respond to changing relationships between supply and demand. To meet the identified problems of complexity, relevance, and time-consumption of the logistic planning process in modern enterprise management, the PL9A method of logistic planning and 9A LOGPLANNER application for logistics planning were developed. The article presents the results of experimental and simulation studies on the improvement of logistic processes in a working manufacturing enterprise with application of the PL9A method. The results of the experimental work indicate that the application of the PL9A method embedded in the 9A LOGPLANNER software makes it possible to dynamically simulate any number of logistics system variants in a short period of time, while reducing risk and obtaining tangible benefits in terms of energy and ecological efficiency.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058068280","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"639","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6459e9ff4097076a7a4b68e9","name":"Norbert","lastName":"Chamier-Gliszczyński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"84728809-0341-41f8-8150-05e9c99f8fd7"},{"objectId":"6459e9ff4097076a7a4b68e8","name":"Michał","lastName":"Staniuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a6559229-d1ea-42e3-8cc0-114864e70f9e"},{"objectId":"6459e9ff4097076a7a4b68e7","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Staniuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1a0418e2-8bc3-409c-bffb-55de7243a797"},{"objectId":"5e709310878c28a0473a22c4","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kłodawski","uuid":"10990A5AF736A1352A2897D2BFC299DE40AE7A96A2F1F972CBA68B6E0EEC165547E2DA997606EC7E1488B264C1B2DF18DF7A09DBA46B636A498C6F7E76BEE22B","orcidId":"0000-0002-4256-2189","documentHash":"4bb9a97e-0e6b-4db7-9055-e22900dd4efc"},{"objectId":"5e709237878c28a047391e19","name":"Marianna","lastName":"Jacyna","uuid":"28B91E1FE2902B6A2BA96647620A6EAA61315E421D8A67A7B3F36A22A0F3ACE86DA13BF0E10B3B170006771EC336B74BF9AA306C3F708C49C417127048899CC3","orcidId":"0000-0002-7582-4536","documentHash":"7f256b86-ce3d-478f-88d0-7f744a7ebfc8"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15020639"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA1ODA2ODI4MA=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
