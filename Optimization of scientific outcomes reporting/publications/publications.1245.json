Drying can reduce the moisture content to a safe level where enzymatic activity can be stopped when the water activity is lower than 0.6. In the preservation of herbs, spices, and medicinal plants, various drying techniques have been reported such as microwave drying, infrared drying, solar drying, convective air drying, vacuum drying, thin-layer air infringement drying, spray drying, and fluidized bed drying.

Additionally, as a result of the need to maintain the height of the turf at an appropriate level, a significant amount of biomass residues is generated, which requires proper disposal. The goal of this work concerns the determination of biomass residues resources (grass clippings), obtained after mowing of the six selected golf courses in Poland. Based on own research, the selected golf course was characterized in terms of the area, frequency of mowing as well as management strategy and disposal of mowing residues. Based on the indicators obtained from the literature review, the biomass potential was determined, which was equal to 77.96 MgDM∙year^-1 (± 5.51 MgDM∙year^-1) to 150.97 MgDM∙year^-1 (± 6.25 MgDM∙year^-1) depending on the golf course. The obtained results and performed calculations indicated that the existing resources allow for the construction of microbiogas plants, fed by grass clippings with the electric power of 9.56 kW to 18.51 kW, which would allow for the production of electricity in the amount of 76.19 MWh∙year^-1 to 147.55 MWh∙year^-1 and heat in the amount of 237.36 GJ∙year^-1 - 459.67 GJ∙year^-1. In addition, it was shown that the production of electricity and heat exceeds the energy input for mowing golf courses, making a positive energy balance of the process."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491429","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"163","pagesFromTo":"84-90","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://rynek-energii.pl/pl/RE163","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"634a1b297523402e34127284","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Sobol","uuid":"1B126E6CEBBF4A38097C6728597F44F1983BEDC25D352257D130192BE9285D17D9CAE30078C34867F2C3232301D23766727D3ED24DD9F30DF93BD68A4EECAFCC","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a00fc696-6f23-4b8d-bf86-89c5a1d3220a"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e2c9","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Dyjakon","uuid":"F74BAF8F6279A46A527E44C36DCBC5DB8339885230FBAC88875230CADF86137D39B3E09B2164BA20982EF696F9BB3739975CA2C017923A431DEF31419FB263BD","orcidId":"0000-0003-3618-2099","documentHash":"4fbd2733-ee85-4519-9736-048644e8527d"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"In-depth analysis of erythrose reductase homologs in Yarrowia lipolytica","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":null,"issn":"2045-2322","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-05","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eefec94097076263b99f9e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65eefec94097076263b99f9f","60b867859543c72336542e6b","65eefec94097076263b99fa0","5e709264878c28a047394d6c"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The unconventional yeast Yarrowia lipolytica produces erythritol as an osmoprotectant to adapt to osmotic stress. In this study, the array of putative erythrose reductases, responsible for the conversion of d-erythrose to erythritol, was analyzed. Single knockout and multiple knockout strains were tested for their ability to produce polyols in osmotic stress conditions. Lack of six of the reductase genes does not affect erythritol significantly, as the production of this polyol is comparable to the control strain. Deletion of eight of the homologous erythrose reductase genes resulted in a 91% decrease in erythritol synthesis, a 53% increase in mannitol synthesis, and an almost 8-fold increase in arabitol synthesis as compared to the control strain. Additionally, the utilization of glycerol was impaired in the media with induced higher osmotic pressure. The results of this research may shed new light on the production of arabitol and mannitol from glycerol by Y. lipolytica and help to develop strategies for further modification in polyol pathways in these microorganisms."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491431","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-36152-x","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eefec94097076263b99fa0","name":"Cécile","lastName":"Neuvéglise","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"554ff6e1-5a45-485e-879f-f4ddc5f591c8"},{"objectId":"65eefec94097076263b99f9f","name":"Mateusz ","lastName":"Szczepańczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b89ee0b1-dac5-45ae-a88d-17ae157ad596"},{"objectId":"60b867859543c72336542e6b","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Rzechonek","uuid":"9667544870C997EEA1104E1A1A97277B48827B3D41972EAC99A8BB807D7E5C8380A8FF903E42C16FAC614489B9703629DE7E0E5656DB81CA6F89243476B9A538","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"530024a6-4c37-424a-9e5f-fae2a46fbe0b"},{"objectId":"5e709264878c28a047394d6c","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Mirończuk","uuid":"BBD29AA5F10D4C75BBF8851819B28F942A07BB17B76DF6DE23A0ED0A705F0309EE3E2F0FABFF7A3E914C54B961373680F3AE8EEBA5C9496F584D07C1E0F03F22","orcidId":"0000-0003-1604-1635","documentHash":"4db0740d-2359-422c-b893-0f664a4b3cdf"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-36152-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"niemiecki","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6576c1b140970765802287d6","doi":null,"title":"Natur – Geist und Macht.

The subject of the analysis is the so far not studied specificity (modeling) of combinatorics of metaphorical patterns in poetic texts in semantic and cognitive terms. The material for analysis consists of 172 metaphorical expressions (conceptual metaphors). The source domain was used as the basis for metaphorical modeling, and therefore the division of conceptual metaphors into anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, phytomorphic, naturomorphic and artifactual (object) metaphors was used. The result of the article is the distinction of mono- and polymetaphores containing an incorporation and correlation metaphorical model (single- and different-type binary and tertiary models)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491438","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65cb49f84097072cdd75e3c7","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"185","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"faedef70-3f91-4637-80da-80a465561639"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"185","pagesFromTo":"195-219","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"The specificity of the metaphorization of the phenomenon nature concepts In the russian poetic discourse (metaphorical modeling) - winter"}],"publicUri":"https://www.journals.us.edu.pl/index.php/PR/article/view/15384","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093c1878c28a0473b030f","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Kononowicz-Kur","uuid":"14F807599FB3E4DB522B62FDBE5F667442BD335A7F248C947A2676AE82F96D696D45F77D1969F1FB2B75914F2CE53BC0D32744C3B85A0922B3FD2136B4E0675C","orcidId":"0000-0001-9107-4790","documentHash":"6f7622f8-4d6e-4ca6-a6d7-cf3324b98b7c"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Pierwsze stwierdzenie Phytolacca americana (Phytolaccaceae) w południowo-zachodniej Polsce","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479e68","mniswId":"22495","title":"Fragmenta Floristica et Geobotanica Polonica","doi":null,"issn":"1640-629X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"9df76051-39f8-4d6d-8539-00181082a9f8"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65ef00d74097076263b9a6dd","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709262878c28a047394c92"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A synanthropic locality of the pokeweed was found near the village Jankowice Wielkie (Olszanka commune, Brzeg district, Opole Silesia province, SW Poland) on 27.07.2022 (Figs 1, 2).

One of the devices that can use wastewater as a raw material for energy production is a microbial fuel cell (MFC). MFCs technology is constantly evolving. However, to increase its use, it is necessary to improve its efficiency. There are various possibilities to ensure this, such as the use of new electrode materials, new cell designs, or the use of wastewaters from different sources. In this paper the analysis of MFC operation (cell voltage, power, and current density) fed by mixed municipal and industrial wastewaters was shown. Moreover, the change in time of COD was analyzed. Due to cost reduction the membrane-less microbial fuel cell (ML-MFC) was chosen. It was noted that the addition of concentrated process wastewater increases the COD reduction time in the ML-MFC. An increase of generated bioelectricity during fed ML-MFC by mixed municipal and industrial (process wastewater from yeast production) wastewater was demonstrated. The highest values of average cell voltage (598 mV), maximum power (4.47 mW) and maximum current density (0.26 mA•cm-2) were obtained for a 10% share of yeast process wastewater in the mixed wastewater, which fed the ML-MFC"}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491453","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"33","pagesFromTo":"50-62","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.ceer.com.pl/Feeding-a-Membrane-less-Microbial-Fuel-Cell-by-Mixed-Municipal-and-Industrial-Wastewater,178189,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a0473975ad","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Włodarczyk","uuid":"B419CD38FFAFDC9893E27300C53BA7D877512D65FA211789F3D6325D88D215AFB6490C5D664EEB21B05A6F08C76DB7307651869A5B466E94F7B5EF4040594C3A","orcidId":"0000-0003-1785-1998","documentHash":"4409fdf2-b531-4f50-9726-8acf2c6e0ef5"},{"objectId":"5e709237878c28a047391e0a","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Włodarczyk","uuid":"FC9F45A357223AB9241F96C71AB07925C02BB7BC979ED5905C8FC8AF097284119767FDFF59FC98BDAE1828B3D5377C811E775D8B27D3A3F21CE2AAAE559C5A63","orcidId":"0000-0001-5969-6653","documentHash":"06d0b2f9-4eb9-494f-96c5-1315f094cc01"}],"doi":"10.59440/ceer/178189"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["SCXRD","coordination polymers","topology","intermolecular interactions"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"From isostructurality to structural diversity of Ag(I) coordination complexes formed with imidazole based bipodal ligands, and disclosure of a unique topology","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1944","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"66029f924097076263243279","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709494878c28a0473bfd45"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Two Ag(I) complexes with 1,3-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene (bib) and counterions BF4¯ (1) and PF6¯ (2) were synthesized in order to check their behavior in forming molecular/crystal structures. This allows comparison with the final products of analogous syntheses performed with similar bidentate ligands containing methyl substituents on the benzene ring, namely 1,3-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-5-methylbenzene (bimb) and 1,3-bis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene (bitmb). The Ag(I) complexes obtained with the methylated ligands mentioned above form isostructural pairs of waved 1D chains or dinuclear boxes, of general formula {[Ag(bimb)]X}n and [Ag2(btmb)2]X2, respectively (X = BF4¯, PF6¯), under the same reaction conditions. SCXRD analyses of 1 and 2 revealed the formation of polymeric coordination compounds of formula {[Ag2(bib)3](BF4)2}n and {[Ag(bib)]PF6}n, respectively, different from those observed for bimb. The 3D coordination polymer 1 forms a unique 5,5-c net of 5,5T188 topological type, observed for the very first time for a coordination compound, with silver cations adopting a trigonal geometry, whereas 2 shows the presence of 1D single-stranded cationic helices with linear coordination of the metal centers. Interestingly, these complexes differ not only from the mentioned isostructural pairs of related Ag(I) complexes, but also from the isostructural pair of compounds obtained as the final product when reacting bib and bimb with the larger counterion CF3SO3¯. Hirshfeld surface analyses indicate a higher contribution of F···H intermolecular contacts in 2 than in 1, with H…H contacts being dominant in the latter."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491457","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/5/1852","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709494878c28a0473bfd45","name":"Liliana","lastName":"Dobrzańska","uuid":"A7F18B27FA46478BC53802B008A6218E85A1DD2E627B12E660E764CDA3C68F1C02DECC9117BBAA39C1686D0C1302E0BAD1DD5CBE11B6B19B6AFC9BBFD6B63B6E","orcidId":"0000-0003-2075-2122","documentHash":"f8f1b348-7387-457d-a72e-08d0c8a00cf1"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15051852"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65c2139040970762639ea9b6","doi":null,"title":"Leczenie bólu u chorych na nowotwory","year":2023,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-66801-47-9","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://repo.uni.opole.pl/info/book/UOe9c6f61c666a496399f8dfe033f1ad76/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"71008a34-c65f-43ac-88f2-e4ac9980c8d5","publisher":{"objectId":"5e71548246e0fb0001ca06d5","mniswId":null,"name":"AsteriaMed","documentHash":"ec736887-e6a6-446b-bf5a-c054ff2c9410"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Jak rozpoznać i leczyć ból neuropatyczny?","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6602bff34097076263251cbb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6602bff34097076263251cbc","5ebedc34752340254fc42098"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059491458","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"113-120","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://repo.uni.opole.pl/info/article/UOd5438fae57544b029f02fa3b7be9196e/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6602bff34097076263251cbc","name":"Elwira ","lastName":"Góraj","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c5608067-2978-4460-9ff8-085f37380955"},{"objectId":"5ebedc34752340254fc42098","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kluczna","uuid":"C5BD742A06397D2342E5B1803ADCB6483B802ABA20ABB5AFD5D21D4EA2B63EEBCC4913E2D28A1C780F5380D453BA080B7BACD3DAECD17B210C54C27878BC183B","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d01531b4-addd-4229-b779-54454becadb9"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Wczesna działalność polskich komunistów w Stanach Zjednoczonych.

Elbaum was one of the founders of the Polish radical left in the USA. His\nactivities in the context of the events taking place in America (explosion of political radicalism\nand repression against left-wing activists) first consisted in winning support for Polish\ncommunist circles, taking control of the Polish faction of the Socialist Party, then editing its\nperiodical, Głos Robotniczy (Workers’ Voice), and participating, as a delegate from Michigan,\nin the founding convention of the Communist Party USA in Chicago in September 1919.\nArrested in 1920 and threatened with deportation, Elbaum escaped from prison in March\n1920, managing to get to Europe, where he continued his work as a communist activist. His\ncareer in the USA also illustrates the divisions among American socialists, growing role\nof immigrants among them and their gradual radicalisation, which eventually led to a split\nand the founding of the Communist Party USA."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491463","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6497589b409707619db20e30","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"114","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"54b93f24-9d54-4c89-b212-327b34483a3b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"114","pagesFromTo":"83-103","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.przegladhistoryczny.pl/pl/content/przegl%C4%85d-historyczny-rok-2023-tom-114-zeszyt-1","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70928c878c28a047397b07","name":"Włodzimierz ","lastName":"Batóg","uuid":"B404E4CB1F66822A35D5329D107D0668C04C41F689BEAABAA375336D7B569041861BFFCCBB3E1AB931EF9FABD9EE3CC91057C8D2FC179AE7E462AAD559DB8E66","orcidId":"0000-0003-0527-0299","documentHash":"c16c01f0-da17-4994-aa0e-52b3de75f262"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-1-003-26925-0","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Drying of Herbs, Spices, and Medicinal Plants","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":238,"publicationPlace":"Boca Raton","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65ef021e4097076263b9a857","editors":[{"objectId":"65ef021e4097076263b9a859","name":"Shivanand S.","lastName":"Shirkole","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c66b8d35-382a-48fb-b1ae-cc17b44aa8bd"},{"objectId":"65ef021e4097076263b9a858","name":"Ching Lik","lastName":"Hii","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"caed0dc6-5e39-417f-a8b2-893ae6e91e51"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["65ef021e4097076263b9a858","65ef021e4097076263b9a859"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059491464","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb7c9","mniswId":"20200","name":"CRC Press / Balkema","documentHash":"2a6ef8b6-bb62-46c9-82bd-63632e7f90e5"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/edit/10.1201/9781003269250/drying-herbs-spices-medicinal-plants-ching-lik-hii-shivanand-shirkole?refId=00c184c3-c1b7-4b8d-9fb9-192141c48b77&context=ubx","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":"10.1201/9781003269250"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"654e4af64097074318088d18","doi":null,"title":"Premierzy i ministrowie Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej 1918-1939","year":2023,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-67253-59-8","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://repo.uni.opole.pl/info/book/UO0f1296e07a514426a66da6f8236dd104/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"f0daeda8-67f1-430f-94f8-00af5a9d5533","publisher":{"objectId":"610809959543c70b144e7022","mniswId":"88200","name":"Wydawnictwo Instytutu De Republica","documentHash":"f1cf6b90-a71e-403a-988e-640864571177"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Mieczysław Norwid-Neugebauer (1884-1954).

This is incorrect, both in technical and economic terms. Such approach results from the fact that the minister responsible for transportation issued a regulation that imposes usage of service loads comprising solely of vertical loads when analyzing existing bridge structures; rules for determination of other variable loads, e.g. braking forces, are not given in the regulation. The article presents principles for determination of all the necessary loads and actions – both permanent and variable. They have been adopted based on the standard that was introduced in Poland in 1985. Requirements of this standard have already proved adequate in decades of engineering design practice.

I t is pursued by analyzing the meanings of verbs on the basis of \"Podróż bez celu\" (1824-1825) by Fryderyk Skarbek. In the conducted research, both the methods of computer linguistics and the classical philological method were used, which allowed for the necessary immersion into contexts and connotations. Verbs with meanings not noted in modern dictionaries of the Polish language were subjected to a detailed analysis. From the perspective of the generał contemporary language, these are lexical, semantic and morphological archaisms. Half of them disappeared completely, in the remaining ones there were semantic shifts: extensions, narrowing, changes in designation, the analysis of which proves a significant tendency of the nineteenth-century resource to differentiate and expand."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491482","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"39","pagesFromTo":"297-315","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/320869","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61971a397523400e637366cd","name":"Olga","lastName":"Radziszewska","uuid":"833403BED4E95082E60E085FFF025DCC994020307273DBC9F1B0052723CBB31BF52AF8A65AAA6F7B4D5980C789C53E2CE7E821D97C0ACB6EFD0B3857B5C553D8","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c941c546-b8f4-4d11-b7d9-04eb32824a4f"}],"doi":"10.53052/17313317.2022.51"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["structural fracture and failure","failure analysis","lattice Boltzmann method","molecular dynamics"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","uid":"bQp8ITDzg_V-1GFpvOVvvtg","uuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","parentUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","rootUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","name":"Politechnika Opolska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["643a0c2840e3ff4630cec040","5e7093a4878c28a0473ae592","611b1f299543c757bc082899"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A critical review on molecular dynamics applied to structure fracture and failure analysis","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477abc","mniswId":"5707","title":"Engineering Analysis with Boundary Elements","doi":null,"issn":"0955-7997","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"46437bcc-c4f5-4410-a6a6-ee4dad7cb583"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eedf7f4097076263b9049d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65eedf7f4097076263b9049e","65eedf7f4097076263b9049f","65eedf7f4097076263b904a0","611b1f299543c757bc082899","5e7093a4878c28a0473ae592","65eedf7f4097076263b904a1","643a0c2840e3ff4630cec040"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Due to the continuous exploration of ocean resources, the marine structures are gradually applied from offshore to far-reaching sea areas, and the safety and reliability of the marine structures are becoming more and more important. Fractures and failures of the marine structures are the most common structural damages while considerable numerical computational techniques are developed to investigate the failure mechanisms and health monitoring of the marine structures. This review aims to report the numerical methods for structural failure analysis from macroscopic, mesoscopic to microscopic scales, including the methods of the macroscopic continuum, lattice Boltzmann, and molecular dynamics. The fundamental theories and recent progresses in the macroscale, mesoscale and microscale are summarized to suggest the future development directions. The discussions of the latest achievements in structural failure analysis will not only deepen the understanding of the structural failure mechanisms subject to solid-fluid coupling in a marine environment, but also provide necessary guidance for engineers and researchers in this research field."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491484","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eedfa640970749973d79de","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"150","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"f9cd4501-64da-468a-9fd8-9bd54e43e976"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"150","pagesFromTo":"413-422","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955799723000863?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eedf7f4097076263b904a1","name":"Darius","lastName":"Andriukaitis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8f7763d3-b1d0-4c14-980e-8c8aa5af1609"},{"objectId":"65eedf7f4097076263b904a0","name":"Chunsheng","lastName":"Yang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e1c74f4d-850f-4848-ad1c-355145923e2d"},{"objectId":"65eedf7f4097076263b9049f","name":"Atilla","lastName":"Incecik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"84974443-8aa8-445d-a4ca-ce392cf44135"},{"objectId":"65eedf7f4097076263b9049e","name":"Mengmeng","lastName":"Wang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c319acb4-878e-4cd0-b738-1d3ce7cd4498"},{"objectId":"643a0c2840e3ff4630cec040","name":"ZHIXIONG","lastName":"LI","uuid":"702756DCCCD3492C7F8BEE876ECFF5320F12A813CAE78A9EF23A2EFD6E44E8974DA4C0167114F64ABED373F069177BE3B59258C22EAA67DBD18E6C027CAFAFBA","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"59b058ba-526e-4828-8f00-3046d9f8887c"},{"objectId":"611b1f299543c757bc082899","name":"MUNISH","lastName":"GUPTA","uuid":"F5865D4EDDEC75980E79207C030BE585C437E16B74094A84FCA3195D425EAB1657A884C28B18CBD0B0FAAB6D8CBDEAFFE4740A0D2A99F3AAF389A97DA5A5D8B0","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3b10e4c8-a02e-4698-9a16-fb80cf6020a1"},{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae592","name":"GRZEGORZ","lastName":"KRÓLCZYK","uuid":"CBFCAB23248F107BE0869A0A1B95424418771F3BF1C3230726107C2E5AFCDAD7015626B297AF4BA3889E7234B4F73D33C256E065E8A33D085071A5B816F9E9BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2967-1719","documentHash":"983b593f-a262-4fbd-83c5-754137e069b1"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.enganabound.2023.02.028"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e178","uid":"bNsOc8LWMO-rYhuDMGKqClg","uuid":"b276c277-c4c6-4376-befd-8461236490bd","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wydział Mechatroniki, Uzbrojenia i Lotnictwa","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094e2878c28a0473c5fcf","5e7092a4878c28a047399c69","633b9aaa7523402e340ef5ed"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Comparison of Computational Methods and Approaches Applied in Formulation of Boundary Conditions in Lagrange’s Ballistic Problem","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547e315","mniswId":"24302","title":"Journal of Physics : Conference Series","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"1742-6588","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"8c908a9a-27d0-414c-bae7-bef7b230fef1"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eee78f40970749973e2cb7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["633b9aaa7523402e340ef5ed","5e7094e2878c28a0473c5fcf","5e7092a4878c28a047399c69"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper compares algorithms for constructing a differential solution to the gas\ndynamics equations in the surrounding of a moving boundary. In order to compare the\nalgorithms, the Lagrange problem, also known as the piston problem, was chosen as a test\nproblem. A comparison was made between the author's algorithm based on the method of\ncharacteristics and the classical approach with a fictitious cell using the solution of the Riemann\nproblem. Calculations were carried out for the case of subsonic and supersonic gas motion.\nComparisons were made on a fixed grid with a dynamically expanding cell (Euler grid) and on\na uniformly expanding grid (Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian – ALE grid).

However, net carbon monoxide (CO) production has been observed during bio-waste composting. So far, O2 concentration and temperature have been identified as the main variables influencing CO formation. This study aimed to investigate CO net production during bio-waste composting under controlled laboratory conditions by varying aeration rates and temperatures. A series of composting processes was carried out in conditions ranging from mesophilic to thermophilic (T = 35, 45, 55, and 65 °C) and an aeration rate of 2.7, 3.4, 4.8, and 7.8 L·h−1. Based on the findings of this study, suggestions for the improvement of CO production throughout the composting process have been developed for the first time. The highest concentrations of CO in each thermal variant was achieved with an O2 deficit (aeration rate 2.7 L·h−1); additionally, CO levels increased with temperature, reaching ~300 ppm at 65 °C. The production of CO in mesophilic and thermophilic conditions draws attention to biological CO formation by microorganisms capable of producing the CODH enzyme. Further research on CO production efficiency in these thermal ranges is necessary with the characterization of the microbial community and analysis of the ability of the identified bacteria to produce the CODH enzyme and convert CO from CO2."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491487","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/13/4551","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eef7df4097076263b97ece","name":"Erwin","lastName":"Binner","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b7f7a9a3-cff7-4598-aa56-b77d403fcaa8"},{"objectId":"65eef7df4097076263b97ecd","name":"Christian","lastName":"Zafiu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a18d68bf-7e47-4db0-9bfe-78dfdbfbee15"},{"objectId":"602f4bf09543c7410626f2ed","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Sobieraj","uuid":"3F2A552DB84250BD0A5994922D2DC1A2084F88A7FAB512483FD9EAB9A3FF31B78664746757510C8CB9FC29D468354ABEF55A2EA7294E0F69E761C72A16EA9B17","orcidId":"0000-0001-6901-8354","documentHash":"6fd51930-526b-42a0-8e91-220b0f4c7bec"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6ceb","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Stegenta-Dąbrowska","uuid":"80D1601E2AFFEF13CF7A130F184009290FC4298E9EC5673F5A17D8F6487AEDD71C8A4EF2BB3D040DA0C7AC4AB3C889ED099BD79B9AC2514D0CF2CDCF7BFD0FA5","orcidId":"0000-0001-7161-1878","documentHash":"5fed024f-6d4d-4e94-bb37-26568620bf62"},{"objectId":"5e70921c878c28a0473900b8","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Białowiec","uuid":"BDF818D6D6BB69D5CB05F525C0A728054D812F8C0CBC79878F9420A7D0179A7016B66891425C5163C20A634E1DFADC9AE9B75400AF4ECBB91B18B2827927D69A","orcidId":"0000-0002-5871-2129","documentHash":"81d1531c-2c4b-477c-b00c-645c599311ea"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma16134551"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927d878c28a0473968fb","5e709359878c28a0473a7db8","5e709355878c28a0473a7806"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"55.

Substytucja dzięki swojej kreatywności skupia uwagę odbiorcy,\r\nzachęca do lektury oraz wzmacnia koherencję tekstu ogłoszenia prasowego. Dzięki znajomości utartego sformułowania u odbiorcy zostają wywoływane pozytywne emocje w stosunku do reklamowego produktu, a tym samym następuje jego dowartościowanie. Dzięki popularności utartego sformułowania redukowany jest nakład związany z zapamiętywaniem, co prowadzi do lepszego utrwalenia i służy do umocnienia przesłania tekstu reklamowego w pamięci odbiorcy. Ponadto poprzez użycie zmodyfikowanych frazemów w odpowiednich kontekstach reklamowych wywoływane są różnego rodzaju efekty semantyczne, które powstają dzięki metaforyczności frazemów, w szczególności idomów.

Its popularity can be explained by, inter alia, inexhaustible possibilities of expressive word games at various levels of difficulty in reception. The aim of this paper is not only to present substitution as a method of formal modification of a phraseme engendering semantic effects, but above all to discuss its function in press\r\nadvertising. Thanks to its creativity, substitution draws the recipient’s attention, facilitates 74 Mariola Majnusz-Stadnik\r\nreading and improves coherence of the text of a press advertisement. Thanks to referring to known fixed wording, it is possible to evoke in the recipient positive emotions in relation to the advertised product, and thus its appreciation takes place. Thanks to the popularity of well-known wording, the effort related to memorization is reduced, which leads to better consolidation and strengthens the message of the advertising text in the recipient’s memory. Moreover, by using modified phrasemes in appropriate advertising contexts, various semantic effects are caused, arising because of the metaphorical nature of phrases, in particular idioms. In addition, thanks to substitution, additional information can be included in the text of the advertisement in a condensed form, especially in the wording where, despite the change in the formal structure, the denotative meaning of well-known\r\nfixed wording is still noticeable. The paper is based on a corpus of 500 advertisements in which phraseme substitution comprises 146 examples."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491492","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"73-84","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://czasopisma.uwm.edu.pl/index.php/pj/article/view/7914","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a04739764d","name":"Mariola","lastName":"Majnusz-Stadnik","uuid":"F469FEC22AA5824A0A6C643927582372F909A07BF3259DB200F87925102C9814EC731603E1DE592A028468D906103120838F03DC6A5446CDDED4045B90476AC2","orcidId":"0000-0002-5809-3057","documentHash":"0e8b2d65-c5de-4e10-b4e3-7e64f8357fa4"}],"doi":"10.31648/pj.7914"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["napoje funkcjonalne","energetyki","serwatka","analiza wody"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Napoje funkcjonalne, czyli małe laboratorium zamknięte w puszce lub butelce","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"61b9abf8ad204581b62ebaf8","mniswId":"201134","title":"Analityka","doi":null,"issn":"1509-4650","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"957daf86-2435-424b-8721-311c6f785078"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6602b731409707626324caaa","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f1a4a357523405869ccc325","5e7092bd878c28a04739bdb6"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059491494","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"37-48","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.malamut.pl/analityka/numery/analityka-32022","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f1a4a357523405869ccc325","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Sugajski","uuid":"750ECA7E20756CFDAE1D62D2C8F3B2111245CF890567CFF3D16A4269056CFFBB2EEA2CF9682BBDF27CA6C01A86571062F87A46DB06C10E729BBACC4473FC7A5F","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"861f6ec2-cade-4fa4-adf5-e770ac4d2b7e"},{"objectId":"5e7092bd878c28a04739bdb6","name":"Bogusław","lastName":"Buszewski","uuid":"3D231AF8DD7B6C22D45A3BCB0A7973AD1B8DCBB42586B9AA9BC966D0AEF2E2E0A8670EEDFCDA9ABAC07CA41E2FEFE8E11AC5609D48C25008617EA7EB6D5B9753","orcidId":"0000-0002-5482-7500","documentHash":"66429445-885c-4776-8964-85fb28a22aac"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Qualitative, energy and environmental aspects of microwave drying of pre-treated apple slices","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":null,"issn":"2045-2322","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-26","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65ef026e4097076263b9ac1e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65ef026e4097076263b9ac1f","65ef026e4097076263b9ac20","5e7091fc878c28a04738e2a7","5e709232878c28a0473918da","65ef026e4097076263b9ac21"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the present research, response parameters such as specific energy consumption (SEC), thermal efficiency (TE), energy efficiency (EF), drying time (DT), greenhouse gas (GHG) emission (such as CO2 and NOx), and quality features (color variation and shrinkage) were modeled by response surface methodology (RSM) for apple slices dried in a microwave dryer under ultrasonication (30 ℃—10 min) and blanching (80 °C—2 min) pretreatments. Also, RSM was applied to optimize two independent parameters including microwave power and sample thickness in the levels 100, 200, and 300 W and 2, 4, and 6 mm, respectively. The results indicated the significant influence (P < 0.01) of the independent parameters on the response parameters. The vales of SEC, DT, GHG emission, shrinkage, and color difference were linearly decreased with the declining sample thickness and increasing microwave power, while the energy and thermal efficiencies were increased by a quadratic equation. The use of ultrasonication and blanching pretreatments decreased the SEC, GHG emissions, and DT; while improving the quality of the samples as compared to the non-treated slices. The optimization results showed the optimal drying times (31.55, 82.19, and 50.55 min), SEC (3.42, 10.07, and 4.37 MJ/kg), CO2 with natural gas (1539.75, 1518.75, and 4585 g), CO2 with gas oil (3662.53, 2099.25, 2721.25 g), NOx with natural gas (10.094, 9.956, and 12.906 g), and NOx with gas oil (12.934, 12.758, and 16.538 g) at a microwave power of 300 W and sample thickness of 2 mm with desirability of 0.921, 0.935, and 0.916 for control samples, ultrasonicated, and blanched, respectively."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491495","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-43358-6","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65ef026e4097076263b9ac21","name":"José","lastName":"Blasco","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3fd74f2b-4ebd-498d-8754-cec59cb9cf2a"},{"objectId":"65ef026e4097076263b9ac20","name":"Mohammad","lastName":"Kaveh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ffec49f3-0299-47fc-9de0-aaf05b1976af"},{"objectId":"65ef026e4097076263b9ac1f","name":"Ebrahim","lastName":"Taghinezhad","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"433a20e0-5f78-4c4c-bc68-60bbcdc1488c"},{"objectId":"5e709232878c28a0473918da","name":"Adam","lastName":"Figiel","uuid":"7CC02E5E7CFADAA95EF7E40B2E1C7D29C14377D7B4AB9BA5364132373FB61274047ECD9B06CD5C35BD849D2657D27872B54B246DAB8403D22BCA4233268B82BC","orcidId":"0000-0002-3443-1269","documentHash":"1782715b-2b4e-484e-9840-1aece3199060"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e2a7","name":"Antoni","lastName":"Szumny","uuid":"AE28B651B632C894879C2606F003399974DB4F842D3C49CA1D5C8EB76BBAD0B5F2BCC1B7BA62F3E92848A2BD932035D823CDA1FF929B80C04EA5CC526CE6F2D5","orcidId":"0000-0001-9058-1598","documentHash":"8b015d67-9d2a-4720-a998-2fe34600ba49"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-43358-6"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["styl tekstów szkolnych","język nastolatków","interferencje międzystylowe","kształcenie językowe"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["school text style","teenage language","interstyle interferences","language didactics"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63d380f84097070bb2f77a0f","doi":null,"title":"(Re)konstrukcje edukacji humanistycznej XXI wieku : (dydaktyka - literatura - język - nowe media)","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"9788322937976","ismn":null,"issn":"2956-4255","url":"https://repo.uni.opole.pl/info/book/UOb24d2d14b0e4457cab3aceca361d6185/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"857a6d1e-6d3d-44b9-b239-2558c80d457f","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb90d","mniswId":"62000","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","documentHash":"82030422-1508-44a9-a72a-2819a325f4b8"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Potoczność naznaczona stylem nowych mediów.

The textural properties of graphene nanoplatelets (GnPs) used as styrene-butadiene rubber’s filler and the thermal properties of the composites obtained with the use of the mentioned fillers were investigated. GnPs were modified with 1-butylpyridinium bromide (BPyBr) and 4-methyl-1-butylpyridinium bromide (BmPyBr) through two different ways. One strategy has been to deposit the filler modifier from the solution. The second one involved the modification of the filler with ionic liquids in bulk during the preparation of elastomer blends. Settlement of the proposed ionic liquids onto the GnPs’ surface led to significant changes in the textural characteristics. BPyBr has restricted the filler’s microporosity, whereas BmPyBr has caused the formation of a more opened filler structure without the increase in its average pore size. GnPs modified with ILs led to reducing the temperature of vulcanization of SBR compounds and affected the thermal stability of the composites.

Improving removal efficiency is crucial, thanks to ever-tightening legal requirements. Main reason for that is growing problem of eutrophication phenomenon. Nowadays, this problem is visible not only in lakes and ponds but also in water courses and coastal water. Study was conducted during time of 15 weeks. In that time, listed parameters were tested: pH, conductivity, total nitrogen, organic nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, total phosphorus, and phosphates. Each tank was filled with same amount of biologically treated wastewater; ambient temperature and dissolved oxygen concentrations were kept in same range for the time of experiment. Average concentrations of main pollutants in tanks with LED lighting have reached: conductivity, 936 μS/cm; TN, 8.55 mg/dm3; P-PO4, 0.74 mg/dm3; TP, 2.57 mg/dm3. In case of no LED lighting, concentrations of main pollutants have reached: conductivity, 949 μS/cm; TN, 12.85 mg/dm3; P-PO4, 1.28 mg/dm3; TP, 2.54 mg/dm3. Based on observations and analyses, it can be concluded that the use of LED lighting imitating PAR radiation has positive effect on removal efficiency of total nitrogen and phosphates. Data suggests optimal time for treatment with floating islands as 13 weeks, extending that time to 15 weeks leads to degradation of treated wastewater quality instead improving it."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491502","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"233","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11270-022-05821-4","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eef8774097076263b982a8","name":"S.","lastName":"Kilian","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4e8d45b9-5ee4-4496-be6c-2bfb3a6434f2"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473aa0ca","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Bawiec","uuid":"B32065E03CDC15FBCD3ADED91C41CF8BD1665C02DDCD0C9953FDF7AB77EBC888F2F76B06CEA2C11EEA2CD3BB609D3296F189E3BA0865731EB0EB992A2A648F79","orcidId":"0000-0002-9952-7886","documentHash":"40a35cd2-8d6a-4aaa-8fce-dde098301c58"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e1b6","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Pawęska","uuid":"F4F579FD34D2BE4EEDDC53252244652FD415A4570BE2932C21207F2E95F7CBE9D2F3DBB9BC48494F0EB2427EAD88E0AEB82AF4072F0AC4B7604105AC060B0D03","orcidId":"0000-0001-8617-1596","documentHash":"4c81679e-e7ba-492d-988d-b0de5728eccb"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11270-022-05821-4"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["alternating copolymerization; bio-based polymers"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709269878c28a047395424"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Ring-opening (co)polymerization of cardanol glycidyl ether","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479333","mniswId":"16371","title":"Polymers for Advanced Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1042-7147","eissn":"1099-1581","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"6bd04c7f-293e-4bf5-9dc9-a1213194ec9a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eeb79b4097076263b57a02","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709269878c28a047395424","67334dfcfdbe830349a2af54","67334dfcfdbe830349a2af55","67334dfcfdbe830349a2af56","67334dfcfdbe830349a2af57","67334dfcfdbe830349a2af58","67334dfcfdbe830349a2af59","67334dfcfdbe830349a2af5a","67334dfcfdbe830349a2af5b","67334dfcfdbe830349a2af5c","67334dfcfdbe830349a2af5d"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The anionic ring-opening copolymerization of commercially available bio-based cardanol glycidyl ether (CGE) was investigated without any prior purification. As a first step, anionic-ring-opening homopolymerization was attempted through active chain-end and monomer-activated mechanisms. Both strategies were unsuccessful. Conversely, in a second step, the anionic alternating ring-opening copolymerization (AAROP) of CGE with the renewable N-acetyl homocysteine thiolactone (NHTL) was successfully carried out in the presence of a strong base. Anisole, a solvent classified as sustainable and rarely used in anionic ring-opening polymerization, proved to be a suitable for the AAROP. This polymerization is an unusual example of synthesis of linear polyesters with cardanol-based monomers. The copolymers were carefully characterized by 1H, 13C, COSY, HSQC, 1H-15N NMR and MALDI-ToF, demonstrating an alternating structure. Then, CGE was copolymerized with NHTL and another additional epoxide. The cardanol-derived monomers enable the preparation of functionalizable poly(ester-alt-thioether) bearing multiple allyl and alkene groups. The AAROP method in anisole offers new opportunity for green anionic polymerization through the use of sustainable chemicals, witnessed by the valorization of cardanol-derived compounds and expands the scope of synthesized renewable polyesters."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491503","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eeb79b4097076263b57a03","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"35","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"f8bb81c1-c62c-46c9-9749-65896bead5af"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"35","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67334dfcfdbe830349a2af5d","name":"Nicolas","lastName":"Illy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"44f02810-b8ad-478c-b0fb-21426bef2ac4"},{"objectId":"67334dfcfdbe830349a2af5c","name":"Sylvain","lastName":"Caillol","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1c04d655-ed20-48ed-b22b-698849b92f6a"},{"objectId":"67334dfcfdbe830349a2af5b","name":"Philippe","lastName":"Guegan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"14c6d7c6-bbcd-4057-81fa-2f84b0dc327b"},{"objectId":"67334dfcfdbe830349a2af5a","name":"Rettina","lastName":"Radjou","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fd591a1c-1da3-4dfb-97eb-f003d7c236d5"},{"objectId":"67334dfcfdbe830349a2af59","name":"Baptiste","lastName":"Quienne","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f2d6dfa2-2d92-4fa1-b8c1-da18444e2873"},{"objectId":"67334dfcfdbe830349a2af58","name":"Margot","lastName":"Gomes","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6f48ec9b-4692-4a41-ab1a-4cb008c5d0f5"},{"objectId":"67334dfcfdbe830349a2af57","name":"Fato","lastName":"Niang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"87f7ffb1-f701-4b21-921f-5154e65c72af"},{"objectId":"67334dfcfdbe830349a2af56","name":"Justine","lastName":"Grier-Boisgontier","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eedf9929-7b58-472e-89b0-e4199d269d13"},{"objectId":"67334dfcfdbe830349a2af55","name":"Gholamreza","lastName":"Charmi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1728d355-2773-49fd-bc21-ec939e0e31f2"},{"objectId":"67334dfcfdbe830349a2af54","name":"Emma","lastName":"Mongkhoun","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c58c4ace-ea65-44c1-a455-6fc1940ef8c3"},{"objectId":"5e709269878c28a047395424","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Pietrasik","uuid":"60C28E8F2047AD91AF929416ADDD3E362229628674A513911ECB77F68C5D0FA56D795A7854D2E4C1B1B2F8D5205EF0271B27E64C40FFFAF16CC6D3DD8560B21E","orcidId":"0000-0001-7438-9627","documentHash":"e70bc56a-906e-4c3f-9dbc-48135e442bbe"}],"doi":"10.1002/pat.6320"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6602bf844097076263251027","doi":null,"title":"Polsko-rosyjski

The continuity of tradition has always played a key role in this process – defended, maintained and cultivated by subsequent generations of Silesian musicians. All this was guaranteed by the experience passed on from the master to his disciple. This is perfectly reflected in the situation of the Wrocław cathedral, which for years was the center of the Catholic Church in Silesia. Almost every subsequent organist or bandmaster who took up a position there was a student of his predecessor. The legacy of previous generations established in this way and reflection on their activities and the continuation of artistic goals laid solid foundations for the development of the orchestral mass in Silesia, which grew stronger together with subsequent cathedral musicians, and the repertoire of vocal-instrumental church music was constantly enriched. The activity of Joseph Franz Wolf (1802–1842) – the organist of the cathedral in Wrocław in the years 1833–1842 – fits into this process. He was educated by his predecessors: Joseph Ignaz Schnabel (1767–1831) – the bandmaster of the Wrocław cathedral, and Joseph Gottwald (1754–1833) – the organist of the above-mentioned cathedral church. And Moritz Brosig (1815–1887) – later the organist and bandmaster of the cathedral in question – was his pupil. It is worth mentioning that in order to expand his competences, Wolf also took organ lessons from a representative of the Evangelical side – Friedrich Wilhelm Berner (1780– 1827) – the organist of the church of St. Elizabeth. Among his peers at the Catholic Teachers’ Seminary, he stood out for his proficiency in playing the piano and organ, and he also willingly played the tenor trombone, which he mastered to perfection. J.F. Wolf quickly attracted the attention of the Wrocław music and church community with his art of playing the organ. As the candidate for the position of a university music teacher, he gained the support of Professors Braniss and Winterfeld. He was employed at the Royal Academic Institute of Church Music. He was also an active member of the Breslauer Singakademie and an artistic director of the Wrocław Artists’ Association (Breslauer Künstlerverein). In his free time he not only practised instruments but also devoted a lot of time to exploring history of music: studying the scores of other composers, their biographies, techniques and solutions used by them, and searching for inspiration for his own compositional activities. He paid special attention to the works of Viennese classics: Joseph Haydn (1732–1809), Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791) and Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827). Although today Joseph Franz Wolf is associated mainly with the position of the organist of the Wrocław cathedral, there is no point in looking for his works written for solo organ. However, this instrument is constantly present in his workshop. His vocal-instrumental church music always includes an organ which appears both as an element carefully noted by the composer in the score, taking into account each sound and recording instructions, as well as in the form of basso continuo. Wolf developed his compositional skills mainly in the field of religious music. Among the numerous compositions in this area, one can distinguish: offertoria, graduals, vesper psalms, mass cycles, as well as church songs and their harmonizations. The vast majority of these compositions was written for a vocal-instrumental ensemble, including a 4-voice mixed choir, an orchestra with a slightly changing composition over the course of subsequent works, and an organ. His creative opus vitae also includes solo songs with piano accompaniment and single piano, chamber and orchestral compositions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491510","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"93-113","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://foliaorganologica.com/issues.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709445878c28a0473b969a","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Szendzielorz","uuid":"5A7C0A1DD542520C4CE0C31C133CCC1602EEBD54FBE19A783C9D9EECB1B2B13DC4B2B8EC1591258FB30345405F9FEC22718B13B2BB0120E0DF79084A5A0ED055","orcidId":"0000-0001-5213-6418","documentHash":"d89ddc6b-d82f-4e7f-a876-e494c7408861"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet

In order to address this threat on a planetary scale, humanity must find new forms of expression. In her poetry volume Ouf (2015), Laurence Vielle creates a proposal for an experimental poetic language, understood as a corporeal opening to material reality and to non-human beings. In this article, we explore three key factors of Vielle's poetic strategies: (1) the materiality and corporeality of language, (2) relational feminist thought, and (3) pre-linguistic affective communication. These three aspects allow the author to write about ecological issues in a way that goes beyond the framework of scientific discourse, and at the same time to portray poetry itself as an ecological phenomenon."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491517","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"205-217","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://gerflint.fr/images/revues/Portugal/Portugal10/kraj.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"634626a97523402e34117777","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Kraj","uuid":"4B68E0F6007613BDD3A433B219EE79EE0AD12A9A709CF79BA7BD9FF6FA547E69A990B4847F4CFA98295EE2ACDC45614C4B4FC6667D47572C093719395C00555A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cbb01fe6-ee11-4d4a-9af0-97aacbe42a88"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","uid":"bt6mbuLY9Vpc_KWGkV1Lk4w","uuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["633e3da97523402e340f9cd2","5e709224878c28a047390928","621ee4b97523402df08b96bd","5e709225878c28a047390a12","5e709225878c28a047390a36","651b7caa40e3ff22d347c134","5e709225878c28a0473909ee","5e709225878c28a0473909b2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The activity of monocyte-derived macrophages after stimulation with platelet-rich and platelet-poor concentrates.

Their functional phenotype can be affected by platelet-derived products as determined by those products’ composition. When the inflammatory response caused by implantation is excessive, it can lead to rejection of the implant. Therefore, a thorough evaluation of implant haemocompatibility is necessary to minimise undesirable consequences.\r\n\r\nMaterial and Methods\r\nIn an in vitro study, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) were obtained from the whole blood of sheep after a silicon-doped diamond-like carbon–coated implant insertion. These MDMs were then exposed to autologous platelet-derived products for functional marker analysis.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nPlatelet-poor plasma (PPP) and pure platelet-rich plasma (P-PRP) stimulation increased arginase-1 activity, while leukocyte-rich PRP stimulation produced a mixed response involving higher O2− (6.49 ± 2.43 nM vs non-stimulated 3.51 ± 1.23 nM, P-value < 0.05) and NO (3.28 ± 1.38 μM vs non-stimulated 2.55 ± 0.32μM, P-value < 0.05) generation.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nUsing PPP and P-PRP stimulation in post-implantation procedures may contribute to the polarisation of macrophages towards the M2-like pro-resolving phenotype, thereby accelerating wound healing. This would also prevent implant degradation due to an excessive inflammatory process."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491518","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"68","pagesFromTo":"167-174","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://sciendo.com/pl/article/10.2478/jvetres-2024-0003","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"651b7caa40e3ff22d347c134","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Nguyen Ngoc","uuid":"EDE478E4C95AAD680636C652E5E4CD7BD895AB8C26B504EE2EABA8C3612DD5A08CC09D45752C0CDE03DA81AC3E361EFBF36C7D5A0DDFFB91632F207ECB244D2F","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5524754e-e8b7-455d-8743-657550ca9b2f"},{"objectId":"633e3da97523402e340f9cd2","name":"Beata","lastName":"Drzewiecka","uuid":"662AF0AB872D38C688C47BA8A057553271C9D224385690AE158EA9EC1AB66298A28D7FA1571C1DA75B5B21114A8629496EEC174F4081C5607973E856F26D1527","orcidId":"0000-0001-5862-4615","documentHash":"9e7fc526-f94d-4433-83d3-193153ab7de8"},{"objectId":"621ee4b97523402df08b96bd","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Szymczak","uuid":"C1B2CEF8C94E8E6AA15CCDEC066947CEF0B86C799CB6FB0BBFBEFCDA8B001E702BE7EEC4ECF2844F110A95F8D6483CB412854886B437253C10136925D860C739","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ae4ad8bd-9b5f-4f3a-8c68-7d399664c5d3"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a047390a36","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Wessely-Szponder","uuid":"486BF8D61F1E0ECDB63F2840BA17C8BB237139C73992FA65169B07B81DD6C57DBDA62F1EDC3E9557DCEF01217C9A5BAB5C7CEB0E52E7C042B802D2BF08857877","orcidId":"0000-0002-8815-0630","documentHash":"86a0bc39-3722-435c-8990-4113187d12b6"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a047390a12","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Szponder","uuid":"E04C9B1B8CF8085A2522EBE163202A7257E0127C91B0027D87D9329B516B26E7C2F9FE2F8953CD1AF50438054DED848FC22CFF072332E6ABF0035AC47B22A7C9","orcidId":"0000-0001-7949-7328","documentHash":"57a42c38-b835-467f-b94e-107f7ddad232"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a0473909ee","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Sobczyńska-Rak","uuid":"D52AC62A6ADD904854C353ED3F5ED08C55BE5778C2A73EB4135CEA59B78E212BD0EB2BCB01B99C6510AC05241F2B28FD72A5CB38D825B774EAE8ECDADDCED7BB","orcidId":"0000-0002-0105-0662","documentHash":"c2a46792-9dda-48ac-8e90-8f085a6b9021"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a0473909b2","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Patkowski","uuid":"EDA19F614A535A34E87A4A778E46E2A06EDF4C98FDDB81C527F005F54F60023D262FE8163AAED77C684AE0D1531E57AB63A10D584333C53AF641C1A4F4631940","orcidId":"0000-0003-4113-8981","documentHash":"3c426990-0250-485f-afb1-09458979f69d"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390928","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Junkuszew","uuid":"3EB50AECDF589886121627CB5CB4C4ECEE3A58642BC75087D49B833CFBFFB6C5E975CDB847A673DF5ECFFDE0729566A186E88E6C2660A658AEC0098426190CD7","orcidId":"0000-0003-2679-9597","documentHash":"63bb29f6-6a3c-45de-b8ec-4796a385cc85"}],"doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2024-0003"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6515c6a44097070ba4d087c8","doi":null,"title":"Oczekiwania wobec nauk biomedycznych – trendy, wyzwania i perspektywy","year":2023,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-67104-73-9","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://bc.wydawnictwo-tygiel.pl/publikacja/887BCE77-A81C-F5A8-9470-940F6A002EF4","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"46a42904-61ba-449c-8eca-325be4c28691","publisher":{"objectId":"610809959543c70b144e702c","mniswId":"85900","name":"Wydawnictwo Naukowe TYGIEL Sp. z o. o.","documentHash":"0d57bd73-1897-49e3-a7d9-d36929fd7806"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Fluorescencyjne metody znakowania egzosomów","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6602bf9d409707626325131c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6602bf9d409707626325131d","5e709337878c28a0473a5279","5e709241878c28a047392998","5e709241878c28a0473928f7"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Celem pracy było przedstawienie stanu wiedzy odnośniedo metod izolacji egzosomów, jak i technik ich\r\nznakowania sondami fluorescencyjnymi.

The results highlighted that while the processing methods had some impact on juice quality, the inherent grape variety remained the most significant factor. Although similar treatments were applied to all varieties, there were differences in the quality attributes of the juice. In general, red grape juice had a higher polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity than white grape juice. Four phenolic acids, eleven flavonols, five flavan-3-ols and five anthocyanins were identified. While the polyphenolic profile of each sample depended on the treatment and the variety, regardless of the variety, destemming was found to increase the yield by around 10–15%, while the addition of enzyme improved the yield by around 20–30%. Although the addition of enzymes led to a higher polyphenol content, it changed the color profile of the juice as a result of the pigment’s skin extraction. In contrast, the destemming process did not influence the color of the juice, but at the same time, it reduced the health benefits due to the removal of potential bioactive compounds from the stems."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491523","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/12/18/3475","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65ef02494097076263b9ab26","name":"Muhamad","lastName":"Zubaidi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eae9bd73-3b53-4236-baf6-8f65482c3040"},{"objectId":"5e70934a878c28a0473a69b6","name":"Marta","lastName":"Czaplicka","uuid":"D49E67E6C5D220482D3EE0DF413BE83B254E0839945625830269BB24E50E9CE16E213FB0BA9ABFBB1440FE47685AB10E95F52F9E138787988DE96D416A367F29","orcidId":"0000-0001-6626-4568","documentHash":"a03e7454-9a33-41c5-b3c3-cc3a8ebeb7c3"},{"objectId":"5e709264878c28a047394d47","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kolniak-Ostek","uuid":"932D8F2B970DEEFEC23072DFC223A3882027CD476282C2DE645F7ED3EC568CB5A196BA88AC377433ED03A6698B078123218E2C8037485C77BD51443DD5F9DDBC","orcidId":"0000-0002-1933-2852","documentHash":"4eebea01-5e9d-46cf-8343-e64408e07ed3"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e1cc","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Nawirska-Olszańska","uuid":"D878C1AD4C042E289B0176CB1295555D86A65AAFE0C061D242B78CE0A2733E36CFDD41D96228C41738B671EDEE4638E4F2CBD7C4B77B83D85717E5B6AC3FA0AB","orcidId":"0000-0002-9417-767X","documentHash":"55bd4a02-75dd-4a83-b84f-1379c292f557"}],"doi":"10.3390/foods12183475"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","uid":"bt6mbuLY9Vpc_KWGkV1Lk4w","uuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709227878c28a047390b45"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Fujiwara’s inequality for synchronous functions and its consequences","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d51878c285145479cc5","mniswId":"200183","title":"Biometrical Letters","doi":null,"issn":"1896-3811","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"386153b9-b7fd-4d8c-a39a-9d40832aa293"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-12-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65ef04ac4097076263ba2752","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709227878c28a047390b45"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The theory of inequalities is an essential tool in all fields of the theoretical and practical sciences, especially in statistics and biometrics. Fujiwara’s inequality provides relationships between expected values of products of random variables.

This newly introduced property of random variables will be called synchronicity. As a consequence, we obtain inequalities originated by Chebyshev, Hardy–Littlewood–Pólya and Jensen–Mercer under new conditions.\r\n\r\nThe results are illustrated by some examples constructed for specific probability measures and specific random variables. In biometrics, the obtained inequalities can be used wherever there is a need to compare the characteristics of experimental data based on means or moments, and the data can be modeled using functions

field (MF) treatment, as an efficient and pollution-free treatment method, has received extensive attention from researchers and found broad prospects in horticultural and agricultural development. According to relevant studies, mainstream research direction is aimed at utilizing MF treatment to improve the economic traits of horticultural and agricultural crops. MF has positive effects, for example, on seed germination, seedling growth, crop yield and quality and plant tolerance to stress. In recent years, more and more researchers have focused their work on using seed MF or magnetised water (MW) irrigation treatment to improve plant tolerance to salt or heavy metal stresses, to achieve the purpose of soil restoration by plant heavy metal accumulation. In this review, the most commonly utilised MF or MW treatment methods have been described in detail, and the effects of MF treatment on horticultural and agricultural crops have been presented. Furthermore, new prospects for MF treatment and the associated molecular basis have been presented. Since different species or cultivars have different optimal dose requirements for MF treatment, it is still a challenge presently to promote MF treatment use in commercial applications. For successful implementation of MF treatments, it is essential to conduct a large number of screening experiments and more in-depth research on the effects of MF on cultivated plants."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491528","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eb59db409707216ee10651","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"36","doi":null,"documentHash":"bf64caf0-9c47-4dca-82a2-5f4cbf5e7823"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"36","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.2478/fhort-2024-0004","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eb59db409707216ee10656","name":"Alma","lastName":"Balestrazzi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6034e16e-376e-4852-949b-61d1f3e06fd4"},{"objectId":"65eb59db409707216ee10655","name":"Gregorio","lastName":"Padula","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e6258ca2-04f8-4524-a17a-20926177dcff"},{"objectId":"65eb59db409707216ee10654","name":"Anca","lastName":"Macovei","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a854c112-ac1b-4fba-acb5-04417fe6b044"},{"objectId":"65eb59db409707216ee10653","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Pagano","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0ec99f4d-4a64-48a3-bec9-9c89c4a20ba9"},{"objectId":"65eb59db409707216ee10652","name":"Xianzong","lastName":"Xia","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"51f23663-11cf-49c4-a101-965adbdbe317"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62ae","name":"Roman","lastName":"Hołubowicz","uuid":"0AF30F4A6E8D43BEF9705EF0D6BEF1373D2AB61BBCBFABFC3554CDEAB0934166F06521A1A6BEAB42E7DACEAFBBC84F9AFC35AF0519B8576C40370858B65C883A","orcidId":"0000-0001-6484-1851","documentHash":"3db9fdb1-2b11-4f91-b36d-4e9eeb44e183"}],"doi":"10.2478/fhort-2024-0004"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Active substanceHPLCpesticide formulationsquality of plant protection productsnonselective signals"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee9","uid":"btl1TUFZ-RmtE1VFT09EDlQ","uuid":"f68cdefe-93d4-402f-94e1-bd2ef1f8616a","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee9","parentUuid":"f68cdefe-93d4-402f-94e1-bd2ef1f8616a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee9","rootUuid":"f68cdefe-93d4-402f-94e1-bd2ef1f8616a","name":"Instytut Ochrony Roślin - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5eead6a17523404d1000ea06","5e7093b9878c28a0473afd74","5e7093b9878c28a0473afd22","5e70937d878c28a0473ab05b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Development and validation of a simple and efficient method for the analysis of commercial formulations containing clopyralid, picloram and aminopyralid as active ingredients","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5ebff454ad49b31ccec155fe","mniswId":null,"title":"Journal of Environmental Science and Health, Part B","doi":null,"issn":"0360-1234","eissn":"1532-4109","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"4d3bbaf9-1bc9-40a2-beec-d77739b0ce58"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"66051e6e4097073700bb4e8d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70937d878c28a0473ab05b","5e7093b9878c28a0473afd22","5eead6a17523404d1000ea06","5e7093b9878c28a0473afd74"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Liquid chromatography plays a pivotal role in evaluating pesticide formulations as it enables the determination of multiple active substances in plant protection products. An adaptable separation technique has been developed, enabling the qualitative and quantitative analysis of clopyralid, picloram, and aminopyralid within pesticide formulations in line with SANCO/3030/99 rev. 5 guidelines. This article offers an insight into the validation procedure encompassing key aspects such as selectivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, and recovery. It places emphasis on critical stages, including sample preparation, chromatographic separation, detection, quantification, and data analysis. The active ingredients are separated using chromatography with isocratic elution, utilizing a mobile phase consisting of a mixture of water, acetonitrile, and acetic acid in a specific ratio (83:15:2 v/v/v). This separation is carried out on a YMC-Pack ODS-AQ column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 μm) at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. The method’s validation parameters have produced satisfactory outcomes. The recovery rates for each individual compound were found to be in the range of 98.6% to 101.0%. Precision, as indicated by the relative standard deviation (%RSD), was lower than the values predicted by the modified Horwitz equation. Furthermore, the correlation coefficients assessing the linearity of the response exceeded 0.99."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491530","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66051e6e4097073700bb4e8e","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"f7ddff8a-f7f2-42b4-b3b5-c8ace87492d8"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-6","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03601234.2024.2323425","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5eead6a17523404d1000ea06","name":"Monika","lastName":"Szalbot","uuid":"25A52926908254C31212AF30089812E9BD7652E76166094DBD05CC551726CF9974F6220BD314D01ECA8F1184684F99A9FC1A6266BFC7BA71A55F568D71DEE2E8","orcidId":"0000-0001-9180-0828","documentHash":"30e7aa6a-be32-483b-9af1-8dd29f8cca06"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afd74","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Stobiecki","uuid":"340056DB6BC411177F8B458A27101E88DB94FB2B52B667A77BBE7AA14A17982AC5A70C5AF8087D027EA9E90F28DD705D161E4AC81743BCB58B9187C2B1D76C04","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"da140982-0e80-4622-b376-ab60fbab1a30"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afd22","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Rolnik","uuid":"86ED2DD54E81636CEC72C20BE04C418294FABE1019F4BB2C3C2798E1462F6181FA4C0AD722DE6D3196AF7060BE28CF9A773DA060F6E727CC5D9C411CB7B806D7","orcidId":"0000-0001-9788-6319","documentHash":"c47a8948-ee25-4946-92d2-94b595443a94"},{"objectId":"5e70937d878c28a0473ab05b","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Marczewska","uuid":"69976CD5AB084BDA9774DBC5FA6D8118938758B056A2666BCC7F73B389CE6C00735A87EBC445BC72D5E09218AB3BBA48B13732049E5E40DBC2FF0583FB3699BA","orcidId":"0000-0002-1110-1267","documentHash":"d642e66c-372d-49fa-853b-743a379df478"}],"doi":"10.1080/03601234.2024.2323425"},{"mainLanguageName":"niemiecki","keywords":[{"languageCode":"deu","keywords":["Sprachkontaktforschung","deutsch-polnische Zweisprachigkeit","Sprachideologien"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["contact linguistics","German-Polish bilingualism","language ideologies"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"655f108740970733106e3f66","doi":"10.14220/9783737016278","title":"Wende?

Our main results show that directly indecomposable nilpotent minimum algebras (with or without negation fixpoint) with modal operators are fully characterized as connected and disconnected rotations of directly indecomposable Gödel algebras endowed with modal operators."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491535","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"6603cc0d40970762632a17b7","mniswId":null,"startDate":"2022-07-11","endDate":"2022-07-15","fullName":"19th

aim of the research was to initially assess changes in the physicochemical composition of water in the reservoirs of the city moat (Wrocław) in the context of the analysis of the type of pollutants flowing into the inner-city water reservoirs and in relation to the impact of air quality directly in the vicinity of the reservoirs. As an element of the urban landscape, the inner-city water reservoirs play an important role in improving the local climatic conditions, increasing the biodiversity of the landscape, and eliminating the negative impact of urban heat islands. The measurement campaign was conducted for 11 months. The following parameters were determined in the analyzed water samples: turbidity, pH, electrolytic conductivity, as well as concentrations of nitrogen forms (ammonium nitrogen, nitrite nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen), total phosphorus and sulphates. Additionally, air quality parameters in the direct location of the reservoirs were analyzed, including: concentrations of nitrogen oxides, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, humidity level and selected meteorological data, i.e. daily precipitation and average daily air temperature. The average concentrations of nitrogenous forms in the waters of the downtown water reservoir were as follows: ammonium nitrogen 0.155 mg·dm-3, nitrite nitrogen 0.084 mg·dm-3, nitrate nitrogen 1.15 mg·dm-3. The sulphate concentrations showed greater variability 67.805–180.973 mg·dm-3. Based on the conducted observations and analyzes, a statistically significant relationship was found between the quality parameters of water in municipal water reservoirs and external factors such as air quality, and in particular the correlation of air humidity with the concentration of nitrite and nitrate ions in the water. The conducted research confirms the influence of air quality on the levels of pollutants in the waters collected in the urban water reservoir."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491538","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"58-66","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.jeeng.net/Initial-Assessment-of-Changes-in-Water-Quality-in-the-Wroclaw-City-Moat-Reservoirs,149722,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eef8844097076263b982f4","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Kilian","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1fc5ffa7-c28a-4b0c-b449-fc551427b7a5"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473aa0ca","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Bawiec","uuid":"B32065E03CDC15FBCD3ADED91C41CF8BD1665C02DDCD0C9953FDF7AB77EBC888F2F76B06CEA2C11EEA2CD3BB609D3296F189E3BA0865731EB0EB992A2A648F79","orcidId":"0000-0002-9952-7886","documentHash":"40a35cd2-8d6a-4aaa-8fce-dde098301c58"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e1b6","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Pawęska","uuid":"F4F579FD34D2BE4EEDDC53252244652FD415A4570BE2932C21207F2E95F7CBE9D2F3DBB9BC48494F0EB2427EAD88E0AEB82AF4072F0AC4B7604105AC060B0D03","orcidId":"0000-0001-8617-1596","documentHash":"4c81679e-e7ba-492d-988d-b0de5728eccb"}],"doi":"10.12911/22998993/149722"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62da866840970752a1f1de4a","doi":null,"title":"Antykryminalistyka.

As a multifactorial condition, EMS is characterized by three main metabolic abnormalities including insulin resistance, increased adiposity or obesity and hoof laminitis. Adipose tissue dysfunction is recognized as a core pathophysiological determinant of EMS, as it strongly participates to lipotoxicity and systemic metaflammation, both of which have been closely linked to the development of generalized insulin resistance. Besides, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) is an important sex steroids transporters that has been recently proposed as an important metabolic mediator. Therefore, the aim of this study was to verify whether SHBG treatment may ameliorate subcutaneous adipose tissue metabolic failure under EMS condition in terms of lipidome homeostasis, lipid metabolism programs, insulin signalling and local inflammation.Obtained results showcased that SHBG intervention efficiently normalized the altered fatty acids (FAs) profiles by lowering the accumulation of saturated and trans FAs, as well as the pro-inflammatory arachidonic and linoleic acids. Moreover, SHBG showed promising value for the regulation of adipocyte lipolysis and engorgement by lowering the levels of perilipin-1.SHBG exerted moderated effect toward SCD1 and FASN enzymes expression, but increased the LPL abundance. Interestingly, SHBG exhibited a negative regulatory effect on proadipogenic stimulators and induced higher expression of KLF3, IRF3 and β-catenin, known as strong adipogenesis repressors. Finally, SHBG protein showed remarkable ability in restoring the insulin signal transduction, IR/IRS/Pi3K/AKT phosphorylation events and GLUT4 transporter abundance, and further attenuate pro-inflammatory response by lowering IL-6 tissue levels and targeting the PDIA3/ERK axis.Overall, the obtained data clearly demonstrate the benefice of SHBG treatment in the regulation of adipose tissue metabolism in the course of EMS and provide new insights for the development of molecular therapies with potential translational application to human metabolic disorders.

Data on long-term erosion rates are crucial for tracking changes in the stability of a loess mantle and reconstructing the evolution of loess-enriched soils. We used meteoric 10Be to i) define the factors responsible for its distribution along the profile, ii) determine long-term erosion rates in loess-enriched polygenetic soils characterised by illuviation processes, and iii) evaluate initial soil thickness and stability over time. Distribution of meteoric 10Be along the soil profiles was mainly driven by its translocation with clay particles and accumulation in the illuvial horizons. However, in some cases (loess over serpentinite), the highest meteoric 10Be content was measured in the C horizons which may be related to the longer exposure of serpentinite to meteoric 10Be deposition before the occurrence of a major loess accumulation event. The estimated long-term erosion rates greatly depend on the assumed environmental settings and were in the range of about 0.1–3 t ha−1 yr−1. Based on the soil redistribution rates, we reconstructed the removed loess layer which was from a few dm to about 3 m. The results indicate four main soil evolutionary phases: a) pre-exposure of sediments to meteoric 10Be accumulation; b) formation of thick loess mantles during the Last Glacial Maximum; c) erosion events between 21 and 11.6 ka that significantly shallowed the initial loess mantles; d) pedogenesis (with subsoil clay accumulation) in the Holocene within the thinner relicts of the former Late Pleistocene loess mantle followed by a recent and strong erosional phase due to human impact. These phases are also believed to have occurred in several other areas of Central Europe."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491548","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"433","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706123001283/pdfft?md5=63893ddbc99e5cf4fe88efd1fb713265&pid=1-s2.0-S0016706123001283-main.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65ef02464097076263b9ab16","name":"Marcus ","lastName":"Christl","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6c0cedc7-3ac1-428e-90f2-356038d5017a"},{"objectId":"65ef02464097076263b9ab15","name":"Dmitry","lastName":"Tikhomirov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c8ae3dae-4825-4d93-86a5-99c3d8868769"},{"objectId":"65ef02464097076263b9ab14","name":"Martina","lastName":"Vögtli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e6a5cef7-bb90-4b2c-b56b-bbf7ca4b812b"},{"objectId":"65ef02464097076263b9ab13","name":"Markus","lastName":"Egli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7372c787-0990-4526-a72a-b4f9a854b902"},{"objectId":"5ed719637523404d1000e8ca","name":"JOANNA","lastName":"KOWALSKA","uuid":"AB8F919D82AB85AA3476A535E95E4A20444CF4CFA2A7134B9F4759C28AD7BA914FDE86412FECDB45718022748B4EB33C15F3ED3EC0E6116778A059A0B27B68BB","orcidId":"0000-0002-4086-5696","documentHash":"9be08dac-63ca-4700-8150-89fda6085a3c"},{"objectId":"5e709360878c28a0473a8601","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Waroszewski","uuid":"1D8D7BE0C3C4C6E1F0A8D9BE9CDAFD7ABA5968B6661C3A1279786001166DD6CD451A48A4B247E754EE83DD72A5054D3E4253916C5EFE19006EA37C54BF7704B5","orcidId":"0000-0002-3064-4232","documentHash":"8db5b334-1575-4cd7-85c7-ac99a8b0f0b5"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e230","name":"Beata","lastName":"Łabaz","uuid":"8406E6A1ED619554B565A604766930DBE8269EC2E70691DC4AB92928DDA2C86050D1A7E96D2CAAEDB748253E6F5AF122F49418DD379F38741F9A6B619D506E9E","orcidId":"0000-0003-0957-015X","documentHash":"21627ec9-e044-4590-bb43-01fd644e3212"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.geoderma.2023.116451"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["software-defined networks","moving target defense","IP address mutation","Programming-Protocol-Independent Packet Processors (P4) language","cybersecurity"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f2878c28a04739fc58","5e7092f2878c28a04739fca0","5e7093a8878c28a0473ae83e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Implementation of a Lossless Moving Target Defense Mechanism","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bfef","mniswId":"5581","title":"Electronics (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2079-9292","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d24835fa-79e8-41ed-9235-04b77a1dc9bd"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6604076d4097072a77fcc438","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f2878c28a04739fca0","5e7092f2878c28a04739fc58","5e7093a8878c28a0473ae83e"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The contemporary world, dominated by information technologt (IT), necessitates sophisticated protection mechanisms against attacks that pose significant threats to individuals, companies, and governments alike. The unpredictability of human behavior, coupled with the scattered development of applications and devices, complicates supply chain maintenance, making it impossible to develop a system entirely immune to cyberattacks. Effective execution of many attack types hinges on prior network reconnaissance. Thus, hindering effective reconnaissance serves as a countermeasure to attacks. This paper introduces a solution within the moving target defense (MTD) strategies, focusing on the mutation of Internet protocol (IP) addresses in both edge and core network switches. The idea of complicating reconnaissance by continually changing IP addresses has been suggested in numerous studies. Nonetheless, previously proposed solutions have adversely impacted the quality of service (QoS) levels. Implementing these mechanisms could interrupt Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections and result in data losses. The IP address mutation algorithms presented in this study were designed to be fully transparent to transport layer protocols, thereby preserving the QoS for users without degradation. In this study, we leveraged the benefits of software-defined networking (SDN) and the Programming-Protocol-Ondependent Packet Processors (P4) language, which specifies packet processing methodologies in the data plane. Employing both SDN and P4 enables a dynamic customization of network device functionalities to meet network users’ specific requirements, a feat unachievable with conventional computer networks. This approach not only enhances the adaptability of network configurations but also significantly increases the efficiency and effectiveness of network management and operation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491550","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66056c914097073700c12c43","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"cfc62ab6-ec83-47cc-8c6d-c951f3189e94"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"918-1 - 918-24","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/5/918","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093a8878c28a0473ae83e","name":"Marek","lastName":"Michalski","uuid":"F76066EB4B88BBDB5985E64F741DE9A6A7344D2465254932F694166AE81ED9C3B5376FB67F6C3C84D5C047F5A9685EEC54D078DE9EFB2DB3FCD6DE5D2246026D","orcidId":"0000-0002-6951-7222","documentHash":"aa783120-b9b6-4d99-884d-a3218d624d3d"},{"objectId":"5e7092f2878c28a04739fca0","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Żal","uuid":"9E338F462C04CCCB458E08130D99748FD420D66069E24D37D08ADDC18CB0AEA44BC80BDD76BBAFA61F03E9E4288DD95F303CC602AADEBFDCE30ABBBB29E9A541","orcidId":"0000-0002-2579-1502","documentHash":"65274afa-45bf-4167-bad0-33f429e5760f"},{"objectId":"5e7092f2878c28a04739fc58","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Zwierzykowski","uuid":"B751FFBD3F816C42CF4DB732E311A41B6D255E93F6948F2FA04439FCEB59693F99286F55E827AF77CF27350584FB1507F56917C945B626C4A6FE26C2E12E9BD6","orcidId":"0000-0001-5609-1026","documentHash":"c7f1f321-d291-4b81-bbc6-00cb0e31fd16"}],"doi":"10.3390/electronics13050918"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biochar","soil respiration","incubation experiment","CO2 efflux","carbon sequestration"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Biochar and Organic Fertilizer Co-Application Enhances Soil Carbon Priming, Increasing CO2 Fluxes in Two Contrasting Arable Soils","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1944","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-10-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65ef028d4097076263b9accb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602f416a9543c7410626f26f","5e70920d878c28a04738f2d8","5e709273878c28a047395e16"]},"issue":"21","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Biochar soil amendments, along with non-tillage agriculture, are often proposed as a strategy for carbon sequestration. It is still questionable how the quality of biochar might influence the priming effect on soil organic matter and whether the addition of unprocessed organic amendments will affect biochar stability. In the study, six different biochars and three exogenous organic matter sources were added to two distinct arable soils. CO2 emission was monitored for 100 days of incubation and CO2 flux was estimated. Results showed that biochar increased soil CO2 fluxes. The highest peaks, up to 162 µg C-CO2 h−1 100 g−1, were recorded in treatments with food waste biochars, suggesting that they serve as a source of easily available carbon to soil microbes. Co-application of raw organic materials (manure and fresh clover biomass) enhanced CO2 emission and carbon losses, especially in sandy soil, where 0.85–1.1% of total carbon was lost in the short-term experiment. Biochar properties and content of labile C can stimulate CO2 emission; however, in a long-term period, this contribution is negligible. The findings of our study showed that more attention should be paid to priming effects caused by the addition of exogenous organic matter when applied to biochar-amended soils."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491551","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/21/6950","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602f416a9543c7410626f26f","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Bednik","uuid":"92DF00E1F2269614A0C8F80C4AC2D21E3896D987609F7D59EF43053262433B33F80C4B7C2C02205028C9D5A62A051027E8B5A8A88318C2356DD21D19B71B6836","orcidId":"0000-0003-3209-9044","documentHash":"e024b1f9-9aee-4b21-8d5c-55e22c1c692f"},{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395e16","name":"Irmina","lastName":"Ćwieląg-Piasecka","uuid":"43C5D2F1403E89BC1E2A2FFD8D9CF926297DFE440A815E8F4067C9EEAC68B599C1C1F087EAB79F04562BD68267552B7B645D10D67F873CFA52279968B58C0E8E","orcidId":"0000-0002-1439-0295","documentHash":"012e17ed-1e55-40dd-bf24-1f024cf81c58"},{"objectId":"5e70920d878c28a04738f2d8","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Medyńska-Juraszek","uuid":"A97CAD4C33290C92643BF27D1123970777A0D8E5397A8E4A6B73B39C75293098728F6313E70FFFDDC36A00239FF1AC0E735274DD97063B766B39B3313691A4DC","orcidId":"0000-0002-9891-2600","documentHash":"ce4f4572-f246-4666-b3e0-c6d43ca7d7fd"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma16216950"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Towarzystwo Ziemi Kozielskie","Kędzierzyn-Koźle","animacja","pogranicze etniczne i kulturowe","kapitał miejski"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Society of Koźle Land.

Cereal cultivation dominates in Poland; hence, the search for high-value plants will also consider this group of plants. The aim of the study was to compare the nutritional value of proteins from two wheat cultivars. A field experiment conducted in Zawidowice in south-western Poland in 2019 investigated the nutritional values of two winter wheat cultivars: Aurelius and Activus. These two cultivars were compared in terms of their chemical composition, the biological value of their proteins for animal nutrition, and the content of macro- and microelements. Significant differences in chemical composition were found between the tested wheat cultivars. In terms of the chemical composition, i.e. the content of protein, fiber and ash, the Activus cultivar was characterized by significantly better parameters. This cultivar also had significantly higher gross energy. In turn, a significantly higher content of essential amino acids, i.e. lysine, cysteine, tryptophan, histidine, leucine, ioleucine, and valine, was found in the Aurelius cultivar; therefore, the indicators determining the biological value of the protein are more favorable in the Aurelius cultivars. Meanwhile, in terms of selected macro- and microelements the Auerlius cultivar was more valuable. Varietal progress is necessary to obtain cultivars with the essential nutrients needed by animals to satisfy their dietary requirements."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491565","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-53094-0","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65ef02124097076263b9a816","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Jarki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"faedbf18-ad01-45a1-8639-889b8caf0373"},{"objectId":"65ef02124097076263b9a815","name":"Zygmunt","lastName":"Król","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"047bd53a-0fe3-4a78-ae9e-bb705fe6261f"},{"objectId":"65ef02124097076263b9a814","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kamińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"acb45c47-0282-4b78-b590-c9b9e1e4f7af"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afb16","name":"Anna","lastName":"Jama-Rodzeńska","uuid":"8002BC07F2A013019537A281727B4A291FE31A6A15105BC9F365306065BE1F803C9C4D013A95F3479FE2B0F11F2137F74F3D2068239B8FCD47FA3CB1F360C130","orcidId":"0000-0003-4864-7367","documentHash":"32b52328-1061-4c77-b9d8-95f96f08d1b2"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e228","name":"Bernard","lastName":"Gałka","uuid":"5E2A5F4AA394E950F11AD135B1675D9B1216ABCFA372C2AEE9857611C54DA3A30C8C0AD88AE46B3390A6A3CB66320C15F7D433CB9E31956947BA1442CC47210A","orcidId":"0000-0002-4555-9460","documentHash":"945419ac-d0b9-40bb-b799-13f69f32eabc"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e1f8","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szuba-Trznadel","uuid":"9A5D49146F50C5F295025697842BBE5FF96FD1F967E2B0D496CDE8F138A50474D2016C18A5CCEBCBD4DA13D9DA1B9701472EF2581E9C93176382ACAA3D902A6E","orcidId":"0000-0002-4304-667X","documentHash":"c07b74a1-7166-4ef7-8c9f-25accd7e34eb"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e1ef","name":"Bogusław","lastName":"Fuchs","uuid":"3B4E64C29ADD36F36A52A4236CFA0B3D74D21B7012B1503C44C474E00761E9BA8E034E24237EAE0B652863D49D83CFBD5089196E9CCE96601ED279E9429B2072","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"03bd5b9f-7c96-4bab-9a4d-7074de261d81"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-024-53094-0"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63aecfbe409707743b316165","doi":null,"title":"Przywódcy

However, the mechanical and tribological qualities of an additively manufactured (AMed) parts are distinct from those of a conventionally made components because of the layer-by-layer nature of AM process. However, there is a need to machine these complex geometries of AMed components to achieve the desired final dimension and surface finish. Therefore, this study investigates the impact of four environmental regimes (dry, flood, MQL, and N-MQL) on the metal cutting of AMed 316L stainless steel specimen, with a focus on the efficacy of N-MQL lubrication containing rice bran oil + carbon dots (CDs) particles. Responses measured include cutting temperature, surface roughness (Ra), tool wear, microstructure, and micro-hardness.

Rye straw hydrolysate, a possible renewable carbon source for bioconversion, contains a large amount of xylose, inaccessible to the wild-type Yarrowia lipolytica strains. Although these oleaginous yeasts possesses all crucial genes for xylose utilization, it is necessary to induce their metabolic pathway for efficient growth on xylose and mixed sugars from agricultural wastes. Either way, biotechnological production of single cell oils (SCO) from lignocellulosic hydrolysate requires yeast genome modification or adaptation to a suboptimal environment.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nThe presented Y. lipolytica strain was developed using minimal genome modification—overexpression of endogenous xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) and xylulose kinase (XK) genes was sufficient to allow yeast to grow on xylose as a sole carbon source. Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGA1) expression remained stable and provided lipid overproduction. Obtained an engineered Y. lipolytica strain produced 5.51 g/L biomass and 2.19 g/L lipids from nitrogen-supplemented rye straw hydrolysate, which represents an increase of 64% and an almost 10 times higher level, respectively, compared to the wild type (WT) strain. Glucose and xylose were depleted after 120 h of fermentation. No increase in byproducts such as xylitol was observed.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nXylose-rich rye straw hydrolysate was exploited efficiently for the benefit of production of lipids. This study indicates that it is possible to fine-tune a newly strain with as minimally genetic changes as possible by adjusting to an unfavorable environment, thus limiting multi-level genome modification. It is documented here the use of Y. lipolytica as a microbial cell factory for lipid synthesis from rye straw hydrolysate as a low-cost feedstock."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491571","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"21","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://microbialcellfactories.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12934-022-01951-w","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eeff7c4097076263b9a449","name":"Adam","lastName":"Dobrowolski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b9685942-93b6-4e4e-9add-a9134612506e"},{"objectId":"65eeff7c4097076263b9a448","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Drzymała‑Kapinos","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"50f9950e-a371-43cd-baf1-741009b1ff7d"},{"objectId":"5e709264878c28a047394d6c","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Mirończuk","uuid":"BBD29AA5F10D4C75BBF8851819B28F942A07BB17B76DF6DE23A0ED0A705F0309EE3E2F0FABFF7A3E914C54B961373680F3AE8EEBA5C9496F584D07C1E0F03F22","orcidId":"0000-0003-1604-1635","documentHash":"4db0740d-2359-422c-b893-0f664a4b3cdf"}],"doi":"10.1186/s12934-022-01951-w"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Effect of struvite (Crystal Green) fertilization on soil element content determined by different methods under soybean cultivation","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":null,"issn":"2045-2322","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-05","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eef81d4097076263b9805d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afb16","5e7091fc878c28a04738e228","5e7091fc878c28a04738e1f8","65eef81d4097076263b9805e","5e70926c878c28a04739561b"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Struvite is regarded as a promising phosphorus fertilizer alternative to mineral fertilizers; however before fertilizing, soil tests should be undertaken to determine fertilizer recommendations. In May 2022, soil was sampled from a pot experiment with the application of phosphorus set up at the Wroclaw University and Environmental and Life Sciences. Chemical analysis of the soil included total and available phosphorus, potassium, magnesium determined by the Egner–Riehm, Mehlich 3 and Yanai methods. The purpose of the article is to compare soil element extraction by three different methods under struvite fertilization and its use in soybean cultivation. The application of these methods indicated an unambiguous increase in soil Mg content after struvite application. Broadcast soybean fertilization affected the phosphorus content of the soil. The results of the study indicated that different extraction methods presented different contents of P from soil. The content of available phosphorus was circa 122–156 mg kg−1 dm, 35.4–67.5 mg kg−1 dm and 100–159 mg kg−1 dm according to the Mehlich, Yanai and Egner–Riehm methods, respectively. A positive correlation was found between the content of Mg and K in soil determined by the Mehlich 3 and Yanai methods, which may suggest that the Yanai method could be introduced into standard soil chemical analysis in Poland. Such a correlation was not found for phosphorus, which is a difficult element to determine due to the multitude of factors affecting its availability."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491573","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-39753-8","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eef81d4097076263b9805e","name":"Anita","lastName":"Jandy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8dc7b53c-e744-4d58-ba30-e315dd34f9b7"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afb16","name":"Anna","lastName":"Jama-Rodzeńska","uuid":"8002BC07F2A013019537A281727B4A291FE31A6A15105BC9F365306065BE1F803C9C4D013A95F3479FE2B0F11F2137F74F3D2068239B8FCD47FA3CB1F360C130","orcidId":"0000-0003-4864-7367","documentHash":"32b52328-1061-4c77-b9d8-95f96f08d1b2"},{"objectId":"5e70926c878c28a04739561b","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kamińska","uuid":"5A70E258F9F5FA2B07F93EA9475B02767969BC89ECF6A6D78157072CF98164274312F7EAEC7474D1A92BE64A78C556F34A874AB247652C65DF10C254537347FD","orcidId":"0000-0002-0157-516X","documentHash":"2af9ad30-5d34-4eca-b8c6-bc228fa35bd1"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e228","name":"Bernard","lastName":"Gałka","uuid":"5E2A5F4AA394E950F11AD135B1675D9B1216ABCFA372C2AEE9857611C54DA3A30C8C0AD88AE46B3390A6A3CB66320C15F7D433CB9E31956947BA1442CC47210A","orcidId":"0000-0002-4555-9460","documentHash":"945419ac-d0b9-40bb-b799-13f69f32eabc"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e1f8","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szuba-Trznadel","uuid":"9A5D49146F50C5F295025697842BBE5FF96FD1F967E2B0D496CDE8F138A50474D2016C18A5CCEBCBD4DA13D9DA1B9701472EF2581E9C93176382ACAA3D902A6E","orcidId":"0000-0002-4304-667X","documentHash":"c07b74a1-7166-4ef7-8c9f-25accd7e34eb"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-39753-8"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"649bec644097071386c3b03e","doi":null,"title":"Powiat strzelecki od kuchni","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"9788393710546","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://repo.uni.opole.pl/info/book/UO568ccf4e46fe46ceb1a110488eeb147d/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"6b82c754-f0b0-4f92-9d9a-fcc3d039ab66","publisher":{"objectId":"5e711d6946e0fb0001bf9808","mniswId":null,"name":"Powiat Strzelecki","documentHash":"41675ef1-f9a0-4659-9a51-1232a4c58f09"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Na świątecznym stole","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6602c1a64097076263255798","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709262878c28a047394bca"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059491576","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"19-36","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://repo.uni.opole.pl/info/article/UO0a33c1a6c7404fab8d6b1c95ea020ddd/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709262878c28a047394bca","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Świtała-Trybek","uuid":"A6C5CCCE73C51E45CE8E0AD3185BBF78E2A3C1F539922EB3220E37122791EFC61D5BE60CC1372684260EB3535F91448574743A2F0541C822F7BEA0A6496F21CC","orcidId":"0000-0001-8525-5800","documentHash":"95274026-9a27-4b61-8d39-d251af011c41"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-231-5081-7","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[],"type":"BOOK","title":"Rozum w społeczeństwie / George Santayana ; przekł. i oprac.

This concept may shed new light on the role of personality traits in shaping vulnerability to the internalized stigma.\n\nAim\nIn this paper we propose a novel approach to clarifying the underpinning of self-stigma by empirically exploring its links with TP.\n\nMethod\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study among 86 patients with ICD-10 diagnoses of paranoid schizophrenia to validate the predictive role of TP for self-stigma. We used the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI), Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness scale (ISMI) and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS).\n\nResults\nWe found significant positive correlations of self-stigma with Past-Negative, Future-Negative and Present-Fatalistic TP categories and negative correlation with the Future-Positive category. The hierarchical regression analyses revealed that two TP categories and Deviation from the Balanced Time Perspective (DBTP) are significant predictors of self-stigma over and above sociodemographic and clinical control variables. Conclusion. The results of the study confirm the hypothesis that TP opens new possibilities to understand proneness or resistance to self-stigmatization, and this may provide a basis for novel approaches to anti-self-stigma interventions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491582","journalIssue":{"objectId":"660319104097071d5ba92a01","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"33","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"5d0214ce-93c7-46d1-8dd3-e5dc0a21331b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"33","pagesFromTo":"48-56","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09638237.2023.2182413","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093f3878c28a0473b3d74","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Świtaj","uuid":"7AB9BC0E57E11A12A10A1B5177DC3910E32F737477EA0EE997112CFDAA9942E5B5E2B92D58BB753BC3F4B1318C7680872469F94944791ED9D2575035D919BFF0","orcidId":"0000-0002-0805-6696","documentHash":"872053cf-18b7-4de6-a65b-b30d9c4cf4b5"},{"objectId":"5e70935b878c28a0473a7e02","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Styła","uuid":"602FA351F601FF45482E589F0A9DC4C5CD23C9766723A0E4FFA3F6499E0A33DA81CCB5CFB44420280465DA1FB73EC33D89FA3FCA6A58A521F58C62C1E260FB05","orcidId":"0000-0002-3792-8473","documentHash":"0800525d-2a6f-455a-bce7-4f75298fcb8f"}],"doi":"10.1080/09638237.2023.2182413"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Diospyros kaki L.","smoothies","storage","polyphenols","antioxidant activity","digestive enzymes inhibition","LC-PDA/MS QTof","sensory evaluation"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Investigation into Polyphenol Profile and Biological Activities of Enriched Persimmon/Apple Smoothies during Storage","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"Foods","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2304-8158","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"0f59a8f0-a1f9-45c0-ba10-cec780ad3d19"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65ef04924097076263ba14e1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65ef04924097076263ba14e2","5e709442878c28a0473b90dd","5e7091fc878c28a04738e1ce","65ef04924097076263ba14e3"]},"issue":"17","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Smoothies are becoming an increasingly popular product as a healthy alternative to snacks. The consumer expects from this product that, apart from its nutritional value, it will also be qualitatively stable during storage. Therefore, in this study, original smoothies obtained with persimmon fruit puree and apple juice (Dk/Md) enriched with Arbutus unedo fruits, Myrtus communis purple berry extract, Acca sellowiana, and Crocus sativus petal juice were evaluated for their polyphenol composition, antioxidant activity, and inhibition on targeted digestive enzymes, over six months of storage. The amount of polyphenols evaluated by UPLC-PDA analysis decreased in six months from 23.5% for both Dk/Md and enriched C. sativus smoothies to 42.5% for enriched A. sellowiana, with anthocyanins the most sensitive compounds (71.7–100% loss). Values of antioxidant assays generally strongly decreased during the first three months (up to ca. 60%) and to a lesser extent in the following three months (0.4–27%). In addition, inhibitory activity on α-amylase, α-glucosidase, and pancreatic lipase, especially on the last two enzymes, was negatively affected by time storage. The outcome of this study indicates that persimmon fruit is a good option for producing smoothies, and enrichment with other plant extracts can enhance the bioactive compound content and biological activities. It is recommended that appropriate storage strategies to preserve the properties of those smoothies should be developed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491584","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/12/17/3248","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65ef04924097076263ba14e3","name":"Carlo Ignazio Giovanni","lastName":"Tuberoso","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6cd52435-36b3-43c2-bb84-b9882e3d67a0"},{"objectId":"65ef04924097076263ba14e2","name":"Katarzyna Angelika","lastName":"Gil","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ddf444aa-40f3-4bae-9bf0-325719bd3ea8"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b90dd","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Nowicka","uuid":"A244E3A036793F004ACE1AD9E1267EC463319890D94572D24C340C4ABF9475E27123DBDE16E8AE25D915621EE7F16CF52617C13C87C9227C72CAFBD322458713","orcidId":"0000-0002-5626-2662","documentHash":"ac25e6fd-100a-4b3f-ae53-aaea38a9a430"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e1ce","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Wojdyło","uuid":"3E72B08EFFB25D8106E40216DB78BF696707F6EDA6C9042BCA6ED9627EA6ADF52B9A2A81A2C6B39C651708CBBFCE6781F908681B427D7B46D9B1589104274C9F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0067-0691","documentHash":"85c64c3f-00c4-4dc9-907b-320284537df8"}],"doi":"10.3390/foods12173248"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["attachment","COVID-19","glorification","trust in government","trust in science"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df20","uid":"bMvn9i-Wb4qNqQKvtk7hgiw","uuid":"c6e84f2a-bbff-4e0b-8fd5-dc507baff821","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Psychologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935b878c28a0473a7e92"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The distinct associations of ingroup attachment and glorification with responses to the coronavirus pandemic: Evidence from a multilevel investigation in 21 countries","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477474","mniswId":"2861","title":"BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY","doi":null,"issn":"0144-6665","eissn":"2044-8309","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"18d9f595-f366-4ade-9592-e555d67f4c30"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8d2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8d4","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8d5","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8d6","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8d7","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8d8","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8d9","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8da","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8db","5e70935b878c28a0473a7e92","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8dc","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8dd","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8de","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8df","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8e0","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8e1","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8e2","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8e3","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8e4","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8e5","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8e6","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8e7","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8e8","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8e9","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8ea","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8eb","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8ec","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8ed","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8ee","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8ef","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8f0","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8f1","6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8f2"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"While public health crises such as the coronavirus pandemic transcend national borders, practical efforts to combat them are often instantiated at the national level. Thus, national group identities may play key roles in shaping compliance with and support for preventative measures (e.g., hygiene and lockdowns). Using data from 25,159 participants across representative samples from 21 nations, we investigated how different modalities of ingroup identification (attachment and glorification) are linked with reactions to the coronavirus pandemic (compliance and support for lockdown restrictions). We also examined the extent to which the associations of attachment and glorification with responses to the coronavirus pandemic are mediated through trust in information about the coronavirus pandemic from scientific and government sources. Multilevel models suggested that attachment, but not glorification, was associated with increased trust in science and compliance with federal COVID-19 guidelines. However, while both attachment and glorification were associated with trust in government and support for lockdown restrictions, glorification was more strongly associated with trust in government information than attachment. These results suggest that both attachment and glorification can be useful for promoting public health, although glorification's role, while potentially stronger, is restricted to pathways through trust in government information."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491585","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6602b9584097071d5ba4aa83","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"62","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"6aeac00e-03c4-4e04-81d1-6a55b84b7c24"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"62","pagesFromTo":"992-1012","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bjso.12614","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6602b93b4097071d5ba4a8f2","name":"Rizqy

Ojciec Święty Grzegorz XV ustanowił Kongregację Rozkrzewiania Wiary (Congregatio de Propaganda Fide). Główną intencją papieża było wyjęcie działalności misyjnej Kościoła spod jurysdykcji mocarstw kolonialnych – Hiszpanii i Portugalii – i oddanie jej pod wyłączny patronat Stolicy Apostolskiej. W artykule postawiono pytanie o stosunek kongregacji do dialogu międzyreligijnego. By uniknąć anachronizmu, zwrócono wpierw uwagę na historię relacji chrześcijaństwa do religii niechrześcijańskich. Tradycyjna doktryna Kościoła w tej materii opierała się na utrzymanej w duchu chrześcijańskiego ekskluzywizmu interpretacji zasady extra Ecclesiam salus nulla, którą zapoczątkował Fulgencjusz z Ruspe. Na pozytywną ocenę działalności Kongregacji Rozkrzewiania Wiary zasługują przede wszystkim orzeczenia wydane w kontekście akomodacji misyjnej w XVII w. (M. Ricci, R. de Nobili i in.). W Instrukcji dla Wikariuszy Apostolskich, udających się do prowincji chińskich: Tonkinu i Kochinchiny (1659 r.) podano wyjątkowe – jak na owe czasy – zasady postępowania, w których zalecało się, by nie zmuszano ludności tubylczej do zmiany ich obyczajów, jeśli nie są one sprzeczne z religią lub moralnością chrześcijańską. Niestety, ukształtowane w tym duchu nowatorskie metody prowadzenia dialogu międzyreligijnego nie znalazły w tamtym czasie zrozumienia, czego wyrazem były akty potępiające tzw. ryty chińskie i obrzędy malabarskie. Na zmianę nastawienia Stolicy Apostolskiej, w tym Kongregacji Rozkrzewiania Wiary, do rodzimych obrzędów mieszkańców Dalekiego Wschodu trzeba było czekać aż do połowy XX w. W 1988 r. Congregatio de Propaganda Fide została przekształcona w Congregatio pro Gentium Evangelizatione. Wydany przez Papieską Radę ds. Dialogu Międzyreligijnego i Kongregację ds. Ewangelizacji Narodów dokument Dialog i przepowiadanie uważany jest za pierwszą oficjalną wypowiedź Kościoła katolickiego, traktującą dialog z religiami niechrześcijańskim w sposób integralny i wszechstronny."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"6 January 1622. Gregory XV established the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (Sacra Congregatio de Propaganda Fide). The pope’s main intention was to take the Church’s missionary activity out of the jurisdiction of the colonial powers – Spain and Portugal – and place it under the exclusive patronage of the Holy See. The article raises the question of the Congregation’s attitude to interreligious dialogue. To avoid anachronism, attention was first drawn to the history of the relationship of Christianity to non-Christian religions. The traditional doctrine of the Church in this matter was based on an interpretation of the principle extra Ecclesiam salus nulla, which was maintained in the spirit of Christian exclusivism and pioneered by Fulgentius of Ruspe. Above all, the judgements made in the context of missionary accommodation in the 17th century (M. Ricci, R. de Nobili et al.) deserve a positive assessment of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith’s activities. The Instruction to the Apostolic Vicars going to the Chinese provinces of Tonkin and Cochinchina (1659) gave rules of conduct unique for the time, recommending that indigenous peoples should not be forced to change their customs if they were not contrary to Christian religion or morals. Unfortunately, the innovative methods of interreligious dialogue shaped in this spirit were not understood at the time, as demonstrated by the acts condemning the so-called Chinese rites and Malabar rites. It took until the middle of the 20th century for the Holy See, including the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, to change its attitude towards the indigenous rites of the inhabitants of the Far East. In 1988, the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide was transformed into the Congregatio pro Gentium Evangelizatione. Published by the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue and the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, the document Dialogue and Preaching is considered the first official statement of the Catholic Church treating dialogue with non-Christian religions in an integral and comprehensive manner.

The impact of supply chain flexibility is important because although SMEs are inherently more flexible than large firms, allowing them to respond more quickly to changing customer needs and environmental conditions, they seek to build their advantage on relational resources due to their limited financial and human resources. However, previous research suggests that maintaining relationship quality is costly and not always cost-effective. This raises the question of whether relationship quality affects SME performance per se or whether it has an indirect effect through supply chain flexibility. The purpose of this article is to examine the role that supply chain flexibility plays in the connection between relationship quality and SME performance.\r\n\r\nMethods: Combining relationship quality with SME performance, we analysed how supply chain flexibility moderates this association. Data collected from 1286 Polish SMEs using the CAPI method were analysed using SEM modelling.\r\n\r\nResults: The results confirm the direct impact of relationship quality on both supply chain flexibility and SME performance. The study also provides empirical evidence that supply chain flexibility moderates the impact of relationship quality on SME performance and that this impact is stronger than the direct impact of relationship quality on SME performance.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Our findings have important implications for SME managers, providing arguments for the desirability of managing relationship quality in conjunction with supply chain flexibility. While previous research suggests that relationship quality is important for SMEs because it can be treated as a substitute for limited tangible assets as well as financial, infrastructural and human resources, our research has demonstrated the desirability of building relationship quality in conjunction with supply chain flexibility, which seems to be an important insight given the limited resources of SMEs."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491594","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"20","pagesFromTo":"71-80","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.logforum.net/volume20/issue1/abstract-6.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6603ec5440970762632d1cab","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Glabiszewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5e2885c5-c8f2-4d52-b2f9-ca76196d9705"},{"objectId":"6603ec5440970762632d1caa","name":"Witold","lastName":"Szumowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5cc65d95-9bbe-4175-bd3e-46a01311b53a"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393a48","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Cyfert","uuid":"6F791AF6158E004F97A03C8C87CCC64818C5BCAF410BF2B1362655C6E239422C127B5C0A8919042FDC982F30D4CBAB4ECBD98DB75735DA23308679B7C769C07A","orcidId":"0000-0002-5563-1403","documentHash":"8cb5a289-e87f-46d8-a29f-46e5837f81d2"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cat spermatozoa","CASMA","sperm head morphometry","fertility","sperm subpopulations","sperm heterogeneity"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Feline sperm head morphometry in relation to male pedigree and fertility","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479934","mniswId":"19490","title":"Theriogenology","doi":null,"issn":"0093-691X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"036c4053-f54b-4683-b63b-a8e5010618ba"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-06-11","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eefeb74097076263b99f22","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709440878c28a0473b8ec7","65eefeb74097076263b99f23","65eefeb74097076263b99f24","5e709236878c28a047391bac"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Computer-assisted sperm morphometry analysis is an advanced tool which allows to precise measure sperm head parameters like length, width, area, and perimeter. On the basis of these and calculated parameters, morphometric subpopulations of spermatozoa can be distinguished. In many species, the distribution of subpopulation within the ejaculate is related to male fertility. There is no information about such a relation for domestic cats; therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether spermatozoa from non-pedigree and purebred domestic cats differ in morphometric parameters. The second aim was to check if there is a relationship between sperm morphometry and fertility. Urethral semen was collected from 27 tomcats, divided into three study groups: non-pedigree cats of unknown fertility, purebred infertile cats and purebred fertile cats. The morphometric assessment was performed by CASMA, followed by principal component analysis and clustering. The results revealed huge intra- and inter-individual variation in sperm head morphometric parameters and three sperm-head morphometric subpopulations were identified in feline semen. Neither mean values of morphometric parameters nor the distribution of spermatozoa between morphometric subpopulations differ between non-pedigree cats of unknown fertility and purebred infertile and fertile cats.

This study was conducted over 6 years (2017–2022) in a facility with a capacity of 4.5 m3/day located in southeastern Poland and designed to treat real domestic wastewater from a school building. The studied facility consists of a three-chambered septic tank, a pumping station with an aeration system, and two beds with vertical and horizontal flow planted with giant miscanthus and willow. As a result of artificial aeration, the dissolved oxygen concentration in wastewater after mechanical treatment increased significantly, by an average of 1.18 mg O2/L, and was negatively correlated with wastewater temperature. The cumulative pollutant removal effects of the treatment plant (primary settling tank + VFCW + HFCW) were 81% for TSS, 98% for BOD5, and 89% for COD. There was no statistically significant effect of aeration on the organic pollutant removal effects in the VF bed, and such an effect was found for the temperature of wastewater entering the VF bed.

Niektóre branże zostały bardziej dotknięte, a inne tylko\r\nnieznacznie. Szczególnie interesująca była sytuacja agrobiznesu ze względu na jego kluczową rolę\r\nw życiu społeczno-gospodarczym. Celem publikacji jest ocena kondycji ekonomiczno-finansowej\r\ngospodarstw rolnych w Polsce i Czechach w czasie pandemii COVID-19. Okres badania obejmował\r\nlata 2017–2021. Kondycję ekonomiczno-finansową ustalono na podstawie następujących wielkości\r\ni wartości wskaźników: produkcja globalna, ceny produktów i środków produkcji, wolumen eksportu\r\noraz importu, wskaźnik produktywności, rentowności i zadłużenia. Analiza obejmuje dane ze statystyk\r\nkrajowych oraz systemu rachunkowości rolnej FADN i dotyczy dwóch wymienionych wyżej krajów\r\nUnii Europejskiej (UE). Dla ukazania zmian wykorzystano indeksy łańcuchowe, natomiast analiza\r\nfinansowa obejmuje wskaźniki produktywności, rentowności i zadłużenia. Obliczenia przeprowadzono\r\ndla średnich wartości gospodarstw, jak i w podziale na klasy wielkości ekonomicznej. Wyniki wskazują, że sektor rolny nie był szczególnie podatny na pandemię COVID-19 w zakresie zmian produkcji,\r\nna którą wpływ miały głównie czynniki pogodowe. Skutkował natomiast wyższymi cenami surowców\r\nrolnych i środków produkcji (nawozów, paliw, pasz) w 2021 roku. W Polsce dynamika wzrostu cen\r\nproduktów sprzedanych przewyższała dynamikę wzrostu cen środków produkcji, w Czechach relacje te\r\nbyły odwrotne, co przełożyło się na wartości wskaźników finansowych. Generalnie poprawiły się one\r\nw Polsce, podczas gdy w Czechach rok 2021 okazał się mniej korzystny pod względem finansowym.\r\nPorównując różne klasy ekonomiczne, w Polsce wyniki dla małych gospodarstw były stosunkowo\r\nkorzystne, z kolei w Czechach większe podmioty poradziły sobie lepiej w warunkach kryzysu."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the functioning of the entire economy. However, the strength of the impact was not uniform across sectors, with some affected more severely and others only slightly. Due to its importance, agribusiness is of particular interest. Therefore, the aim of the publication is to assess the economic and financial condition of farms in Poland and Czechia during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study covered the 2017–2021 period. The economic and financial condition was established on the basis of the following volumes and values of indicators: total output, prices of products and inputs, export and import volumes, productivity, profitability and debt ratios. The study includes data from national statistics and the FADN agricultural accounting system and concerns two EU countries, mentioned above. Chain indices were used to show trends, while the financial analysis includes selected productivity, profitability, and debt ratios. Calculations were carried out for average values of farms and divided into economic size classes. The results indicate that the agricultural sector was not particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic crisis in terms of changes in output, which was mainly influenced by weather factors. What did change were the higher prices of agricultural raw materials and inputs (fertilizers, fuels, feed) in 2021. In Poland the growth dynamics of the prices of sold products surpassed that of inputs, in Czechia the proportions were reversed. This translated into the values of financial indicators. In general, they improved in Poland, while in Czechia 2021 turned out to be less favourable financially. Comparing different economic classes, in Poland the results for small farms were relatively good, in Czechia the larger entities fared better under the crisis conditions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491600","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"378","pagesFromTo":"30-49","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"pol","title":"Kondycja ekonomiczno-finansowa gospodarstw rolnych w Polsce i Czechach w warunkach pandemii COVID-19"}],"publicUri":"http://www.zer.waw.pl/KONDYCJA-EKONOMICZNO-FINANSOWA-GOSPODARSTW-ROLNYCH-W-POLSCE-I-CZECHACH-W-WARUNKACH,181138,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6603ed9640970762632d1cce","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Tošović-Stevanović","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ba2205e9-8f9b-482c-a5eb-ad7ceee309dc"},{"objectId":"6603ed9640970762632d1ccd","name":"Ivo","lastName":"Zdráhal","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dd91ccb0-2f28-45aa-a8f2-011ad5895950"},{"objectId":"6603ed9640970762632d1ccc","name":"Eliška","lastName":"Svobodová","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ac9983c2-124d-4cb4-93bb-14d335fb714c"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473afeee","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Smędzik-Ambroży","uuid":"03894FE9E19BFBBE8323183E839A69C26BA42D6C12543E35250392BD387487596CA9327DE2B607001DD6429F1060165453BE30887E54B0E91AF722EA8C74176B","orcidId":"0000-0001-5228-2263","documentHash":"922abe5a-8bc4-41fd-b73d-b42e35e5ee5c"},{"objectId":"5e709245878c28a047392cf6","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Stępień","uuid":"3474945B3C5F405E2A0973289C602E8E4BEDA7DC9D53C9A8F6E90484AA7D435D4F31A650BEFEA7DC3452CD9A4B0B637EB1E5778570A8774E1746E9E53038DAA2","orcidId":"0000-0001-9475-8418","documentHash":"3623994a-3f67-44cb-abdb-cae0b4d3323c"}],"doi":"10.30858/zer/181138"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"64c3d0b640970724338342c4","doi":null,"title":"Urząd do spraw wyznań.

Total genomic DNA was isolated from hairs with bulbs of 145 individuals captured between 2018 and 2020. All dormice sampled were genotyped at 14 microsatellite loci. Population genetic analyses showed that genetic variability in the studied dormice, assessed based on observed and expected heterozygosity as well as allelic richness, was on average very low (0.39, 0.43, and 2.83, respectively). In the populations studied, genetic structure was detected indicating two or five distinct genetic clusters, the existence of which can be attributed to either historical factors or modern human activity. Genetic differentiation between dormice living in the studied localities, determined by FST, ranged from 0.07 to 0.40 (all FST coefficients were significant at P < 0.05). A significant positive correlation was detected between genetic differentiation and geographic distance (r = 0.645, P < 0.017), indicating that genetic differentiation increases with distance, but no correlation between genetic differentiation and habitat barriers (r = 0.359, P < 0.132).

Therefore, in order to find out whether PA in VR can be an attractive alternative towards the PA in a real world, the research should be undertaken to verify if the state of satisfaction and flow involved in the practising certain PA in the VR environment could be higher comparing to the levels of pleasure and flow connected with the same PA carried out in the real world.\nObjective\n\nThe main objective of the study was to assess the level of satisfaction and flow experienced by healthy adults during various cycling conditions: real life (RL), non-immersive and immersive virtual reality (nIVR and IVR). Additionally, questionnaires for assessing satisfaction with PA and flow in RL and VR were also validated in terms of their measurement reliability. The correlation of the results obtained during tests using both measurement tools was also assessed.\nMethods\n\nForty students were studied, including 20 women (age 22.35 ± 2.32 years) and 20 men (age 22.95 ± 2.19 years). The Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale (PACES) was used to evaluate the enjoyment of cycling. Flow state was assessed using The Flow State Scale (FSS).\nResults\n\nBased on Friedman’s analysis of variance regarding the results obtained for all the respondents, it can be concluded that the conditions of cycling significantly affect their level of satisfaction (χ2 = 85.61(40;3); p < 0.001) and flow (χ2 = 40.52(40;3); p < 0.001). The research participants rated cycling the highest in IVR. Based on the calculated Cronbach's alpha coefficients, high measurement reliability of the questionnaires used in nIVR (PACES, α = 0.94; FFS-2, α = 0.86) and IVR (PACES, α = 0.89; FFS-2, α = 0.91). There was also a significant positive moderate correlation between PA satisfaction and user flow.\nConclusions\n\nThe research is the first attempt to directly compare the sense of satisfaction and flow when practicing cycling in RL and in nIVR and IVR. The greater attractiveness and higher level of flow during PA in IVR compared to a similar traditional form of PA in RL, found on the basis of the conducted research, should prompt reflection by both those involved in planning and promoting PA, as well as the creators of active video games (AVGs). Due to the great attractiveness of PA in IVR and the constant, dynamic development of immersive information technologies, virtual training may, in the near future, become not only an important supplement to conventional forms of exercise, but perhaps even an alternative solution."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491607","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6596901f4097074a3902566c","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"16","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"d1cdb013-368c-4ce1-976b-163b8346d7e5"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://bmcsportsscimedrehabil.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s13102-024-00818-4.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709368878c28a0473a8fb0","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Szczechowicz","uuid":"ACECBC97ED82BACF1EC33554991965F72E8140C51550FB96F6EBA2D26D598976F729E53FE463DAF683D0097D6466AB74FF066F411FB68061927BE9A950AB63A7","orcidId":"0000-0002-9019-9396","documentHash":"b5937145-b324-4c73-b877-e90f5fc029ca"},{"objectId":"5e709309878c28a0473a18cc","name":"Rajmund","lastName":"Tomik","uuid":"BD16585F9E28041BFDF0858214A08DD02D50120BA264BDDDE2AC8345AA1BDAF6EDDFF1718208DC7854A6F12206F079FC97B199B88D476C2145E98AFBEE869FA6","orcidId":"0000-0001-9603-8828","documentHash":"16e94dbe-86fa-4fa5-ba28-da987631cb21"},{"objectId":"5e7092ee878c28a04739f5c7","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Polechoński","uuid":"8BE0195B264D2BCEBCFB6E2C9F0C7F473D4943C2EC3620D4764C250AD3DFC4DE9CFCCA612A76CC2D162B3F4BF71949CE4BBC35E4CD77FFE523EC4351F1AFB80C","orcidId":"0000-0002-3294-7800","documentHash":"48771f2d-ef6b-4aa7-850e-6e577f93efc7"},{"objectId":"5e709243878c28a047392a6a","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Ryśnik","uuid":"1D13F24012BB83BC653A58AD1ACD5BD5836AE713E91F01AC884CB6EF8BBF5E6D08D847DE8E75DC1D486E0624C1D9197D496430005C9130FAAACD33F2076EF001","orcidId":"0000-0001-5994-2922","documentHash":"c194f21f-0556-4598-8deb-baa54da844ae"}],"doi":"10.1186/s13102-024-00818-4"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["implementations of LCA","indicators of CE","Sustainability Development Goals","Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)","Circular Economy (CE)"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70926a878c28a0473954db","5e709431878c28a0473b7f79"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The role of life cycle assessment in the implementation","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775c4","mniswId":"3465","title":"Chemical and Process Engineering - Inżynieria Chemiczna i Procesowa","doi":null,"issn":"0208-6425","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"c04f2d6f-5c00-40ba-8c68-420a89dca1e6"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"JULY","releaseDateYear":2023,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eebb7c4097076263b5edc5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70926a878c28a0473954db","5e709431878c28a0473b7f79"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is an important tool of Circular Economy (CE), which performs the analysis in a closed loop (“cradle-to-cradle”) of any product, process or technology. LCA assesses the environmental threats (climate change, ozone layer depletion, eutrophication, biodiversity loss, etc.), searches for solutions to minimize environmental burdens and together with CE contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emission, counteracts global climate crisis. The CE is a strategy for creating value for the economy, society and business while minimizing resource use and environmental impacts through reducing, re-using and recycling. In contrast, life cycle assessment is a robust and science-based tool to measure the environmental impacts of products, services and business models. Combining both the robustness of the LCA methodology and the principles of circular economy one will get a holistic approach for innovation. After a presentation of the LCA framework and methods used, examples of case studies of comparative LCA analysis for replacement materials to reduce environmental load and their challenges as assessment methods for CE strategies are presented. It was concluded that there is a need for improvement of existing solutions, developing the intersection between the CE and LCA.

In the present paper, carbaryl, carbofuran and metolachlor retention by loamy sand and loam topsoil materials is compared and referred to humic acids (CHA) and the residual carbon (CR) content of SOM. Additionally, the sorption-desorption behavior of agrochemicals in soils was tested at a pH of three to seven. Calculated isothermal parameters point to favorable, spontaneous and physical pesticide sorption. Groundwater ubiquity score (GUS) indexes confirmed the low leaching ability of metolachlor on soils and moderate of carbofuran. The high affinity of carbaryl to CR may explain its pronounced sorption in loam soil and the lowest percolation potential. Carbofuran retention in soils was associated with montmorillonite (Mt) and CR fractions. Meanwhile, metolachlor uptake was related to humic acid and Mt content of the soils. Lower pH enhanced retention of the agrochemicals, except for carbaryl sorption in sandy loam soil. Results of this study highlight that SOM composition and mutual share of individual organic carbon fractions alongside pH may play a crucial role in predicting non-ionic pesticide behavior in soil."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059491612","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"28","pagesFromTo":"1-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/28/14/5552","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395e16","name":"Irmina","lastName":"Ćwieląg-Piasecka","uuid":"43C5D2F1403E89BC1E2A2FFD8D9CF926297DFE440A815E8F4067C9EEAC68B599C1C1F087EAB79F04562BD68267552B7B645D10D67F873CFA52279968B58C0E8E","orcidId":"0000-0002-1439-0295","documentHash":"012e17ed-1e55-40dd-bf24-1f024cf81c58"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules28145552"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA1OTQ5MTYxMg=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
