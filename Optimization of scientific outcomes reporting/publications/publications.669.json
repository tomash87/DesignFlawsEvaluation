(synonym: Piper betel Blanco), or betel vine, an economically and medicinally important cash crop, belongs to the family Piperaceae, often known as the green gold. The plant can be found all over the world and is cultivatedprimarily in South East Asian countries for its beautiful glossy heart-shaped leaves, which are chewed or consumed as betelquidand widely used in Chinese and Indian folk medicine, as carminative, stimulant,astringent, against parasitic worms, conjunctivitis, rheumatism, wound, etc., andis also used for religious purposes. Hydroxychavicol is the most important bioactive compound among the wide range of phytoconstituents found in essential oil and extracts. The pharmacological attributes of P. betle are antiproliferation, anticancer, neuropharmacological, analgesic, antioxidant, antiulcerogenic, hepatoprotective, antifertility, antibacterial, antifungal and many more. Immense attention has been paid to nanoformulations and their applications. The application of P. betle did not show cytotoxicity in preclinical experiments, suggesting that it could serve as a promising therapeutic candidate for different diseases. The present review comprehensively summarizes the botanical description, geographical distribution, economic value and cultivation, ethnobotanical uses, preclinical pharmacological properties with insights of toxicological, clinical efficacy, and safety of P. betle. The findings suggest that P. betle represents an orally active and safe natural agent that exhibits great therapeutic potential for managing various human medical conditions. However, further research is needed to elucidate its underlying molecular mechanisms of action, clinical aspects, structure-activity relationships, bioavailability and synergistic interactions with other drugs."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058839972","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"26","pagesFromTo":"3083-3119","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jcmm.17323","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e82dc9409707626313bb67","name":"Abhijit","lastName":"Dey","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3608532e-8f05-4646-9a74-0e48d87821df"},{"objectId":"65e82dc9409707626313bb66","name":"José

this paper, we draw on our subjective experiences as two female early-career academics during the global COVID-19 pandemic. While we acknowledge that the pandemic had negative implications for many female scholars due to compulsory telework or increased family responsibilities, we also want to shed light on the empowering experiences shaped by collegial support that became an important part of our pandemic story. We build on the theory of liminality to explain how the events triggered by the pandemic allowed us to break out of our uncomfortable occupational limbo (i.e., feeling “locked-in” to the identity of a foreign-born PhD graduate) and, through creating a kind of equality, resulted in some unique opportunities and challenges. During these difficult times, shaped by an increasing fear of us or our family catching COVID-19, we embarked on a betwixt-and-between state that allowed us to grow as academics as a part of a collective."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058839976","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"30","pagesFromTo":"1042 - 1058","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca56cd4097077ac1cfe8b4","name":"Frederike","lastName":"Scholz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5e7ce9e1-628d-4966-ad20-61a78eb94cca"},{"objectId":"615bb8a875234017e04eda55","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Szulc","uuid":"59F92492F39822D9424E6538492886D28FE6CEB243E10D19BF8B3D5571E1A8FA972C6041AE69B953B412F36992AA53F9459CB77A3F7D505EA6CD7E987004A7BE","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8f3cb76e-9598-40ca-bc68-8e1a00492d91"}],"doi":"10.1111/gwao.12969"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Analytical Chemistry","Pharmaceutical Science","Molecular Medicine","Drug Discovery","Physical and Theoretical Chemistry","Chemistry (miscellaneous)","Organic Chemistry"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","uid":"bWyeXRlH0huS_TwqiYk7m5Q","uuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","parentUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","rootUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092c8878c28a04739c82f","607faf189543c73526c48afc","5e7092c8878c28a04739c7e3"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Composition and anti-Helicobacter pylori properties of essential oils obtained from selected Mentha cultivars.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":null,"issn":"1420-3049","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"85ea3d3d-2670-4384-98ee-1b5b44edab21"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-07-27","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca57324097077ac1cfee69","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["607faf189543c73526c48afc","5e7092c8878c28a04739c7e3","673c5f0efdbe832d85c62dcb","5e7092c8878c28a04739c82f"]},"issue":"15","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>Helicobacter pylori infections are highly common amongst the global population. Such infections have been shown to be the cause of gastric ulcers and stomach carcinoma and, unfortunately, most cases are asymptomatic. Standard treatment requires antibiotics such as metronidazole or azithromycin to which many strains are now resistant. Mentha species have been used as a natural treatment for gastrointestinal diseases throughout history and essential oils (EOs) derived from these plants show promising results as potential antimicrobial agents. In this study, EOs obtained from the leaves and flowers of five cultivars of Mentha × piperita and M. spicata were examined by GC-MS. The investigated mints are representatives of four chemotypes: the menthol chemotype (M. × piperita ‘Multimentha’ and M. × piperita ‘Swiss’), the piperitenone oxide chemotype (M. × piperita ‘Almira’), the linalool chemotype (M. × piperita ‘Granada’), and the carvone chemotype (M. spicata ‘Moroccan’). The chemical composition of EOs from mint flowers and leaves was comparable with the exception of the Swiss cultivar. Menthol was the most abundant component in the leaves while menthone was highest in flowers. The H. pylori ATCC 43504 reference strain and 10 other H. pylori clinical strains were examined for their sensitivity to the EOs in addition to their major monoterpenoid components (menthol, menthone, carvone, dihydrocarvone, linalool, 1,8-cineole, and limonene). All tested mint EOs showed inhibitory activity against both the reference H. pylori ATCC 43504 strain (MIC 15.6–31.3 mg/L) and clinical H. pylori strains (MIC50/90 31.3–250 mg/L/62.5–500 mg/L). Among the reference monoterpenes, menthol (MIC50/90 7.8/31.3 mg/L) and carvone (MIC50/90 31.3/62.5 mg/L) had the highest anti-H. pylori activity, which also correlated with a higher activity of EOs containing these compounds (M. × piperita ‘Swiss’ and M. spicata ‘Moroccan’). A synergistic and additive interaction between the most active EOs/compounds and antibiotics possibly points to a new plant-based anti-H. pylori treatment.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058839977","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"28","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/28/15/5690","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"673c5f0efdbe832d85c62dcb","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kiełtyka-Dadasiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ba6be009-206b-4b71-bb54-dd98f2e0200e"},{"objectId":"607faf189543c73526c48afc","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Piasecki","uuid":"17AF56A47955DF0252815EA4B89B40DF4E2501AD08BDA08C88D882D0DFA2B27944CA4D82B437438335840C5A69909E3506A83126BC48737E852EADEFB6E9EC5B","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5e9e4c0b-4c0b-4968-ae4c-4677acfad8a6"},{"objectId":"5e7092c8878c28a04739c82f","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Ludwiczuk","uuid":"9625C286A202B1B487295A23A981E6AFE14F966DE85F19A8982A7FDD38F1D06027C413AE8E06F42A9A52FA41081E4D038FC3F0D9F72FB3E6C86AD7E8C8774644","orcidId":"0000-0003-1108-613X","documentHash":"24feba62-59ab-45a2-bf56-36a0c43dd412"},{"objectId":"5e7092c8878c28a04739c7e3","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Korona-Głowniak","uuid":"B8E210C874983E7A63580D1CB65D8B9F335CB232A06750FCC3865FEEDB0175335B8CC716F0CD6A8219DEA224CA06E6EB7D7299B7D7AD184F0A498F32A76B4E0A","orcidId":"0000-0003-1634-0387","documentHash":"3587b4e8-cef0-4f7b-b308-44187a5296b3"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules28155690"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1d5","uid":"bJAF3J7gD1iEjREYkfNvHfQ","uuid":"9ab5d088-ab1d-4ba8-8cf3-3b1ed670a267","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wydział

As the European Union has not introduced a local food labelling scheme, the study examines how selected countries defined and labelled local food and whether the implemented brands are suitable for fulfilling their functions of identifying, promoting and guaranteeing local products, avoiding misleading consumers. The question of to what extent geographical indications can be used as a tool to identify locally produced food is also considered. The analysis shows that there is a variety of local or regional, public and private brands that are the result of bottom-up initiatives and local self-governance, but their proliferation, differences in legal nature and the meaning of the messages conveyed adversely affect their function. Therefore, a harmonised labelling should be introduced at the UE level, otherwise at a national level, as a ready-made tool for promoting and distinguishing local products on the market, ensuring a uniform understanding of the label for all participants in the food chain, preventing fraud and unfair competition, and giving consumers confidence in its message."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058839981","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"9","pagesFromTo":"259-286","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://brill.com/view/journals/ejcl/9/3/article-p259_002.xml?ebody=abstract%2Fexcerpt","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e1d2","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kapała","uuid":"3095BDE1E28C3498EEFFE0B4F5D10D9DAF2F0D495E6E8A483A47501E5C6D98E86A5CC05EDBB900FA803C2CD8F5693F25F818E9B0F6AFE8E3ABD10C75DBB6AC4D","orcidId":"0000-0002-8554-6517","documentHash":"e42825f8-bb34-47fa-a2a3-48d4491f36e1"}],"doi":"10.1163/22134514-bja10033"},{"mainLanguageName":"hiszpański","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"9788418490378","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Multimodalidad e intermedialidad.

Compared to Socrates, he devoted his work to ethical issues, and his life was a reflection of teaching. Particular attention of scholars was attracted by the symbolic, often hermetic, ambiguous style of his works. you can find there numerous biblical reminiscences, and references to the ancient Greek and Roman tradition. The reli-gious character of Skovoroda’s thought with clear mystical inclinations found itself in the sphere of scientific interest also in Poland, which was largely due to the cen-turies-long coexistence of Poles and Ukrainians within the Commonwealth. Skovo- rodian’s monograph in Polish is an attempt to outline the reception of Skovoroda’s work in Polish science initiated by Adam Honory Kirkor in Krakow in 1874. Initially, it was shaped as part of broader synthetic works on the history of Ukrainian litera-ture and polemics around the Union of Brest. Apart from Kirkor’s work, this period resulted in a Polish-language study by the outstanding Ukrainian scholar Ivan Franko, a comparison of the thoughts of Skovoroda and the Ukrainian Orthodox polemi-cist Ivan Wyszeński conducted by Józef Tretiak, and in the interwar period Bohdan Łepki’s historical and literary synthesis published in Warsaw. The interwar period is a particularly fertile period in the study of Skovoroda’s philosophical thought. Ivan Mirchuk, as part of the articles presented in Przegląd Filozoficzny, analyzed Skovoro-da’s thought in the context of the concept of Ukrainian national philosophy. Jarosław Ulwański, in his doctoral dissertation published in Kwartalnik Filozoficzny, charac-terized Skovoroda’s philosophy from the perspective of the pantheistic trend, making a critical reflection on the current scientific achievements in this field. The central place in this period is occupied by the monograph Фільсофія Г.С. Сковороди, pub-lished in Warsaw in 1934 by the Ukrainian scholar Dmytro Czyżewski. Although the national affiliation of the author and the language of the work do not give grounds for including it in the Polish scientific discourse, the place and circumstances of its publi-cation as part of the activities of the Ukrainian Scientific Institute in Warsaw and the research perspective adopted in it, which for decades defined global research in this field, demands presentation of its assumptions and main conclusions. This period ends with an extensive article by Czesław Jastrzębiec-Kozłowski analyzing Skovoroda’s thought in the light of the messianic tradition of Józef Hoene-Wroński."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058839985","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb863","mniswId":"39300","name":"Księgarnia Akademicka","documentHash":"e782d136-906a-46a2-b0e4-7b1df4f8c45e"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.12797/9788381388290","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":"10.12797/9788381388290"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["resilience","anxiety","depression","satisfaction with life","endometriosis"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df20","uid":"bMvn9i-Wb4qNqQKvtk7hgiw","uuid":"c6e84f2a-bbff-4e0b-8fd5-dc507baff821","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Psychologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["650481024097072f2ae269fb","5e709355878c28a0473a76eb"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Resilience, anxiety, depression, and life satisfaction in women suffering from endometriosis: a mediation model","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c285145479438","mniswId":"16770","title":"Psychology Health & Medicine","doi":null,"issn":"1354-8506","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"30a9cfe8-6f1d-451d-8492-0ca0295ea247"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"650481024097072f2ae269f9","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["650481024097072f2ae269fb","5e709355878c28a0473a76eb"]},"issue":"9","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The main goal of this cross-sectional study was to assess the relationship between resilience and life satisfaction in women suffering from endometriosis and examine anxiety and depression as mediators in this relationship.

The life satisfaction level was assessed by the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). Unspecific anxiety was evaluated using the General Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7). Depression symptoms\nwere assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Resilience was measured using the Resilience Assessment Scale (SPP-25). Life satisfaction correlated negatively with anxiety and depression, but positively with resilience. Resilience correlated negatively with anxiety and depression. Anxiety and resilience accounted for 25% of the life satisfaction variance. Depression and resilience explained 35% of the variance in life satisfaction. Among resilience components, personal coping skills, tolerance of negative affect, tolerance of failures and treating life as a challenge,\nopenness to new experiences and a sense of humour, and optimistic life attitude and ability to mobilize in difficult situations were the best predictors of life satisfaction. Anxiety and depression may serve as mediators in the relationship between resilience and life satisfaction. Our results suggested that resilience may be related to life satisfaction in women suffering from endometriosis directly and indirectly as mediated by anxiety and depression."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058839987","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66017f8f4097070f89ef61bb","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"28","number":"9","doi":"","documentHash":"354b9ecc-4d07-4ba9-87b1-a74897cf5943"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"28","pagesFromTo":"2450-2461","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13548506.2023.2197649","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"650481024097072f2ae269fb","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Romaniuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d3c16bcc-abd3-49cd-a47f-ee959fe2cddb"},{"objectId":"5e709355878c28a0473a76eb","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Oniszczenko","uuid":"278DF834028DEF2A97061B89C91ADBFDF30DEB035F5CD8D95F007A2EB949D17434C22F110A0B6DD75877BA330FDA5F1FFFA84B036221F251E98AF7DD41272BFC","orcidId":"0000-0003-4442-9186","documentHash":"badac83f-1614-44ff-bfa1-570b7d3ea282"}],"doi":"10.1080/13548506.2023.2197649"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["global instability","LES simulations","round jets"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Self-Excited Oscillations in Variable Density Counter-Current Round Jets","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c28514547820f","mniswId":"8973","title":"International Journal of Heat and Fluid Flow","doi":null,"issn":"0142-727X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"3f2f948a-18cb-47c4-8ab9-fffbe97ce95c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-21","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"650823b540970775139fee63","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093af878c28a0473aefc5","5e709200878c28a04738e788"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper investigates the global instability phenomenon in variable-density counter-current round jets. The analysis is performed using a large eddy simulation and the computations are carried out employing a high-order numerical code. The configuration of two co-axial nozzles, where suction applied in an annular nozzle is a driving force for the counterflow, is investigated. In order to simulate conditions conducive to the emergence of global instability a wide range of velocity and density ratios is considered. Depending on these parameters two different types of modes are observed, i.e., Mode I — shear layer mode, and Mode II — jet column mode. The former is recognized by a high level of perturbations in the shear layer which vanish away from the shear layer reaching a low level at the jet centerline. The latter is characterized by strong disturbances throughout the entire jet region. The results obtained are in remarkable agreement with the theoretical basis reported in the literature. They reveal that the critical velocity ratio for which global instability emerges decreases along with the density ratio. Additionally, the transition from Mode II to Mode I is found for sufficiently strong suction. In general, the lower the density ratio, the weaker suction is required to induce Mode I. Consistently to the literature, Mode II is characterized by a lower frequency of oscillations compared to Mode I for which an increase in density ratio and/or velocity ratio shifts the peaks of the velocity spectra toward higher frequencies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058839988","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.103","pagesFromTo":"brak","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142727X23000772","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473aefc5","name":"Karol","lastName":"Wawrzak","uuid":"15C0B424897D7E5FDB95BA5AAC3FFBB560A4F57A3DBD0A99C752873FA7D2B838F09669C87678BE662ADA8AAE176FFB530DD64BC90CFC85D27DFBFA2059F2D924","orcidId":"0000-0003-3513-663X","documentHash":"01efa9da-6c87-4771-b3a4-0b0a623a5298"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e788","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Bogusławski","uuid":"377B949EEDC2AC7E439B61BDA3F34A412669050672C19DB40C296B9AB1D59147129167DE1F84D9DAD15F49D19016A18149049236D4F9BDAFF2B8258FE3EC2425","orcidId":"0000-0002-0713-1121","documentHash":"34e786d2-218a-4696-93ef-4838d6cd82c6"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ijheatfluidflow.2023.109178"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de54","uid":"bGdC_bzKT-HVRZ9O1mobrEA","uuid":"1c749f42-2a28-46f6-a59f-63d4e8541713","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de54","parentUuid":"1c749f42-2a28-46f6-a59f-63d4e8541713","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de54","rootUuid":"1c749f42-2a28-46f6-a59f-63d4e8541713","name":"Pomorski Uniwersytet Medyczny w Szczecinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70936b878c28a0473a9276","5e70928f878c28a047397e6f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The role of omentin-1 in cancers development and progression.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bc61","mniswId":"3233","title":"Cancers","doi":null,"issn":"2072-6694","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"9418a906-5b75-4db1-84e3-dff82b7dd6bc"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-11-11","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":1},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65083e1f40970739aadd27a2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928f878c28a047397e6f","5e709383878c28a0473ab9a5","674f7b9cfdbe8357174e3340","5e70936b878c28a0473a9276"]},"issue":"15","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058839990","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"art. id. 3797","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"674f7b9cfdbe8357174e3340","name":"Agata","lastName":"Poniewierska-Baran","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"12209956-0dc7-4726-a165-11a940a955b3"},{"objectId":"5e709383878c28a0473ab9a5","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Dec","uuid":"39BC34BBD8244D16B70AFA014AA1851F5DA4800C7D0050873054DAEB11D2B9A07C8EF8711D3A942B203A91C10AC4AD386778586F9E217A59592D725D17F25D5F","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ddea57c8-1a2a-4f92-b29c-83b4951ef74a"},{"objectId":"5e70936b878c28a0473a9276","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pawlik","uuid":"C5162AF1A7AC9FCAF8F7A8DF6CCC5801B7CB398B5ADFE23751A47F09391FB208E2EE4139E4EBD4D57D8DC15E83C9D2861EC2E42A651718452A6CB99A3C4628D8","orcidId":"0000-0001-6557-1208","documentHash":"1fe362c7-d270-44dc-8a2c-25e5b011f110"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397e6f","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Modrzejewski","uuid":"D236E3EC0A94005550A9643B75C511A709C7734F01D8ECC5D1E5BEAB4EEA2EF2EA82290DA7EE7E7D5B6FBE2763B25EB9723B9756F63E97C85812B12C6EA9C106","orcidId":"0000-0002-5988-7414","documentHash":"7fdc86bd-6480-45bb-8079-d9e0fae29edd"}],"doi":"10.3390/cancers15153797"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","parentUuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","rootUuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

The independent variables for this study are Hofstede’s cultural dimensions. The scores for each of the five dimensions have been used in the model. The Global Innovation index from 2021 was used as the dependent variable for this study. Multiple regressions were used to identify the relationship between the independent variables (Hofstede’s culture dimensions) and dependent variable -The Global Innovation index.\nResults:\nHigher values of long term orientation, individualism and uncertainly avoidance have a positive impact on innovation. On the other hand, the proposed relationship between power distance and innovation as well as masculinity and innovation were not confirmed and require further research.\nConclusions:\nThe study has achieved a part of its main research goal in proving that the proposed relationships between some national culture dimensions and innovation hold true for Eastern Europe countries. In addition, the study has also opened some new questions regarding the relationship between masculinity and power distance and their influence on innovation adoption that require further research.

The addition reactions are controlled by the aromaticity and the kinetic trends were justified by resonance stabilization energies. The rate constants were calculated by using the Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) and canonical transition state theory (CTST) methods in conjugation with zero curvature tunneling (ZCT). The overall RRKM-bimolecular rate constant at ambient conditions is 6.72 × 10−12 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, is negatively dependent on the temperature and can be expressed as k=3.92*10-14 exp(1534.9/T). Contribution of the AD-C4 path in the overall reaction is about 70–80%, implying that the dependence of overall rate constant on pressure can be ignored.

Despite the growing\\ninterest in the peel of the fruit, the leaves are the most frequently used part of the fruit. The aim of\\nthe study was to determine the main by-products of the peel, such as pectins, minerals, essential\\noil, and bioactive compounds, and to evaluate the possibility of using them in various branches of\\nindustry. In the study of the essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation performed using the TGA\\nchromatography technique (GC-MS), sabinene (31.93%), β-pinene (26%), and limonene (19%) were\\nselected as the most abundant volatile compounds. Nine microelements (Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, Co, Ni,\\nCr, Mo, and V), four macroelements (Mg, Ca, K, and Na), and seven ballast substances (Cd, Hg, Pb,\\nAl, V, Sr, and Pt) were also determined using the microwave plasma-atomic emission spectrometry\\ntechnique (MP-AES). In the case of microelements, iron 32.72 ± 0.39 mg/kg DW (dry weight) had the\\nhighest concentration. In the case of macroelements, the calcium content was 9416 ± 34 mg/kg DW.\\nOptimization of the pectin extraction was also performed by selecting citric acid and obtaining a yield\\nof 7.6–17.6% for acid extraction and 9.9–28.2% for ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), depending\\non the temperature used. The obtained pectins were characterized by the degree of methylation,\\ngalacturonic acid content, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging, and DSC\\n(differential scanning calorimetry) analysis.

The proposed antenna is a pentagon-shaped monopole that provides a dual-band response with a wide operating bandwidth at 5G 28/28 bands. The antenna is printed on 0.508-mm-thick Rogers RT5880 substrate of relative permittivity ɛr =2.2. It exhibits a small physical size of 5.5 × 5.4 × 0.508 mm3, excluding the feeding line. The MIMO system is constructed of two symmetric radiating elements arranged adjacently with the mutual coupling of −18.5 dB at both resonant frequencies. The dual-band metamaterial is designed and placed between the two radiators to reduce the mutual coupling. Embedding a 3×1 metamaterial array enhances the isolation to −39 dB and −38 dB at 28 GHz and 38 GHz, respectively. The proposed system is capable of covering both 28/28 5G bands and has the merits of broad bandwidth, low profile, high gain ( > 5 dB), improved isolation (−38 dB), low envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) (< 0.0001) and channel capacity loss (CCL) (< 0.05), and high diversity gain (DG) (> 9.99 dB). The system performance is verified experimentally with good agreement between the simulated and measured data. These properties demonstrate the system applicability for 5G millimeter-wave communication networks."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058840009","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"158","pagesFromTo":"154470","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca547a4097077ac1cfc3c8","name":"Bashar","lastName":"Esmail","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b78fb862-85be-493b-9758-d999d6f72e8e"},{"objectId":"5e709429878c28a0473b7630","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Kozieł","uuid":"ADE10A3FDF1ADAA43EDDED1EECEF7257987D36621DDC2651FA1743F0B2EC4A58B0FCDE0410C8591A1F30E812DFBC087E070124E8464AF6B145423E85D7C160AD","orcidId":"0000-0002-9063-2647","documentHash":"64490206-262d-4cc6-8295-a68adf4c2dfe"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.aeue.2022.154470"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["AUDIBLE SOUND ANALYSIS","ELECTROPLATED TOOLS","GRINDING","PROCESS MONITORING"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709248878c28a047392fd4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Method of Monitoring of the Grinding Process with Lapping Kinematics Using Audible Sound Analysis","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a05b","mniswId":"24174","title":"Journal of Machine Engineering","doi":null,"issn":"1895-7595","eissn":"2391-8071","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"a3e45dbd-ebfb-4be7-9829-25040d7b2283"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca56254097077ac1cfdded","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709248878c28a047392fd4"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Utilising microphones as audible sound sensors for monitoring a single-side grinding process with lapping kinematics is presented in the paper. The audible sound generated during grinding depended on the cutting properties of electroplated tools with D107 diamond grains and different thicknesses of the nickel bond. The tool wear affected the obtained technological effects such as material removal rate and the surface roughness of Al2O3 ceramic samples. The relationship between the quantities that characterise the sound signal and the surface roughness of machined surfaces was examined with the use of spectral analysis of the sound signal in the frequency domain with a focus on the Ra parameter. The decreasing amplitude indicated a better surface finish, down to Ra = 0.23 µm. The developed method and the obtained results will facilitate the practical use of the electroplated tools in the lap-grinding technology without interrupting the process before obtaining the required surface roughness."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058840010","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"5 - 15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709248878c28a047392fd4","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Deja","uuid":"7187E52591BA60F0C025299AF1D51993DEAC5BB5EAFF1EE955A05E72A4D878C7DF97806259ECBEDE1557C93284ED3DA77B6A50581B60466DD4CB8C27A9DDD122","orcidId":"0000-0002-1874-9015","documentHash":"b14b4d51-ded2-40a5-9e55-ffb48c7b6e58"}],"doi":"10.36897/jme/157255"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"9788377683217","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de17","uid":"bPE2PjbeOl7yC2KHqaQECkQ","uuid":"9eec5244-9085-4de9-9ad9-a77b7ad693bc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de17","parentUuid":"9eec5244-9085-4de9-9ad9-a77b7ad693bc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de17","rootUuid":"9eec5244-9085-4de9-9ad9-a77b7ad693bc","name":"Uniwersytet im.

Five chemically manipulated FAAH-like benzamides were localized on the UiO-66-NH2 surface with physical interactions. Comprehensive cellular and molecular analyses were conducted on HEK-293, HeLa, HepG2, PC12, MCF-7, and HT-29 cell lines (cytotoxicity assessment after 24 and 48 h). MTT results proved above 95 and 50% relative cell viability in the absence and presence of the drug, respectively. A complete targeted drug-releasing capability of nanocarriers was demonstrated after capping with leaf extract from Citrus tangerine, with a stimuli-responsive effect in acidic media. Targeted delivery was complete to the nucleus and cytoplasm of HT-29 cell, but merely to the cytoplasm of HeLa cell lines. Nanocarrier could be targeted for drug delivery to the cytoplasm of the HeLa cell line and to both the nucleus and cytoplasm of HT-29 cell lines. MOF-based nanocarriers proved authentic in vivo towards kidney and liver tissues with targeted cancerous cells efficiently. Besides, FAAH-like molecules revealed optical biosensor potential with high selectivity (even ˂5 nM LOD) towards ssDNA, sgRNA, and Anti-cas9 proteins."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058840017","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"299","pagesFromTo":"134359","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca568e4097077ac1cfe4db","name":"Eder C.","lastName":"Lima","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"acf56413-2ac4-456d-a03e-95bcf8e5f06a"},{"objectId":"64ca568e4097077ac1cfe4da","name":"Rajender S.","lastName":"Varma","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"779a0ebd-929b-4891-be3c-c33703fc3505"},{"objectId":"64ca568e4097077ac1cfe4d9","name":"Mohsen","lastName":"Asadnia","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"23f17d2b-be1d-4cf7-bbc1-a7da321a6c65"},{"objectId":"64ca568e4097077ac1cfe4d8","name":"Mojtaba","lastName":"Bagherzadeh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"95f3d30a-4f1d-4f60-97e5-3d45640ad3f7"},{"objectId":"64ca568e4097077ac1cfe4d7","name":"Pooyan","lastName":"Makvandi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"85e681d7-0ada-4a74-830f-74284e812bc2"},{"objectId":"64ca568e4097077ac1cfe4d6","name":"Yousef","lastName":"Fatahi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c795fed9-90a9-4377-91ce-0e7b269c233b"},{"objectId":"64ca568e4097077ac1cfe4d5","name":"Sepideh","lastName":"Ahmadi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fa544afa-eec1-4b63-ab62-9eac118a7e8b"},{"objectId":"64ca568e4097077ac1cfe4d4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Sedaghat","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1b57fc8c-5063-4412-8ef3-894cb8e6017f"},{"objectId":"64ca568e4097077ac1cfe4d3","name":"Vida","lastName":"Alinezhad","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3227350c-930d-4242-b617-583e045417b9"},{"objectId":"64ca568e4097077ac1cfe4d2","name":"Amir Mohammad","lastName":"Ghadiri","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"33e3f002-a7e1-4acc-b769-230ed8bace5f"},{"objectId":"64ca568e4097077ac1cfe4d1","name":"Navid","lastName":"Rabiee","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5aff3d80-bc2e-45e2-8cec-7b32d619116b"},{"objectId":"6110ee1b9543c757bc082820","name":"MOHAMMAD-REZA","lastName":"SAEB","uuid":"74F5D66F67AAD053C12A313EF79181BDFC800B4CC486D1CDBE4F9ED8434576184A9BC0097ABD04D2256D6E48BF3DDBC3219E15F02301340D1E6F674FA9A3EAC8","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"36cc7ed3-6953-43f7-ad68-e6305eda9541"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.134359"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["POLYHYDROXYBUTYRATE","POLYLACTID ACID","POLYMER BLENDS","THERMAL DEGRADATION","THERMOGRAVIMETRIC ANALYSIS"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6110ee1b9543c757bc082820"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Thermal degradation of polylactic acid (PLA)/polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) blends: A systematic review","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479326","mniswId":"16358","title":"Polymer Degradation and Stability","doi":null,"issn":"0141-3910","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"770963d8-da9d-4bc1-9775-34ad7423735f"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca56934097077ac1cfe523","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ca56934097077ac1cfe524","64ca56934097077ac1cfe525","64ca56934097077ac1cfe526","64ca56934097077ac1cfe527","6110ee1b9543c757bc082820","64ca56934097077ac1cfe528"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Polylactic acid (PLA) and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) are two biopolyesters obtained from renewable resources like corn or sugar under bacterial fermentation. PLA is the most widely used biopolymer in diverse applications. Addition of PHB to PLA can improves the crystallinity of PLA, and thereby its mechanical strength. However, both PLA and PHB suffer from poor thermal stability, which limits their potential industrial application. The purpose of this review is to explain thermal decomposition behavior and mechanism of these polymers and systematically categorize available reports on thermal degradation of the neat PLA and PHB, and also as-processed PLA/PHB blends along with PLA/PHB blends modified/reinforced with plasticizers, additives or crosslinkers. The characteristic temperatures (Tonset, and peak temperature or Tmax) of PLA and PHB are taken as the key parameters governing thermal degradation behavior of PLA/PHB blends and composites with variable composition. From this survey we can conclude that the thermal stability of PLA in PLA/PHB blend is lower than the neat PLA, contrary to the PHB with higher thermal stability in PLA/PHB blend. Therefore, thermal degradation mechanism of PLA/PHB blends must be taken as a complex physico-chemical phenomenon. Moreover, the selection of additive severely affects the thermal stability of PLA/PHB blends.

A high discharge of wastewater from industries using dyes affects living organisms and the environment. This paper presents studies on polycationic selenides (PCS) synthesized by hydrothermal methods for photocatalytic degradation of dyes. The synthesized PCS were confirmed by various characterization techniques such as FTIR, SEM, EDX, UV/Vis, and XRD. The FTIR spectra revealed characteristic band at 843, 548 cm−1, and 417 cm−1 due to the M − Se stretching and intrinsic stretching vibrations, respectively. The optical bandgap of polycationic selenide lies in the visible light region (2.36 eV). The SEM images showed that PCS has a spherical shape with an average crystallite size of 29.23 nm calculated from XRD data using Scherer's equation. The PCS has a point of zero charge (PZC) at pH 7. The efficiency of synthesized PCS photocatalyst was confirmed in terms of its activity towards Eosin (EY) and Crystal violet (CV) dyes mineralization. The photocatalytic degradation for EY and CV dyes at optimum conditions was 99.47% and 99.31% and followed second order reactions kinetics with 1.4314 and 0.551 rate constant, respectively.

The article presents a certification system for schools, commissioned by the City of Gdańsk, which is an element of a systemic solution shaping patterns of transport behavior in school trips. The essence of the proposed approach is motivating and supporting schools by government to create conditions conducive to independent and active travel of children and adolescents. An important element of the certification process is the assessment stage in accordance with the set of criteria adopted and grouped into six areas concerning: children transport behavior, infrastructure and traffic organization in and around the school, mobility policy, road safety, promotion, and education. Groups of criteria were divided into basic and extended ones and assigned points in an assessment calculator. A minimum threshold of points has been set in each category to attract schools to take comprehensive action. The assessment calculator has been supplemented by catalogues of good practices describing possible actions that could be taken to meet a given criterion. The full certification process has not yet been completed in Gdańsk due to the coronavirus pandemic and the transition to remote learning.

The TIP4P/ICE model and a Lennard-Jones center were used for water and methane, respectively. To estimate the nucleation rate, the seeding technique was  employed. Clusters of the methane hydrate of different sizes were inserted into the aqueous phase of a two-phase gas–liquid equilibrium system at 260 K and 400 bars. Using these systems, we determined the size at which the cluster of the hydrate is critical (i.e., it has 50% probability of either growing or melting). Since nucleation rates estimated from the seeding technique are sensitive to the choice of the order parameter used to determine the size of the cluster of the solid, we considered several possibilities. We performed brute force simulations of an aqueous solution of methane in water in which the concentration of methane was several times higher than the equilibrium concentration (i.e., the solution was supersaturated). From brute force runs, we infer the value of the nucleation rate for this system rigorously. Subsequently, seeding runs were carried out for this system, and it was found that only two of the considered order parameters were able to reproduce the value of the nucleation rate obtained from brute force simulations. By using these two order parameters, we estimated the nucleation rate under experimental conditions (400 bars and 260 K) to be of the order of log10 (J/(m3s)) = −7(5).\\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058840029","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"158","pagesFromTo":"114505","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca572f4097077ac1cfee37","name":"Carlos","lastName":"Vega","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c4b778a0-00fc-44b0-abb7-0efcaabe1b91"},{"objectId":"64ca572f4097077ac1cfee36","name":"Felipe J.","lastName":"Blas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8a92ddde-74e2-46af-b654-ec39e00c14c3"},{"objectId":"64ca572f4097077ac1cfee35","name":"José Manuel","lastName":"Míguez","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e064c05e-2ad4-4947-be7f-3916364f6e16"},{"objectId":"64ca572f4097077ac1cfee34","name":"Jesús","lastName":"Algaba","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"95cfcd38-9594-42fa-a708-ccec7c616050"},{"objectId":"64ca572f4097077ac1cfee33","name":"Iván M.","lastName":"Zerón","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8a6ba005-490f-4b9c-9625-e9348b23dc9f"},{"objectId":"64ca572f4097077ac1cfee32","name":"E.

consumption involves several dimensions, being some of them directly associated with the consumers’ characteristics. The interrelationships between these domains impact consumer behaviour for food choice and the consequent decisions for food consumption. In these frameworks, economic motivations are determinant. On the other hand, the scientific literature highlights that the economic-based stimuli to choose food is still underexplored. In this perspective, the objective of this study was to assess the main sociodemographic and anthropometric determinants of the economic motivations for food choice. For that, a questionnaire survey was carried out involving 11,919 respondents from 16 countries. A validated questionnaire was used, translated into the native languages in all participating countries, using a back-translation process. First, the information obtained was assessed through factor analysis to reduce the number of variables associated with the economic motivations and to identify indexes. After, and considering the indexes obtained as dependent variables, a classification and regression tree analysis was performed. As main insights, it is highlighted that the main determinants of the economic motivations are country of residence, age, gender, civil state, professional activity, educational level, living environment, responsibility for buying food, weight, height, body mass index, healthy diets and physical exercise practices. Additionally, the results also reveal that economic motivations may be associated with two indexes, one related to convenience attitudes and the other to quality concerns. Finally, the younger persons and the women are the social groups more concerned with healthy diets and food quality. In conclusion, this work confirmed that food choice is to a high extent influenced by several sociodemographic and behavioural factors."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058840034","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"73","pagesFromTo":"127-139","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09637486.2021.1939659?needAccess=true","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a3a9c40970762633a3f25","name":"Raquel P.

We employ the DOLS and ARDL estimation techniques to explore the long-term response of FDI to both insecurity and corruption using quarterly data from Nigeria over the period 1996-2020. A long-term relationship was found amongst insecurity, FDI and corruption (alongside market size, the presence of natural resources, inflation, and exchange rate) based on the bounds testing approach to cointegration. The results point to a long-term significant and positive influence of lower corruption and higher security on FDI. Also, the size of the market, the presence of natural resources and depreciation of the domestic currency have a long-run significant positive influence on inbound FDI, while inflation has a long-term significant and decreasing influence on FDI. Thus, policymakers and government are advised to employ measures to reduce both insecurity and corruption to encourage the inflow of FDI over the long

The experiment was conducted in the Experimental Orchard of the\nNational Institute of Horticultural Research in Dąbrowice, Poland, in 2014–2020. Apple trees of the cultivar ‘Ligolina’\nwere planted in autumn of 2013 at spacing of 3.8 × 1.4 m in the rows of an apple orchard that had been grubbed up in\nspring. The following experimental setups were used: (i) two types of rootstocks of different growth vigour (M.9, P14);\n(ii) replacement of soil in rows of trees with virgin soil; (iii) fertigation with ammonium phosphate; (iv) control\n(cultivation in the exhausted soil). Replantation significantly limited the growth of apple trees by reducing the cross-\nsectional area of the tree trunk, and the number and length of annual shoots. Fruit yields of apple trees grown on the\nreplantation site were significantly lower than those of the trees grown in virgin soil. The use of ammonium phosphate\nfertigation had a positive effect on the growth and yield on the replantation site, especially when it was combined with\nthe use of a stronger-growing rootstock (P14). The most effective environmentally friendly method of eliminating the\napple replant disease is the replacement of the exhausted soil with virgin soil, i.e. soil that has not been used for growing\nfruit trees before."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058840048","journalIssue":{"objectId":"644ba35140970748461a95a0","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"d57f5f6c-ffd3-4be2-b26b-286fea5f4b3d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"58","pagesFromTo":"17–24","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/Content/128397/PDF/2023-03-JWLD-03.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"650806db40970775139e2720","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Kiełkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ac835899-d2b0-4825-b10c-c739c9cb7e5c"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bdde0","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"97CA3174080827A6B0A0270F12F022527EAC69DEAF9A298A7090DB405A36D9BD3C5300A23E15C79339219E9F5C5A610F383406AAEF43CA7180E096A8773B797B","orcidId":"0000-0001-7802-9733","documentHash":"5b2d0c7c-4406-469f-b682-f04386f8910b"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4a21","name":"Anna","lastName":"Tryngiel-Gać","uuid":"98A77A282439EDFDCA5A17C1FCC501D6ACC64EE0DDE21EC927CAE3EE0F051AFE4F6A667D73E28FFE19E620EEB1194BF4B6A9636A0DD3524FA5494BB0B1F7D3D5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8766-6010","documentHash":"483e9d4e-640a-450f-9733-0cdcfc8af5db"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a0473986e0","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Treder","uuid":"CA809C02520EED47C9A82056AF627806F94D6BB9721D9DB8BB14025A6684CE9FE71CFD1C9D18ECE0B1A2610D5554D573E7368A857C8E508CD75D20E6A051643E","orcidId":"0000-0003-1640-9671","documentHash":"c6034984-8a2c-4af0-ae6a-63868a0ca950"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a0473979a2","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Klamkowski","uuid":"7E450B39DF810DB41FC8F651E1A7E17AD750C7E9A422D49912DC393B84655FBED245B386CD93F921C9DE3C513917FBB447B953F71C4C91C5B479A20AFAD3CB05","orcidId":"0000-0003-0358-3726","documentHash":"cbebff37-3723-4ee6-9d6e-43c807f2539a"}],"doi":"10.24425/jwld.2023.145357"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","uid":"bLoLgWizTVEIn0ZQBwSDx-Q","uuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","parentUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","rootUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","name":"Uniwersytet

Using the panel data set of EU-27 countries from 2000 to 2020, linear and non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) are applied for the symmetric and asymmetric evidence and to test environmental Kuznets curve (EKC), linear ARDL with the quadratic function is included. Results of the symmetric relationship find evidence of resource productivity’s impact on the environmental degradation. In full sample of EU-27, both symmetric and asymmetric methods show that the short run and long run increase of resource productivity lower the environmental degradation. Only long run asymmetric relationship in high material footprint subsamples supports that the resource productivity controls environmental degradation. Results of moderate material footprint sub-sample are mixed. However, low material footprint countries show that resource productivity in long run controls the environmental degradation in symmetry and only positive resource controls productivity in short run in asymmetric relationship. The reason for mixed results is the quadratic nature of sub-samples. EKC hypothesis is validated in moderate and low material footprint sub-samples. This research has many policy implications."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058840051","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"30","pagesFromTo":"58536 - 58552","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"631bf6a975234038513c05bc","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Mushafiq","uuid":"11D4426AB916CC328D8E9A3B28FFE8C97014CF05DC332004B61A6F332CA0DCCD05A6E190032D3CE44AC65A385556744FC0837865E648559C7C6DC2EB33563F47","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5adaab2b-e89b-4d8b-a9c8-c3b57a18fc8a"},{"objectId":"5e70925d878c28a0473946f4","name":"Błażej","lastName":"Prusak","uuid":"532CBC7BF8AAFB3C5E0FFCD783BAC9F942CE1C39666F95C28A46AC5D2B073834137DD5BF18BB0F950A76CC954A199ABAA66A544332F85BBE3CF188B99AECB484","orcidId":"0000-0002-6526-0407","documentHash":"5eebe846-b8f2-4fe8-949a-3f20ab69d3d4"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11356-023-26631-z"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a64d6","5e7093a0878c28a0473adf8b","5e709345878c28a0473a622f","5e709347878c28a0473a63b9","5e709472878c28a0473bd38e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Temperature, Salinity and Garlic Additive Shape the Microbial Community during Traditional Beetroot Fermentation Process","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"Foods","doi":null,"issn":"2304-8158","eissn":"2304-8158","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"827d8888-1217-4c9f-a068-b8a2e5756417"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-31","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6504381d4097072f2ade5a59","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093a0878c28a0473adf8b","6504381d4097072f2ade5a5a","5e709347878c28a0473a64d6","5e709472878c28a0473bd38e","6504381d4097072f2ade5a5b","5e709347878c28a0473a63b9","5e709345878c28a0473a622f"]},"issue":"16","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Plant-based traditional fermented products are attracting a lot of interest in global markets. An example of them is beetroot leaven, which is valued for its high bioactive compound content. The variety of production recipes and the spontaneous nature of red beet fermentation favor its high diversity. This study aimed to analyze the impact of external factors—temperature, brine salinity, and garlic dose—on the beetroot fermentation and bacterial metapopulation responsible for this process. The research results confirmed the significant influence of the selected and analyzed factors in shaping the leaven physicochemical profile including organic acid profile and betalain content. Analysis of bacterial populations proved the crucial importance of the first 48 h of the fermentation process in establishing a stable metapopulation structure and confirmed that this is a targeted process driven by the effect of the analyzed factors. Lactobacillaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Leuconostocaceae were observed to be the core microbiome families of the fermented red beet. Regardless of the impact of the tested factors, the leaven maintained the status of a promising source of probiotic bacteria. The results of this research may be helpful in the development of the regional food sector and in improving the quality and safety of traditionally fermented products such as beetroot

An elemental analysis was carried out, determining the content of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulphur in the leaves tested. A technical analysis of the biofuel was also carried out to determine the content of moisture, volatile matter, and ash. The calorimetric method was used to determine the higher heating value for the material. Fixed carbon and oxygen carbon was calculated based on the elemental and technical analyses. The study showed that the type of rootstock and the year of cultivation influence the amount of leaves obtained from the cultivation area. Leaf entrustment per hectare ranged from 1,140,868.02 in rootstock 161-49 to 1,265,286.7 Mg∙ha–1 in rootstock SO4. Regardless of the year of the study, shrubs grafted on 125AA rootstock and the control had the highest combustion heat of 17.5 MJ∙kg–1 and 17.6 MJ∙kg–1 respectively, while 5BB rootstock had the lowest combustion heat (16.4 MJ∙kg–1).

(Garlic) is a fragrant herb and tuber-derived spice that is one of the most sought-after botanicals, used as a culinary and ethnomedicine for a variety of diseases around the world. An array of pharmacological attributes such as antioxidant, hypoglycemic, anti-inflammatory, antihyperlipidemic, anticancer, antimicrobial, and hepatoprotective activities of this species have been established by previous studies. A. sativum houses many sulfur-containing phytochemical compounds such as allicin, diallyl disulfide (DADS), vinyldithiins, ajoenes (E-ajoene, Z-ajoene), diallyl trisulfide (DATS), micronutrient selenium (Se) etc. Organosulfur compounds are correlated with modulations in its antioxidant properties. The garlic compounds have also been recorded as promising immune-boosters or act as potent immunostimulants. A. sativum helps to treat cardiovascular ailments, neoplastic growth, rheumatism, diabetes, intestinal worms, flatulence, colic, dysentery, liver diseases, facial paralysis, tuberculosis, bronchitis, high blood pressure, and several other diseases. The present review aims to comprehensively enumerate the ethnobotanical and pharmacological aspects of A. sativum with notes on its phytochemistry, ethnopharmacology, toxicological aspects, and clinical studies from the retrieved literature from the last decade with notes on recent breakthroughs and bottlenecks.

The Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are operationally used in the estimation of thetropospheric state and assimilation of the results into the weather models. One of the GNSS techniques of troposphere sensingis tomography which provides 3-D fields of wet refractivity. The tomographic results have been successfully assimilated intothe numerical weather models, showing the great potential of this technique. The GNSS tomography can be based on twodifferent approaches to the parameterisation of the model’s domain, i.e. block (voxel-based) or grid (node-based) approach.Regardless of the parameterisation approach, the tomographic domain should be discretised, which is usually performed in aregular manner, with a grid resolution depending on the mean distance between the GNSS receivers. In this work, we proposea new parameterisation approach based on the optimisation of the tomographic nodes’ location, taking into account thenon-uniform distribution of the GNSS information in the troposphere. The experiment was performed using a dense networkof 16 low-cost multi-GNSS receivers located in Wrocław and its suburbs, with a mean distance of 3km. Cross-validationof four different parameterisation approaches is presented. The validation is performed based on the Weather Research andForecasting model as well as radiosonde observations. The new approach improves the results of wet refractivity estimationby 0.5–2 ppm in terms of RMSE, especially for altitudes of 0.5–2.0km."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058840063","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"97","pagesFromTo":"1-23","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00190-022-01691-0","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6628ff604097076263323fd1","name":"Estera","lastName":"Trzcina","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a45a0673-e81d-40af-968f-1b7dce6cd337"},{"objectId":"602fa0ee9543c7410626f6bb","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Smolak","uuid":"1B5637EF9B13A579790FCF9DD506F9BC2BF5C2CD43C2CE1E108B7EB0DC01569DE2F03298B7B4321C038E13D4CADCF427EE7BC1BC6DDC6647A01D5F2A9AE9B677","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a7218f57-30e9-425a-9831-c74063961971"},{"objectId":"5e709271878c28a047395cab","name":"Witold","lastName":"Rohm","uuid":"190E4C660B8469B59BC59809E652CDBF7824CD50F7F493D11ADC0C9266AB8B0B404BEF2E9D17C4FF0CC57BF39AE4CC54C400DE81A6FD5FEF8A5764382BB6F98B","orcidId":"0000-0002-2082-6366","documentHash":"2b859ef5-36b3-4db6-ae64-2bc241c5656e"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00190-022-01691-0"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["ochrona karna ludzkiego zarodka","zapłodnienie in vitro","zamrażanie zarodków","prawo karne","prawo medyczne"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de22","uid":"bgWwWc4g_PZlP-gzFo2l2EA","uuid":"9d3664e2-2c7a-448a-9fb2-278de61e6136","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de22","parentUuid":"9d3664e2-2c7a-448a-9fb2-278de61e6136","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de22","rootUuid":"9d3664e2-2c7a-448a-9fb2-278de61e6136","name":"Katolicki Uniwersytet Lubelski Jana Pawła II w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709277878c28a047396236"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Polskie prawo karne wobec kriokonserwacji ludzkich zarodków","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a0dc","mniswId":"200013","title":"Krytyka prawa.Niezależne studia nad prawem","doi":null,"issn":"2080-1084","eissn":"2450-7938","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"f08a9d73-e49e-4fa9-a1bd-227a2ffadd92"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"JULY","releaseDateYear":2023,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65082eb24097077513a0d5c1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709277878c28a047396236"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Przedmiotem artykułu jest problem kriokonserwacji ludzkich zarodków z perspektywy polskiego prawa karnego.

Odpowiedzialność karna za wymienione działania i zaniechania ma dwie zasadnicze podstawy.

The X-ray ignition is associated with a galaxy at z = 0.10, making the peak luminosity log<SUB>10</SUB>(L<SUB>0.2−2 keV</SUB>/[erg s<SUP>−1</SUP>]) = 44.7 ± 0.1. Around the time of the rise in X-ray flux, the nucleus of the galaxy brightened by approximately 3 mag. in optical photometry, after correcting for the host contribution. We present X-ray follow-up data from Swift, XMM-Newton, and NICER, which reveal a very soft spectrum as well as strong 0.2-2.0 keV flux variability on multiple timescales. Optical spectra taken in the weeks after the ignition event show a blue continuum with broad, asymmetric Balmer emission lines, and high-ionisation ([OIII]λλ4959,5007) and low-ionisation ([NII]λ6585, [SII]λλ6716,6731) narrow emission lines. Following the peak in the optical light curve, the X-ray, UV, and optical photometry all show a rapid decline. The X-ray light curve shows a decrease in luminosity of ∼0.45 over 33 days and the UV shows a drop of ∼0.35 over the same period. eRASSt J234402.9−352640 also shows a brightening in the mid-infrared, likely powered by a dust echo of the luminous ignition. We find no evidence in Fermi-LAT γ-ray data for jet-like emission. The event displays characteristics of a tidal disruption event (TDE) as well as of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), complicating the classification of this transient. Based on the softness of the X-ray spectrum, the presence of high-ionisation optical emission lines, and the likely infrared echo, we find that a TDE within a turned-off AGN best matches our observations. \n\nFull Table 4 is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/\">cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=\"https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/672/A167\">https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/672/A167</A>\""}],"lastRefresh":"1747058840073","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"672","pagesFromTo":"A167","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023A&A...672A.167H","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64b4f7dc4097071386665cff","name":"J.

The model of the cation exchange process was built using an artificial neural network (ANN). The acid mine drainage waste’s Cu(II) ion was removed using Indion 730 cation exchange resin. Experimental data from 252 cycles were recorded. In a column study, 252 experimental observations validated the three-layered ANN module’s ion exchange process forecasting. The model design for the ion exchange process focuses on the process’s major constraints, such as initial flow rate, initial concentration of Cu (II) ions, and AMDW residence time in the column, to fit the working environment. The maximum metal ion removal efficiency was found at 5 LPH initial flowrate, 5 pH suspension, and 60 cm bed height. With a regression value of 0.99, the proposed model matches experimental values. A hidden layer with 6 neurons and an outer layer with a linear transfer function can predict adsorption efficiency using the three-layer ANN module’s backpropagation (BP) technique. A linear method was used to construct the correlation between dependent and independent variables. The BP-ANN module’s coefficient of correlation was 0.99 with accurate dependent variable predictions. In a feedforward neural network, the current research’s ANN module predicts the best conditions for Cu(II) ion extraction."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058840075","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca56d54097077ac1cfe93f","name":"V.

Polymers, metals, and ceramics are the few materials that can be used in AM technology, but metallic materials (Magnesium and Aluminum) are attracting more attention from the research and industrial point of view. Understanding the role processing parameters of laser-based additive manufacturing is critical to maximize the usage of material in forming the product geometry. LPBF (Laser powder-based fusion) method is regarded as a potent and effective additive manufacturing technique for creating intricate 3D forms/parts with high levels of precision and reproducibility together with acceptable metallurgical characteristics. While dealing with LBPF, some degree of porosity is acceptable because it is unavoidable; hot ripping and cracking must be avoided, though. The necessary manufacturing of pre-alloyed powder and ductility remains to be the primary concern while dealing with a laser-based additive manufacturing approach. The presence of the Al-Si eutectic phase in AlSi10Mg and AlSi12 alloy attributing to excellent castability and low shrinkage, attaining the most attention in the laser-based approach. Related studies with these alloys along with precipitation hardening and heat treatment processing were discussed. The Pure Mg, Mg-Al alloy, Mg-RE alloy, and Mg-Zn alloy along with the mechanical characteristics, electrochemical durability, and biocompatibility of Mg-based material have been elaborated in the work-study. The review article also summarizes the processing parameters of the additive manufacturing powder-based approach relating to different Mg-based alloys. For future aspects, the optimization of processing parameters, composition of the alloy, and quality of powder material used will significantly improve the ductility of additively manufactured Mg alloy by the LPBF approach. Other than that, the recycling of Mg-alloy powder hasn’t been investigated yet. Meanwhile, the post-processing approach, including a homogeneous coating on the porous scaffolds, will mark the suitability in terms of future advancements in Mg and Al-based alloys."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058840077","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"8122","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca54934097077ac1cfc569","name":"Dhanesh G.","lastName":"Mohan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c5725f9a-3a43-4969-baed-e340fd7a881f"},{"objectId":"64ca54934097077ac1cfc568","name":"Ramesh","lastName":"Raju","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5a9f9aeb-5310-4ca0-b34c-4b346ef19274"},{"objectId":"64ca54934097077ac1cfc567","name":"Dharam","lastName":"Buddhi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6e8df443-bf8f-4531-8bb7-8cc2799690de"},{"objectId":"64ca54934097077ac1cfc566","name":"J.

Since knowledge is the main production factor and output of these companies, it is essential to achieve a better understanding of how they manage this resource. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted on a sample of Polish small and micro KIBS operating in various service sectors. A cluster analysis of the data was performed, to categorize the sample according to the KM attitude of the companies. Three main groups of companies were identified, varying in terms of their levels of “knowledge needs”, “intensity of use” of KM practices and “perceived barriers to KM implementation”. This classification is shown to characterize attitudes towards KM to a higher level of statistical significance than do structural characteristics. The survey was based on a single country sample. On the one hand, this provides consistency to the analysis. On the other hand, further insights can be obtained by a multi-national study. In addition, cluster analysis is exploratory in nature. The results provide useful insights for policy makers (to formulate policies for facilitating KM implementation in small KIBS) and managers (to reflect on the KM attitudes of their company). The statistical categorization of small and micro KIBS in terms of their KM attitude has been very rarely undertaken. Even the most recent investigations of KM issues used samples from large companies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058840090","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca54c64097077ac1cfc836","name":"Riccardo","lastName":"Ceccato","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"020373fa-aecb-43f5-904f-9993c1fe5522"},{"objectId":"64ca54c64097077ac1cfc835","name":"Enrico","lastName":"Scarso","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"61700808-1e5b-42ab-8ff6-03ccbfdba0b6"},{"objectId":"64ca54c64097077ac1cfc834","name":"Ettore","lastName":"Bolisani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2c1f2ed7-ee9a-49b3-8972-72b2d21c60a3"},{"objectId":"5e70925d878c28a0473946bb","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Zięba","uuid":"54B959F189D2DE2E4047C7D45FCF450C4C2FBB49341FBB52FEF4C6E7673054F3B1423590570B49645E194B831B5E29D2726E2C03607558D2EE9B440F1ACC2DCB","orcidId":"0000-0002-5138-9330","documentHash":"5c03f16f-6af1-4c6d-b808-45d69e686fbc"}],"doi":"10.1002/kpm.1723"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["GOOGLE EARTH ENGINE","IMPACT ASSESSMENT","LAND SURFACE TEMPERATURE","REMOTE SENSING & GIS","TIME SERIES ANALYSIS"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a4878c28a047399bc7","631bf6a975234038513c05cd","630830287523404ea24555d2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Time series analysis and impact assessment of the temperature changes on the vegetation and the water availability: A case study of Bakun-Murum Catchment Region in Malaysia","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547e864","mniswId":"25912","title":"Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2352-9385","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"bd52c4fa-f783-4b73-b812-ff23e7aafbad"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca55f04097077ac1cfdab4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["631bf6a975234038513c05cd","5e7092a4878c28a047399bc7","64ca55f04097077ac1cfdab5","630830287523404ea24555d2","64ca55f04097077ac1cfdab6","64ca55f04097077ac1cfdab7","64ca55f04097077ac1cfdab8","64ca55f04097077ac1cfdab9"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Bakun-Murum (BM) catchment region of the Rajang River Basin (RRB), Sarawak, Malaysia,\\nhas been under severe threat for the last few years due to urbanization, global warming, and climate\\nchange.

On this basis, it was checked whether the power of monarchs is a factor in the success and prosperity of monarchies. The author stated that there is no really strong monarch on the territory of Europe at the present stage, and almost all the countries considered are constitutional monarchies, where a monarch and his or her actions are significantly limited by constitution, traditions, laws, government and parliament. This is due to the fact that the heads of state in the democratic countries of Europe govern, but do not rule and do not manage, as well as instead perform nominal and symbolic roles. Oddly enough, this is one of the reasons for the success and prosperity of monarchies, although the hypothesis that the power of monarchs correlates with the development results and prosperity rating of certain states has not been directly proven."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058840097","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6507302e4097076fa827411b","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"8e399441-5b11-411b-98da-14c3edb3ef03"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"48-63","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.59861/ansgk.2353-8392.2022.2.pp48-63","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6507323e4097076fa8275f70","name":"Michał","lastName":"Białobłocki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8cc7e477-8d62-44b2-93a7-28e0edbd94d6"}],"doi":"10.59861/ansgk.2353-8392.2022.2.pp48-63"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":"978-83-66515-79-6","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Perspectives on LSP teacher training in Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":"Warszawa","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"650452054097072f2ae06630","editors":[{"objectId":"650452054097072f2ae06632","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Woźniak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9d637240-440b-4286-87b1-1670da85a4e0"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473afffd","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kic-Drgas","uuid":"E19B957C6FD5E58A6F5875C0C5FD3D7CF543A2B7386FFFFEB911110F09CE47E2C993922CC2942A7FD228BF453C6FAA20330D53109666319053D15EFDEFEF392C","orcidId":"0000-0002-8133-9190","documentHash":"ffc42864-6a93-47d5-bd57-d9be10448ffe"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["5e7093bd878c28a0473afffd","650452054097072f2ae06632"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058840100","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"650452054097072f2ae06631","mniswId":null,"name":"FRSE Publishing","documentHash":"0eccb094-b77f-44d7-a945-efe4462f7524"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frse.org.pl/eksperci-dla-frse/languages-for-specific-purposes-challenges-in-teaching-on-the-example-of-german-philology","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Self-esteem","Purchase decisions","Instagram","COVID-19"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd41","uid":"bc81RPyqL4Br7M4bOIzt-xA","uuid":"2d00d06e-140e-46c4-be04-bf77ae1c73ca","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd41","parentUuid":"2d00d06e-140e-46c4-be04-bf77ae1c73ca","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd41","rootUuid":"2d00d06e-140e-46c4-be04-bf77ae1c73ca","name":"Akademia Ekonomiczno-Humanistyczna w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709274878c28a047395f1d","5e7092a8878c28a04739a1b0"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The influence of Instagram on mental well-being and purchasing decisions in a pandemic","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454798df","mniswId":"19301","title":"Technological Forecasting and Social Change","doi":null,"issn":"0040-1625","eissn":"1873-5509","websiteLink":"","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"a2365e18-aeec-48fb-8342-704eaa01903b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64b14a8540970704a434119d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709274878c28a047395f1d","5e7092a8878c28a04739a1b0"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The main aim of the study was to investigate Instagram’s impact on users’ mental well-being and behavior (including purchasing activity) during the pandemic. The study was conducted on 359 respondents who stated that they used Instagram regularly. Three questionnaire tools were implemented: the Instagram Usage Questionnaire (original tool), the MSEI Multidimensional Self-Esteem Inventory by O’Brien and Epstein, and the Personal Data Sheet (original tool). Significant negative correlations were obtained between self-esteem components: self-control, competence, lovability, identity integration, defensive self-enhancement, frequency, and intensity of social media use. The respondents declared no negative influence of Instagram on their current mental well-being. One group (21.2%) considered the influence beneficial to their mental well-being. Observing others’ Instagram profiles did not influence the activity of (most) users, including changing appearance, lifestyle, or making purchase decisions. Moreover, most respondents declared not making purchase decisions based on Instagram ads. The analysis of differences between purchasing and nonpurchasing groups showed significant discrepancies in these self-esteem components: likability, personal power, and competence. Significant differences regarding physical attractiveness, overall self-esteem, lovability, likability, personal power, competence, and vitality were reported between men who made purchase decisions based on Instagram messages and those who did not. Among women, these differences concerned only defensive self-enhancement. The results confirm that prolonged/frequent use of social media can have a negative impact on self-esteem (including identity integration and self-control). However, a positive impact of Instagram on mental wellbeing was observed. Following (mostly) acquaintances (not influencers) and not undertaking activity (regarding purchasing decisions of Instagram-advertised products) may indicate emerging changes in society due to the pandemic."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058840103","journalIssue":{"objectId":"642d497e40970741c697b189","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"174","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"8933e02e-bc37-4197-8984-9f09b4e0cfdb"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"174","pagesFromTo":"121287","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0040162521007216?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092a8878c28a04739a1b0","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Awruk","uuid":"E923E1CC9F1D8F273503D61C79D757FDFD040216EFE547A1867C194A85BBE04BF42F97039887D379F15485FE8BB36D50504A1D7AB33AC708A9D0D1799EFFF60D","orcidId":"0000-0003-3068-6309","documentHash":"69be7db6-0099-4cf0-9fee-c38dc6f72434"},{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a047395f1d","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Staniewski","uuid":"160EE90C40FFA7AEBCCF024ACFB125D5CA4936971BF3FB5A97E68E3E54F4BCBF089116DFC09A272DF3D49C6785A9CCF110402883D4BA67970D9217F5735D1F4B","orcidId":"0000-0003-1913-6007","documentHash":"d32ff4a8-5ca8-4a65-ab14-0d57fecd5c77"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.techfore.2021.121287"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"64b503984097071d4722fe23","doi":null,"title":"Bilans

Forest, due to its unique character, requires a specific approach to the management of this area, inclu\u0002ding fire risk assessment. This is particularly important with regard to the recent bark beetle (Ips typographus) outbreak, \nwhich has contributed to the local dieback of Norway spruce stands on a total area of approx. 11.5 thousand hectares during \nthe 2012–2022 period. The article presents the most important results of the implemented projects related to the fire protec\u0002tion of the Białowieża Forest.\nThe analysis of potential fire hazard should take into account both dead wood and the impact of tree stand dieback, which \nresulted in the emergence of grasses as the dominant plant cover that poses a high risk not only for the possibility of fire, but \nalso for its rapid spread. During 2012–2022 fuelload of the studied areas increased almost sevenfold compared\nto 2011 (15.8 t/ha), reaching an average maximum value of 108.9 t/ha in 2017. However, the progressive decomposition of \ndead wood and the decreasing amount of fine combustible material (fire-active biomass) caused that the fire risk in turn gra\u0002dually decreased. After a period of about 10 years after the stand dieback, the fire risk caused by the dead wood left behind \nhas reached a minimum level and the possibility of initiating the burning of such material was significantly reduced. Despite \nthe decreasing fire hazard from dead wood, the fire risk will remain high for many years due to the presence of grass cover, \nespecially during periods when it dries out.\nThe analysis of the fire risk in the Białowieża Forest caused by the spruce bark beetle outbreak formed the basis for the \ndevelopment of the \"Fire Protection and Forest Fire Fighting Plan for the Polish Part of the Białowieża Forest Transboundary \nWorld Heritage Site\", which includes: fire risk assessment, fire detection, communication and alarm system, fire roads, water \nstores, equipment for fire fighting and rules for conducting rescue and fire-fighting operations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058840116","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"83","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.ibles.pl/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/10.48538_lpb-2023-0001.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"627488cd75234003501255b8","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Tyburski","uuid":"7A20605C6A6BA39CCEE7BB785F86FFE81F895A14B9DD7BAAE3ABA3116ABC2E7E7BD5311FF6AF0E4319D709807C7A35C5E849E5D952765BCCAF6FC96E9E9FEAAE","orcidId":"0000-0001-8543-3566","documentHash":"ad278100-477d-4e33-b5eb-9571254df778"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b599a","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Kwiatkowski","uuid":"5A3CB0A99278AAAF84AE77AEF7853DD4911E6E65D1C269227D0ACEEF997D142878DDADBBAE9715D1B1E5D55D5509452A5C14FD2AD6708C5AAF65673E53CAA361","orcidId":"0000-0003-1661-9847","documentHash":"eaa42c31-6efb-4675-b28f-f47a8df5c22a"},{"objectId":"5e7092e3878c28a04739ed4f","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Szczygieł","uuid":"CBB1663838C9A72920790087DD7979E0E6FDED5C851D7677E403FE2847826F9E16D80A8CE69530874BDB202A8ABF9DE98356696A8F6AF0B9A606AFBC31B1E2B7","orcidId":"0000-0001-8008-7430","documentHash":"cf190848-c03f-4424-bd8a-72eae315fef1"}],"doi":"10.48538/lpb-2023-0001"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["water quality","irrigation","quarry lake","water reservoir","quarry","SAR","TDS","EC"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Assessment of the Quality and Quantity of Water Retained in Closed Granite Quarries with the View to Mitigate the Effects of Droughts in Agriculture","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a9a","mniswId":"20224","title":"Water (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":"2073-4441","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f45dfe6a-c51f-4cba-a665-a984d2f35671"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-16","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6504317d40970739aa3fcf83","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7091fc878c28a04738e1e0","658d1d9d4097076c1456e0ae"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents the results of bathymetric measurements of quarry lakes located in inactive granite quarries (Poland, Lower Silesia, County Strzelin), which were used, among other reasons, to determine the surface area, depth, and volume of water retained in the analysed quarry lakes. The usability of water in quarry lakes for agricultural irrigation was also assessed, based on the FAO Guidelines and the PN-84/C-04635 standard. The average surface area of the analysed quarry lakes was 0.99 ha, the average depth was 6.0 m, and the maximum depth was 14.3 m. At the same time, the total volume of the retained water amounted to 307.8 thousand m3, which accounts for 10.6% of the retention capacity of water reservoirs situated in the catchment of the Oława River. The average values of water quality indicators were as follows: electrical conductivity—0.332 mS × cm−1; sodium adsorption ratio—0.56; total dissolved solids—212.4 mg/L; water pH—7.8; BOD5—2.4 mgO2/L. The mean concentrations of ions had the following values: nitrates—0.91 mgN-NO3−/L; sulphates—176.3 mg SO42−/L; chlorides—36.56 mg Cl−/L; sodium ions—14.8 mg Na+/L; calcium—41.3 mg Ca2+/L; magnesium—7.48 mg Mg2+/L; manganese—0.1 mg Mn/L; and iron—0.01 mg Fe/L. The concentrations of water quality indicators that were recorded for the analysed Strzelin quarry lakes were similar to those observed in natural lakes and uncharged water bodies. Water from the analysed quarry lakes met (with some minor limitations) the requirements that enable them to be used for agricultural irrigation. The volume of the water retained in the analysed quarry lakes constitutes an important element of the total balance of water retained in all the reservoirs, ponds, and all Strzelin quarry lakes situated in the catchment of the Oława River, accounting for 10.6% of the total volume of retained water. The article presents the innovative concept of the possibility of using water from quarry lakes in agriculture, based on their quantity and quality and the requirements for the purpose for which they will be used, e.g., for agricultural irrigation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058840118","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-26","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/15/4/782","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"658d1d9d4097076c1456e0ae","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c9ad55a1-dcdc-4110-ba42-659292b59643"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e1e0","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Jawecki","uuid":"C2499464A8C40402A1CA991A09745DB97071F18FB7847D6BE2960E2C6A2D411FE8050C9EF807E7A93105A89F2A902DFD232D126CBAA49043407F84A83E82F906","orcidId":"0000-0002-4277-0412","documentHash":"6246728d-fc9b-4e1e-8c77-ad6ce038e15a"}],"doi":"10.3390/w15040782"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["proces","polskie

is a universal phenomenon and is a culture-creating field closely related to other fields of art. Hence, experiencing and feeling identity are also conditioned by the proper formation of architectural objects, which are carriers specific values which co-decide about the possibility of this experience occurring in connection with a specific place and the fulfilment of a specific need in it. In the era of ubiquitous thoughtless consumption and common avoidance of the written word, objects belonging to the material culture that architecture co-creates become essential objects in the process of conveying ideas and specific content. Belonging to a place, cultural group, community or regional community is reflected in consciously designed spatial forms. However, in order to ensure this awareness, the above-mentioned issues should be included in the general education as part of expanding knowledge about regional planning, but also the knowledge of regional architectural forms and settlement systems. The Pomeranian home experience can be related to two contrasting situations. First of all - a former Kashubian village with its regional buildings, where the house was a wooden Kashubian cottage. This architecture, arising from local conditions and culturally embedded in the consciousness of Kashubians, strengthened the sense of identification with the inhabited region and a specific place. Secondly - a contemporary Pomeranian housing estate, built up with multi-frame, prefabricated blocks. It seems that this type of development, devoid of cultural roots in regional traditions, impoverishes personal identification with the inhabited building / apartment. The space of housing estates, as well as neglected buildings in some villages await revalorization. A lost identity can be searched for by caring for valuable housing based on knowledge of architecture and regional settlement. The authors will present a publication made as part of the project entitled \"ZASPA: house in a block of flats. The spaces of architecture. \" In line with its assumptions, the issue of the residence of inmates in the region was raised. The book entitled \"Block and hut: wandering\" is an educational material for children from higher grades of primary schools. It provides knowledge about the regional form of the Kashubian house and settlement forms typical of the area. At the same time, contemporary settlement forms are shown - housing estates."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058840134","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2574","pagesFromTo":"070010","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af848","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kurkowska","uuid":"C0CEC3F1286E1B01D2A9C14365707364EDA28575AECAAD0BF3C8F24BF63E709243D921ECF3E000BB5B26271EDAB1A7698EA803FFF85C53949AB84613FBA505D0","orcidId":"0000-0002-1380-4628","documentHash":"23b39115-4de4-4991-8982-e8bfdeb19c87"},{"objectId":"5e70925d878c28a047394679","name":"Robert","lastName":"Idem","uuid":"15D2E804A7EEF1EB0EA3C9347EB3EE168C655AC9FB6A4E415BE4C1FCCFDFA02B242767914D68007C6F4E7D21CA45DE3D238BB542FCA864CC5954D449EF88B2F0","orcidId":"0000-0002-0199-9106","documentHash":"85c679a6-1f60-472c-95e2-6fe9966580f0"}],"doi":"10.1063/5.0105885"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Uwe Wesel"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f8f7","uid":"b08jkqDWXnVidLLRD_KUh7A","uuid":"245338e7-fceb-4fa1-ab8e-bc9c25278590","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","parentUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","rootUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","name":"Instytut Nauk Prawnych","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709277878c28a047396249"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Uwe Wesel, Wozu Latein, wenn man gesund ist?

The advancement of the natural sciences at that time provided scholars and thinkers with a new perspective and a better tool for getting to know the universe. Thanks to this, utopian visions created at that time were more daring and ambitious than their predecessors. It is no coincidence that the first cosmic utopias were created at this time, positioning ideal communities outside the earth. Russian authors Alexander Bogdanov and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky stand out among the creators of such utopias. These two renowned scientists, considered pioneers in their respective areas, presented within the span of slightly more than a decade surprisingly similar visions, one of them taking place on Mars and the other in the cosmic space. What sets the two narratives apart is the role they attribute to science and technology. Regardless of the fact that both utopias are characterized by a high level of scientific development and technological advancement, the scientific-technological factor is a vital determinant of the idealized community in only one of them. The key to understanding this discrepancy may be found in the works of British writer H. G. Wells."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058840144","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"33","pagesFromTo":"36-53","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093c3878c28a0473b05df","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Pomarański","uuid":"D3BFBA95E34CBC758C535EA7011D909842CDED95CA204EA34A7F10488B2211613F9F848D13959427E9AF643A5A91C185DC190A303DEF11184733B521FA76C215","orcidId":"0000-0001-5008-2612","documentHash":"356814e3-feb8-4b9c-bc7d-0deb90d3d2b2"}],"doi":"10.5325/utopianstudies.33.1.0036"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COLLISIONS","ERGODIC THEOREM","FRAGMENTATION","MOLECULAR DYNAMICS","QUANTUM CHEMISTRY SIMULATIONS"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709388878c28a0473ac1f0"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Non-ergodic fragmentation upon collision-induced activation of cysteine–water cluster cations","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547925d","mniswId":"16075","title":"Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics","doi":null,"issn":"1463-9076","eissn":"1463-9084","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"4612b607-18ad-41ad-a3eb-93115aaa86dc"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca56344097077ac1cfdedb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ca56344097077ac1cfdedc","64ca56344097077ac1cfdedd","5e709388878c28a0473ac1f0","64ca56344097077ac1cfdede","64ca56344097077ac1cfdedf","64ca56344097077ac1cfdee0","64ca56344097077ac1cfdee1"]},"issue":"7","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cysteine–water cluster cations Cys(H2O)3,6\\n+ and Cys(H2O)3,6H+ are assembled in He droplets and probed\\nby tandem mass spectrometry with collision-induced activation.

Study and application of these materials are bringing together scientists and engineers from physics, chemistry, and materials science. The diversity of each of these disciplines comes with perspectives and jargon that may be confusing to those outside of the individual fields, which can result in miscommunication of important aspects of research. In this Perspective, we provide examples of research and characterization taken from these different fields to provide a framework for classifying the differences between compositionally complex oxides, high entropy oxides, and entropy stabilized oxides, which is intended to bring a common language to this emerging area. We highlight the critical importance of understanding a material’s crystallinity, composition, and mixing length scales in determining its true definition."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058840151","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"110902","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca55ba4097077ac1cfd714","name":"Ayako","lastName":"Yamamoto","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"81d1fe65-f91c-4301-9788-b3fc4395459e"},{"objectId":"64ca55ba4097077ac1cfd713","name":"Thomas","lastName":"Ward","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d7c2e60e-416f-4a98-8b34-0f14aab4c0c8"},{"objectId":"64ca55ba4097077ac1cfd712","name":"Cormac","lastName":"Toher","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2519e5a5-a009-48bc-85c7-f2c1d291f8c8"},{"objectId":"64ca55ba4097077ac1cfd711","name":"Susan B.","lastName":"Sinnott","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8a6e2212-fd98-4375-a2af-e191ef27f6fe"},{"objectId":"64ca55ba4097077ac1cfd710","name":"Christina M.","lastName":"Rost","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9b364cd4-4d42-426c-a26c-ed275cfafae6"},{"objectId":"64ca55ba4097077ac1cfd70f","name":"Katharine","lastName":"Page","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a713eacf-66ec-4528-9667-218a6ecafffd"},{"objectId":"64ca55ba4097077ac1cfd70e","name":"Brianna","lastName":"Musico","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9b90be66-fb14-4ef3-aa1f-bffca081709d"},{"objectId":"64ca55ba4097077ac1cfd70d","name":"Scott J.","lastName":"Mccormack","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"66dc9981-a8b0-4db9-9de1-8ec4b060c980"},{"objectId":"64ca55ba4097077ac1cfd70c","name":"Alessandro R.","lastName":"Mazza","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bf3c2228-68d6-4532-b214-12ecd50c358a"},{"objectId":"64ca55ba4097077ac1cfd70b","name":"Veerle","lastName":"Keppens","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5ed96356-5b8b-4356-92a1-c861cad4d7f9"},{"objectId":"64ca55ba4097077ac1cfd70a","name":"Matthew","lastName":"Brahlek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b42467b1-4220-4594-888e-021ab3902216"},{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a047398fe0","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Mielewczyk-Gryń","uuid":"8B5E0CE606A52EFD7E90A30E59328129BEA9D0ABC61C95B098192F912A1188916161324C17E9CA4DD7E9702795330E91F1C021745D5E04C475FD21E1AC1F0F87","orcidId":"0000-0001-6795-3840","documentHash":"5e4e778a-e0c0-425c-bae1-b0de5b94a527"},{"objectId":"5e70925d878c28a047394641","name":"Maria","lastName":"Gazda","uuid":"7F309D2ED5F6E87FB3C6FA12FE1F87BC4BADAA7C5CD733314950BD31B2642FF825565F798A279D8A79FD64344943A4EF7572120FB6631FF59109C4CD8DDBE963","orcidId":"0000-0001-6193-7815","documentHash":"8fc079e8-02ba-4024-b42f-4d464cdd5bce"}],"doi":"10.1063/5.0122727"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["DETECTABILITY","DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY","INDISTINGUISHABLE DYNAMICS","OBSERVABILITY","UNCERTAIN BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEM"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709481878c28a0473be9e5","602f34a39543c7410626f1f2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"An observability and detectability analysis for non-linear uncertain CSTR model of biochemical processes","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":null,"issn":"2045-2322","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca559f4097077ac1cfd53c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602f34a39543c7410626f1f2","5e709481878c28a0473be9e5"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The problem of proving observability/detectability properties for selected non-linear uncertain model of biochemical processes has been addressed in this paper.

But do these descriptions have a deeper meaning? Do they reveal a common psychological dynamic? Or are they merely a mode of things about phenomena that have little in common? Bringing together world-leading psychologists from a variety of disciplines, the book uses a brand-new model to examine different expressions of extremism, at different levels of analysis (brain, hormones, and behavior), in order not merely to describe such behaviors but also to explain their occurrence, and the conditions under which they may be likely to emerge. Also including suggestions for ways in which extremism could be counteracted, and to what extent it appears to be harmful to individuals and society, this is essential reading for students and academics in psychology and behavioral sciences."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058843090","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb75f","mniswId":"2100","name":"Routledge","documentHash":"64cc346c-fb88-4618-a71a-f3105e672a66"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/279188","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Prokocim","historia mówiona"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["oral history","Prokocim"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-67497-09-1","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944e878c28a0473ba2b3"]}],"type":"BOOK","title":"...wiadomo, że tutaj się dobrze mieszkało... : Stary Prokocim we wspomnieniach mieszkańców : praca zbiorowa","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":true,"translationToPolish":null,"translationFromPolish":null,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ccab344097077ac1d79097","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70944e878c28a0473ba2b3"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058843092","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8d3","mniswId":"56100","name":"Towarzystwo Wydawnicze Historia Iagellonica","documentHash":"5b981c5a-35a1-490e-becd-0da74bdfba7d"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/304203","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70944e878c28a0473ba2b3","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Więch","uuid":"37469172922BEA40862B14B898DB41B40DB934202E7265AA649B9ECC65EBC2ADBEB1B61D98DDDF00BAEA33021C03923A0D50D72A095E39316E5E304AD7402ED0","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"363352d1-cbe7-44ef-951d-2d0c7de84658"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Weight","Bariatric chair","Chair construction","User weight","Wooden chairs","Designing"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a644a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Designing chairs for users with high body weight","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477389","mniswId":"2528","title":"BioResources","doi":null,"issn":"1930-2126","eissn":"1930-2126","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"cc8ee234-9ca9-4942-ad81-227eb20b84af"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64cb638640970748848f04bc","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64cb638640970748848f04bd","64cb638640970748848f04be","64cb638640970748848f04bf","64cb638640970748848f04c0","64cb638640970748848f04c1","5e709347878c28a0473a644a"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The relationship between the functional dimensions of the furniture and a user’s anthropometric dimensions is crucial for safety and functionality.

Such components are expected to improve the stiffness and strength properties of the chair structure, and it provides the possibilities to a chair design with improved ergonomic parameters. To increase rigidity and reinforce the frame structure of a chair for obese users, the side stretchers, middle braces inserted under seat and armrests are used. The main goal of the different structural designs of chair frames is to minimize internal forces acting in the structural components of the chair. The finite element method (FEM) was used to determine the internal forces and stress-strain state in the structural elements of the chair, starting with the standard design of the chair frame and comparing different design variants. A synergistic effect is obtained, making the bariatric chair durable and ergonomic, without stigmatizing its users."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058843095","journalIssue":{"objectId":"64709ea34097076e9c41bc72","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"18","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"afb4979f-7ee0-4796-8258-7e702d8ba62a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"5309-5324","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://bioresources.cnr.ncsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/BioRes_18_3_5309_Hitka_NLGLS_Design_Chairs_Users_High_Body_Weight_22604.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64cb638640970748848f04c1","name":"Denisa","lastName":"Lizoňová","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"11303294-7f23-4ee2-a77e-04be2630a66f"},{"objectId":"64cb638640970748848f04c0","name":"Miloš","lastName":"Gejdoš","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"12c5404a-85f5-48f5-b7be-0d4a543da645"},{"objectId":"64cb638640970748848f04bf","name":"Nadežda","lastName":"Langová","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7598791c-b63e-43b4-81ef-1b9deecdffc1"},{"objectId":"64cb638640970748848f04be","name":"Milan","lastName":"Naď","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b1d6ce92-8ae4-4417-b55f-f7ba90e0818d"},{"objectId":"64cb638640970748848f04bd","name":"Miloš","lastName":"Hitka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ea9edcae-9618-47b8-bbc4-adb49995fea8"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a644a","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Sydor","uuid":"17AFBAE010FC15C20EE05A4C92B7D8B0F99B24F699F8F704E6481AC35A08C5ABB8EE42B1B1EEDF7C76D0C5045D3E23EA1ADA7FA1F9E72773AE3A332AFDC29BEB","orcidId":"0000-0003-0076-3190","documentHash":"aad7a03d-146b-4b7e-bf42-1f28abe860ba"}],"doi":"10.15376/biores.18.3.5309-5324"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CURCUMINZNIIDFTMOLECULAR DOCKINGMOLECULAR DYNAMIC SIMULATIONRMSDRMSFRADIUS OF GYRATIONSASAHYDROGEN BONDS"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61a83db87523402fabe26d0e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"An insight into the mixed quantum mechanical-molecular dynamics simulation of a ZnII-Curcumin complex with a chosen DNA sequence that supports experimental DNA binding investigations","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c28514547818a","mniswId":"8662","title":"International Journal of Biological Macromolecules","doi":null,"issn":"0141-8130","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d8406c23-7ec9-462d-a028-2033a7b65cec"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca58b34097077ac1d0075a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ca58b34097077ac1d0075b","61a83db87523402fabe26d0e","64ca58b34097077ac1d0075c"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"An important aspect of research pertaining to Curcumin (HCur) is the need to arrest its degradation in aqueous solution and in biological milieu. This may be achieved through complex formation with metal ions. For this reason, a complex of HCur was prepared with ZnII, that is not likely to be active in redox pathways, minimizing further complications. The complex is monomeric, tetrahedral, with one HCur, an acetate and a molecule of water bound to ZnII. It arrests degradation of HCur to a considerable extent that was realized by taking it in phosphate buffer and in biological milieu. The structure was obtained by DFT calculations. Stable adduct formation was identified between optimized structures of HCur and [Zn(Cur)] with DNA (PDB ID: 1BNA) through experiments validated with multiscale modeling approach. Molecular docking studies provide 2D and 3D representations of binding of HCur and [Zn(Cur)] through different non-covalent interactions with the nucleotides of the chosen DNA. Through molecular dynamics simulation, a detailed understanding of binding pattern and key structural characteristics of the generated DNA-complex was obtained following analysis by RMSD, RMSF, radius of gyration, SASA and aspects like formation of hydrogen bonds. Experimental studies provide binding constants for [Zn(Cur)] with calf thymus DNA at 25 °C that effectively helps one to realize its high affinity towards DNA. In the absence of an experimental binding study of HCur with DNA, owing to its tendency to degrade in solution, a theoretical analysis of the binding of HCur to DNA is extremely helpful. Besides, both experimental and simulated binding of [Zn(Cur)] to DNA may be considered as a case of pseudo-binding of HCur to DNA. In a way, such studies on interaction with DNA helps one to identify HCur's affinity for cellular target DNA, not realized through experiments. The entire investigation is an understanding of experimental and theoretical approaches that has been compared continuously, being particularly useful when a molecule's interaction with a biological target cannot realized experimentally."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058843097","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"245","pagesFromTo":"125305","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca58b34097077ac1d0075c","name":"Saurabh","lastName":"Das","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e7160147-aaba-4f3a-8908-76efa43ee700"},{"objectId":"64ca58b34097077ac1d0075b","name":"Tanmoy","lastName":"Saha","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"38f6bc9a-e053-47b0-9a36-711f66511bd1"},{"objectId":"61a83db87523402fabe26d0e","name":"Subrahmanyam","lastName":"Sappati","uuid":"3E419920EDC064378A0CACC5D6ED6FC5A20D3E39AB0A502A62BC0E5702C7DF3B4318099A0BFF3DDA5CA7DB4775C5B313D106DB15BD14D0DD444251C7E0C51744","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"51c01896-518e-4a3f-9b23-d2cacd25f5c6"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2023.125305"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["dane

cementless implants are now widely used clinically, implant debonding still occur and is difficult to anticipate. Assessing the biomechanical strength of the bone–implant interface can help improving the understanding of osseointegration phenomena and thus preventing surgical failures. A dedicated and standardized implant model was considered. The samples were tested using a mode III cleavage device to assess the mechanical strength of the bone-implant interface by combining experimental and numerical approaches. Four rough (Sa = 24.5 μm) osseointegrated coin-shaped implants were left in sheep cortical bone during 15 weeks of healing time. Each sample was experimentally rotated at 0.03◦/sec until complete rupture of the interface. The\\nmaximum values of the torque were comprised between 0.48 and 0.72 Nm, while a significant increase of the normal force from 7-12 N to 31–43 N was observed during the bone-implant interface debonding, suggesting the generation of bone debris at the bone-implant interface. The experimental results were compared to an isogeometric finite element model describing the adhesion and debonding phenomena through a modified Coulomb’s law, based on a varying friction coefficient to represent the transition from an unbroken to a broken bone-implant interface. A good agreement was found between numerical and experimental torques, with numerical friction coefficients decreasing from 8.93 to 1.23 during the bone-implant interface rupture, which constitutes a validation of this model to simulate the debonding of an osseointegrated bone-implant interface subjected to\\ntorsion."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058843101","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"141","pagesFromTo":"105787","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca58474097077ac1d0008b","name":"Guillaume","lastName":"Haiat","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c5b4c9b2-658e-4741-8cc5-86244b5751d5"},{"objectId":"64ca58474097077ac1d0008a","name":"Patrick","lastName":"Karasinski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"35c88dff-84fa-42ee-b677-e0155f663ccc"},{"objectId":"64ca58474097077ac1d00089","name":"Vladimir","lastName":"Brailovski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b84c31a8-dbbf-44a1-82fe-dd0fa1536866"},{"objectId":"64ca58474097077ac1d00088","name":"Vu-Hieu","lastName":"Nguyen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"148ad76c-8dcd-4110-babe-43b0b3772b3d"},{"objectId":"64ca58474097077ac1d00087","name":"Elsa","lastName":"Vennat","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"05343231-e005-4647-9e7b-0e1805dda6b1"},{"objectId":"64ca58474097077ac1d00086","name":"Katharina","lastName":"Immel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1e2ad33c-9f09-4628-9502-116d7e63e8fe"},{"objectId":"64ca58474097077ac1d00085","name":"Sophie","lastName":"Le Cann","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"badb5d6b-29ce-4d15-a4e2-0e3f354c9759"},{"objectId":"64ca58474097077ac1d00084","name":"Yoann","lastName":"Hériveaux","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cdf51cd4-1e74-4470-bf39-91fc22883b0a"},{"objectId":"602cd10c9543c7410626e3cd","name":"Roger","lastName":"Sauer","uuid":"AE79EF0202F1E1D8ED6F00FF375D0F9F8A32C1695D099D6F2C0F4D3519BCFA0F22C8D0ACC3909ACB769CEC4EB140258D51091B0BF3081CC0A52734180A012F88","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6c2e382d-24b1-4952-b8b6-dc23a2bd3bb3"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jmbbm.2023.105787"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["FORCED CONVECTION","MONO NANOFLUIDS"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709248878c28a047392ff2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Experimental Investigations of Forced Convection of Nanofluids in Smooth, Horizontal, Round Tubes: A Review","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1073","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca58914097077ac1d00547","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709248878c28a047392ff2","64ca58914097077ac1d00548"]},"issue":"11","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A comprehensive review of published works dealing with experimental studies of forced\\nconvection heat transfer of nanofluids is presented.

It belongs to large settlements of the Middle Neolithic Funnel Beaker culture (TRB) and was occupied ca. 3600-3200 BCE. The aim of the research was to assess the role of plants in the life of the settlers, including domesticated and wild food resources as well as possibilities of non-alimentary use of herbal plants. The connection of two types of plant macroremains, namely seeds/fruits and wood charcoal, found in three different parts of the site was done to evaluate possibility of spatial palaeoeconomic differentiation between the sectors of the settlement. The site is exceptional among the other TRB dry sites studied due to high quantities of flax seeds and pulses, namely lentil, although the most numerous were wheat remains, mostly emmer grains. The high number of charred seeds of gromwell, the crop weed but also a source of purple dye, which was linked to flax seeds in statistical analysis, could suggest production of purple or red textiles at the site. High significance of textile production can be supported by discovery of a broad spectrum of utensils, representing all chaîne opératoire stages. Nonetheless, there are no convincing archaeological premises according specialisation of textile production at the settlement. Taking into account the proportions of main groups of plants among the three studied parts of the site, some differences were noticed, which could indicate the diversification of past activities at the settlement. The detailed study of other categories of findings and exact spatial-temporal scheme of settlement development are necessary to confirm this diversification and assess whether it mirrors higher material and social status of people living in the central part of the settlement than those living in the NW and SE parts."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058843111","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"49","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/327129","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094f9878c28a0473c8409","name":"Marta","lastName":"Korczyńska","uuid":"78D380F25BFF91419B8EA5DF0E5866E47971E0FD080F19B557B70D36C9E6163A49042EC6A92890B97A63A943DA35562640C593CB623A0D9DFF687F71D1E9A838","orcidId":"0000-0003-2943-7276","documentHash":"49943232-4fa1-4a49-ba85-b91717dfa9a5"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b917f","name":"Magda","lastName":"Kapcia","uuid":"9522FCF9ED561E82F9F71D4392B873EDE2A02B78539342D39FEB91810D96134D6CFE5CCAE4E51B817C64078D9540218170A14C992AD921ACF9FE1160E0E13528","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7e3a6448-0f80-474a-b592-eb2ffbe3e810"},{"objectId":"5e709408878c28a0473b5208","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Moskal

Obecnie w znaczącej mierze status gwiazdy jest w znaczącej mierze determinowany medialną widocznością, ale także determinowany zwrotem demotycznym, w którym to publiczność orzeka, kto może być gwiazdą.

In the next years, the development and implementation of IoT systems will be very dynamic. It can be seen that the solutions of LTE – NB-IoT (Long Term Evolution – Narrowband IoT) transmission devices are implemented in a wide range of terrestrial solutions, e.g. smart grids. This paper aims to analyse the possibility of the use of NB-IoT technology for maritime communication applications and partially, for some maritime safety solutions, based on signal coverage analysis at sea. An interesting approach is the comparison of the results of NB-IoT coverage to the classic cellular LTE based communication systems. Proposed solutions are based on the practical implementation of a designed specialised data concentrator with implemented gateway and radio modems, for both NB-IoT technology as well as LTE. In the paper, analyses of radio link budget and propagation loss models for sea environment are presented.

Numerical\\ncalculations were performed with ANSYS Fluent.

The long-term stability of these implants is achieved by bone growing around and into the rough surface of the implant, a process called osseointegration. However, debonding of the bone–implant interface can still occur due to aseptic implant loosening and insufficient osseointegration, which may have dramatic consequences. The aim of this work is to describe a new 3D finite element frictional contact formulation\\nfor the debonding of partially osseointegrated implants. The contact model is based on a modified Coulomb friction law by Immel et al. (2020), that takes into account the tangential debonding of the bone-implant interface. This model is extended in the direction normal to the bone-implant interface by considering a cohesive zone model, to account for adhesion phenomena in the normal direction and for adhesive friction of partially bonded interfaces. The model is applied to simulate the debonding of an acetabular cup implant. The influence of partial osseointegration and adhesive effects on the\\nlong-term stability of the implant is assessed. The influence of different patient- and implant-specific parameters such as the friction coefficient mu_b , the trabecular Young’s modulus E_b , and the interference fit IF is also analyzed, in order to determinethe optimal stability for different configurations. Furthermore, this work provides guidelines for future experimental and computational studies that are necessary for further parameter calibration."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058843131","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"133 - 158","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca58434097077ac1d0004b","name":"Guillaume","lastName":"Haiat","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7aa230f6-96cb-41f2-bf38-d98a1f76fa1f"},{"objectId":"64ca58434097077ac1d0004a","name":"Vu-Hieu","lastName":"Nguyen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"14697ec2-bf96-4259-b033-ffd7ac8bdab8"},{"objectId":"64ca58434097077ac1d00049","name":"Katharina","lastName":"Immel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"65a85743-2f51-4304-8a64-45fbf1d86777"},{"objectId":"602cd10c9543c7410626e3cd","name":"Roger","lastName":"Sauer","uuid":"AE79EF0202F1E1D8ED6F00FF375D0F9F8A32C1695D099D6F2C0F4D3519BCFA0F22C8D0ACC3909ACB769CEC4EB140258D51091B0BF3081CC0A52734180A012F88","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6c2e382d-24b1-4952-b8b6-dc23a2bd3bb3"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10237-022-01637-7"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["DATA SCARCITY","ERBIL","FLASH FLOODS","FLOOD MODELING","GIS"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f61dcad752340073806a9f6","5e709248878c28a04739306b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"GIS-based hydrodynamic modeling for urban flood mitigation in fast-growing regions: a case study of Erbil, Kurdistan Region of Iraq","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":null,"issn":"2045-2322","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca585b4097077ac1d001c6","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f61dcad752340073806a9f6","5e709248878c28a04739306b","64ca585b4097077ac1d001c7","64ca585b4097077ac1d001c8"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Floods threaten urban infrastructure, especially in residential neighborhoods and fast-growing regions. Flood hydrodynamic modeling helps identify flood-prone locations and improve mitigation plans' resilience. Urban floods pose special issues due to changing land cover and a lack of raw data. Using a GIS-based modeling interface, input files for the hydrodynamic model were developed. The physical basin's properties were identified using soil map data, Land Use Land Cover (LULC) maps, and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). So, the HEC-RAS 2-D hydrodynamic model was developed to estimate flood susceptibility and vulnerability in Erbil, Iraq. The case study examines the quality of flood modeling results using different DEM precisions. Faced with the difficulty, this study examines two building representation techniques: Building Block (BB) and Building Resistance (BR). The work presented here reveals that it is possible to apply the BR technique within the HEC-RAS 2-D to create urban flood models for regions that have a lack of data or poor data quality. Indeed, the findings confirmed that the inundated areas or areas where water accumulated in past rainfall events in Erbil are the same as those identified in the numerical simulations. The study's results indicate that the Erbil city is susceptible to flood hazards, especially in areas with low-lying topography and substantial precipitation. The study's conclusions can be utilized to plan and develop flood control structures, since it identified flood-prone areas of the city."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058843133","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"8935","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca585b4097077ac1d001c8","name":"Hasan Mohammed","lastName":"Hameed","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c88090b8-9d88-4840-8a83-53bd0c708788"},{"objectId":"64ca585b4097077ac1d001c7","name":"Mozafar","lastName":"Veysipanah","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cf98beb1-0dbf-4ca7-b166-5a87ad29ecc3"},{"objectId":"5f61dcad752340073806a9f6","name":"Andam","lastName":"Mustafa","uuid":"E5A3F705CCD366F95CD59B433E6C5034B00F4C4F8EFF32A0F2D71290D6540F924ACCF59E8197FEBD00E76E4C306467D9C6731817B1A7DA79E035DEA6D7E67A58","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"71ed2f7b-6f13-4fbe-bae8-0089b370bf67"},{"objectId":"5e709248878c28a04739306b","name":"Michał","lastName":"Szydłowski","uuid":"65E52D9B43D1F6E44A4628A6B87EEA00177A110BB13EB58C5863A95D5496C6FD3D8AF848986EF25E14D7F2BC44DF4F40E5B8D8CA9742BB398EB29D61BDF0EC4D","orcidId":"0000-0003-3409-591X","documentHash":"58423320-22e9-40c4-ae18-51438fcec7ac"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-36138-9"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"627266234097077af526bcee","doi":null,"title":"Od zwoju do e-booka : kulturotwórcza rola tekstów religijnych","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-7676-342-2","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/291539","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":null,"translationFromPolish":null,"bookProjectNCN":null,"bookProjectFNP":null,"bookProjectNPHR":null,"bookProjectUE":null},"documentHash":"14b36592-6723-4460-92b1-4844ce3a631d","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8a1","mniswId":"49200","name":"Polska Akademia Umiejętności","documentHash":"c9d1bbc7-5cbf-41f2-9b7f-4099713dd7b1"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709317878c28a0473a2bcc"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Kulturotwórcza rola tekstów religijnych : wielość perspektyw w kontekście Biblii","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ccb1b64097077ac1d81b68","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709317878c28a0473a2bcc"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058843136","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"13-27","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/291540","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709317878c28a0473a2bcc","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Plichta","uuid":"A6C42043ECD54FA924E6C08EE000F67B32161BF3428815A0CC42FC245C179D046F62EDDF7EADCEE34E85654710C83EA22816B234CAE692F11E7333C6CC85156D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ddecc63e-ecc8-45ee-be27-67173a038d1e"}],"doi":null}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA1ODg0MzEzNg=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
