The use of lighter boards saves material, but at the same time increases the risk of not meeting the guaranteed load capacity. Therefore, the answer to the question “in which layer the basis weight of the paper should be increased?” is not simple or obvious. The method proposed here makes it easy to understand which components and to what extent they affect the load-bearing capacity of packages of various dimensions. The use of numerical homogenization allows for a quick transformation of a cardboard sample, i.e., a representative volume element (RVE) into a flat plate structure with effective parameters describing the membrane and bending stiffness. On the other hand, the use of non-local sensitivity analysis makes it possible to find the relationship between the parameters of the paper and the load capacity of the packaging. The analytical procedures presented in our previous studies were used here to determine (1) the edge crush resistance, (2) critical load, and (3) the load capacity of corrugated cardboard packaging. The method proposed here allows for obtaining a comprehensive and hierarchical list of the parameters that play the most important role in the process of optimal packaging design."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058068323","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e7e0ed2467f05e29628319","year":"22","publishedYear":null,"volume":"3","number":"15","doi":null,"documentHash":"e8e27a94-bb5b-40b5-8e17-7faa5df4fbfb"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"720-1 - 720-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/3/720","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"618353b97523400564d8201b","name":"Damian","lastName":"Mrówczyński","uuid":"FF127074859D06E4C1AA4202FFEA0D807A0DEA7A91ED49B0FA0B8C54B33D63696DB1C4233BB6646D62386B3BFC6D2BFD325E69162A071D286E84560FFEEC2151","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"59ed3073-7196-4188-a9b9-63242619e2a0"},{"objectId":"5e7093a5878c28a0473ae6f4","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Garbowski","uuid":"C2B4DE757D8886907DAD1487B338EB3FFEFC81745770C595B50FE00A4709A2FF2A90E163029C241915F2629083E468C343504A15B14819FB7702EFA9344EBBF0","orcidId":"0000-0002-9588-2514","documentHash":"3b0e42a7-4e11-459a-813b-c6de44def90c"},{"objectId":"5e7093a5878c28a0473ae6ee","name":"Anna","lastName":"Knitter-Piątkowska","uuid":"5A9D70374F61EACC25E46DA14C1382718C7B9DD133EB743BFF9FC80E07DDBF259B9678D36BC566750F14BD381CF2DBA5EB458665189ABAAB33B833B8D4B25064","orcidId":"0000-0002-8082-6966","documentHash":"7c453f79-558f-4053-b60b-b292242c7690"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15030720"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["nutritional risk","elderly","lifestyle"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709442878c28a0473b90ca","5e709438878c28a0473b8570","5e70940c878c28a0473b56ba"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Differentiation of Nutritional Risk among Polish Seniors Based on Selected Lifestyle Characteristics","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790a2","mniswId":"15295","title":"Nutrients","doi":null,"issn":"2072-6643","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"249ff7e0-f443-46aa-b5c4-21f8cf400d2e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620dfb4d2467f02b135c6bee","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70940c878c28a0473b56ba","5e709438878c28a0473b8570","5e709442878c28a0473b90ca","662a3a3c40970762633a3b85"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Elderly people living in the community are a population group at high nutritional risk. The aim of this study was to assess the nutritional risk of Polish seniors in relation to the region of residence and selected lifestyle characteristics (alcohol consumption, smoking, sleep, physical activity). The SCREEN-14 (Seniors in the Community: Risk Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition) questionnaire was used to assess nutritional risk. The questionnaire was conducted among 320 Polish adults aged 60 and older. The snowball method was used to select the sample. The study was conducted from May to July 2021 in two regions. Cluster analysis with agglomeration technique was used to identify the association between categories of variables describing nutritional risk level, demographic characteristics, and lifestyle characteristics. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between identified nutritional risk levels and selected lifestyle characteristics. Men over 75 and seniors living in smaller towns have been shown to be at higher nutritional risk. High nutritional risk was significantly more common among those who consumed alcohol, smoked tobacco, and had less than six hours or more than nine hours of sleep per day. In addition, low to moderate physical activity was associated with higher nutritional risk. The identification of factors that increase nutritional risk among seniors can support the planning of ways to prevent nutritional problems in this age group."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058068324","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/3/607/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a3a3c40970762633a3b85","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Suliga","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b1274160-85a3-4961-ac4d-5cd1f5c8085c"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b90ca","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Mazurkiewicz","uuid":"FCC891B955BA9AD278A0D104EC5F8763316BEF79EFC5887A3C78A6CE535F15B6F3942A625479BC2DF0BBF971672B8AC51AB709CC73F4E83E12B248EEF3E2F522","orcidId":"0000-0002-3225-1053","documentHash":"689e4b6d-793c-4f6a-a7d7-a6ac09f62307"},{"objectId":"5e709438878c28a0473b8570","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Raczkowska","uuid":"265B72BBCC30521D615A08777029BA880582EA5DDCC30662228491E7C371B95D70C902D7D8DA1575FD1E6502CAA1C5C1BA4206222050362CD46028FF5EE4E9F8","orcidId":"0000-0003-4205-1351","documentHash":"c5a71fd3-452c-4089-abb2-77fdffcd017b"},{"objectId":"5e70940c878c28a0473b56ba","name":"Robert","lastName":"Gajda","uuid":"6E8B63FABC7014981AB0E326CF9DEAE5145A5A37075DD0A40EFE4BA9150939087A19E54921B1870E4F7615A9B9F73B43FE2C4BE9BCCFDCEBCE0630FE1C46B6DD","orcidId":"0000-0001-7957-918X","documentHash":"cb45ea4f-2a3a-486e-a0b7-7165dcf5d4a9"}],"doi":"10.3390/nu14030607"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika

entities strive for continuous adaptation to changing situations and needs. The decisions of business entities entangled in multifaceted processes of economic, social, and environmental progress must be taken on the basis of reliable knowledge, developed know-how, scrupulous recognition of the initial state, and foresight of the multiple consequences of business actions over a long horizon. In such a situation, the measurement of financial efficiency in terms of the profitability of enterprises in meat and poultry industries is extremely desired and provides valuable information on the necessary modifications to reduce the potential risks of business operation. The Polish meat and poultry industries should take into account current and future market requirements, competition, and consumer response. The dynamic progress of technology is forced to take appropriate steps to improve and modernize products, services, and methods of solving profit losses. The aim of the paper is to calculate and evaluate the statistical relationships between profitability ratios in Polish meat and poultry enterprises divided into four groups: slaughterhouses, meat enterprises (small, medium, and large), poultry meat enterprises, and meat trade enterprises. In the theoretical part of the study, methods of descriptive, comparative, deductive, and synthetic analyses were used. In the practical part of the study, panel data from the entire meat and poultry industries in the period from 2010 to 2019 were used. For the measurement of financial efficiency, methods, such as financial indicator analysis, panel database modeling, and nonparametric ANOVA, were applied. The ANOVA method was used to test only the statistically significant relationships between profitability ratios across all groups of examined enterprises in the meat and poultry industries. To summarize, the optimal level of profitability was achieved by all groups of examined enterprises, except small meat enterprises. The highest financial efficiency in the area of profitability was reached by poultry enterprises. Moreover, financial support for small companies in the meat industry can bring tangible benefits such as maintaining a diversified product range locally and transforming small meat companies into buying centers for the local community. Both are effective solutions, especially in view of the post-pandemic situation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058068378","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61d431cf2467f0627d077fec","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"f75e7399-5df9-48a8-bced-9ecdfd23d8d2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/1/92","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6661a1604097074fa1bcc9e5","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Kaźmierczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ab287c4c-c2d6-4848-8189-a176c4eb1ffc"},{"objectId":"6661a1604097074fa1bcc9e4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Zielińska-Chmielewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a0d93602-2f1a-44eb-8059-ae47e0e4e26e"},{"objectId":"5e7092a2878c28a0473999a6","name":"Ireneusz","lastName":"Jaźwiński","uuid":"581EBEAB31797A511532EC1532396568889AD0B9311748F514EAC4F66573C9EB7233557B32A884FCBD1180FD488F07376431AA7FD0271EF145385910409236DD","orcidId":"0000-0002-6532-4247","documentHash":"6c204db9-8557-4e5d-a97c-a80d3aec415b"}],"doi":"10.3390/agronomy12010092"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-67172-00-4","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet Warszawski","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709355878c28a0473a776c"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df1f","uid":"b0noSHIUtJa6Uw08fQ9NYJQ","uuid":"03cbc2ce-336f-4f80-872b-657ea8d2cccc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Prawa i Administracji","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709355878c28a0473a776c"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet Warszawski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709355878c28a0473a776c"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df1f","uid":"b0noSHIUtJa6Uw08fQ9NYJQ","uuid":"03cbc2ce-336f-4f80-872b-657ea8d2cccc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Prawa i Administracji","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709355878c28a0473a776c"]}],"type":"BOOK","title":"Działalność turystyczna, noclegowa i gastronomiczna jako przedmiot opodatkowania podatkiem od towarów i usług","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":135,"publicationPlace":"Warszawa","translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6214c1462467f02f1e6131ba","editors":[{"objectId":"5e709355878c28a0473a776c","name":"Witold","lastName":"Modzelewski","uuid":"3909C60C4EB9E87E1EA36AC9A5F42BF34A435F4EB43E759998FC8F8DFFD3BF05EA6A726841CD8CDE3DBD6C2C7392A8CD04A2C41030151E844311423E602E1735","orcidId":"0000-0002-6449-9897","documentHash":"fe9a4c1f-ddf9-4915-acc8-2f5c011adcb7"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["5e709355878c28a0473a776c"],"AUTHOR":["63d7a25a4097074c742808ae","63d7a2804097074c74280cd6","63d7a2a24097074c74280f15","63d7a2bd4097074c742810a0","63d7a2de4097074c742816c1","5e709355878c28a0473a776c"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Problematyka prawnopodatkowa działalności turystycznej, noclegowej i gastronomicznej należy do najbardziej złożonych zagadnień wspólnotowej wersji podatku od towarów i usług.

Oczywiście najistotniejsze znaczenie ma wpływ rozwiązań unijnych, a przede wszystkim nakaz opodatkowania usług turystycznych przy zastosowaniu procedury szczególnej – marży, który – oględnie mówiąc – nie grzeszy prostotą i rodzi niekiedy dziwaczne (?) preferencje ekonomiczne.

The ability of the hybrid heating under action of alternating magnetic field and laser radiation (in a separate and synergy mode) was evaluated and compared with stock nanoparticles. It was found that hybrid materials show a high response to both stimulants and the highest temperature was achieved by using both AMF and laser exposure under synergic mode (twice the value for the AMF alone). The specific absorption rate of composite material was around 30 W/g for the optimized field parameters and both laser wavelengths (808 and 1122 nm). The great response of the hybrid material for contactless action of AMF and NIR radiation makes the proposed material very interesting for future biomedical and EMI shielding

The identification of genomic regions — quantitative trait loci (QTL) and molecular markers associated with freezing tolerance in winter hexaploid triticale — was the aim of this study. For that purpose, a new genetic linkage map was developed for the population of 92 doubled haploid lines derived from ‘Hewo’ × ‘Magnat’ F1 hybrid. Those lines, together with parents were subjected to freezing tolerance test three times during two winter seasons. Plants were grown and cold-hardened under natural fall/winter conditions and then subjected to freezing in controlled conditions. Freezing tolerance was assessed as the plants recovery (REC), the electrolyte leakage (EL) from leaves and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (JIP) after freezing. Three consistent QTL for several fluorescence parameters, electrolyte leakage, and the percentage of the survived plants were identified with composite interval mapping (CIM) and single marker analysis (SMA). The first locus Qfr.hm-7A.1 explained 9% of variation of both electrolyte leakage and plants recovery after freezing. Two QTL explaining up to 12% of variation in plants recovery and shared by selected chlorophyll fluorescence parameters were found on 4R and 5R chromosomes. Finally, main locus Qchl.hm-5A.1 was detected for chlorophyll fluorescence parameters that explained up to 19.6% of phenotypic variation. The co-located QTL on chromosomes 7A.1, 4R and 5R, clearly indicated physiological and genetic relationship of the plant survival after freezing with the ability to maintain optimal photochemical activity of the photosystem II and preservation of the cell membranes integrity. The genes located in silico within the identified QTL include those encoding BTR1-like protein, transmembrane helix proteins like potassium channel, and phosphoric ester hydrolase involved in response to osmotic stress as well as proteins involved in the regulation of the gene expression, chloroplast RNA processing, and pyrimidine salvage pathway. Additionally, our results confirm that the JIP test is a valuable tool to evaluate freezing tolerance of triticale under unstable winter environments."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058070633","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61dfe0ad2467f034397bd1cc","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"63","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"403dcc24-161f-4f74-b9a5-9d78524015e0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"15-33","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13353-021-00660-1","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"658f14b24097076c145d78b0","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Rapacz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"63378105-8c6c-4637-b39b-8cbf5eb36a36"},{"objectId":"658f14b24097076c145d78af","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Dyda","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d00ebda3-2803-492a-80a4-fa3aa63ee2d2"},{"objectId":"658f14b24097076c145d78ae","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Szechyńska-Hebda","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6d3b68f8-7574-4dad-93d9-17e86ff570c2"},{"objectId":"658f14b24097076c145d78ad","name":"Maria","lastName":"Wędzony","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"406e5937-6282-4aeb-9ed3-6deb2ffc7bea"},{"objectId":"658f14b24097076c145d78ac","name":"Gabriela","lastName":"Gołębiowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8ed1fa13-7bc9-491f-994a-55a4c22ad417"},{"objectId":"658f14b24097076c145d78ab","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Wąsek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7ddfcb2f-9111-488f-8a6b-5e386f0cb859"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a04739527a","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Tyrka","uuid":"7FBD89837AC2E924EF1CB51549CAFEB88EBB5F5A99C9C0022B30E833A7FEFE75120380AFA8DF308E68891846216E8033AC80639D2F13CD85803F967BB11DFC34","orcidId":"0000-0002-6051-5079","documentHash":"6d92fca6-3d1d-4201-959d-d95b224fd0cb"}],"doi":"10.1007/s13353-021-00660-1"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cognitive performance","Cognitive disorders","Spinal cord injury","Elite athletes"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","parentUuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","rootUuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Methods: nine participants suffering a SCI participated in the study. Different cognitive functions were evaluated through the following tests: COWAT, Digit Span, Stroop color–word and QoL through the WHOQoL-BREF scale. Results: Generally, participants positively assessed their overall quality of life and health status. Although the tests conducted indicate reduced cognitive function among the athletes, it did not affect the reduction in QoL. Single correlations between the results of cognitive tests and QoL could be treated as coincidental. Conclusions: Despite the observed decline in selected cognitive functions, the participants positively assessed their quality of life and physical health.Reduced cognitive functioning could be influenced by the impact of sleep-disordered breathing, pain, depressive disorders and medication.

In particular, the near-infrared emission of Nd3+ ions enhanced by Bi3+ ions of a series of novel Bi3TeBO9:Nd3+ microcrystalline powders doped with Nd3+ ions in various concentrations was investigated. In order to investigate the luminescent properties of BTBO:Nd3+ powders, the excitation and emission spectra and the fluorescence decay time were measured and analyzed. In particular, the emission of Bi3TeBO9:Nd3+ at 890 and 1064 nm was excited at 327 nm (via energy transfer from Bi3+ ions) and at 586.4 nm (directly by Nd3+ ions). The highest intensity emission bands in near-infrared were detected in the spectra of Bi3TeBO9:Nd3+ doped with 5.0 and 0.5 at.% of Nd3+ ions upon excitation in ultraviolet and visible spectral range, respectively. The fluorescence decay lifetime monitored at 1064 nm for Bi3TeBO9:Nd3+ powders shows the single- or double-exponential character depending on the concentrations of Nd3+ ions. The possible mechanisms of energy relaxation after excitation Bi3TeBO9:Nd3+ powders in ultraviolet or visible spectral range were discussed. The investigated Bi3TeBO9:Nd3+ phosphors efficiently concentrate the ultraviolet/visible radiation in the near-infrared spectral range and can be potentially used as effective spectral converters."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058070765","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63a4191940970710a6d9b9b2","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"57","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"108a6a94-d97f-41c5-b894-8dede6c610ab"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"57","pagesFromTo":"185 - 203","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10853-021-06642-2","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"615fad2875234017e0505dd5","name":"Taras","lastName":"Zhezhera","uuid":"BC033CD42AC20C855F6FE08E21DC896C0B33BB9C1B71D3F888A52FDD92980420929DF22231E4B8E13D670B220FA5EE51527EAA420E37E9ED6F8B0797FCFC6FEE","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a2ec5932-1ab2-4d67-b15a-8348ccba7bd2"},{"objectId":"5e7093ea878c28a0473b324d","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kosyl","uuid":"72CC701301A86553F7503125C47F593AD62B0DDCA371E585ACDA787FCDDD7551637A4DD9164DFEEF30D4E3B0D44F22599919A8834E112A0658EACE49FA9A08FF","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"12c605d9-23aa-4146-9948-b67b9280d002"},{"objectId":"5e709390878c28a0473ace96","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Chrunik","uuid":"C2CE906B2F58E81D98FCAB4A42FD26FA300EE294938AF0F7E86BC250DF8B17A4C44132DB2F0503AB36FCE7FF6A35007D9AAE89C868FAD0C5CD24A333A73ABC82","orcidId":"0000-0002-2369-3992","documentHash":"aad60d25-8652-4b73-9829-7a4900168d84"},{"objectId":"5e709366878c28a0473a8d1f","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Głuchowski","uuid":"B68982443AE136CF4BF20FB0E90446237EF59A15942659792E00F59236C69AE3F86D8861DDF0F3C09460628E6890446BDF29BFA94340DC12C4B38F711022BBA1","orcidId":"0000-0003-2566-1422","documentHash":"c9da8b1d-d858-4dc0-aa89-94c74ea0cf47"},{"objectId":"5e70934a878c28a0473a6a59","name":"Dobrosława","lastName":"Kasprowicz","uuid":"6DE71FB5187FFFCFABF6386F1168553819CEA14A954B854DFAB949D8C074C637177260BCF0A43CA15ED3F6E42483A63BE8E2B1354418798D79BC38F3BB0F096C","orcidId":"0000-0003-2229-3513","documentHash":"f297384b-710d-4e29-8bd0-9f818f78ca37"},{"objectId":"5e7092f4878c28a04739fe4b","name":"Marek","lastName":"Nowicki","uuid":"41C604A62ED68718E521B79042E46C21915B8BE0E4DE3DF4414C071DE859D5F616E3981E7BAEC094A37D40CAEAD1B1C62F3D12C03CB0F591228B9EC51FAA8E9E","orcidId":"0000-0002-0305-6881","documentHash":"18bd3f7d-af72-4cdc-ba55-a69bfae55150"},{"objectId":"5e7092a5878c28a047399cb2","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Majchrowski","uuid":"FEFA423F13ED14A84DEABCFB005EB4E7E0D6C824591E53619A43DBD697FCACC256824EF63A36A93B564AF333848256B1B5A50821B9B89C8DF2E67B2E5C21963E","orcidId":"0000-0003-1078-418X","documentHash":"47e657e3-9399-4e5e-87e9-617c5629a8e5"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10853-021-06642-2"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Współpraca innowacyjna","Ekosystem innowacyjny B+R","Innowacja translacyjna","alianse B+R","alianse otwartych innowacji","ECMO","COVID-19","sztuczne podtrzymywanie życia"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Innovation Cooperation","R&D Innovation Ecosystem","Translational Innovation","R&D Alliances","ECMO","COVID-19","Artificial Life Support"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"61e6acd52467f00287f183bf","doi":"10.4324/9781003204343","title":"Competition, Strategy, and Innovation.

In addition, the authors present how such innovative cooperation should be developed in order to bring about appropriate results. The authors present examples of projects that use digital tools and artificial intelligence (AI) and which are focused on the delivery of new solutions to improve patient care. In order to deliver these solutions to the market faster, the role of innovation cooperation should not be forgotten. Taking this issue into account, the authors share the results of one of the first quantitative primary research projects in the world that focuses on innovation cooperation in the biopharmaceutical industry in the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) region (covering 18 countries), as well as qualitative research: a focus group interview with representatives of the “ECMO (Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation) for Greater Poland” regarding the development of successful innovation cooperation as an example of translational innovation.

No matter whether it is known as “honors”, “honours” or “talent-development”, honors education is associated with a student-centric ethos of attainment-setting, and with comprehensive and often creative approaches to teaching and learning.

The low-temperature disintegration of distillation residue and waste-activated sludge before the co-fermentation process increased biogas production by 30% and methane production by 65% (over a 26 d duration). The obtained results confirm that the low-temperature disintegration method can be effectively used to pre-prepare this type of feed.

To assign the accuracy of FTIR spectra regions where peak shifts occurred, the Random Forest algorithm, traditional C5.0 single decision tree algorithm and deep neural network approach were used. We verified the correspondence between the FTIR results and the laboratory indexes such as: the count of peripheral blood cells, biochemical parameters, and coagulation indicators of pregnant women. CH2 scissoring, amide II, amide I vibrations could be used to differentiate the groups. The accuracy calculated by machine learning methods was higher than 90%. We also developed a method based on the dynamics of the absorbance spectra allowing to determine the differences between the spectra of healthy and COVID–19 patients. Laboratory indexes of biochemical parameters associated with COVID–19 validate changes in the total amount of proteins, albumin and lipase."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058071246","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"237","pagesFromTo":"122916","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039914021008389?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"649d5b854097071386c8b9c2","name":"Nevzat","lastName":"Tarhan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5edca60b-8dfb-4901-ac6d-5b4c81608354"},{"objectId":"649d5b854097071386c8b9c1","name":"Esra","lastName":"Öten","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f284d056-4ae5-4047-81cc-0baaad2a02d8"},{"objectId":"649d5b854097071386c8b9c0","name":"Huri","lastName":"Bulut","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bcb03a76-4862-4f05-8240-42e50a7280d7"},{"objectId":"649d5b854097071386c8b9bf","name":"Pancerz","lastName":"Krzysztof","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"72461cf0-bf5a-427a-b95b-ac7884a70190"},{"objectId":"649d5b854097071386c8b9be","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Paja","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"59539e5d-eaec-4299-bb33-de4822dcfc9f"},{"objectId":"649d5b854097071386c8b9bd","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Jakubczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ec8aecbe-4e21-40c6-8981-bed35df2c937"},{"objectId":"649d5b854097071386c8b9bc","name":"Zozan","lastName":"Guleken","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"24e9b6ad-c1ff-4f03-9276-66a6a22c2c8a"},{"objectId":"5e7093a1878c28a0473ae0aa","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Depciuch-Czarny","uuid":"1BA0414392EC8B7AB106FD1ECA6976A557C5EACB0823E96D4BA0940EBA694E0B7117202D422DD049DA7D3729F22AB3244A144D7F91EF61370EB4D8EFC526870A","orcidId":"0000-0003-0168-1701","documentHash":"e5324a1b-3796-489d-a3bb-1b19e15c9c84"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.talanta.2021.122916"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["PGC-1α","central nervous system","mitochondrial biogenesis"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","parentUuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","rootUuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

PGC-1α is implicated in the pathophysiology of many neurodegenerative disorders; therefore, a deep understanding of its functioning in the nervous system may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. The central nervous system (CNS)-specific isoforms of PGC-1α have been recently identified, and many functions of PGC-1α are assigned to the particular cell types of the central nervous system. In the mice CNS, deficiency of PGC-1α disturbed viability and functioning of interneurons and dopaminergic neurons, followed by alterations in inhibitory signaling and behavioral dysfunction. Furthermore, in the ALS rodent model, PGC-1α protects upper motoneurons from neurodegeneration. PGC-1α is engaged in the generation of neuromuscular junctions by lower motoneurons, protection of photoreceptors, and reduction in oxidative stress in sensory neurons. Furthermore, in the glial cells, PGC-1α is essential for the maturation and proliferation of astrocytes, myelination by oligodendrocytes, and mitophagy and autophagy of microglia. PGC-1α is also necessary for synaptogenesis in the developing brain and the generation and maintenance of synapses in postnatal life. This review provides an outlook of recent studies on the role of PGC-1α in various cells in the central nervous system."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058071300","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61d323932467f0718b29e16d","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":"11","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"f6ede4ce-4d55-40ff-a213-92f2a185c868"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"111","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/11/1/111/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61dff38d2467f03439858bb1","name":"Michal","lastName":"Liput","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3f2b334a-0720-4ab7-b104-2245a1005c54"},{"objectId":"60c2fcf59543c723365434bc","name":"Erkan","lastName":"Metin","uuid":"BC1829428C013CF36757F32B27C1A96AB8C031324BA6379E9643B42DF4CF71C701C46174831ABB1BBE2C377E05F02106E8964B6FCCE5AFBAB74A6A591C8EDD9C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c1dab303-627f-4016-9876-e6935a799625"},{"objectId":"5e709448878c28a0473b9a6a","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Kuczyńska","uuid":"3A3E8E4C864DEEF290E9A096833989A45A67B6648FA2923C562DAAAE27833B77465EE0575E833365C141F2092352FE73F493DF07862143C6907F85AC6878853D","orcidId":"0000-0001-8104-9217","documentHash":"8e0f97f9-f1de-4a7d-ad2c-eb430e258782"},{"objectId":"5e70927a878c28a047396749","name":"Leonora","lastName":"Bużańska","uuid":"6445B014AE407813453431BD83C08DCA8DBEC8FADC685994B5CB8F1D258441F5C6664E4E53C22170AEE6BF993681EE4A6540EC69417C468F9BC5D980B703A1C6","orcidId":"0000-0003-4433-9906","documentHash":"c42d54b5-11d3-4b3e-9585-86e08367f3f5"}],"doi":"10.3390/cells11010111"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["biogazownie rolnicze","energia odnawialna","środowiskowa ocena cyklu życia","biomasa"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biogas plants","renewable energy","life cycle assessment","biomass"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"61e7fdc62467f002871a99f4","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-77127-0","title":"Towards a Sustainable Future - Life Cycle Management","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-3-030-77126-3","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-77127-0","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"3e152052-2edd-4c64-8ebf-d210953e3fa1","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"The Environmental Assessment of Biomass Waste Conversion to Sustainable Energy in the Agricultural Biogas Plant","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61e7fdcc2467f002871aa755","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70946c878c28a0473bcad5"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Operating an agricultural biogas plants offers the potential of stable, clean, renewable and diversified energy source.

The most important determinants of the transition to the cashless economy are discussed: digitalization and new technologies; changes in the activities of commercial banks, which are creators of cashless money and quasi-money instruments; changes in customers’ demand for cash; and macroeconomic factors. The cashless economy seems to offer the largest benefits for banks, central banks and big tech companies.

Based on our previous two independent studies, we have selected HSPA2 to evaluate this seminal plasma protein is a potential biomarker of correct spermatogenesis.\n\nUsing immunoblotting and mass spectrometry (MS) we have screened human seminal plasma samples for the presence of HSPA2. Samples were obtained from individuals with normozoospermia, cryptozoospermia, non-obstructive and obstructive azoospermia.\n\nOur results showed a lack of HSPA2 in seminal plasma in all azoospermic males however, in cryptozoospermia the results were extremely diversified. Additionally, the application of 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) indicated the presence of additional protein isoforms suggesting possible mechanisms underlying the male infertility.\n\nOur findings suggest seminal plasma HSPA2 protein as a possible biomarker not only of spermatogenesis status, especially in cryptozoospermic males, but also as a biomarker predicting the success of reproductive treatment including assisted reproductive techniques (ART)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058071363","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61dff6222467f0343985fc43","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"22","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"c1b6e35b-79c4-41f7-ac4c-09dc364c47c2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"100597","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1642431X21001182?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61dff6222467f0343985fc3e","name":"Olga","lastName":"Włoczkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9917-6027","documentHash":"16b1742f-573a-4518-980f-e2e083817c8b"},{"objectId":"61dff6222467f0343985fc3c","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Nowicka-Bauer","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6299-013X","documentHash":"42eca8d9-5ad7-4ec9-a62f-d0898d550a4e"},{"objectId":"5e709433878c28a0473b7fe2","name":"agnieszka","lastName":"Malcher","uuid":"96E1CC1FA4F1B20B9C3CA9A5DA46E9AFB07E2A4D3755BD8057C6A919E178EF07AD972FDA198CE352CBE622A32BE5482B2C6035BCFDE45E69FD5B76A55EA40C92","orcidId":"0000-0002-3433-6990","documentHash":"1af032c3-0cd5-4ffe-bf17-000b3d3d021e"},{"objectId":"5e70942d878c28a0473b7a45","name":"Marta","lastName":"Olszewska","uuid":"5014994D9A0BE76B7091DC29B3D9FD1AF9CE8572CB085E7943841B66B6A4E5251FCE2F52BC30D570F49CBFFABFBEBD5E4992EDBA0CB2DA2D9E4629175AACAC7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-2337-4545","documentHash":"4718e4bf-3390-44ab-b0dd-7cd99518a2d1"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d3d4","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Kamieniczna","uuid":"53D8F8E0B915F2321B388BBC4ACE8CEFBB2EF08C93942596BE0F159C84DB4E8C8B7E78C6A4B0BF96F110D4D57DF2EDA5171F96DD8B7F78F593B144B9843E8076","orcidId":"0000-0002-9619-8220","documentHash":"72b9c10f-a5d7-41b3-a716-463d15849474"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d3a4","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Kurpisz","uuid":"205C6426938F9F4E39BD72C7BB93F6553712A8FB452370EEB206FB28C5DCF63DC566E79664C6E8A4C1613139DE7448107FDD6D5E5C7749D43D202D089DC29C29","orcidId":"0000-0003-3275-3245","documentHash":"f04558a3-1ad4-4a36-8c6f-4db0975a8918"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.repbio.2021.100597"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["quark matter"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","uid":"bdkLR6wGCrp59lwUjwb_dMA","uuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","parentUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","rootUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","name":"Instytut Fizyki Jądrowej im.

We estimate the thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity, and the Seebeck coefficient of hot and dense quark matter. These coefficients are calculated using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation within relaxation time approximation. The relaxation times for the quarks are estimated from the quark–quark and quark–antiquark scattering through meson exchange within the NJL model. As a comparison to the NJL model estimation of the Seebeck coefficient, we also estimate the Seebeck coefficient within a quasiparticle approach."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058073739","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"82","pagesFromTo":"71","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1140/epjc/s10052-022-09999-z.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"621df1782467f06798e18efc","name":"Hiranmaya","lastName":"Mishra","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8128-1382","documentHash":"3feb3064-d8d6-490d-a873-61c2d6ba8edc"},{"objectId":"621df1772467f06798e18efb","name":"Deepak","lastName":"Kumar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"84bbecb2-4e4a-4f7d-92db-e049eb25d0c5"},{"objectId":"621df1772467f06798e18ef9","name":"Aman","lastName":"Abhisek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"63d0cfb0-f686-4053-8bbd-2dc884d2a6dc"},{"objectId":"5e7094f9878c28a0473c834a","name":"Arpan","lastName":"Das","uuid":"EAF724A3364E891985670D60D4B6593FD79676EAEADE2DB8BCAFF6E86042BBFA394989C39F66B4EA6A539F6DB4A8906E022F235376357A71D68416B37B64D5E8","orcidId":"0000-0002-2630-8914","documentHash":"93f1b02f-6795-400a-8e00-704e14bb56b0"}],"doi":"10.1140/epjc/s10052-022-09999-z"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["leczenie stomatologiczne osób niepełnosprawnych, osoba niepełnosprawna u dentysty, bariery i przeszkody dla niepełnosprawnych w gabinecie lekarskim, leczenie osób niepełnosprawnych, przystosowanie gabinetu dentystycznego dla osoby niepełnosprawnej, osoba w wieku zaawansowanym w gabinecie stomatologicznym"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dental treatment of people with disabilities, a disabled person at the dentist, barriers and obstacles for the disabled in the doctor’s office, treatment of disabled people, adaptation of a dentist’s office for a disabled person, an advanced age person in a dentist’s office"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Praca z pacjentem niepełnosprawnym ruchowo w gabinecie stomatologicznym.

develop and grow in the brain and central nervous system. Examining glioma grading processes is valuable for improving therapeutic challenges. One of the most extensive repositories storing transcriptomics data for gliomas is The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). However, such big cohorts should be processed with caution and evaluated thoroughly as they can contain batch and other effects. Furthermore, biological mechanisms of cancer contain interactions among biomarkers. Thus, we applied an interpretable machine learning approach to discover such relationships. This type of transparent learning provides not only good predictability, but also reveals co-predictive mechanisms among features. In this study, we corrected the strong and confounded batch effect in the TCGA glioma data. We further used the corrected datasets to perform comprehensive machine learning analysis applied on single-sample gene set enrichment scores using collections from the Molecular Signature Database. Furthermore, using rule-based classifiers, we displayed networks of co-enrichment related to glioma grades. Moreover, we validated our results using the external glioma cohorts. We believe that utilizing corrected glioma cohorts from TCGA may improve the application and validation of any future studies. Finally, the co-enrichment and survival analysis provided detailed explanations for glioma progression and consequently, it should support the targeted treatment."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058073785","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62153edd2467f02f1e6308ae","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"8e2c1e4a-f67a-4f0d-95bb-95d077462201"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1014","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/14/4/1014/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"621de9f92467f06798e16cd5","name":"Claes","lastName":"Wadelius","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"be2a2f5f-b73d-4e7d-840b-1f4ccead0aaa"},{"objectId":"621de9f92467f06798e16cd4","name":"Klev","lastName":"Diamanti","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4922-8415","documentHash":"7464b9b6-9560-4400-aead-9481fe3e384e"},{"objectId":"621de9f92467f06798e16cd3","name":"Fredrik","lastName":"Barrenäs","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"caed1639-c10b-4ad8-acdc-362166f60648"},{"objectId":"621de9f92467f06798e16cd2","name":"Esma Nur","lastName":"Yaz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c0951fa9-a34d-4469-91b4-b9309a13de10"},{"objectId":"621de9f92467f06798e16cd1","name":"Ludovica","lastName":"Celli","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5847-5856","documentHash":"0631a4e3-7361-4fac-bf93-ce2b7846b311"},{"objectId":"621de9f92467f06798e16cd0","name":"Sara A.","lastName":"Yones","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7201-2604","documentHash":"acd43abe-61fb-4ef2-95ef-8941ef341e09"},{"objectId":"621de9f92467f06798e16ccf","name":"Uğur","lastName":"Çabuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4443-3065","documentHash":"e746ab6c-6472-4aab-b256-9772ed680c96"},{"objectId":"621de9f92467f06798e16cce","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Smolinska","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0907-5298","documentHash":"809fcfe5-60f0-4c45-a152-fde15b7ef8bb"},{"objectId":"621de9f92467f06798e16ccd","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Garbulowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2497-194X","documentHash":"3dce6a04-07ce-49eb-a890-074a2cc76771"},{"objectId":"5e709355878c28a0473a7689","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Komorowski","uuid":"785E552A1C961AB7F4237100EC76499D25B9F764F1669D2700AB0B69794FB6F51D1A826D849ECB82B4AFF6DDFEC09074386A0F7773BD4C4DA218852A95842EC1","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e86a575a-81c4-414f-8296-1fd33239507d"}],"doi":"10.3390/cancers14041014"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-90-04-30688-2","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Social security in the Balkans.

However, the effects of TRDMT1 gene knockout (KO) during cancer cell selection upon drug stimulation and the involvement of exogenous RNA were not addressed. In the present study, osteosarcoma (OS) cells lacking active TRDMT1 gene were subjected to short-term treatment of etoposide in the presence of exogenous RNA and long-term effects were analyzed after drug removal. Changes in cell proliferation and cell viability, genetic stability and DDR, telomere length and shelterin complex, retrotransposon activity and the levels of selected pro-inflammatory cytokines were considered. Long-term selection of TRDMT1 KO OS cells resulted in modified DDR, changes in telomere length and increased retrotransposon activity that was modulated by the addition of exogenous RNA. Thus, TRDMT1 gene KO may promote cellular and genetic heterogeneity that may modulate cancer cell responses to chemotherapeutic drugs."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058073800","journalIssue":{"objectId":"621f80c92467f07479836538","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"80","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"ec340af5-39b7-46cf-ace4-52d5be674f6b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"80","pagesFromTo":"ID number 105323","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0887233322000200","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709425878c28a0473b70e3","name":"Gabriela","lastName":"Betlej","uuid":"45396FE8827D224EE2CD91D1747B92C26266F7161FAD2250AC9664CE830CC0CAAE448FB7F50031C13C8910BDF265BB06A9AE31667902EEFCC3600D68B42958F9","orcidId":"0000-0003-0620-7195","documentHash":"b286e19e-eb92-4766-ba94-ecb99bd35c5b"},{"objectId":"5e7093a2878c28a0473ae20d","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Rzeszutek","uuid":"790B2570C1EEE69204E57A74292758B59E60ED45C64BF5D0CE202BA5F0E88812EBFF81A0C5C6B03F61DC4FFB354C4A72779665EF1440718AB79B54BC973433E2","orcidId":"0000-0001-6016-868X","documentHash":"55a1958b-878c-408f-87a1-0b44b69231d8"},{"objectId":"5e7093a1878c28a0473ae161","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Błoniarz","uuid":"961D1673BD3486F2D5BCCBDEC531294AFA7630020DE537C1223AF0AEA87C2E07FCD443A7C99E135271740E9E916CC5C4A875179E8C67819E63AEB716F43B4D38","orcidId":"0000-0003-0965-3537","documentHash":"719871ec-6f3a-404c-904d-340963c6255e"},{"objectId":"5e7093a1878c28a0473ae0e5","name":"Jagoda","lastName":"Adamczyk-Grochala","uuid":"76247488109695CB771F110C4C9B6C03625648497BDD581FDA6739531A405D18DBAE8C459F104365ED3E22FA39E2D8936905D7E12881BBE6FEA619E130EC560B","orcidId":"0000-0002-9535-7971","documentHash":"7e45f796-2cc8-4f4b-9714-fc5e9465a149"},{"objectId":"5e709229878c28a047390dd2","name":"Anna","lastName":"Lewińska","uuid":"0CD20A003E56E16682E84A7B75472424C7CF5CCF6A553E325F6258531E95D672CD919A82590020E7122E1B405FC4AD8B1F46B977DB831428176117075CFCC282","orcidId":"0000-0001-8055-1918","documentHash":"27a0644a-b067-4946-b6b9-efc2d84c1c35"},{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fbe0","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Wnuk","uuid":"F268CE45351160BFFD7B9BA299338747BD248B2236A87424A6249A19E97370733DF2960B92CA75D9DC267ABF1004B7D67258987532D5BCB9742F459BB2581DFD","orcidId":"0000-0002-8518-6670","documentHash":"b501c430-18aa-4c35-b8d0-dd0d8b382157"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.tiv.2022.105323"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biofertilizer","degraded soil","soil microbiome","soil health","phosphorus biotransformations"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","parentUuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","rootUuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

In order to improve soil quality, we investigated the impact of phosphorus biofertilizer on the microbiological parameters of soil (type Brunic Arenosol) degraded as a result of inappropriate cultivation and fertilization, characterized by low pH and decrease in K and Mg content. Two-year field experiment included control treatment (FC) without microbial enrichment and FA100 and FA60 treatments containing beneficial microorganisms. The results showed that the biofertilizer enhanced soil enzymatic activity (as expressed by the increased activities of urease, protease, acid phosphomonoesterase and β-glucosidase), increased number of operational taxonomic units associated with metabolic processes (including phosphorus related pathways and degradation of xenobiotics), improved crop yield, increased bacterial diversity and changed the quantity of phytoavailable phosphorus in the soil. Biofertilizer also stimulated the occurrence of plant growth promoting microorganisms involved in phosphorus biotransformations, decomposition of organic matter, nitrogen fixation and protection plants against pathogens. NGS and BiologTM analyses showed that the composition of soil microbiome was affected also by soil sampling time, suggesting seasonal variations in the preferred carbon sources and level of C-substrates utilization and pointing the differences in the relative abundance of individual microbial groups at particular stages of the experiment. Taking into consideration the improvement of microbiological indicators of soil health, phosphorus biofertilizer seems to be effective approach to implement in sustainable agriculture linking soil microbiome quality with the general soil condition."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058073806","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"33","pagesFromTo":"844-865","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ldr.4179","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473be973","name":"Agata","lastName":"Gryta","uuid":"7A599A80898846E39A0928AFF148C0109204A33487D92C4474CD7E87542DC8C541574E6A8030D21A9FCE8D3F5EFBD911BFA7F4F7B3DF41AE3A1A60AF6D108F45","orcidId":"0000-0002-6880-3112","documentHash":"b3ff6975-710e-48a7-8cf5-bcfb9951a144"},{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b423b","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Frąc","uuid":"DB7317F3078EAE2173CC896E4BA6E90BB0A524CBBF87F4FD301CCE20C9BABA9C9A82075C72E316FC40712199000F8AC2D5940BF7D278C98AA695622BAAE8AE31","orcidId":"0000-0001-9437-3139","documentHash":"9e52e582-5b2c-4d87-af08-89b425ea9091"},{"objectId":"5e7093de878c28a0473b23af","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Mącik","uuid":"580AB022EB4C8FC9B4E6034F7E9516070D814F47AB06ACD18FAA88FEEC73F85FA774165563825430AA52FE26E80A94DCA7E0DFF808F6C5C60D64005637C5458C","orcidId":"0000-0002-1585-4776","documentHash":"6b44c6ae-4a47-42cb-a2aa-625fe2b7adaf"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398362","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Sas-Paszt","uuid":"F65BF0798F03691C5ACA3C2A1EA4E5FD87ED5CB37729DF32BC5DB47710F0EBA374AA8CB082C6E75E322B257742E90231A958EB8FE9204AC6F2B651D5DF6471FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-4076-4032","documentHash":"c4b1b795-a964-4309-87da-3ec6e5c5aacd"}],"doi":"10.1002/ldr.4179"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"621906bf2467f05591fc9cd7","doi":null,"title":"Poza prawem.

The literature analysis presented here discusses the use of gamification among home energy production customers. However, there is a lack of analysis on the use of this tool in the management of energy sector companies. When considering the advantages of gamification elements in the training process, there was mention of this tool potentially being able to be used in HR management to realize the EU’s energy goals. The relevance of the topic has been explored in international studies that have shown that gamification increases employee productivity and motivation. In the article, the directions of gamification in the practices of Ukrainian organizations are investigated. The main principles of effective gamification implementation in HR management, at energy enterprises in particular, are highlighted. A survey on gamification perception by Ukrainians from educational and related areas has been organized and analyzed. The survey results are supplemented by the results of the digitalization state analysis conducted for energy companies, which represent an important foundation for the implementation of gamification into practice. The prototype of a simulation model in which a solar panel must be connected to a controller is worked out as an example of the element usage incurred by gamification in the learning and training process, both in enterprise and in university activity. The present research underlines the importance of an interdisciplinary approach in gamification utilization, as it allows the skill-gaining processes in managerial and technical fields to be combined. The main advantages of gamification in HR management in enterprises are described by impact categories, such as staff appraisal, motivation, and corporate culture and internal communications. The use of gamification in companies in the energy sector is expected to contribute to the support of energy policy, as well as to the efficient integration of Ukrainian energy companies into the EU energy market."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058073813","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/4/1344/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"673d970ffdbe832d85e0d9d0","name":"Vladyslav","lastName":"Psyuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b159afbc-3b66-43c7-a8dd-1966860d0e0b"},{"objectId":"673d970ffdbe832d85e0d9ce","name":"Maksym","lastName":"Andriiovych","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"168e9536-f983-4bc4-8db9-628d2aa59971"},{"objectId":"63520429752340623bbf011e","name":"Alla","lastName":"Polyanska","uuid":"A0E40DFBE7B5A12248A3BBE1058EA218C02FDB85C3F0062F64C161826692CC67B48D2A39426CE6BF2B018452E8E5A1048309EA8C58FDF096A68468E374DDE303","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b21fb974-7ecc-46e9-af34-7c3164f2560b"},{"objectId":"5e709444878c28a0473b9396","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Generowicz-Caba","uuid":"EBAB294C2AD609D37EFEB8D07ECDEE41C2E3FA5D99F837BD4EE38C2FE318B68B89D61739277B1D5F0ABBD857DCD22A1D1D75817E2270CEFBFA8A6CB62611FF4A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f8f878a6-8faf-45f6-94d2-a308c48b306b"},{"objectId":"5e70923a878c28a047392064","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kulczycka","uuid":"CBFBC515891EE7FE02A754E9CE2008FC93BEB5483AB36A9998D0DB53322CD01216BB77BB0B0D71DC7175108D0909B71979D70B66E12F03E140E79B8C9D8A88E5","orcidId":"0000-0002-4377-5506","documentHash":"6f08247e-b11a-4078-aeb2-9430b7873d5b"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15041344"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["leczenie kanałowe, resorpcja wewnętrzna, implant zębowy"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["endodontic treatment, internal resorption, dental implant"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Resorpcja wewnętrzna zęba siecznego przyśrodkowego w dwóch odsłonach.

Ukrainian renewable energy sector has demonstrated a significant increase in its renewable power capacity, especially for solar and wind power plants. Decommissioning the end-of-life equipment in Ukraine has not yet taken place, but it is only a matter of time. With this in mind, this paper assesses the quantities and the market values of the materials that could potentially be recovered from used solar and wind power plants, and it estimates the impact of their decommissioning on employment in Ukraine. It has been estimated that approximately 8.9 GW of solar power plants, and 3.6 GW of wind power plants, will be decommissioned from 2044 to 2059, and that the cost of the raw materials recovered could reach EUR 421.4 million and EUR 124.6 million in 2021 prices, respectively, compared to the decommissioning costs of EUR 240.1 million and EUR 49.1 million, respectively. Decommissioning renewable power plants will require the creation of new jobs, including 11.6 thousand in the solar industry, and 2.8 thousand in the wind sector. It is essential to amend the legislation in Ukraine, particularly Directive 2012/19/EU, to introduce the principle of the extended producer responsibility to ensure the efficient recycling of renewable power plant end-of-life equipment in Ukraine in the future."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058073841","journalIssue":{"objectId":"621679e52467f04ac0dc71a7","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"42b00240-cbb1-44e9-b565-eef7bd2d61c4"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/5/1662","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"656dac7240970749a862e1a1","name":"Olha","lastName":"Prokopenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6ee2ec48-1bd6-465f-96bb-2851a862df93"},{"objectId":"656dac7240970749a862e1a0","name":"Tetiana","lastName":"Kurbatova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dde30cf3-ad18-431c-864b-4ade7b369633"},{"objectId":"656dac7240970749a862e19f","name":"Galyna","lastName":"Trypolska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6b384dbf-931c-4fff-8442-eda7fa709399"},{"objectId":"5e7094df878c28a0473c5c09","name":"Jurij","lastName":"Klapkiv","uuid":"9B8F6F2EF3EE402D6EA54AD5A3B595A5F19B776E1BE87B730B8089265068E7FF1E9B30B39DCDC456115C2D5FB3C0BCE69B4CA3948C30F592C7A842CFEE502F15","orcidId":"0000-0002-9771-5357","documentHash":"f41569fd-be58-4b69-9942-cf78ba92695c"},{"objectId":"5e709204878c28a04738eb49","name":"Honorata","lastName":"Howaniec","uuid":"BA4850FF1F0D7C5A15631C820B28F556BF3C7477B416672DB35ABC76B56E833D290455DC8B11315567EF56DF74A5C933539414F00686EAD6DB9835CF4BED469B","orcidId":"0000-0002-8975-3601","documentHash":"1014a0dd-74ce-4891-834f-aedd4e8264f0"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15051662"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sediment transport; coastal protection; coastal morpho-dynamics"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","uid":"baS62_4vAAy1pEv5KVBV4_g","uuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","parentUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9c","rootUuid":"95b2c8d7-d049-4f8e-bc64-f6ec2debfa92","name":"Instytut Budownictwa Wodnego Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d77f","5e7092c4878c28a04739c4ae","5e7092d3878c28a04739d792"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Impact of the Revetment on the Seashore in the Region of Babie Doły (KM 93.6–93.9), Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5ebff812ad49b31ccec57c8a","mniswId":null,"title":"MDPI Applied Sciences","doi":null,"issn":"2076-3417","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"4610cc44-2259-40ac-837e-8a49cf019854"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2022-01-11","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62177f622467f05a132faae8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d792","5e7092d3878c28a04739d77f","5e7092c4878c28a04739c4ae"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The present paper addresses the litho-dynamic and morpho-dynamic processes in the coastal zone of Babie Doły (KM 93.6–93.9), Poland.

The communes located in the southern, Carpathian part of the province are the\nmost attractive tourist destinations. However, the volume of tourist traffic in Podkarpackie Province\ndiffers from many other regions in Poland. It is visited by far fewer tourists than might be expected.\nIn order to conduct a more effective tourist policy, it was necessary to acquire knowledge on the\nstructure of tourism in the region and its image. The aim of this article is to present the proprietary\nmethodology of cyclical research of the tourist image of Podkarpackie Province and the key results of\nthe research conducted in 2021. The proposed set of methods and techniques includes: (1) an analysis\nof strategic documents in terms of the assumed tourist image (Atlas.ti), (2) a verification of search\ntrends for keywords related to the identified associations (Google Trends), and (3) a search of widely\navailable internet resources for spontaneously generated content (Google Search). The obtained\nresults indicate that potential tourists find online information about tourist assets deviating from the\nplanned tourist image presented in the strategic document. First of all, they look for opinions and\ntips on specific tourist attractions.

We conducted a 10-year study to assess the ecological effects of stream restoration while analysing the possibility of a seasonal lack of hydrological continuity, with multiple measurements before and after restoring stream structural continuity. The research hypothesis assumes that in intermittent streams, there would be little or no change in the fish community downstream the barrier before vs. after barrier removal, and a significant change upstream the barrier before vs. after. Our results indicate, that by removing small barriers, their detrimental effects on the longitudinal passage of riverine fishes and fish assemblages can be rehabilitated. In the wet season, fish migrants from the mainstem river appeared in the downstream section of the stream. Stream intermittency, however, placed a habitat filter over the assemblage. Thus, after barrier removal, only two small-bodied fish species that tolerate periodic oxygen deficiencies and rising water temperatures gradually shifted upstream and formed stable populations. We emphasize, that we should not refrain from restoring the longitudinal continuity of intermittent streams, because they periodically provide fish valuable refugia and can also be a source of new generations and strengthen fish populations in mainstem river."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058073860","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6204e9a22467f04219d00aa3","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"6f277079-92a2-4906-a3fd-56acdd571480"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"ID number 1512","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05636-7.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709229878c28a047390e02","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Bylak","uuid":"5692E7813C6EEC431D6ADC7B920CA413081D40F43AFF169557A2C714E677662DDD61490A250D44192B7ADF6F609E549108F3BCFDD23EE1B6C8AE34B64454B867","orcidId":"0000-0002-7617-5814","documentHash":"2b448849-3225-4753-83e4-327b6ec9820c"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fa77","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kukuła","uuid":"D781C5FA674B9B123CAC131C5AF746E07479CB812B81E1EAD889B5C272B21AC94CD0BCF806D1FF1A1A479ABAF24C7D3BA64FB4D2289C5DA55B6E8F2BE5E1D160","orcidId":"0000-0002-9685-7994","documentHash":"613ae79a-893c-4057-ad70-7dd26f3f4ba8"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-022-05636-7"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deaa","uid":"bIVuXx-j3MA3vg5GttGgoow","uuid":"7688bf94-399f-4567-854e-220f826816fb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deaa","parentUuid":"7688bf94-399f-4567-854e-220f826816fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deaa","rootUuid":"7688bf94-399f-4567-854e-220f826816fb","name":"Instytut Geografii i Przestrzennego Zagospodarowania im.

Optimization solutions have different selectivity but it remains unexplored. Indeterminate solutions happen without warning and may be spatially biased. Errors are hidden. These issues may undermine connectivity measures and conclusions.\n\nTwo optimization targets may be distinguished: mobile agent and connectivity provider, with different requirements. Review of how are they handled in literature finds them entangled and often misspecified, owing to inconclusive results, especially pronounced when conservation and explanatory goals are mixed. I categorize graph structures against targets and show how initial choice of structure introduces implicit optimization.

Serum BCAA levels are enhanced by whey protein supplementation (WPS), and evidence in clinical populations suggests an association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with BCAA metabolite levels. It is not known whether the same SNPs are associated with the ability to catabolise BCAAs from exogenous sources, such as WPS. The present study investigated whether possessing a higher number of alleles associated with increased BCAA metabolites correlates with muscle fiber CSA of m. vastus lateralis in physically active participants, and whether any relationship is enhanced by WPS. Endurance-trained participants (n = 75) were grouped by self-reported habitual WPS consumption and genotyped for five SNPs (PPM1K rs1440580, APOA5 rs2072560, CBLN1 rs1420601, DDX19B rs12325419, and TRMT61A rs58101275). Body mass, BMI, and fat percentage were significantly lower and muscle mass higher in the WPS group compared to Non-WPS. The number of BCAA-increasing alleles was correlated with fiber CSA in the WPS group (r = 0.75, p < 0.0001) and was stronger for fast-twitch fibers (p = 0.001) than slow-twitch fibers (p = 0.048). Similar results remained when corrected for multiple covariates (age, physical activity, and meat and dairy intake). No correlation was found in the Non-WPS group. This study presents novel evidence of a positive relationship between BCAA-increasing alleles and muscle fiber CSA in athletes habitually consuming WPS.We suggest that a high number of BCAA-increasing alleles improves the efficiency of WPS by stimulation of muscle protein synthesis, and contributes to greater fiber CSA."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058073888","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"397","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/13/3/397/htm","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62189a1a2467f05591faad58","name":"Ildus I.","lastName":"Ahmetov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6335-4020","documentHash":"751de0e9-2e6c-4ab9-b205-aac79cb133e2"},{"objectId":"62189a1a2467f05591faad57","name":"Edward V.","lastName":"Generozov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"78e7747e-9990-483c-966d-711c7d7b6059"},{"objectId":"62189a1a2467f05591faad55","name":"Andrey K.","lastName":"Larin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fb7c543b-ae68-43b1-ac54-7e0435c88809"},{"objectId":"62189a1a2467f05591faad54","name":"Liliya B.","lastName":"Andryushchenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"740e294f-1809-4786-9e87-ee7fa09ca49e"},{"objectId":"62189a1a2467f05591faad53","name":"Elvira A.","lastName":"Bondareva","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e72168e4-8f1b-4efa-ac0e-63829baf93c6"},{"objectId":"62189a1a2467f05591faad52","name":"Ekaterina A.","lastName":"Semenova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-1248-2855","documentHash":"78362cda-ae71-47d9-8189-4e0f4c11c972"},{"objectId":"62189a1a2467f05591faad51","name":"Elliott C.

Activation of potassium channels from the inner mitochondrial membrane leads to cytoprotection during such events. The mitochondrial large-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (mitoBKCa) is one of these cytoprotective channels. It was previously shown that BKCa channels are blocked by hemin, which is present in excess during hemorrhage. In the experiments described in this work, we checked whether NaHS, known as a donor of gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which can play an important role in cytoprotection, interacts with mitoBKCa channels. Indeed, using the biotin-switch method, it was found that mitoBKCa channels undergo S-sulfhydration in the presence of NaHS. Although patch-clamp experiments showed that NaHS has negligible effects on the activity of mitoBKCa channels, NaHS has been shown to almost fully activate hemin-inhibited mitoBKCa channels. The effects of NaHS were mimicked by imidazole, suggesting a common mechanism of activation of mitoBKCa channels inhibited by heme/hemin by molecules able to coordinate the iron ion of porphyrin. A set of absorption spectroscopy experiments with the 23 amino acid model peptides containing the heme-binding motif CXXCH suggested previously unrecognized roles of cysteines in heme binding."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058073893","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6218ba742467f05591fb7485","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"aa1580c8-7e8e-45b9-be26-52cb4d74ebb4"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"JPET-AR-2021-001017","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://syndication.highwire.org/content/doi/10.1124/jpet.121.001017","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61f9fbdb7523402df07d9642","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Walewska","uuid":"0648A26A67EAD159702A5A504749E21549648F48E3DB0AC6D4BEA00735294D57C5ED7E5B0D23D213D9F55EF78E2AB0592FFAC409538E4DB109B6D24ADF36F415","orcidId":"0000-0001-6911-627X","documentHash":"08fd7034-23a4-49fe-9736-e4fd024699f3"},{"objectId":"61a054b87523402fabdf7c6c","name":"Milena","lastName":"Krajewska","uuid":"74461F3762B00290A973942AE4BD5008C31718FC863F2E21BF019AC217EEA94F0A6C5E5CBB5AA74BDC0AC68894F88C82C344A03E12B78327E597054C4EA0C3EF","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"062e933a-0397-4b89-9568-08f374447d7c"},{"objectId":"5e7092ff878c28a0473a0b59","name":"PIOTR","lastName":"KOPROWSKI","uuid":"9609A64BCF61589EE99B8C62F4EBF6DB65C73DD5EF8B9E457C5024E05C0D9263B4F39D0B703E1B809B50E37B2C558799EEE748C4FD11533A75C8A36091FB8C77","orcidId":"0000-0002-7571-2446","documentHash":"366859b2-be4d-4e43-9d72-7e2e57dfb450"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b528","name":"ADAM","lastName":"SZEWCZYK","uuid":"B3B8C55CF34D69326D079B5B69041A64B819FCCAC09FB19FADD1B11E5E3283262734BC8E9F5CB1FEE0D322018E96350CA508FA5C4EC30BF445AA0E17D59A2786","orcidId":"0000-0001-5519-260X","documentHash":"1f57e2e6-00e3-4a73-b29d-dff1739ef6b6"}],"doi":"10.1124/jpet.121.001017"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Bioaccessibility","supercritical carbon dioxide","blackcurrant","vitamin C","anthocyanins","antioxidant activity","in vitro digestion model"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70941c878c28a0473b65ab","5e7094d7878c28a0473c4ff0","5e709217878c28a04738fbcf"]},{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a04738564a","uid":"beGpESG6icEeopJ3VnMkvIw","uuid":"0e8f33a2-7d2c-4765-a697-b104163eb1ac","parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a04738564a","parentUuid":"0e8f33a2-7d2c-4765-a697-b104163eb1ac","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a04738564a","rootUuid":"0e8f33a2-7d2c-4765-a697-b104163eb1ac","name":"Instytut Biotechnologii Przemysłu Rolno-Spożywczego im. prof.

An in vitro gastrointestinal digestion model completed with dialysis was used to assess BAc. The use of SCCD at each of the pressures applied improved the stability of vitamin C, total anthocyanins, and AC before in vitro digestion. As a result of digestion, the total content of vitamin C, anthocyanins, and AC decreased. The highest BAc of vitamin C was noted in fresh juice (FJ) (40%) and after mild heat treatment at 45 °C (T45) (46%). The highest BAc of total anthocyanins was also noted in the FJ (4.4%). The positive effect of the application of SCCD on the BAc of the delphinidin-3-O-glycosides was observed compared to T45 and thermal pasteurization at 85 °C (T85). Although SCCD did not significantly improve the BAc of vitamin C and total anthocyanins, the higher AC of SCCD samples after intestinal digestion (ABTS+• and DPPH•) and in dialysate (ABTS+•) compared to thermally treated was observed. The protocatechuic acid was detected by UPLC-PDA-MS/MS as the major metabolite formed during the digestion of delphinidin-3-O-rutinoside. This may indicate the influence of SCCD on improvement of the accessibility of antioxidants for digestion, thanks to which more metabolites with high antioxidant activity were released."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058073895","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61f3da412467f061bc10e18c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"27","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"a0dda249-25df-4f6c-bb49-6666d6edee45"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"ID number 1036","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/3/1036/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094d7878c28a0473c4ff0","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Buniowska-Olejnik","uuid":"7899C54D051187BD484C389CE69A04B8255B68D44193B3C656F72CB9311C62133536CC1DFC09C1C949AF102949465043645650785E4D0BA0AD3B3AE0E7A0B588","orcidId":"0000-0003-3795-4003","documentHash":"f970cb15-941d-4ae8-b50d-54dd22b58dee"},{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b65ab","name":"Krystian","lastName":"Marszałek","uuid":"88F93A3610E25C643A9BFFEA7A4C0BA623BD8193F4E5FC1CEBAD67725B197D3F7470EF018F43D327D124F9626D81C72DF19FFE99ADCE550CFFDBEA001372ABC3","orcidId":"0000-0003-2121-0704","documentHash":"059df68b-5aba-400a-890a-fe326344f4df"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b4639","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Skąpska","uuid":"A6FEE03FBD0D27ACF850651E02501949E4A66585559D7469BF8AD0A859744DFF03383CB46A875EFC4304E6F33927C5517F601B4E3D465EC5A6E943B01BFD7D42","orcidId":"0000-0001-8442-2523","documentHash":"c95d79e9-05ab-47fe-99d8-95c8cbe2cdcb"},{"objectId":"5e7092bc878c28a04739bb5c","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Trych","uuid":"DF0206F083D3201381B1062ADB0814243D529FADFF1439EBDBFFFD2A93F97255B89BD04D3FFEDF3E8A244A04D2B5AB8CE40DB0FFEA7EF53B9424E9DE8D13FD03","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d1aa6734-7530-4e28-9ed6-fc89db02fb1b"},{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fbcf","name":"Ireneusz","lastName":"Kapusta","uuid":"6DAB645BDC2EBEE02DD000181F5F143BD9D7E0423ACCC8A800CA763AD09A0FEA916CE715E99056C761B940E21E587089ED03A23C4A9765611BE7A70B5ED64E47","orcidId":"0000-0002-1197-2361","documentHash":"a4c18afe-c217-4921-96ed-6e1885929b72"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules27031036"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["carbon footprint","carbon capture and storage","zero/low emission building","greenhous effect","environmental protection"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","uid":"bHvub0W7DW61k4FKLYJQ3Zw","uuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","parentUuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","rootUuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Długosza w Częstochowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709337878c28a0473a4f37","5e709447878c28a0473b99c3","5e7093af878c28a0473aefc2","5e709240878c28a04739265a","5e709414878c28a0473b5e0e","5e7093de878c28a0473b22e6","622b0e392467f040f243250c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"CO2 Capture by Virgin Ivy Plants Growing Up on the External Covers of Houses as a Rapid Complementary Route to Achieve Global GHG Reduction Targets","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1073","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"67894746-212e-466e-b7ad-c33c45443ffa"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-24","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62189b5b2467f05591faaed2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709414878c28a0473b5e0e","622b0bfa2467f040f24318c4","5e709202878c28a04738e7f0","5e709240878c28a04739265a","5e709337878c28a0473a4f37","5e7093de878c28a0473b22e6","5e709447878c28a0473b99c3","5e7093af878c28a0473aefc2","622b0e392467f040f243250c","622b0e582467f040f2432537"]},"issue":"Iss.5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Global CO2 concentration level in the air is unprecedently high and should be rapidly and significantly reduced to avoid a global climate catastrophe. The work indicates the possibility of quickly lowering the impact of changes that have already happened and those we know will happen, especially in terms of the CO2 emitted and stored in the atmosphere, by implanting a virgin ivy plant on the available area of walls and roofs of the houses. The proposed concept of reducing CO2 from the atmosphere is one of the technologies with significant potential for implementation entirely and successfully. For the first time, we showed that the proposed concept allows over 3.5 billion tons of CO2 to be captured annually directly from the atmosphere, which makes even up 6.9% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The value constitutes enough high CO2 reduction to consider the concept as one of the applicable technologies allowing to decelerate global warming. Additional advantages of the presented concept are its global nature, it allows for the reduction of CO2 from all emission sources, regardless of its type and location on earth, and the fact that it will simultaneously lower the air temperature, contribute to oxygen production, and reduce dust in the

Therefore, the reduction of CO2 emissions has long been a crucial challenge for individual countries. In this area, numerous technological, legal, and economic solutions are used. The purpose of this article is to examine the impact of public spending on the level of CO2 emissions in Polish regions. The study uses the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) method, proposing a unique proprietary set of factors that influence the level of CO2 emissions. The results of the study confirm that public expenditure contributes to reducing CO2 emissions at the regional level, while environmental expenditure is counterproductive. This tendency is observed mainly in regions with a high level of socioeconomic development, higher energy consumption, and high carbon emissions. The failure of environmental spending to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in Polish regions is explained by the “green paradox” hypothesis."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058073936","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61cbda8d2467f06e5d2baa1c","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"760d3dbe-8ad6-41e2-a304-fdb06bb2a3e3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/1/103/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5e12","name":"Jan","lastName":"Braun","uuid":"967726D3E752465D170B924868869C1017D64DD7349CD6000FE777F5E027664237D06DA8BC4B9D2F7EFDC646FA1A8CB304F8F654986DDDE3E987980EB873899E","orcidId":"0000-0002-5762-0046","documentHash":"9bd99c99-b4ce-49c4-ad05-a0d7b7b8b9cb"},{"objectId":"5e7092f8878c28a0473a03c9","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Wójtowicz","uuid":"37F9EB1DA901CF2E5D751D045B22D695E4C029BCC37AD2F86C508B165CFEE839BB1EEB488F8228660968B72E0722205D69E1AA061C3343F7AF07EFBB280B0487","orcidId":"0000-0002-7049-0063","documentHash":"dac8f7a2-867a-4a40-9a3b-6c4bcb841805"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396b42","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Szołno-Koguc","uuid":"BC57C1106DFAF7EC5F730D34DBDFBD8A414B0B4AE54CDFB5616EEA62B4E526D8914A581EC4717D8CC237C2480160624AF7061A69599E2124F644BD02657165B0","orcidId":"0000-0003-4745-0001","documentHash":"a0540128-c21f-4e25-97e2-9b587b385781"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15010103"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedb","uid":"bnG-e53W_Hi4NXdss6g991Q","uuid":"61b49d12-2b15-473d-98e8-d4d874973bcd","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedb","parentUuid":"61b49d12-2b15-473d-98e8-d4d874973bcd","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedb","rootUuid":"61b49d12-2b15-473d-98e8-d4d874973bcd","name":"Instytut Hematologii i Transfuzjologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e4878c28a0473b2bbe","5e7093b7878c28a0473afa33"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Noninvasive diagnostics of fetal\n            \n              KEL\n              *01.01\n            \n            allele from maternal plasma of immunized women using digital\n            PCR\n            protocols","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479996","mniswId":"19680","title":"TRANSFUSION","doi":null,"issn":"0041-1132","eissn":"1537-2995","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"e288500c-86a7-4233-bec6-f6b1f167876c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-22","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6220c5d52467f004a5a84c35","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093e4878c28a0473b2bbe","6220c5d52467f004a5a84c38","6220c5d52467f004a5a84c39","6220c5d52467f004a5a84c3a","5e7093b7878c28a0473afa33"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Allo-antibodies produced by K-negative pregnant women against a fetal K antigen from the Kell blood group system may cause hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN).

For 36 cases compared using two digital PCR platforms and assays, there were not statistically significant differences in a level of fetal KEL*01.01 fraction (p < .72).\n\nConclusion\nIndependent of the applied dPCR and ddPCR platforms and KEL*01.01 assays, prediction of the fetal KEL*01.01 is highly reliable. Before implementation in routine practice further validation of the KEL*01.01 protocol with a larger group of pregnant women should be performed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058073950","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6220c5d52467f004a5a84c3d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"f7950e11-22eb-4b93-b361-7777095c847e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"62","pagesFromTo":"863-870","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/trf.16829","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6220c5d52467f004a5a84c3a","name":"Izabella","lastName":"Kopeć","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0d895ba2-2083-4182-b898-6291b3a12ec2"},{"objectId":"6220c5d52467f004a5a84c39","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Purchla‐Szepioła","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0fe8f8ec-ab2b-4fae-b1a5-ebed6fdfa2a4"},{"objectId":"6220c5d52467f004a5a84c38","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Krzemienowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"26904ed1-72ca-4a4e-9b3b-da1721ef5751"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2bbe","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Orzińska","uuid":"5D3DA837F38EE6F2309F49519483AD2B4DDB3916812DAADEB517ED91C410C2007B583309A3C2C11EB3D6BCAECD4F15520476E86371C26C62B53E42FCCAD4F312","orcidId":"0000-0002-7306-0579","documentHash":"082f25b4-7789-4cba-b057-3b55e13e4ad4"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afa33","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Guz","uuid":"945AC3C042B02BD0AC75AA7561FB12BFF8EC37DAFB429E5F4941ABB52ADA7283897901B4567209990C3591E78156CD03D3DF94CAB6B1B886E8231E1CE73F2ED7","orcidId":"0000-0002-2250-2226","documentHash":"5346ac27-064d-4227-a530-2ecae0cbd10a"}],"doi":"10.1111/trf.16829"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["nauki o bezpieczeństwie"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":"9788367138604","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","uid":"bGA_QwQGoDNg-6MMEBxlWNQ","uuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","parentUuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","rootUuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","name":"Akademia Marynarki Wojennej im.

The behavior of fungicide mixtures and their impact on plant biochemical and antioxidant status was poorly investigated. The main goal of this study was to compare the impact of fluazinam, a separately applied fungicide, and its mixtures (dithianon+fluazinam, dodine+fluazinam) during dissipation on biochemical compounds and the antioxidant profile in lettuce. Additionally, the behavior of dithianon and dodine applied singly was examined. We noted a longer dissipation time of fluazinam in mixtures (DT50= 6.31 and DT50=4.80) compared to separate application (DT50= 3.36) as well as a shortened dithianon and dodine degradation in mixtures. Moreover, dithianon, dodine and fluazinam applied separately affected the reduction of chlorophylls (43%) and carbohydrates (56%) as well as the induction of carotenoids (37%), protein (40%) and phenolic compounds (50%) in a different dissipation time. Furthermore, fluazinam mixtures intensified accumulation of carotenoids (up to 106.1 µg g−1), protein (21.9 mg g−1) and phenolic compounds (1410 µg g−1), while reduction of carbohydrates (3.4 µg g−1), compared to separate application. For the first time, we revealed that non-enzymatic antioxidants are the first line of defense in ROS scavenging caused by fungicides (up to the 12th h), while antioxidant enzymes (CAT, POD, SOD) play a secondary role in supporting stress mitigation. Results of the study can be applied to the horticultural practice in lettuce cultivation and shed a new light on plant biochemistry under fungicide stress conditions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058073975","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62188d392467f05591fa954c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"298","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"167b4b6a-013e-409b-a221-938c202b84d6"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"298","pagesFromTo":"110988","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0304423822001145?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093e2878c28a0473b28e4","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Iwaniuk","uuid":"2E1F9EE8E96537F460007792E222681EAC46F299A117375B3D4F2A3FA0898B9D0F0C1444474D0F74D0A81F9B780A73644919B9FA4879B163770532EB2234315E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9058-1125","documentHash":"bbc6f636-943e-40a0-b9ed-261ccd12d820"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afd0b","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Łozowicka","uuid":"227A3531CB28F0C83AA3EFD3DC102BD396778BD6593CAE8AED24CD9555D9E31B6BB14A7FFCE934C16DA059EC46D8CC72BCF52D209F499B352D1A076BEBE9F5B0","orcidId":"0000-0002-2760-3333","documentHash":"9b03ab2a-55cc-427e-8c0d-e2cc41f8e705"},{"objectId":"5e7091ff878c28a04738e489","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Borusiewicz","uuid":"F07780E642B5BCAFC8B176BB13A54A6F0A37BEEA3A9778121C766F4973CBBD870C5448899786AB3BB8DB44BD75E618E516C6347866F088992118F39A10E5B484","orcidId":"0000-0002-1407-7530","documentHash":"e42bfa6e-6ef5-4861-af80-f2031d397d7e"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.scienta.2022.110988"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["bakterie pożyteczne","fitopatogeny","kontaminacja","patogeny roślin i człowieka"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a0473983a3"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Bakterie w środowisku roślin - wrogowie i sprzymierzeńcy","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"60e720652467f01e93037be1","mniswId":null,"title":"Kosmos.

Poważnym zagrożeniem jest także kontaminacja roślin i gleby przez wyłączne patogeny człowieka i/lub zwierząt. Są to głównie bakterie jelitowe. W środowisku roślin występują również bakterie korzystnie oddziałujące na ich zdrowotność, wzrost i plonowanie. Bakterie takie dysponują mechanizmami, które umożliwiają bezpośrednie i/lub pośrednie ograniczanie sprawców chorób, wykazując wobec nich aktywność antagonistyczną, a możliwie także indukując odporność roślin na porażenie. Ich zastosowanie w praktyce wymaga jednak przeprowadzenia szczegółowych badań, bowiem nawet te same szczepy mogą korzystnie oddziaływać na rośliny, a jednocześnie stanowić różnego rodzaju zagrożenia.

environmental awareness imposes on polymer scientists the development of novel materials that show a longer lifetime and that can be easily recycled. These challenges were largely met by vitrimers, a new class of polymers that merges properties of thermoplastics and thermosets. This is achieved by the incorporation of dynamic covalent bonds into the polymer structure, which provides high stability at the service temperature, but enables the processing at elevated temperatures. Numerous types of dynamic covalent bonds have been utilized for the synthesis of vitrimers. Amongst them, boronic acid-based linkages, namely boronic acid esters and boroxines, are distinguished by their quick exchange kinetics and the possibility of easy application in various polymer systems, from commercial thermoplastics to low molecular weight thermosetting resins. This review covers the development of dynamic cross-links. This review is aimed at providing the state of the art in the utilization of boronic species for the synthesis of covalent adaptable networks. We mainly focus on the synthetic aspects of boronic linkages-based vitrimers construction. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives are

The concept of the genus is briefly discussed, and its systematic position is clarified. A key to fossil species is provided. The genus Paleoplatyura is described from the Eocene Baltic amber. It is concluded that, in Baltic amber, this group is represented only by the type species, and the identity of the other two species is problematic. No additional specimens have been found so far in this amber. Therefore, the presence of as many as three new species in Burmese amber, certainly belonging to Paleoplatyura, is a confirmation of its occurrence already in the Mesozoic."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058074020","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e6aa562467f030e8be0bed","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"782af0ac-99ab-4032-82e6-ae07ca87d100"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13(1)","pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/13/1/24/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61e94bb72467f0651ffca4d1","name":"Jan","lastName":"Ševčík","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7174-593X","documentHash":"c0e53542-0297-43bc-b4b2-92da35dea2f3"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473aa078","name":"KORNELIA","lastName":"SKIBIŃSKA","uuid":"5C59D3C2A0BF175C47DBADE4D35100060A6F048A903EE3A34E6ADA58BD58549B259C820CC4C8A8F4B1B6B56FBA5F6946513D981057013B7EA10F913AEA8945A1","orcidId":"0000-0002-5971-9373","documentHash":"68562b76-7722-411d-bfdf-ce7e30dcc0b9"},{"objectId":"5e709229878c28a047390ddf","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Krzemiński","uuid":"F4D443A4F4348C6895AB9AF12A6C8E902851D5D19CB1ABCE3138C376DFDFACBE85FCBE7A72E0A90F3172A13243732969D39FA5F8534B509AB9A021D3B453E054","orcidId":"0000-0001-5685-891X","documentHash":"8d25c4c7-31f2-4626-a3b7-59738806df19"}],"doi":"10.3390/insects13010024"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Behavioural plasticity","Cognitive ecology","Habitat selection","Soil-dwelling","Myrmeleontidae","Temperature","Vermileonidae","Vibrations"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec5","uid":"bi0054EFyZHNUwKK3x5HmqA","uuid":"8cc45ab7-e9f8-4e3b-ac7b-5dd9a6fe481d","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec5","parentUuid":"8cc45ab7-e9f8-4e3b-ac7b-5dd9a6fe481d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec5","rootUuid":"8cc45ab7-e9f8-4e3b-ac7b-5dd9a6fe481d","name":"Instytut Systematyki i Ewolucji Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709328878c28a0473a3d7f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Convergent evolution of antlions and wormlions: similarities and differences in the behavioural ecology of unrelated trap-building predators","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454772df","mniswId":"2286","title":"Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology","doi":null,"issn":"0340-5443","eissn":"1432-0762","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"53e6d13b-35c0-4a65-b607-99e45ec305bb"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61e94ead2467f0651ffce10a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709328878c28a0473a3d7f","61e94ead2467f0651ffce10d"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Antlions and wormlions are unrelated insect taxa, but both construct pit traps in loose soil and hunt similar prey. Owing to the likeness of their hunting strategies, and since no other animals construct similar traps, they demonstrate an intriguing case study of convergent evolution. We reviewed the literature of the last 16 years and compared the existing knowledge on trap-building antlions and wormlions. Whereas the knowledge on antlions has been accumulating, studies on wormlions are \nlacking, in particular studies on how wormlions sense prey and their cognitive abilities. Shared characteristics of the taxa include responses to increasing conspecifc density, such as populating suboptimal microhabitats and altering their spatial pattern. The taxa difer, however, in other aspects, such as response to disturbance, prey size range, diversity in habitat selec\u0002tion and behavioural plasticity. We provide recommendations for future research on several levels of biological organization. If such research is conducted on co-occurring antlions and wormlions, the fndings will contribute to a greater understanding of this convergent evolution, the extent to which it exists, and its limitations. This in turn will contribute to understanding how natural selection in specifc environments has shaped similar phenotypes and which constraints limit the phenotypic outcome"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058074028","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e94ead2467f0651ffce10f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"76","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"26a47237-ee74-48ae-9e7e-ab18692bcbf3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"76","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00265-021-03106-0.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61e94ead2467f0651ffce10d","name":"Inon","lastName":"Scharf","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8506-7161","documentHash":"159ea6a7-61bf-43fd-82ee-c23beb9d01c1"},{"objectId":"5e709328878c28a0473a3d7f","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Miler","uuid":"18E05A8103307AE916169004274D53958BBA6E5053DD908046E1F67532BB282F8A3B64F5DB5FEC686D29153F7E6B45AB696C1041D37742C51C17BDC37D2D3FB9","orcidId":"0000-0001-7684-0629","documentHash":"43f54d10-4211-4e87-a315-c8ee2078e8e4"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00265-021-03106-0"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"621e3b0b2467f06798e2c5a2","doi":null,"title":"Securitologiczna panorama bezpieczeństwa","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"9788367138604","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://katalogi.bn.org.pl/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma991053056855205066&context=L&vid=48OMNIS_NLOP:48OMNIS_NLOP&lang=pl&search_scope=NLOP_IZ_NZ&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=LibraryCatalog&query=any,contains,9788367138604&offset=0","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"197934be-3913-468b-856a-2eccf59f0028","publisher":{"objectId":"5d6d0363878c284eaa45c902","mniswId":"71500","name":"Wydawnictwo naukowe FNCE","documentHash":"26eb0606-8c14-43a2-807c-7ad7f4c6df9e"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","uid":"byIMgWh_9RUyyDH3dMzNDyw","uuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna im.

The surface roughening increasing with the temperature of this treatment is a major obstacle on the way toward production of the fine quality products. Confronting the roughness measurements performed at different scales with complementary plan-view surface observations (OM, SEM/SE, FIB/SE, AFM) and cross-section (TEM) ones, focused on description of the surface defects, allowed the mechanism of their development to be explained. Namely, the TiN layer produced at lower temperatures (∼620 °C) grows predominantly with a flat front, roughly reproducing the substrate morphology, while at intermediate and higher temperatures (680 °C-830 °C) it is a subject of severe self-spalling of the upper part of this layer. It means that simultaneous hardening and preservation of a high surface quality of Ti-6Al-7Nb after CP-PN is possible only during the plasma nitriding performed at the temperatures close to 600 °C. Additionally, a strong self-spalling of the upper part of the TiN layer during this treatment at higher temperatures means that only its remaining part, growing toward the core, could eventually serve as a corrosion protection barrier."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058074058","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61c30ce82467f057532ca597","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"574","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"9aa728a1-f9c9-4e5e-930e-d8e61bf37eee"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"574","pagesFromTo":"151639","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0169433221026866?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"615fad2875234017e0505dc7","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Szymkiewicz","uuid":"8F418C4018BA744C0A3B2E042A8193B097B4A32B3165195B466897D06962762F53D685032555E2482653F344DC8448E5E9F8547A9016D2C23742CDD0C6A297B5","orcidId":"0000-0002-6069-8987","documentHash":"64e5af61-bb47-4b52-8497-9ce1b37b59fe"},{"objectId":"5e709499878c28a0473c02e3","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Pomorska","uuid":"1D34E3493D84608D2A6B38079871D705884EFB75ACDD91FD7832B346A8FB568F0ABE2557FD22F1AE8E6F98BDA94224484BA409495FA4A74E889F6C2E857C9428","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7342d84d-3c98-4eec-aa64-30e0a1eaa1b8"},{"objectId":"5e70946a878c28a0473bc979","name":"Michał","lastName":"Tarnowski","uuid":"896D230090576A2ECF6A1548BBA3DF307FEE8AFC2FA80C36EA84069977D05FBC9A80C0CAC78C5519371D08947002E8B31E8363A249BC3DACB57BB71F3F183552","orcidId":"0000-0003-0611-4626","documentHash":"0180ba65-e3bd-4145-bbae-19ee8659da6a"},{"objectId":"5e709454878c28a0473ba9ab","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Toboła","uuid":"77D6E35525FA46D8C6EF9DD4F7F6C570FD33ED415B65C0D3B4B013280D6E10188709162D2BA93FFB14B3715BA01397F86A4A8C078D3DB727A791C0CAB9FAFD58","orcidId":"0000-0001-7966-240X","documentHash":"fea10732-5b0e-4c10-99a8-54adb54fffc8"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af0f5","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Morgiel","uuid":"942B866E4FFBF64BB71F71B416D858043C11FEEA6B845A43D9928C9AC1049FA95EBA59806071977C19D8CC0CE07D29212DEF2FCB52D24A5F23C42D7823FB201F","orcidId":"0000-0003-1807-0149","documentHash":"8773308a-1464-4ccf-b3d4-fc926d04b1fc"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af0f4","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Ozga","uuid":"65C97D8032525D2523E986F5EC5C66ED23C3DAC897385E54265E2F9FF0D1B7D64F8BE8C0495E62FB202B481D2C88FD82F558EEEC9489B49D1FC138DA5552FAD0","orcidId":"0000-0002-1690-3146","documentHash":"fcf365e0-1b9c-4e88-b4d4-81b1705853d7"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473ac999","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Maj","uuid":"C89EB61A18127031891E7F8D10A54CE2EBED0CC12790A1B98166E236B878F3665E7173745435E2597A0775AF07D43685F90EF850882974B4A1C885F259B40363","orcidId":"0000-0001-8287-0146","documentHash":"9c64ecb7-a325-4f78-b31c-88abe2a0bbd8"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.151639"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Antiviral drugs","Photolysis","Photocatalysis","Lopinavir","Ritonavir","Ecotoxicity","COVID-19"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Revealing the toxicity of lopinavir- and ritonavir-containing water and wastewater treated by photo-induced processes to Danio rerio and Allivibrio fischeri","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"Science of the Total Environment","doi":null,"issn":"0048-9697","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"59516ca8-3554-4f06-a1d4-f330ee71985e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"621c6dec2467f05c960dc0e7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f5878c28a0473a00c3","659fc2614097076c144aafd8","659fc2614097076c144aafd9","659fc2614097076c144aafda","659fc2614097076c144aafdb","659fc2614097076c144aafdc"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), among many protocols, lopinavir and ritonavir in individual or combined forms with other drugs have been used, causing an increase in the concentration of antiviral drugs in the wastewater and hospital effluents. In conventional wastewater treatment plants, the removal efficiency of various antiviral drugs is estimated to be low (<20%). The high values of predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) for lopinavir and ritonavir (in ng∙L−1) reveal their high chronic toxicity to aquatic organisms. This indicates that lopinavir and ritonavir are current priority antiviral drugs that need to be thoroughly monitored and effectively removed from any water and wastewater samples. In this study, we attempt to explore the impacts of two photo-induced processes (photolysis and photocatalysis) on the toxicity of treated water and wastewater samples containing lopinavir and ritonavir to zebrafish (Danio rerio) and marine bacteria (Allivibrio fischeri). The obtained results reveal that traces of lopinavir in water under photo-induced processes may cause severe problems for Danio rerio, including pericardial edema and shortening of the tail, affecting its behavior, and for Allivibrio fischeri as a result of the oxygen-depleted environment, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Hence, lopinavir must be removed from water and wastewater before being in contact with light. In contrast, the photo-induced processes of ritonavir-containing water and wastewater reduce the toxicity significantly. This shows that even if the physicochemical parameters of water and wastewater are within the standard requirements/limits, the presence of traces of antiviral drugs and their intermediates can affect the survival and behavior of Danio rerio and Allivibrio fischeri. Therefore, the photo-induced processes and additional treatment of water and wastewater containing ritonavir can minimize its toxic effect."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058074062","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"824","pagesFromTo":"1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969722010592?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"659fc2614097076c144aafdc","name":"Mirabbos","lastName":"Hojamberdiev","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f24f9e25-a06c-4a82-ba24-5cc1602f2fdc"},{"objectId":"659fc2614097076c144aafdb","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Jośko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aacc5e96-eed4-44a0-adb4-a255521c9dc2"},{"objectId":"659fc2614097076c144aafda","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Opielak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"25d604d4-adca-43f1-8f9f-f5d8315e3871"},{"objectId":"659fc2614097076c144aafd9","name":"Anna","lastName":"Boguszewska-Czubara","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"299a89ca-5bac-43ad-bfa3-a0f180993e2a"},{"objectId":"659fc2614097076c144aafd8","name":"Agnieszka Katarzyna","lastName":"Krzyszczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d7ac15c9-e530-489f-9864-fd5af6daf5f6"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a00c3","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Czech","uuid":"DFBDEBF7C114925627DA9151532CF82BA9A33324F5242A90DBEC69067DEB26DE07BE7BA0DC9934E39EDB392BF55ED015F31CCE326B397F13DFE37731CA5EBDFC","orcidId":"0000-0002-4895-5186","documentHash":"496ba4f1-066f-4ca9-8a0f-0e382cf3890a"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.153967"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fertilization","Beneficial microorganisms","Leaf greenness","Malus domestica"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397d85","5e70928b878c28a0473979a2","5e709295878c28a0473986e0","5e709292878c28a047398362","5e709479878c28a0473bdde0","5e709400878c28a0473b4a21"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Apple leaf macro- and micronutrient content as affected by soil treatments with fertilizers and microorganisms","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b4","mniswId":"18258","title":"SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE","doi":null,"issn":"0304-4238","eissn":"1879-1018","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"2a554406-91f1-426c-8e10-e67b2e56031a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-02-10","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6220b1362467f004a5a7dbba","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709295878c28a0473986e0","5e70928b878c28a0473979a2","5e709400878c28a0473b4a21","5e709292878c28a047398362","6220b1362467f004a5a7dbc0","5e70928e878c28a047397d85","5e709479878c28a0473bdde0"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The effects of bacterial and fungal inocula on the nutritional status of ‘Sampion’ apple trees was evaluated in three-years study (2018–2020). The experiment was set up in a two-factor system: (i) fertilization (without fertilization or mineral fertilization with nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium); (ii) application of beneficial microorganisms (without application, application of fungi or bacteria). The mixture of beneficial soil fungi contained two species: Aspergillus niger and Purpureocillium lilacinum. The mixture of beneficial bacteria contained three strains of Bacillus (Bacillus sp., Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Paenibacillus polymyxa). The analysis of mineral content and leaf greenness (SPAD index) was performed on the samples collected from the trees in August. The lack of mineral fertilization caused a significant decrease in the nitrogen content of apple leaves, which resulted in their lighter color (lower SPAD index). The application of filamentous fungi or bacterial strains had a modifying effect on the mineral composition of apple leaves, what became evident especially in the third year of the study. An increase in the concentration of nitrogen, calcium, magnesium, sulphur and most microelements (except for boron) was found as a result of the influence of tree mineral fertilization and microorganisms applied to the soil. In the absence of mineral fertilization of the trees, the applied microbial inocula resulted in the significant increase of concentration of most macro- and microelements in the leaf tissue (except for magnesium and boron)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058074065","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6220b1372467f004a5a7dbc4","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"297","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"65c3d34e-b6b5-497c-8dd6-77c856cc8abf"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"297","pagesFromTo":"110975","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0304423822001017?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6220b1362467f004a5a7dbc0","name":"Augustyn","lastName":"Mika","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bf472290-3721-4e2f-a283-0a74aa6068f5"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bdde0","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"97CA3174080827A6B0A0270F12F022527EAC69DEAF9A298A7090DB405A36D9BD3C5300A23E15C79339219E9F5C5A610F383406AAEF43CA7180E096A8773B797B","orcidId":"0000-0001-7802-9733","documentHash":"5b2d0c7c-4406-469f-b682-f04386f8910b"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4a21","name":"Anna","lastName":"Tryngiel-Gać","uuid":"98A77A282439EDFDCA5A17C1FCC501D6ACC64EE0DDE21EC927CAE3EE0F051AFE4F6A667D73E28FFE19E620EEB1194BF4B6A9636A0DD3524FA5494BB0B1F7D3D5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8766-6010","documentHash":"483e9d4e-640a-450f-9733-0cdcfc8af5db"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a0473986e0","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Treder","uuid":"CA809C02520EED47C9A82056AF627806F94D6BB9721D9DB8BB14025A6684CE9FE71CFD1C9D18ECE0B1A2610D5554D573E7368A857C8E508CD75D20E6A051643E","orcidId":"0000-0003-1640-9671","documentHash":"c6034984-8a2c-4af0-ae6a-63868a0ca950"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398362","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Sas-Paszt","uuid":"F65BF0798F03691C5ACA3C2A1EA4E5FD87ED5CB37729DF32BC5DB47710F0EBA374AA8CB082C6E75E322B257742E90231A958EB8FE9204AC6F2B651D5DF6471FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-4076-4032","documentHash":"c4b1b795-a964-4309-87da-3ec6e5c5aacd"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d85","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"3897AF5C7E4FAAF35F404A9BC0F9A8CC22B535BAEF573567F51A2A1A784D9620935E656E73521A53CD02CED856407343E2833BC3E064485F8738EE7724777E10","orcidId":"0000-0002-1473-9207","documentHash":"93393335-9114-4927-8bda-c788c468a09e"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a0473979a2","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Klamkowski","uuid":"7E450B39DF810DB41FC8F651E1A7E17AD750C7E9A422D49912DC393B84655FBED245B386CD93F921C9DE3C513917FBB447B953F71C4C91C5B479A20AFAD3CB05","orcidId":"0000-0003-0358-3726","documentHash":"cbebff37-3723-4ee6-9d6e-43c807f2539a"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.scienta.2022.110975"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Active forms of vitamin D;

The biological evaluation showed that these compounds exhibited similar properties to each other regarding inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of cell differentiation but with subtle and quantitative differences. They showed both overlapping and differential effects on T-cell immune activity. They also showed similar interactions with nuclear receptors with all secosteroids activating vitamin D, liver X, retinoic acid orphan and aryl hydrocarbon receptors in functional assays and also as indicated by molecular modeling. They functioned as substrates for CYP27B1 with enzymatic activity being the highest towards 20S,25(OH)2D3 and the lowest towards 20S(OH)D3.

Chronic immunosuppression, loose stools, and poor wound healing in this population present challenges to the management of perianal diseases. The purpose of the study was to determine the predominant bacterial species found in specimens from perianal lesions causing anal abscess and/or fistula drainage in hospitalized patients, and to compare the number and type of microorganisms isolated from samples taken from patients undergoing biological therapy or traditionally treated. The outcomes of studies of patients treated for anal abscesses or fistulas from 2017 to 2019 were evaluated. Data obtained from medical records included culture and antibiotic sensitivity results of swabs from perianal lesions of isolated microorganisms. A total of 373 swabs were collected from perianal lesions during the analysis period, including 51 (49 positive samples) from patients with CD.

In vitro susceptibility testing showed E. coli, ESBL (strain with Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase) in five cases, S. aureus, MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus -resistant to all beta-lactam antibiotics: penicillins with inhibitors, cephalosporins, monobactams, carbapenems, except for ceftaroline) in one sample.

However, the level of asymmetry may vary depending on the performance on one or both lower limbs. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify the differences in leg stiffness between the dominant and non-dominant lower limb during a two-legged countermovement jump. The research was conducted on 35 s-league basketball players (body height: 1.90 ± 0.08 m, body mass: 81.9 ± 10 kg, age: 19.5 ± 1.7 years). Each participant performed three countermovement jumps with arm swing to the maximum height. Measurements employed a BTS SMART motion analysis system and two Kistler force plates. Statistically significant differences were found during the comparison of leg stiffness in the dominant and non-dominant lower limbs. Inter-limb asymmetry of leg stiffness reached 22.0% in the countermovement phase and 8.9% in the take-off phase. Significant inter-limb asymmetry of leg stiffness might lead to injury or considerably reduce the performance of athletes. Therefore, an important role is to conduct strength and speed-strength trainings with proper loads to both body sides. Coaches should pay more attention to similar lower limbs movement patterns during two-legged exercises and bilateral strength development."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058074090","journalIssue":{"objectId":"621f68422467f0747982d125","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"8476e4d1-ecc4-418a-904f-f17d84f884ae"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"440","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/14/3/440/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"621f68422467f0747982d123","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Zawadzki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8e6bbf49-9f3e-4b20-ac8c-05b024edfbb8"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b823b","name":"Artur","lastName":"Struzik","uuid":"C511CA63A612665123667115A778897AF1FDEE0A9756133DB743C8273BD20675C2AFB679918E324F64A4A9C49184E11A9E93D06CC8411336697E09DABC481FC6","orcidId":"0000-0002-4798-7899","documentHash":"10a18765-9e98-4a70-886c-0a905dd95c9d"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047394fd5","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Winiarski","uuid":"362DED14F863C1EB57062E150D02D3A3EFDCDA9ABF7E5F799C9553097CCC83FCB5DFBB89DAAD37952A7020B4F4EACE81CCC404A0DBA457330C3491198A58C0CA","orcidId":"0000-0001-6109-7510","documentHash":"82ec928d-844b-47bd-970b-f87a6486904f"}],"doi":"10.3390/sym14030440"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"621e3b0b2467f06798e2c5a2","doi":null,"title":"Securitologiczna panorama bezpieczeństwa","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"9788367138604","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"http://www.fnce.info/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"6be6d0d7-27b5-45c2-9aa1-66cc9a8f50b2","publisher":{"objectId":"5d6d0363878c284eaa45c902","mniswId":"71500","name":"Wydawnictwo naukowe FNCE","documentHash":"26eb0606-8c14-43a2-807c-7ad7f4c6df9e"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","uid":"byIMgWh_9RUyyDH3dMzNDyw","uuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna im.

Despite the high productivity and strict control of production conditions in this method, excessive salinity of the substrate often occurs. However, recent research results indicate that salinity at a high enough threshold can improve yield quality, while prolonged exposure to too high EC, or exceeding the safe EC threshold for a given species, leads to reduced quality and reduced or even no yield. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of biodegradable lignite substrate (L) and eustressor in the form of high EC nutrient solution (7.0 dS·m−1) on morphological and physiological parameters, as well as the quality and yield of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) in hydroponic cultivation compared to the mineral wool substrate (MW). The MW/high EC combination showed a significant reduction in shoot diameter by nearly 6% compared to the MW/control EC combination. The stomatal conductance (gs) and the transpiration rate (E) were also significantly reduced in this combination. The present study indicates that the effects of eustressor application vary depending on the growing medium used, and more favorable effects in terms of yield quality were obtained using biodegradable lignite substrate. The high EC of nutrient solution combined with lignite substrate (L/high EC) significantly increased in cucumber fruit the content of β-carotene, lutein, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and the sum of chlorophyll a + b by 33.3%, 40%, 28.6%, 26.3% and 26.7%, respectively, as compared to MW/high EC

aim of the research was to examine the moderating role of search for meaning in the relationship between loneliness and presence of meaning. The authors hypothesized that loneliness would be negatively associated with presence of meaning and that with an increase in search for meaning this relationship would weaken. To test these predictions adults from Poland were invited to participate in three cross-sectional studies: one paper-and-pencil study (Study 1, N = 563) and two online studies (Study 2, N = 306; Study 2, N = 206). In Studies 1 and 2 the moderating effect of search for meaning manifested itself in the case of general loneliness, and in Study 3 in the case of each of the three domains of loneliness (i.e., social, romantic, and family). The studies add to the large body of research on the interpersonal sources of meaning in life and provide preliminary evidence of the moderating role of motivation to seek meaning in the relationship between loneliness and presence of meaning. The results suggest that actively striving to augment one's sense of meaning may prevent the loss of meaning as a result of subjectively perceived social isolation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058074128","journalIssue":{"objectId":"621c8f242467f05c960e03b1","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"190","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"25d366cd-3d26-4020-8942-f6097f08425f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"190","pagesFromTo":"[1-9], [poz.] 111550","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0191886922000538?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"621c8f242467f05c960e03af","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Zakrzewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fcd13c46-114b-44cf-a92a-bcc3cf1aa596"},{"objectId":"621c8f242467f05c960e03ae","name":"Agata","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c97a762e-398c-4109-ba9f-8ebabb62f68c"},{"objectId":"5e70922a878c28a047390eb5","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Borawski","uuid":"114D21B7F0D3653E85D75E94BFE4DEFF0097F116934F387E0FBF9244C2CD217DA0CADEE0E583682D5B522AA08FB070FACD815B04EE6B0B61154AE0C58258D6A6","orcidId":"0000-0002-1504-2145","documentHash":"d63b4f66-6964-4db1-9dd4-5e64eb028a67"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.paid.2022.111550"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fat-soluble vitamins","cinnamaldehyde","nanoemulsions","purity gum ultra","physicochemical stability"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709472878c28a0473bd37b","5e7093b5878c28a0473af8fc"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Effect of Co-Encapsulated Natural Antioxidants with Modified Starch on the Oxidative Stability of β-Carotene Loaded within Nanoemulsions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-3417","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"976d1e86-5dd0-4e19-9276-7114f4dea573"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-20","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61ea70872467f06f09dc92e0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61ea70872467f06f09dc92e2","61ea70872467f06f09dc92e3","61ea70872467f06f09dc92e4","61ea70872467f06f09dc92e5","61ea70872467f06f09dc92e6","61ea70872467f06f09dc92e7","61ea70872467f06f09dc92e8","61ea70872467f06f09dc92e9","5e709472878c28a0473bd37b","5e7093b5878c28a0473af8fc","61ea70872467f06f09dc92ec"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"β-Carotene (vitamin A precursor) and α-tocopherol, the utmost energetic form of vitamin E (VE), are known to be fat-soluble vitamins (FSVs) and essential nutrients needed to enhance the growth and metabolic functions of the human body. Their deficiencies are linked to numerous chronic disorders. Loading of FSVs within nanoemulsions could increase their oxidative stability and solubility. In this research, VE and β-Carotene (BC) were successfully co-entrapped within oil-in-water nanoemulsions of carrier oils, including tuna fish oil (TFO) and medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), stabilized by modified starch and Tween-80. These nanoemulsions and free carrier oils loaded with vitamins were stored for over one month to investigate the impact of storage circumstances on their physiochemical characteristics. Entrapped bioactive compounds inside the nanoemulsions and bare oil systems showed a diverse behavior in terms of oxidation. A more deficiency of FSVs was found at higher temperatures that were more noticeable in the case of BC. VE behaved like an antioxidant to protect BC in MCT-based nanoemulsions, whereas it could not protect BC perfectly inside the TFO-loaded nanoemulsions. However, cinnamaldehyde (CIN) loading significantly enhanced the oxidative stability and FSVs retention in each nanoemulsion. Purity gum ultra (PGU)-based nanoemulsions comprising FSVs and CIN presented a greater BC retention (42.3%) and VE retention (90.1%) over one-month storage at 40 °C than Twee 80. The superior stability of PGU is accredited to the OSA-MS capabilities to produce denser interfacial coatings that can protect the entrapped compounds from the aqueous phase. This study delivers valuable evidence about the simultaneous loading of lipophilic bioactive compounds to enrich functional foods."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058074134","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1070","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/3/1070","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61ea70872467f06f09dc92ec","name":"Wenshui","lastName":"Xia","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d2ffa269-351f-4172-bde9-2669bd60cb1e"},{"objectId":"61ea70872467f06f09dc92e9","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Usman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c8e4da6a-6fb6-4274-9eea-b130e88e6d4e"},{"objectId":"61ea70872467f06f09dc92e8","name":"Sohail","lastName":"Khan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"594b47b1-e862-48e7-948a-80d4a483c1f8"},{"objectId":"61ea70872467f06f09dc92e7","name":"Hafiz Muhammad","lastName":"Shahbaz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e5f0512b-af96-4b94-8ccd-3a526a7686b5"},{"objectId":"61ea70872467f06f09dc92e6","name":"Qayyum","lastName":"Shehzad","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a8468a1e-adc4-48dc-bdd7-7b9a196d9b4e"},{"objectId":"61ea70872467f06f09dc92e5","name":"Muhammad Modassar Ali Nawaz","lastName":"Ranjha","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"48304ab5-40dd-4395-82f7-0bc6598eb052"},{"objectId":"61ea70872467f06f09dc92e4","name":"Seid Mahdi","lastName":"Jafari","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5858e85b-4e88-4d39-a339-5c926e763fc7"},{"objectId":"61ea70872467f06f09dc92e3","name":"Abdur","lastName":"Rehman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e5e9c70f-2ff1-4a66-8971-efccb41ec676"},{"objectId":"61ea70872467f06f09dc92e2","name":"Ahmad","lastName":"Ali","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f51675c8-1e01-4633-9226-1f9b6991e856"},{"objectId":"5e709472878c28a0473bd37b","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Kowalczewski","uuid":"DE6CB135EA3EC9DEFAD4D1903F445B04F935CDE49DF028924FE4C2B542B69B3DCE4DD80636C1F2B5FCF8D125090539F66C6AE3409827CB09FE577B21D81042E9","orcidId":"0000-0002-0153-4624","documentHash":"243c1264-fd70-4d77-b348-a3a1df8cbf0d"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af8fc","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Jarzębski","uuid":"F4CFC97147DA68F7FA3F75ED6CD1BF3A3D06D43D8CB608E65DF2F375049DE297F729092C0424CD8FDDC7D4F8E861F5A342816AD294C508DCDE4826DFD476093C","orcidId":"0000-0001-9832-9274","documentHash":"f4895689-7847-464e-96af-ac286fbf566c"}],"doi":"10.3390/app12031070"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fungal diseases","maize cultivation","organic and integrated systems"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","uid":"boRt8XbJIJxFX3j3lPkVVng","uuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","parentUuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","rootUuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","name":"Instytut Uprawy Nawożenia i Gleboznawstwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709204878c28a04738ea62","5e70949d878c28a0473c079c","5e70949d878c28a0473c079b","5e70929c878c28a047399189","5e70929c878c28a0473991c6"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Occurrence of Fungal Diseases in Maize in Organic Farming Versus an Integrated Management System","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d9","mniswId":"689","title":"Agronomy","doi":null,"issn":"2073-4395","eissn":"2073-4395","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"f748c34e-fa45-428e-abf2-7624cc5986fd"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-23","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"621f3d8d2467f0747981aab5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70949d878c28a0473c079c","5e70929c878c28a047399189","5e70949d878c28a0473c079b","5e70929c878c28a0473991c6","5e709204878c28a04738ea62"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Organic farming is becoming increasingly popular because it leads to healthier products. Due to limitations on the use of chemical protection, however, plants may be more susceptible to pathogen attacks. Therefore, the aim of the study was to determine the occurrence of fungal diseases in maize grown in organic versus integrated systems. The field experiment was conducted during the years 2017–2019 in Puławy, Poland. Three maize varieties, Ambrosini, Smolitop and Ricardinio, were cultivated in two fields with a different crop production system. The incidence of fungal diseases, such as northern corn leaf blight, eyespot, common corn rust, corn smut and Fusarium ear rot, was assessed. Fungal isolates were collected from leaves and cobs with disease symptoms and identified microscopically and molecularly. In both cultivation systems, northern corn leaf blight and eyespot were the most common, while corn rust and fusariosis were seen more often in organic cultivation. Alternaria alternata, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium poae, Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium sporotrichioides were the fungal species most frequently detected in the two systems. Additionally, Fusarium verticillioides was common in the organic system. Weather conditions, especially heavy rainfall and high air humidity, greatly influenced the incidence of such diseases."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058074139","journalIssue":{"objectId":"621de6a72467f06798e1658c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"791f6fee-b3db-49ee-bc68-ae9bd65e5552"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"558","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/3/558/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70949d878c28a0473c079c","name":"Diana","lastName":"Czarnecka","uuid":"7427308BDAD4E5B2163944FADEC21B8B65409697D539CDAC65C31C3201D7DBAF2EE761873B553D50F985C716D133644A0366743AD0A5A13BDA9563EFAEB42F62","orcidId":"0000-0003-1272-9950","documentHash":"91373685-5b4f-411d-8388-4489a8ff2c40"},{"objectId":"5e70949d878c28a0473c079b","name":"Monika","lastName":"Agacka-Mołdoch","uuid":"8EB0C6A29ED78847E97915BB5EBA5A1A82E1680A8C291C0A48414F219D5D2064E125821684CBA5A76AEE74A6AC3170E9BC9A78138764BA23C39A2B6A6433EEC7","orcidId":"0000-0001-9373-6129","documentHash":"a6b26b55-bbd8-4dea-9210-bc87d7f40ec0"},{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a0473991c6","name":"Anna","lastName":"Trojak-Goluch","uuid":"C92C2A6AC4F757107C18735E738D8D18BBA28B5CC147A14D108126A2C0F19759BDC271BBC027EE3E0BCF2791C3D3C38D799D62FD7A6CEBC48F26DAF812495C9F","orcidId":"0000-0002-5191-4414","documentHash":"deb3b12d-c53e-4ab4-8661-a40b7fcb2135"},{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a047399189","name":"Anna","lastName":"Czubacka","uuid":"FAC0207000BE887F9BAAC9F4D9434E7C9EA9C00318FAEB73987061B66C643A50B65B526EBD0EC7ED4FDDE36C052A235749E578913AAF784713C81895229BFC5C","orcidId":"0000-0003-1843-6745","documentHash":"9e21f12f-ba62-42b0-95f1-cbdf04e52db9"},{"objectId":"5e709204878c28a04738ea62","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Księżak","uuid":"1C7F089F8B003DCFC5229157C0DF2F8CEAE61EED68E946FF6562875CA2FA370EB67F631394FF2EEC8A905028ABA46EE5463871281A8902936572221A5E827EB0","orcidId":"0000-0002-1991-1141","documentHash":"fcaed47f-5121-4f49-b1bf-1e354189cf7c"}],"doi":"10.3390/agronomy12030558"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["crisis remote education","higher education","distance teaching","distance learning","emergency e-learning","students","exams","asessment","COVID-19","SARS-CoV-2"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de42","uid":"b6wbLGqd2-hodtaiYCyr6xA","uuid":"e45fc816-fbf4-4e46-adfa-89c07c084f45","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de42","parentUuid":"e45fc816-fbf4-4e46-adfa-89c07c084f45","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de42","rootUuid":"e45fc816-fbf4-4e46-adfa-89c07c084f45","name":"Akademia Pedagogiki Specjalnej im.

The total phenolic content established in the purified extracts (PEs) of HIh, HP, and HG was 29.6, 24.0, and 13.0%, respectively. Thirty-eight non-saponin metabolites were identified using LC-HR-QTOF-ESI-MS; however, only 9 were common for the studied Herniaria species. The most abundant phenolic compound in HG-PE was narcissin (7.4%), HP-PE shared 3 major constituents, namely cis-2-hydroxy-4-methoxycinnamic acid 2-O-β-glucoside (cis-GMCA, 5.8%), narcissin (5.4%), and rutin (5.3%). Almost half of HIh phenolic content (14.7%) belonged to oxytroflavoside A (7-O-methylkaempferol-3-O-[3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-(1→6)]-[α-rhamnopyranosyl-(1→2)]-β-galactopyranoside). Antioxidant properties of the Herniaria PEs were evaluated employing an experimental model of human blood plasma, exposed to the peroxynitrite-induced oxidative stress. The assays demonstrated significant reduction of oxidative damage to protein and lipid plasma components (estimated by measurements of 3-nitrotyrosine, protein thiol groups, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances), and moderate protection of its non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity. Anti-inflammatory properties of the Herniaria PEs were evaluated In Vitro as inhibitory effects against cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and -2) and concanavalin A-induced inflammatory response of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). None of the studied plants showed inhibitory effects on COXs but all purified extracts partly reduced the release of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) from PBMCs, which suggested their prospective ability to up-regulate inflammatory response of the cells. The purified extract from H. glabra turned out to be the most efficient suppressor of PBMCs’ inflammatory response. Additionally, cytotoxicity of purified Herniaria extracts on PBMCs was ruled out based on In Vitro studies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058074149","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"1-23","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/2/530","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65770fd04097071b8e0c4823","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Oleszek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6b913450-1917-4a27-a1ae-1c05bdac6043"},{"objectId":"65770fd04097071b8e0c4822","name":"Svitlana","lastName":"Marchyshyn","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c8ca580b-e8f6-43cd-a8e2-6406a99eb98c"},{"objectId":"65770fd04097071b8e0c4820","name":"Solomiia","lastName":"Kozachok","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e26a63c0-a09b-4111-997a-20cee6418007"},{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b866c","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Wojtanowski","uuid":"2E2E9ED6200050C578A0EE91EEB9DBFDA5DFDD0CF228F6822663105394CAC83DCAD6183F6A79626E33437E5630E2DFA64B95823E24F25BE71F0AC5E188EDEB3C","orcidId":"0000-0002-2133-7134","documentHash":"0078fcf6-e95d-4c6e-8695-ead36e3045a9"},{"objectId":"5e70939e878c28a0473add38","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kołodziejczyk-Czepas","uuid":"942741A82BC0BF7B7997D3CA9BEDE4AA66322ECFC19F4EA568BDBF59C928A0AECA56FD0DA7DEF205733425A220A9BEE4DE534ECF9835E465A076C2D6925DEAE0","orcidId":"0000-0001-8849-1067","documentHash":"eee518ba-f6e7-4cdd-8c55-7faa2fbf25a2"},{"objectId":"5e7092c9878c28a04739c9ef","name":"Grażyna","lastName":"Zgórka","uuid":"AF1F808CF34BD5A0CAE9D0128A9E74CD8D48636ABB3C25AFFB7112861D6860DED7EC14EE938561DBAA0018A2D9B3B0BA8636ABFB7A5F31CFF68C6C055B7602BF","orcidId":"0000-0002-0478-2404","documentHash":"3c769006-43ee-45aa-982b-08a549da0908"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules27020530"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deaa","uid":"bIVuXx-j3MA3vg5GttGgoow","uuid":"7688bf94-399f-4567-854e-220f826816fb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deaa","parentUuid":"7688bf94-399f-4567-854e-220f826816fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deaa","rootUuid":"7688bf94-399f-4567-854e-220f826816fb","name":"Instytut Geografii i Przestrzennego Zagospodarowania im.

Social media data can reveal public perceptions and experience with respect to the pandemic, and also reveal factors that hamper or support efforts to curb global spread of the disease. In this paper, we analyzed COVID-19-related comments collected from six social media platforms using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. We identified relevant opinionated keyphrases and their respective sentiment polarity (negative or positive) from over 1 million randomly selected comments, and then categorized them into broader themes using thematic analysis. Our results uncover 34 negative themes out of which 17 are economic, socio-political, educational, and political issues. Twenty (20) positive themes were also identified. We discuss the negative issues and suggest interventions to tackle them based on the positive themes and research evidence."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058074174","journalIssue":{"objectId":"622201dc2467f016970e185a","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"8e47afcf-1050-4396-9cf1-ed5517d97455"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-34","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s41666-021-00111-w.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"622201dc2467f016970e1858","name":"Rita","lastName":"Orji","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6152-8034","documentHash":"d22c6d70-c2d9-4182-a077-21ba2924837a"},{"objectId":"622201dc2467f016970e1856","name":"Evangelos","lastName":"Milios","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f0032dc9-c675-4c77-8e44-46d9d8cee13d"},{"objectId":"622201dc2467f016970e1855","name":"Fidelia Anulika","lastName":"Orji","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5525d81e-1ff6-438f-8cf9-0436ffc1698a"},{"objectId":"622201dc2467f016970e1854","name":"Ashfaq","lastName":"Adib","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"27622566-d635-4a27-938a-9cb617182f8e"},{"objectId":"622201dc2467f016970e1853","name":"Banuchitra","lastName":"Suruliraj","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b367269e-ab0e-410c-9fac-10da7403071b"},{"objectId":"622201dc2467f016970e1852","name":"Dinesh","lastName":"Mulchandani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a752fd41-15ee-4585-9793-7546aa101833"},{"objectId":"622201dc2467f016970e1851","name":"Chinenye","lastName":"Ndulue","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9a8b44c6-08bf-477a-8f25-1cf8f5901948"},{"objectId":"622201dc2467f016970e1850","name":"Oladapo","lastName":"Oyebode","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5797-7790","documentHash":"19f1349d-4b7a-4464-8e87-67cf6c71bf18"},{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a5f77","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Matwin","uuid":"0A766745E1F9F7DDBCDCAE3FA91ED5EE107CA1A64D4FEDF9ED0C09F9C9FBC3BFA3E57ACCA3E158753B818C49CB598ED54C86CC510725CFAF5A42C8A7F5BA58A1","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"07f9075f-604b-40b5-9de2-85c9b5e714da"}],"doi":"10.1007/s41666-021-00111-w"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Spatial Chaos","Planning Law","System of Spatial Management","Spatial Development","Social Participation","Landscape/Regional and Urban Planning"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":"9783030969387","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","uid":"bsTIibl14j-FXDX1as_pUTA","uuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","parentUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","rootUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","name":"Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a568"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deaa","uid":"bIVuXx-j3MA3vg5GttGgoow","uuid":"7688bf94-399f-4567-854e-220f826816fb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deaa","parentUuid":"7688bf94-399f-4567-854e-220f826816fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deaa","rootUuid":"7688bf94-399f-4567-854e-220f826816fb","name":"Instytut Geografii i Przestrzennego Zagospodarowania im.

Based on the general relations of linear elasticity theory, a mathematical model of thin multilayered inclusion of finite width is constructed. The possibility of nonperfect contact along a part of the interface between the inclusion and the matrix, and between the layers of inclusion where surface energy or sliding with dry friction occurs, is envisaged. Based on the application of the theory of functions of a complex variable and the jump function method, the stress-strain field in the vicinity of the inclusion during its interaction with the concentrated forces and screw dislocations was calculated. The values of generalized stress intensity factors for the asymptotics of stress-strain fields in the vicinity of the ends of thin inhomogeneities are calculated, using which the stress concentration and local strength of the structure can be calculated. Several effects have been identified which can be used in designing the structure of layers and operation modes of such composites. The proposed method has shown its effectiveness for solving a whole class of problems of deformation and fracture of bodies with thin deformable inclusions of finite length and can be used for mathematical modeling of the mechanical effects of thin FGM heterogeneities in composites."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058074193","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/4/1435","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6571a7214097071b8e66b07d","name":"Liubov","lastName":"Piskozub","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6c9262fe-5578-4b7b-a8f9-35f578407365"},{"objectId":"6571a7214097071b8e66b07c","name":"Yosyf ","lastName":"Piskozub","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d7272434-5a71-4eae-8f7a-55b896195be8"},{"objectId":"6571a7214097071b8e66b07b","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Hutsaylyuk ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0ef9f9c6-c114-4ad2-9eea-ab0cdf37145c"},{"objectId":"5e709253878c28a047393c32","name":"Heorhij","lastName":"Sulym","uuid":"A80AFC350E0CC9AAAD289ED8EE4925CDFCAE7AD66A184EFC75D9835008A8A26B06CBD1023065DBA68A9BA7DC6BFA0AC552D615F837EF82167397ABFF169EC77D","orcidId":"0000-0003-2223-8645","documentHash":"01e7a323-e39b-46f6-987e-836072d74c97"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15041435"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bioactive compounds; phenolic compounds; phenolic acids; flavonoids; phytosterols; sorghum; functional food"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a04738567d","uid":"buXMLEs4lpbxvwxbqswKB9Q","uuid":"fd60174d-73fa-4546-8dce-9f89a7663753","parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a04738567d","parentUuid":"fd60174d-73fa-4546-8dce-9f89a7663753","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a04738567d","rootUuid":"fd60174d-73fa-4546-8dce-9f89a7663753","name":"Instytut Włókien Naturalnych i Roślin Zielarskich - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092cd878c28a04739d1d2"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6443","5e7093a6878c28a0473ae752"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Concentration of Pro-Health Compound of Sorghum Grain-Based Foods","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"FOODS","doi":null,"issn":"2304-8158","eissn":null,"websiteLink":"https://doi.org/10.3390/foods8100467","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"ef1a9e8c-2661-4476-b116-692933ac116b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61e9593b2467f0651ffdd189","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092cd878c28a04739d1d2","5e7093a6878c28a0473ae752","5e709347878c28a0473a6443"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"More than 35% of the world sorghum seed production is a human food source. The main ingredient of fully ripe sorghum grains is starch. Sorghum does not contain gluten, and it is also a rich source of antioxidant compounds other than vitamins or macro- and microelements, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, and sterols. The aim of this study was to determine the antioxidant activity and the content of selected bioactive compounds, i.e., total phenolic acids, total flavonoids, and total phytosterols, as well as determination of the qualitative and quantitative profile of phenolic acids, flavonoids, and phytosterols in various food products, the basic ingredient of which was sorghum grain. It was found that antioxidant activity is related to the total phenolic compounds content. The ABTS•+ ranged from 319 to 885 µmol TROLOX/kg. However, white sorghum grain flour contained almost two times more polyphenols than red sorghum grain flour. The FPA ranged from 224 in raw pasta to 689 mgGAE/100 g in white sorghum grain. During this study, the quantitative profile of selected polyphenols in grain flour, wafers, pasta, and cookies containing sorghum grain was also investigated, as well as the content of 11 selected phenolic acids.

Puchalski demonstrates the intersection between such national policies and larger processes taking place at the time, including the internationalist turn of colonialism and the global fascination with technocratic solutions.\n\nCarefully researched, the volume is key reading for scholars and advanced students of twentieth-century European history."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058074209","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":"Routledge Histories of Central and Eastern Europe","translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb75f","mniswId":"2100","name":"Routledge","documentHash":"64cc346c-fb88-4618-a71a-f3105e672a66"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.routledge.com/Poland-in-a-Colonial-World-Order-Adjustments-and-Aspirations-19181939/Puchalski/p/book/9780367674700","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094f6878c28a0473c807e","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Puchalski","uuid":"E4B23AC344F675FFA055B544717175EB4A4229E8CD0FE63534CF0E5480BEF622626148B3E32105DAD9A2BCFD9F4B718231B365A609686719CAE07EE5437DE938","orcidId":"0000-0003-4530-959X","documentHash":"bdeed4cf-603e-469e-8a15-4b36583caec8"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Soil organic matter","Soil microbial community","Carbon sequestration","Organic carbon","Agricultural practices","Microbial biomass carbon","Extracellular polymeric substances"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","uid":"boRt8XbJIJxFX3j3lPkVVng","uuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","parentUuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def8","rootUuid":"dcbbf3e8-3ee0-474a-9b9e-f0c2e403c540","name":"Instytut Uprawy Nawożenia i Gleboznawstwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709297878c28a047398897"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Soil carbon sequestration – An interplay between soil microbial community and soil organic matter dynamics","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","doi":null,"issn":"0048-9697","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"536a2e2c-aae7-4edb-84d0-5d817a2d0285"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62162ee82467f04ac0db67e2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62162ee82467f04ac0db67e4","62162ee82467f04ac0db67e5","5e709297878c28a047398897","62162ee82467f04ac0db67e7","62162ee82467f04ac0db67e8"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Soil carbon sequestration (SCS) refers to the uptake of carbon (C) containing substances from the atmosphere and its storage in soil C pools. Soil microbial community (SMC) play a major role in C cycling and their activity has been considered as the main driver of differences in the potential to store C in soils. The composition of the SMC is crucial for the maintenance of soil ecosystem services, as the structure and activity of SMC also regulates the turnover and delivery of nutrients, as well as the rate of decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM). Quantifying the impact of agricultural practices on both SMC and SCS is key to improve sustainability of soil management. Hence, we discuss the impact of farming practices improving SCS by altering SMC, SOM, and soil aggregates, unraveling their inter-and intra-relationships. Using quantitative and process driven insights from 197 peer-reviewed publications leads to the conclusion that the net benefits from agricultural management to improve SCS would not be sustainable if we overlook the role of soil microbial community. Reintroduction of the decayed microbial community to agricultural soils is crucial for enhancing long-term C storage potential of soils and stabilize them over time. The interactions among SMC, SOM, soil aggregates, and agricultural activities still require more knowledge and research to understand their full contribution to the SCS."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058074218","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62162ee82467f04ac0db67ea","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"815","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"87205678-16f4-4307-a462-7ca310e335b7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"815","pagesFromTo":"152928","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0048969722000171?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62162ee82467f04ac0db67e8","name":"Roberto","lastName":"Parra-Saldívar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"49298650-3015-432b-80ed-2490b6605ee9"},{"objectId":"62162ee82467f04ac0db67e7","name":"Hafiz
