Next, we identify the 14 typology criteria used so far in the literature, thematically analyse them and aggregate them into a set useful for further rigorous scrutiny and for the incremental collection of empirical findings.

Such events are good occasions to disseminate knowledge to a large audience. The results of scientific research bring advances for mankind. Since research mostly depends on public funds, it is important to gain understanding and support for it. Scientists are also responsible for educating people in important aspects of science. In a wider perspective, science popularisation may be relevant to influencing decision-making government agencies e.g. regarding legislation about the use of animals in biomedical research. In this paper, we present one of the approaches to knowledge dissemination, namely the independent educational project, which has a more flexible formula, and may give more benefits than science festivals. Based on our experience in implementing educational projects connected with biology, we provide examples of the workflow of such a project and some useful tips. We show some quantitative data underlining the significant educational effect of this specific approach. Science popularisation in this form not only provides significant benefits both for the participants and the tutor, such as satisfaction and inspiration, but also a well-heard voice in public debate and/or useful preliminary experimental research

climate changes and declining ice cover (glacial) are accompanied by an increase in the length of paraglacial coasts. Therefore, issues related to the development and transformation of such areas attract increasing interest. No complex classification of paraglacial coasts has been presented so far. The main aim of this study was the determination of the mutual relations and evolution of paraglacial coasts in a systemic approach (paraglacial, proglacial, periglacial) based on the example of Recherchefjorden (Svalbard). Classification of coasts based on geomorphological mapping of the coasts of Recherchefjorden has been developed in terms of the lithology of sediments, genetic origins of hinterland, morphology, and morphodynamics. Analyses of field data and archival materials permitted the preparation of a model of the evolution of six main groups of coasts. Three groups were designated, characteristic of each of the glacial and paraglacial, and periglacial landscape and conditions causing transitions between particular types of coasts were determined. Due to the comprehensive and universal characteristics used in the development of the scheme and the representative landscapes of the Recherchefjorden region, the classification of High Arctic rock coasts presented here is readily transferable to other regions, potentially facilitating future research, management, and modeling of paraglacial areas."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051303277","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bbe7ef40970754861bf005","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"112","doi":"","documentHash":"e85d3eed-3f95-4906-96c3-5f9e1b3b6300"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"112","pagesFromTo":"1-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/24694452.2021.1898323","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"60a4d5882467f03fde375555","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Mędrek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"25f529b4-4383-40aa-a5f6-8f1ec79e7639"},{"objectId":"60a4d5882467f03fde375554","name":"Michael","lastName":"Lim","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6507-6773","documentHash":"9362cef2-1378-497c-9504-1dcbeadb7987"},{"objectId":"60a4d5882467f03fde375552","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Jarosz","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9565-3498","documentHash":"29badf08-6c41-48e1-931d-071554370ed1"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af532","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Moskalik","uuid":"7089D643B2594CC57D59DE2700FC187DBB9C4D62E0328B409B12232373FF164ED96D4B648D07CC92EF366549051735987A73E346A7B7CAB38ED8A2FACEA2C173","orcidId":"0000-0002-0615-9528","documentHash":"312a8722-20f8-4f71-88a9-6b2d058d4efe"},{"objectId":"5e7092f8878c28a0473a044e","name":"Jan","lastName":"Rodzik","uuid":"FA6D726CEB9B2B6FED5F7CB1D78DC990550361CA555CED7E1357CE53BB6BC6D0F2E716AAE261081C37F426D4626BD992A1DA753FEBEDACF4CF8DDDDE33ABC9A3","orcidId":"0000-0001-7266-0516","documentHash":"36ce00a4-b453-4f05-af45-ed22b20ea55d"},{"objectId":"5e7092f8878c28a0473a043b","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Zagórski","uuid":"C604AF8ABACA2653D6CCA6C92726D4E575DC2B5EE313D2FD95E0217ECCA18B5D9E6DE80DA24A6B7936A11AE165DF2C6E7F95FAC3D822B0CFF9C430BE78F91A61","orcidId":"0000-0002-6086-0470","documentHash":"c9a6fcdb-dda3-4185-a5d3-00078778a1aa"}],"doi":"10.1080/24694452.2021.1898323"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Low Order Technique Deflagration","hazardous object neutralization","Tallboy neutralization","UXO neutralization"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","uid":"bGA_QwQGoDNg-6MMEBxlWNQ","uuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","parentUuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","rootUuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","name":"Akademia Marynarki Wojennej im.

It is believed to be the first underwater action concerning this type of bomb, which has previously been neutralized on land in Europe (Germany, one confirmed case). The preparation of the operation, on an unprecedented scale at national, European and global level, took one year and included a series of projects related to clearing the space around the bomb from other identified UXO objects, international consultations, historical analyses, determination of the risk to residents and critical infrastructure in the event of an explosion of the bomb containing approximately 2400 kg of the TORPEX explosive (with an increased force equivalent to almost 3600 kg of TNT). The object was neutralized on spot at the depth of 12 m, near a ferry crossing, by specialists from the 41st Navy EOD Team from the 12th MCM Squadron (8th Coastal Defence Flotilla), using the Low Order Deflagration technique (underwater deflagration method). In the case discussed, there was an accumulation of unfavourable conditions which practically excluded the use of blow-in-situ explosive methods (BIP), as well as the extraction of the object and its transport to a military ground. After a partial deflagration of the explosive, the explosive was detonated (DDT). Estimates indicate that the deflagration level reached between 55 and 60%, which significantly reduced the strength and effects of the underwater explosion."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051309993","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6082739a2467f007c229445f","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"c76d0a0e-f2f7-4d82-89a3-8c73cf3b5a6d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"524-535","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2214914721000374?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70948e878c28a0473bf877","name":"Rafał","lastName":"MIĘTKIEWICZ","uuid":"278E3BE2FEEBD59A49462B639BEEF72097BE3CB2DAF5967928FA021C2B8EF404E53A2138E65FE2FCE5E4FDC507DA541B15B4B0E73977FCF7C3086AEB68E1A318","orcidId":"0000-0002-3129-7092","documentHash":"1fe6fe8a-4012-41c2-8535-c299d8c0a1f8"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.dt.2021.03.011"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","uid":"bpBenp-xOEUyWFZisxulIDw","uuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","parentUuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","rootUuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","name":"Uniwersytet Kardynała Stefana Wyszyńskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709352878c28a0473a7245"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df1d","uid":"br6adl8JzUqEoa7sG0ujCXg","uuid":"2505fc7c-d493-4c57-8c1f-653bc032f337","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Pedagogiczny","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709409878c28a0473b53ee"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The role of teachers’ emotional intelligence and social competences with special educational needs students","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d54878c28514547ac51","mniswId":"6279","title":"European Journal of Special Needs Education","doi":null,"issn":"0885-6257","eissn":"1469-591X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"a6dbaebd-060a-43ac-811a-6b7104d8c715"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"605f22b32467f0242371deff","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709352878c28a0473a7245","5e709409878c28a0473b53ee"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"There is a lack of research on the relationship between emotional intelligence and social competences, and the difficulties experienced by teachers in the process of educating students, especially those with special educational needs, which is why the aim of this research was to discover if the difficulties experienced by teachers in working with students with different types of special educational needs are related to the differences in the respondents’ level of emotional intelligence as well as social competences.

aim of the study was to analyse the polymorphism of the PIT-1 gene withe introns 4 and 5 and exon\r\n6 in the Limousine cattle breed and its relation to selected rearing traits. Relationships were determined\r\nbetween the genetic variants of the three polymorphic sites of the PIT-1 gene and the following rearing\r\nparameters: body weight at birth, body weight at weaning on day 270, daily weight gain from birth to\r\nweaning, age at first calving and body weight after first calving. The frequency of alleles of the analysed loci was: T =0.2887 and G =0.7913 (IVS4-39G>T), A =0.1087 and G =0.8913 (IVS5+438G>A)\r\nand A = 0.2913 and G =0.7087 (c.1178G>A). For each of the studied polymorphic sites, homozygotes (-,-) were found least frequently. The results showed relationship between polymorphism in loci IVS5+438G> A and c.1178G>A, and rearing traits. The analysis confirmed significant statistical differences (P ≤ 0.05) between homozygotes (+,+) and heterozygotes (+,-) for the following traits: age at first calving (IVS5+438G>A), weights at weaning (c.1178G> A) and daily weight gain from birth to weaning (c.1178G>A).

The biomass is effectively produced by fungal submerged culture at 20 ℃, which results in lower energy consumption during the production of biocatalyst. Supplementation of the culture medium with calcium carbonate together with olive oil contributed to a significant increase in the active biomass of mycelium in one batch culture and increased the efficiency of the biocatalyst. Biomass-bound lipase showed high catalytic activity in a broad temperature range of 30–60 °C and stability up to 70 °C. A maximum molar conversion value of 98% was obtained at 30 °C in n-hexane using a 2:1 alcohol-to-acid molar ratio and 3% w/v of the biocatalyst within 24 h. The high equimolar concentration of the substrates (200 mM) did not have an adverse effect on mycelial biomass activity. Dry mycelium of C. pannorum is a promising biocatalyst for large-scale biosynthesis of citronellyl acetate, given its low-cost production, high activity at low temperatures, and reusability in a minimum of seven 24-h biocatalytic cycles."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051321503","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"399-411","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12155-021-10289-x","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"60aa172f2467f02d0614136d","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Tomaszewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"64e46027-8dd9-4752-b839-3f41a62a8593"},{"objectId":"5e7093de878c28a0473b23ae","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Kutyła","uuid":"FEAB5690018F793E8CF237DDE61E3B5FE5F6C0D2390454FC0205ED911E3E6610A7FA5FF1FF85822FBF5F085F7D3B90FCB3B7426755B47F595ADB07E2321C31FD","orcidId":"0000-0002-1171-897X","documentHash":"bbaea569-646e-4b17-91d3-d51fcfd183a3"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6635","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Buczek","uuid":"D8D66C07DB9BB81CD60A594FBD93B841626E816FD6950B558F1D2DB9A342104E4638CA5940C083496E76FB1530CF52B09AED8A88447F658DC69BEA3566913B44","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"585eadba-57fd-49ba-b00e-10e92e675594"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a04739ff63","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Trytek","uuid":"983C9A7864211DC29E5759E944D34935AACA816C03F6DF04FDF108BD24C2E9FB3DFF70971273A59BE068665722B607848B1C87542967E0D23B8C9CBDAD98F91C","orcidId":"0000-0002-4656-7737","documentHash":"59926515-7bdf-4123-ab1e-e0aa53359849"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390afc","name":"Siemowit","lastName":"Muszyński","uuid":"E8B92AB9BFAAFAA51E854380BD375F25BDAB1C32543155332BAAE342F63D09EA2D5994A8241100BB8141CB6AA0718808F1D6B5FFCF207EAF09FA2CBCA463FF34","orcidId":"0000-0002-4118-6302","documentHash":"4ac39fda-840b-464a-9401-d6ddde97f0d1"}],"doi":"10.1007/s12155-021-10289-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["TG–DTG","Gating system","Pyrolysis","Cellulose mix","Gas emissivity"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70926a878c28a047395465"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The gas evolution of a modified cellulose mixture used for gating systems in the no-bake mould process","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478b86","mniswId":"13040","title":"Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry","doi":null,"issn":"1388-6150","eissn":"1588-2926","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"93d6d5e4-f898-4c49-a7d1-6d672d3e4666"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"FEBRUARY","releaseDateYear":2021,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"605b4f422467f00fdb700d54","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70926a878c28a047395465","6735ab7efdbe83034964e4cc"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper shows the results of a study of gas evolution from a patented modified cellulose mix used in the production of no-bake casting moulds. The modified cellulose mixture was used for investigation with additives such as expanded perlite, expanded vermiculite and microspheres. The binder was an inorganic resin based on commercial technology, called Geopol. Samples were tested in different compositions in order to show the influence of all the additives mentioned. Two different methods were used—one was based on TG–TDG–MS investigation and the other was based on pyrolysis combined with a gas composition analyser. Investigations of both methods were carried out at temperatures up to 900 °C. The results showed that the gas emissions during thermal degradation of all the modified mixtures did not constitute substances that are hazardous or dangerous to health. Therefore, the material proposed can be used as a solution that is more environmentally friendly when compared to formulas which exist on the market and are abundant in harmful compounds."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051327936","journalIssue":{"objectId":"643f8d284097076e1e0d70ac","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"147","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"5d44d03d-8be9-4082-939f-4ab8aa7acd26"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"147","pagesFromTo":"pages 2027–2034","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6735ab7efdbe83034964e4cc","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Zawieja","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"730ee7f9-bdcf-423a-9767-de8e8a52c1a3"},{"objectId":"5e70926a878c28a047395465","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Sawicki","uuid":"65863D2631C93E8E3908B2CF9F5AB8BA17F9BCB2F0D46E8519ACBF04F910779BE074E526F70F134057F9025A4DB3FE10FC0722ED27C36BFF4164B6BC553A12AE","orcidId":"0000-0001-9147-7338","documentHash":"6e159a04-711a-444f-a84e-44971664c303"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10973-021-10634-4"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Dynamic Programming","Regional Development","Reference System","Decision Processes","Reference Points","Multistage Process","Optimality Principle","Numerical Example","Development Problem","Optimality Equations"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","uid":"bLoLgWizTVEIn0ZQBwSDx-Q","uuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","parentUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","rootUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","name":"Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709259878c28a047394268"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Multiobjective dynamic programming in bipolar multistage method","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547708c","mniswId":"1274","title":"Annals of Operations Research","doi":null,"issn":"0254-5330","eissn":"1572-9338","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"0343d9ef-cb4a-4e16-8751-c93a76a05f13"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"606ae9da2467f07f863aff39","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709259878c28a047394268"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The multicriteria Bipolar method can be extended and used to control multicriteria, multistage decision processes. In this extension, at each stage of the given multistage process two sets of reference points are determined, constituting a reference system for the evaluation of stage alternatives. Multistage alternatives, which are compositions of stage alternatives, are assigned to one of six predefined hierarchical classes and then ranked. The aim of this paper is to show the possibility of finding the best multistage alternative, using Bellman’s optimality principle and optimality equations. Of particular importance is a theorem on the non-dominance of the best multistage alternative, proven here. The methodology proposed allows to avoid reviewing each multistage alternative, which is important in large-size problems. The method is illustrated by a numerical example and a brief description of the sustainable regional development problem.

consider a stochastic discrete multiobjective programming process with a finite number of stages. The number of states at each stage and the number of feasible decisions at each state are also finite. The aim of the paper is to propose a new interactive procedure for such a problem based on trade-off analysis. The procedure is illustrated with project portfolio selection. There are many organizations with moderately large portfolios of projects. Although the problem under discussion is not very large, it is difficult to solve, since projects are not implemented simultaneously. Moreover, the companies must take into account the risk that a particular project, which is planned to start in the future, may not be ready for implementation. We present an interactive trade-off procedure, based on the stochastic approach, as a new proposition to solve such a problem."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051348869","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63cf92114097075010eeaee4","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"311","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"cfa13aa8-66bc-4dab-a8e1-4ea6284851e6"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"311","pagesFromTo":"1155-1181","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10479-020-03907-y.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092db878c28a04739e2cd","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"8E6002642180C7C04C2319B4D7EE438861FAAAD6BD5231B20CA769BC0E934BCE2925C2731676AEF93397A756590AA952FE59B762775ED3600B85722FDF57F5AE","orcidId":"0000-0002-8561-3863","documentHash":"c4fea14b-1dcf-40e3-977d-f5cf8faebcee"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a047394268","name":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Trzaskalik","uuid":"D27133A0A08014FCA23C94886FD85068D50FF146616C380823FBE12AF098C9303E9BC24E7AB11A51663C1217707B3CE691D3DF6B432F05F7A10CC92CF8B74459","orcidId":"0000-0001-5581-0922","documentHash":"49932fda-0ed8-4fa7-a1cd-cb7b75d3142e"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10479-020-03907-y"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["children","physical activity","Covid-19 pandemic"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","uid":"bHvub0W7DW61k4FKLYJQ3Zw","uuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","parentUuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","rootUuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Długosza w Częstochowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70923e878c28a0473925ad"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de69","uid":"b8lEq4e8f8p1V09_nBsO4Ew","uuid":"7b1ecf5e-1c1d-40d0-91a9-cbde801c4409","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de69","parentUuid":"7b1ecf5e-1c1d-40d0-91a9-cbde801c4409","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de69","rootUuid":"7b1ecf5e-1c1d-40d0-91a9-cbde801c4409","name":"Akademia Bialska im.

School has a specific mission in this scope, especially at the first stage of education. Attempting to answer the question of how schools in practice realise these tasks, a study was conducted on the level of physical activity of pupils in classes I–III of primary school, during their participation in compulsory school activities. The study took into account many conditions, in particular, the organisation of school work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Physical activity of the pupils was measured with the use of Actigraphs GT3X+, known also as accelerometers, and the Steps Per Minute Test. The study covered pupils (N = 159) aged 7–9 years, who attended classes I–III of several schools in the region of Eastern Poland. The results of the study indicated that the level of physical activity in most of the examined children was low, which may be a limiting factor in their overall development. Accordingly, the writers suggest that during the coronavirus pandemic teachers urgently need to work out new forms of physical activity for children."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051351687","journalIssue":{"objectId":"639867f6409707085969f96e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"50","number":"6","doi":"","documentHash":"cd396959-6bd4-4ff4-b7b8-abcb02fde611"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"50","pagesFromTo":"764-776","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/FY2DBHFTDW45XQNBXJWR/full?target=10.1080/03004279.2021.1912133","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709270878c28a047395a8a","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Tokarewicz","uuid":"63E5B120B7F160EF401FEE4387A5824057EBB79C30D9206C1492232FA930B0D0045468BFF4C2AE905EDA24BE5027B3F6CF24DBB3C701E275AFF956D52C3F4B59","orcidId":"0000-0002-9312-9721","documentHash":"ad1e0d19-d514-4bf0-9cc1-d67b28ad0bc5"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a0473936ff","name":"Stanisława","lastName":"Nazaruk","uuid":"CFE6B1E56C72BB555F158263B1EBD4422F1F218A6BE49C72C0DF4CA1E6B16BA6A559441CAA45175B41F09335E183466375CEB17152D48E0D3A224082138DC119","orcidId":"0000-0001-5620-3980","documentHash":"604e93a6-6255-4d10-a8e5-a0e4f35f35fb"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a0473936ec","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Marchel","uuid":"B5AFF7051EFC9E7C72F2BA170739B7419C8FCD099DE3AB33F7CE3EA316C46640899B604F0FFB2397F0998A544FE7D9D35C8CA80FF615AE1D40F246D4482F8238","orcidId":"0000-0003-3748-5219","documentHash":"4117125a-1bda-4607-ad9a-e591fa5572be"},{"objectId":"5e70923e878c28a0473925ad","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Kruszewska","uuid":"CD7544F1A0E6A147D5A8966093A333A3BBEE41866CDD113E2D68A76BB42C19799013D5E5EA64B65ABDB95FBE1F644E96433F78C709F3A1513DAAAE55C84EC00C","orcidId":"0000-0001-8755-4476","documentHash":"189d66a5-f39f-4a13-a60c-89b70260ac84"}],"doi":"10.1080/03004279.2021.1912133"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","uid":"b_ZPtKgtv4v90uInHkYp6dg","uuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","parentUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","rootUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Kochanowskiego w Kielcach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f1878c28a0473b3c80"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","uid":"b-COLbcdAG-k5w4OvZzdVBg","uuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","parentUuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","rootUuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","name":"Narodowy Instytut Onkologii im.

In the lymphatic metastasis, cancer cells bearing CXCR4 and ACKR3 (CXCR7) receptors are recruited to the LNs that produce the CXCL12 ligand. Our study aimed to assess the role of the CXCR4/ACKR3/CXCL12 axis in VSCC progression.\nMethods Tumour and LN tissue samples were obtained from 46 patients with VSCC and 51 patients with premalignant vulvar lesions. We assessed CXCR4, ACKR3 and CXCL12 by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the tissue samples. Additionally, CXCL12 levels were determined by ELISA in the sera of 23 patients with premalignant lesions, 37 with VSCC and 16 healthy volunteers.\nResults CXCR4 and ACKR3 proteins were virtually absent in vulvar precancers, while in VSCC samples the IHC staining was strong. In the LNs of patients with VSCC, 98% of metastatic cells expressed CXCR4 and 85% expressed ACKR3. Neither CXCR4 nor ACKR3 presence was correlated with tumour human papilloma virus status. Few CXCL12-positive cells were found in the analysed tissue samples, but serum CXCL12 levels were significantly increased in both patients with premalignant vulvar lesions and with VSCC compared with healthy volunteers.\nConclusions It appears that during progression and lymphatic spread of VSCC, the CXCR4/ACKR3/CXCL12 axis is activated. Moreover, our data suggest that CXCR4 antagonists merit further attention as a possible therapeutic option in patients with VSCC."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051354861","journalIssue":{"objectId":"606c1a1c2467f05a44395912","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"b8ab08a0-d391-4fd7-bdb2-5e3af526b68a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"75","pagesFromTo":"324-332","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://jcp.bmj.com/content/75/5/324.long","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"60dc60d09543c7233654462d","name":"Elwira","lastName":"Bakuła-Zalewska","uuid":"B666E12345FBE104C56BB4E4CA6EC8560A5C2D19A3E888E9DDAA997EE18410B410958999A712B24D8A841D0EFE7737AA9763498D366FBEF91B7C72F5CD224477","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b27d964d-c565-4fdb-8db3-2ca4c51e5321"},{"objectId":"606c1a1c2467f05a4439590f","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Kopczynski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"691c1f47-f7a6-4f29-b0b3-5754a4f9fff3"},{"objectId":"606c1a1c2467f05a4439590a","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Zięba","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8151-9418","documentHash":"22d189c1-287f-4845-9149-cc647a15f37f"},{"objectId":"606c1a1c2467f05a44395909","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Zalewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8063-7113","documentHash":"78fdfebd-6bee-4f82-87cb-123eb9c4685b"},{"objectId":"606c1a1c2467f05a44395908","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Kowalski","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0207-7880","documentHash":"9efa7063-103f-483c-b394-7c679d726fd5"},{"objectId":"5e7094c4878c28a0473c34c5","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Rusetska","uuid":"4D1C95BACEC42DEE48F35B5E66C5E34E61B2C8032AF34F4C41E7F64F74FFB76DDCA75A9DCE7C93E3D43D3471FCA5D2D066F2AB9DB1E9F413FF62076DC6F13815","orcidId":"0000-0001-7496-2489","documentHash":"9566ed74-cbe4-4556-8fdb-87f8038df83a"},{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b78b4","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Goryca","uuid":"0F577CF78C4C8D1D2CFBF765F544303DE1F54CD764C0C81D52F3DDCB80337F776E686E096F98E8EF2C959B0C11068E4751E133788E7BC3B4A9EB7B8A25790169","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b48b38c4-e9e2-40da-b5ec-80992ac6782c"},{"objectId":"5e7093fb878c28a0473b454b","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kowalewska","uuid":"444823D6D39BC2FCAD18A3166EA008AFCF08B214938313B11AC5AD95A7ED90CA530DAC59C5CA2F451E347732A7CB8FCE1D884DEEC12826821C038B0446BE621A","orcidId":"0000-0002-3413-9612","documentHash":"aefa6926-e6c8-4a18-b373-f59e86dab447"},{"objectId":"5e7093fb878c28a0473b454a","name":"Beata","lastName":"Kotowicz","uuid":"7507C69890EADB741613ED8D5FA45446A033DF4E6B10C3158416ADEB4690671CD07913E936CB6D06FC87D0699B8E2AA0185BEA00CE63DB29AE55D7C84A539416","orcidId":"0000-0001-6790-3413","documentHash":"2d005b50-a098-4936-960b-022ab50f4af1"},{"objectId":"5e7093fb878c28a0473b4533","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Fuksiewicz","uuid":"51CE82BA115C7FBB4B9AFEFBF4CC1A03E7381D972645A06CE4D80947DEABA82F6A43AA04A32E50083954930F04CDD40929581BECAD1B254CF0E06EDDEB792016","orcidId":"0000-0001-9625-423X","documentHash":"f29f5aaf-4aa5-4887-b735-6329f7e40ad3"},{"objectId":"5e7093f1878c28a0473b3c80","name":"Artur","lastName":"Kowalik","uuid":"5C860568FAA36F74005417BC4FA79BCA84F3590A9B342E19153C0250D7A77B22B7D6997CC09B7823A1599F5508A4EE789B1964E095375B4E4B4AB2012618E285","orcidId":"0000-0002-3718-999X","documentHash":"09c1f22d-54d0-43ad-b257-35ddbc5d89df"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fa87","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Bidziński","uuid":"0057E002BC39FC54B56E64DFA544A9511252377888941A9AF70B137C4F4C5740A0ECC40C6D37E47296A22376030B6F0238AA53B15F410228969ABDDE7A7E5097","orcidId":"0000-0003-4767-6369","documentHash":"7a820668-1830-4044-8322-1ac598f13e11"}],"doi":"10.1136/jclinpath-2020-206917"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Sport

concept of sport engagement, emerging from the application of major ideas of positive psychology in sport science, has\nbecome a valuable conceptual and practical addition to understanding athlete burnout. The present article reports the major results\nof an attempt to develop a Polish version of the Sport Engagement Scale, a brief metric created to measure athletes’ engagement\nfor both research and practical purposes. Study 1, conducted on a sample of Polish athletes (N = 214) supports the original threefactor structure of engagement comprising the dimensions of Vigor, Dedication, and Absorption. A single-factor model also fit\nthe data well, suggesting that calculating a general engagement factor is also justifiable. The internal consistency of the scale, as\nwell as its associations with athletic burnout, competition anxiety, personality traits, declared sport level, and number of hours\nspent in training, provide evidence for sufficient concurrent criterion validity and the reliability of the scale for both research and\napplied purposes. Study 2, conducted on a sample of athletes taking part in a half marathon run (N = 135), provides evidence for\nthe scale’s predictive criterion validity with respect to objective performance: greater engagement, particularly scores in the Vigor\nsubscale, predicted significantly better running performance. In the discussion, we summarize the present findings, commenting\non their limitations and highlighting future research paths for the phenomenon of sport engagement."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051355024","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e52f942467f0034f088c10","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"69ac8e70-f872-4b5d-8198-3cc8eaffdc31"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"41","pagesFromTo":"911-923","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12144-020-00607-5.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602e470a9543c7410626f009","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Waleriańczyk","uuid":"8E0AA3503EE9FC3197CDB9DF56820A639148F97C31A81C0C08DE9C4820DA3263015312D5E2B1552230266EA608776268F20C373A1E2506BE65E08635FA38CA25","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d88b87c8-006a-4bcb-86d1-99ec4a0da5da"},{"objectId":"602e2a139543c7410626eda5","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Pruszczak","uuid":"3DE6B7D911FFAD303114A078B2C8428B82A5FF74D13B775D2B731002C3A2E1A55AE447D33EAD682BCEEA0A1B92C1772467FFA9D39728D64CD9DBBC1D0CE50CB7","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"370fe0ba-78cb-477f-9bf0-5593ec51bb6f"},{"objectId":"5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b5f","name":"MACIEJ","lastName":"STOLARSKI","uuid":"6EEB4A539F86226E3BF0AA95A09155E8EBD18B25C19F53CC7C2741D43CBE756DE711D18F408150E7869CE0C8D264AD32E221F46A416109E9804C0671B7EC084F","orcidId":"0000-0003-1490-357X","documentHash":"43d1b8af-5e15-437c-a973-de72e217ba43"}],"doi":"10.1007/s12144-020-00607-5"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df20","uid":"bMvn9i-Wb4qNqQKvtk7hgiw","uuid":"c6e84f2a-bbff-4e0b-8fd5-dc507baff821","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział

Three types of AgNPs of similar size distribution, but of diverse surface properties, were synthesized using trisodium citrate, sodium hexametaphosphate and tannic acid. The suspensions and solution of silver nitrate were applied in a hydroponic culture in order to assess their influence on the germination of Triticum aestivum seeds. Studies of the damage of the cell membrane and the activity of antioxidant enzymes were carried out on the shoots and roots of the seedlings. The differences in the plant condition were assessed while analyzing photosystem II. The results showed that the AgNPs stabilized with sodium hexametaphosphate exhibited a higher toxicity toward the tested plants than silver ions with the same concentration. It was found that the AgNPs obtained using tannic acid exerted an adverse effect on the crop plants. The citrate-stabilized AgNPs were the least toxic to the seedlings. The obtained results demonstrated that the surface properties of AgNPs strongly influence the phytotoxicity toward T. aestivum seedlings."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051378111","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6255346f2467f052bca9d7a3","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"10","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"55b99649-b7bc-4ec1-b7c1-e780181127ca"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"48-58","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1680/jsuin.20.00094","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b918c","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kula-Maximenko","uuid":"0F36CBF6B64E8E31346435F928C8327A6E2A023E918BE0A34DA5AAE7E0520438C933CA49CFE3281DB226BC6443FDA266B21D36050EBAA16876FDC30BF0C9F09E","orcidId":"0000-0001-7100-877X","documentHash":"543d94d3-9bda-4e95-9f7b-0290090624e9"},{"objectId":"5e709428878c28a0473b74e4","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Oćwieja","uuid":"EB521AFC93451BE132D2FCCD9E0A0C15C71452A9A369302106EC8BD7B403768BE6F6EC288B3D6912572690F2B2F9C147A84135FF7E74154004F0CD40EF30253F","orcidId":"0000-0002-7976-135X","documentHash":"46d1be30-54af-462c-8ef2-ae8e42439330"},{"objectId":"5e7093da878c28a0473b1eb4","name":"Julia","lastName":"Maciejewska-Prończuk","uuid":"21402C46409DE3DC367CF1E43A327F13C295A4101E1CC8B61D060202D790868394D60F78018F4A4801385D0E61D706BD408423A3EE342B5692BD2BE1947F50A4","orcidId":"0000-0002-4036-6627","documentHash":"8c184960-9933-4dca-831b-f13ec8a8d547"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1a42","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Pociecha","uuid":"D70F602D7BA2034757D00AB234C5CD87F3CC167C36C8042A14F77519010A98CA156CE847E1E61A3B17347D6CF06820494C9717B1796C1D4BE692FFB81D451367","orcidId":"0000-0003-1093-8150","documentHash":"571e7a04-bc32-42c6-9fb6-9c2df8c01847"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1a01","name":"Anna","lastName":"Gorczyca","uuid":"E43E9E4BF7D670799178C9FA473B3CF491B68160FDC1BB8EBE10B1FCEC915C9B370B62B5540C4EA2BF81DDBACCE39D29EE695E0542229BA9B9FB1F6BB75608CE","orcidId":"0000-0002-9431-3870","documentHash":"b6a17d23-73ab-4088-b86d-99cf0ebc4f7e"}],"doi":"10.1680/jsuin.20.00094"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Canadian Gothic","Canadian literature","ghosts","Thomas Chandler Haliburton","heterotopia","history","Nova Scotia","settler colonialism","The Old Judge","time"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d0878c28a0473b137f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Ghosting history/historicizing the ghost: Time passage in T.

C. Haliburton’s \"The Old Judge\" as shaped by the writer’s British North American context as well as his political background and agenda. It pays attention to the manner in which the text prepares the ground for native identity formation by providing a version of Nova Scotia’s recent history that is nonetheless presented as bygone and ancient. In \"The Old Judge\", temporal distance of the past, apart from its richness - both confirmed by the presence of the properly historicized settler ghost - is the condition for cultural distinctiveness, maturity and heritage. Approaching \"The Old Judge\" from the perspective of Cynthia Sugars’ Canadian Gothic and Lorenzo Veracini’s settler colonialism, I argue that the text represents the past of the province as curiously extended in time in the Old World fashion, so that it may encompass the stages of cultural development required to gain the Empire’s recognition. Simultaneously, the text’s intricate play with heterochronies suggests that Haliburton’s Nova Scotia contains heterotopic spaces in Foucauldian terms, where the ordinary time passage is necessarily breached for the colony to attain proper legacy and distinct cultural status."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051381321","journalIssue":{"objectId":"64392ffb4097077a0cca6115","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"58","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"9347eb15-9530-4b00-bedc-8456730170a0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"58","pagesFromTo":"213–228","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0021989420969768","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093d0878c28a0473b137f","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kliś-Brodowska","uuid":"C35F4A24384480D3E57A59CDA793DB08A305C0EB0976C39D2821986D05CD602400B2CE8FE432182C152BB98ADB69E0F786A42873C279DBACE51F2E1C28CF2C3C","orcidId":"0000-0003-1024-1601","documentHash":"a93ad0e1-d687-4555-bc4d-e383c454ba8c"}],"doi":"10.1177/0021989420969768"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["convolutional

This paradigm shift must be accompanied by a strong educational architecture that fosters the skills needed for 21st-century success including creativity and cultural awareness. The present study investigates the primary school architecture of post-socialist Poland, tracing its evolution and asking whether its issues apply universally. A comparative review of representative primary school buildings illustrates that their developmental progress has been superficial, as only external forms have been adjusted. The standard spatial arrangement of the traditional corridor and classroom layout has remained stagnant. This layout is oversimplified, inflexible in design, and works against learner-centred pedagogies that stress diversity and multiplicity. This article highlights the inadequacy of Polish primary school spaces for 21st-century educational needs. The results indicate that this is a universal problem since corridor and classroom layouts are widely applied in all Western countries."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051402625","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6586cc1b4097076c143dd416","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"52","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"b3dcd19c-13da-405e-8563-c2581a029990"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"519-542","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1080/03057925.2020.1777843","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b089b","name":"Cezary","lastName":"Szpytma","uuid":"DA92EC44AE6E0DE138A53855E980E85756F0728D90B48DF34D92A7EA854A0B5FD8E2E327EA8481E3C0996638E64673365700D5A6E2A0E44FB65B0D15A4840F58","orcidId":"0000-0002-9197-8447","documentHash":"af6fd106-4b1a-4044-8072-c49b71ad6176"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d53c","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Szpytma","uuid":"30C4A16E7AEC4528B35D9A0BF1038DEC98CD6B1A543906E8CB7F3A417575F045A522D4D918177413F67A90BC3892C73F8195C916D842C9811A7196AEB171BBD2","orcidId":"0000-0002-3997-4502","documentHash":"80b42ee8-6117-403c-be65-810debb7c44f"}],"doi":"10.1080/03057925.2020.1777843"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["IBD","Lactoferrin","anti-inflammatory","antibacterial","antiviral","immunomodulatory","inflammatory bowel disease","lactoferrin receptor"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Lactoferrin: an overview of its main functions, immunomodulatory and antimicrobial role, and clinical significance","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547782e","mniswId":"4519","title":"Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition","doi":null,"issn":"1040-8398","eissn":"1549-7852","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"47505ed5-6e24-430c-a48d-53e0bbc57553"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"609292d22467f059f3eac8c2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659006604097076c147816c6","659006604097076c147816c7","5e7092b9878c28a04739b7ac","5e7092df878c28a04739e8d3"]},"issue":"22","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Lactoferrin (LF), a glycoprotein found in mucosal secretions, is characterized by a wide range of functions, including immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities.

The aim of this trial was to evaluate whether oral coadministration of an anti-opioid agent, naloxone, can be considered a successful approach to overcome ‘the morphine effect’.\r\nMethods:\r\nConsecutive unstable angina patients receiving ticagrelor and morphine with or without orally administered naloxone underwent assessment of platelet reactivity using Multiplate analyzer as well as evaluation of the pharmacokinetic profile of ticagrelor and its active metabolite, AR-C124910XX, at 9 pre-defined time points within the first 6 hours following oral intake of the ticagrelor loading dose.\r\nResults:\r\nThe trial shows no significant differences regarding the pharmacokinetics of ticagrelor between both study arms throughout the study period. AR-C124910XX plasma concentration was significantly higher 120 min after the ticagrelor loading dose administration (p = 0.0417). However, the evaluation of pharmacodynamics did not show any statistically significant differences between the study arms.\r\nConclusions:\r\nTo conclude, this trial shows that naloxone co-administration in ticagrelor-treated acute coronary syndrome patients on concomitant treatment with morphine shows no definite superiority in terms of ticagrelor pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic

results of studies on poly(propylene imine) (PPI) dendrimers indicate their potential use in the treatment of brain cancer or neurodegenerative diseases due to their ability to cross the blood–brain

However, depending on dose, neurotoxicity may occur. Here, we discuss the impact of maltotriose modified PPI dendrimers on rat’s nervous system. Wistar rats were treated intravenously for 14 consecutive days with densely (dense-shell; DS) and partly (open-shell; OS) modified PPI dendrimers at doses established as safe in the previous experiment following a single DS or OS administration. The examination included an estimation of the motility and the clinical symptoms of the respiratory, nervous, and cardiovascular systems. Both DS and OS glycodendrimers (GDs) induced adverse effects at the doses tested. Multiple administrations of PPI-OS had a detrimental influence on rats’ survival. These findings suggest that the dendrimers adversely influence the nervous system and their toxic effects accumulate over time. In PPI-DS treated animals, the harmful effects were less severe but still present. However, with each treatment day, the clinical symptoms in both groups were less severe as if the animals developed tolerance to GDs. We hypothesize that the neurotoxicity of tested dendrimers is related to nanoparticles-induced autophagy."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051406335","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"45","pagesFromTo":"1484-1492","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01480545.2020.1843472","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"657c0a444097076c14a947dd","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Borowiec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f8bdc188-9a21-4583-aa95-403b91fc45d2"},{"objectId":"657c0a444097076c14a947dc","name":"Dietmar","lastName":"Appelhans","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"58a15457-2765-4554-91de-a59996daf8f7"},{"objectId":"657c0a444097076c14a947db","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Jander","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"188987b1-d56d-4dc0-b880-29fb42d172d6"},{"objectId":"657c0a444097076c14a947da","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Sikorska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"293a02e4-3a11-44b6-8096-f2cfc8e38867"},{"objectId":"657c0a444097076c14a947d8","name":"Ida","lastName":"Franiak-Pietryga","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c91a4ded-4d64-4fff-a958-de4e2c165989"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473affc8","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Ziemba","uuid":"BE2DDFF76C2243B93FF1A7C99814B1E209AA4A4AB0685855E31A8A6B94F27A9E1A62C6F217263819723C4356A494B88887FB30CF7B13AFEBC58FC3E618C181AD","orcidId":"0000-0003-4702-7019","documentHash":"2bdfd37d-a105-4ced-a1d1-f49ac35b01ad"},{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9c59","name":"Maria","lastName":"Bryszewska","uuid":"F11FDA8EA321C932D51757C7C9C1A081944DD76C2D29F02F49063153E0E7341C26D2C7B323BDD03C26F10D9420A2C068C1F962081FEF231CC1E29854666196DC","orcidId":"0000-0003-4676-3743","documentHash":"31910faa-30c8-4af7-b598-3cdf4082bc39"}],"doi":"10.1080/01480545.2020.1843472"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["zaburzenie po stresie traumatycznym","wypalenie","ruminacje","stres związany z pracą","funkcjonariusze policji"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["post-traumatic stress disorder","burnout","ruminations","work-related stress","police officers"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737ddfa","uid":"bJc1ZB8VMKUjmTMp7H8dQUw","uuid":"1845b92b-07f4-40a3-9afb-27235ab69d60","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737ddfa","parentUuid":"1845b92b-07f4-40a3-9afb-27235ab69d60","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737ddfa","rootUuid":"1845b92b-07f4-40a3-9afb-27235ab69d60","name":"Uniwersytet WSB Merito w Toruniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70920f878c28a04738f478"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Ruminations and occupational stress as predictors of post-traumatic stress disorder and burnout among police officers","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478279","mniswId":"9201","title":"International Journal of Occupational Safety and Ergonomics","doi":null,"issn":"1080-3548","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"ff0eaa0f-057a-45ae-80b4-695bf609f74d"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"609906322467f01135284fd0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709289878c28a0473977ed","5e70920f878c28a04738f478"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The profession of policeman is one of the most stressful.

On the one hand, a large amount of C is sequestered in soils, and on the other hand, the forest soils are also a significant source of carbon dioxide (CO2). Soil respiration includes anaerobic and aerobic microbial respiration, and root respiration which may contribute even more that half of the total soil respiration. Assessment of the contribution of forest soils to CO2 emissions, in addition to C sequestration, is worth special attention in the context of increasing climate change. To address this field experiments were carried out to assess the CO2 fluxes of 10 different forest soil types with different tree species (deciduous, coniferous, and mixed) in Poland (using static chamber method). The highest CO2 emissions were observed for a silty soil under the youngest deciduous forest (12 y.) with a  daily average of 1.66 ± 0.7 g CO2 m-2 d-1. The lowest daily mean CO2 flux was associated with a sandy soil in a mature stand of a predominantly coniferous forest (0.87 ± 0.3 g CO2 m-2 d-1). Annual averages were in the range 3.21 t C ha-1 to 6.06 t C ha-1 for a mature and young forest, respectively. The main factor causing differences in CO2 emissions could have been the contribution of both trees and soil properties to hydrological conditions. The young forest was covered with trees with a lower root system forest and the young trees could have a lower demand for water resulting in a higher soil moisture content than in a mature forest soil. Different CO2 fluxes could be also a result of a higher water storage capacity in silty soil in the young forest than that of a sandy soil under mature stand. In addition to water supply, the activity of soil microorganisms is also regulated by C availability which was about 30% lower in sandy soil than in silty soil. The two-yearly measurements showed seasonal variations in CO2 fluxes depending on the soil type, age and tree species. Regardless of the characteristics of the forest being studied, the highest CO2 emissions occurred in the summer or spring and the lowest CO2 emissions were found  in winter as a result of a strong influence of temperature on the biological processes under investigation. The observed seasonality in CO2 emission may be attributed to changes in soil moisture during the measurement periods since soil water content regulates microbial activity and gaseous diffusion. Statistical analyses, however, imply that temperature could have  a stronger control over CO2 emissions from the soils studied than soil moisture."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051409415","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"60951d5c2467f04dcb41cc60","mniswId":null,"startDate":"2021-04-19","endDate":"2021-04-30","fullName":"EGU General Assembly, 19-30.04.2021","shortName":"EGU","city":"Wiedeń","country":"AT","website":"https://www.egu21.eu/","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"9b424cb9-efa3-43de-b060-844383f2978f"},"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"EGU21-2530","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU21/EGU21-2530.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"60951d5c2467f04dcb41cc5e","name":"Bruce","lastName":"Osborne","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e340113c-a371-4f70-80de-e1d73aa35b63"},{"objectId":"60951d5c2467f04dcb41cc5d","name":"Katja","lastName":"Klumpp","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b2d797e5-0385-4fa3-b83d-5545bf03555b"},{"objectId":"60951d5c2467f04dcb41cc5c","name":"Pia","lastName":"Gottschalk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"96835a97-8f32-45bd-87f2-c139594e6a6d"},{"objectId":"60951d5c2467f04dcb41cc5b","name":"Bart","lastName":"Kruijt","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7feb5bdb-cc8a-4f90-b2bc-da76fb8859f1"},{"objectId":"60951d5c2467f04dcb41cc5a","name":"Mohammad Ibrahim","lastName":"Khalil","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a241e7e5-9a16-4873-8dbe-9f1926179679"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8c2d","name":"Anna","lastName":"Walkiewicz","uuid":"D8E185B8DF3B2A91D4B886812869A74C1C4237D40D5AEC6D43261CB29B0A4EB657AA53A845FA63B98137ADD29124511AA01C6C2403C0735ABBAC062F9DEC0930","orcidId":"0000-0003-4194-780X","documentHash":"8d1ad695-94a9-41a3-995a-4289a08a82e6"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8ba5","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bulak","uuid":"F36C311820D634A9A00A1FFCC137D171A6FF2B2BB5CB44A739FD7F15C11F3A9AB08C9EE6D674DF521A9D8EA88B2A25365D4E1C957EAA2C0874FAD6702066E23E","orcidId":"0000-0002-0611-002X","documentHash":"0122bcdf-4db3-4d3c-8e66-19413d268f2c"}],"doi":"10.5194/egusphere-egu21-2530"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709218878c28a04738fdd5","5e709218878c28a04738fd9a","5e709425878c28a0473b7249"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Occurrence of antibiotic resistance among Enterobacterales isolated from raw and ready-to-eat food -

The aim of the study is to extend the classification of dietary supplements (DSs) intended for children above the age of 3, as well as to categorize the ingredients used to manufacture such products. Three hundred fifteen dietary supplements intended for children from 3 to 12 years old, available on the Polish market, were chosen. Evaluation of product specifications provided by the producers, which included lists of ingredients as well as health and nutrition claims found on labels or online, was conducted. Among the available products, one can distinguish supplements with overall health effects used to supplement the diet (such as multivitamin supplements) as well as products for specific conditions, which can be divided into a total of 10 groups of products.

With these interindividual differences and a number of antidepressants to choose from, the first choice of treatment often fails to produce improvement in the patient's condition. A substantial part of the variation in response to antidepressants can be explained by genetic factors. Accordingly, variants related to drug metabolism in two pharmacogenes, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19, have already been translated into guidelines for antidepressant prescriptions. The role of variants in other genes that influence antidepressant responses is not yet understood. Furthermore, rare and individual variants account for a substantial part of genetic differences in antidepressant efficacy. Recent years have brought a tremendous increase in the accessibility of genome sequencing in terms of data availability and its clinical use. In this review, we summarize recent developments and current issues in the personalization of major depressive disorder treatment through pharmacogenomics."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051419719","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6315d19f40970717dcf82f9a","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"179","number":"17","doi":"","documentHash":"a159252e-65ad-4cbd-a05f-a505508b6621"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"179","pagesFromTo":"4220-4232","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.15470","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094d4878c28a0473c4dad","name":"Michał","lastName":"Korostyński","uuid":"878BE706BB72D6315E04142A901E8E7328F042F5C2634452799FE8AFA94428819E5968F2081C997EBCF23814EA7B262C6C5FE13ADFDCE78638A42183B1145422","orcidId":"0000-0002-4273-7401","documentHash":"b6fc782e-4d24-4ba9-8b18-fd2b5e3eab24"},{"objectId":"5e709408878c28a0473b530d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Rodriguez Parkitna","uuid":"DD61A1C5D08038A3921FB0E52AB131BD5A00879B6791D88D76D17CEE18B7862597876D554D7660C3F6273CDDCBBC80EA3217C35B7D2B53C6F93E04706FAFD573","orcidId":"0000-0003-0367-2331","documentHash":"b1819132-4fa5-4c1d-b986-fd0a702f25c1"},{"objectId":"5e7093eb878c28a0473b3517","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Borczyk","uuid":"DEAF2CF67A2A30F6455254138F211C854F8C2181E9E55F401F547D83F06B0B75B134819626BAF893F9172A483D32AAA5676DF7AE168DE3E3F317A8F31879EF13","orcidId":"0000-0002-4304-8384","documentHash":"a3f6a988-1f11-4475-8b66-c40ab9dc2523"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739aa0a","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Piechota","uuid":"CC56DC3AF4CC8175BDDC7375F7710BDBBC2EBE11F5A3A06ADC1B27DFEB28AA227D3747B5F2764D38A9A5D5DEBACB451A94E815CA6471DEA8404791379DCFBDDB","orcidId":"0000-0003-2468-151X","documentHash":"13177948-8f15-47db-90aa-f7965ac2a07d"}],"doi":"10.1111/bph.15470"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","uid":"bhdVW0TkXv39ZSgac65mGnw","uuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","parentUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","rootUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","name":"Uniwersytet Komisji Edukacji Narodowej w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398274","5e70940c878c28a0473b56a7"]},{"id":"5e7091d7878c28a04738c67b","uid":"bOZNeeoLQGqxcbFAPXgr_Og","uuid":"04f6300d-c648-4009-85cf-0f3f50cf83a0","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd74","parentUuid":"336f05cc-b615-4f3c-94b2-65abc7f54264","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd74","rootUuid":"336f05cc-b615-4f3c-94b2-65abc7f54264","name":"Wydział Lekarski i Nauk o Zdrowiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944e878c28a0473ba255"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The revised Edward Zigler Yale-Personality Questionnaire (EZPQ) for persons with intellectual disability: A new four-factor structure in confirmatory factor analysis","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454778c8","mniswId":"4801","title":"Current Psychology","doi":null,"issn":"1046-1310","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d1721390-d129-4e50-95d6-c4cca03c3ae9"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"60c34e2d2467f01f29213ddd","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70940c878c28a0473b56a7","5e709292878c28a047398274","5e70944e878c28a0473ba255"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Zigler’s theory assumes that due to frequent negative personal experiences, persons with intellectual disability are likely to develop specific personality traits which hinder their functioning. The Edward Zigler-Yale Personality Questionnaire (EZPQ) is a measure that allows these traits to be assessed. However, studies in which the measure was used report problems with its factorial structure and reliability. We evaluated the psychometric properties of EZPQ in three consecutive studies conducted in three different samples of 336, 330, and 310 students with mild and moderate intellectual disability. By making successive modifications to the original version of the EZPQ, we developed and validated a revised four-factor version of the questionnaire that consists of 16 items (EZPQ-16R). The factors we identified corresponded to the following traits: readiness to explore, assignment alacrity, negative-reaction tendency, and support dependence. The reliability of the new gauge was high, and its validity was confirmed in correlational analyses with other measures of personality and adjustment. The four traits that were identified are directly derived from Zigler’s theory, thus giving a new perspective on the assessment of specific personality traits in persons with intellectual disability."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051426178","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"41","pagesFromTo":"2772–2785","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12144-020-00797-y.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70944e878c28a0473ba255","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Fusińska-Korpik","uuid":"5A2B9BB1B33320FD4A2B064A32A384D7BA6005864F7D4B8BED9D83803D6989C7AC55F7A427FB6DFB2B702927225C5B276B897AD610762B89A43A4B5D8F11B2E6","orcidId":"0000-0003-3520-1315","documentHash":"1c6fb125-135f-4d14-966f-f56738d406a9"},{"objectId":"5e70940c878c28a0473b56a7","name":"Michał","lastName":"Gacek","uuid":"8DD01019831F5E9CD54BB652847489AC30D89EBEECB6168E3A3D5838B884C9D8FDA7A6ED828DD587F198D3D36922E60B9F06980F3FADF6EE6AB6363F4F39232D","orcidId":"0000-0003-0362-2086","documentHash":"ad94d03b-aceb-44e3-be20-66a7dd4e985a"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398274","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Krzywoszański","uuid":"83964FCF0DB89766A4364D0D2BC54225602703D9171F3D80A8A232B389E27FBFDA9A99EB7FB08F28F843E09EC14D87B6A32E2ACAF3B650DF92AF134F807083F2","orcidId":"0000-0001-9222-2150","documentHash":"462784e5-169a-4920-8adb-86053b346372"}],"doi":"10.1007/s12144-020-00797-y"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["1","2","3-Thiadiazole","Episulfonium ion","Episulfide","Photolysis","Photofragmentation of thiirane","Sulfenyl group","Thia-aza-Payne rearrangement","thiirane","Thiirane ring opening","Thiirane S-oxide","Thiiranium ion","Thiirene","Thiirenium ion"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63c7c7244097076eb3776fdd","doi":null,"title":"Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry IV","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-0-12-818656-5","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/referencework/9780128186565/comprehensive-heterocyclic-chemistry-iv","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"44346e98-0163-42c7-bde9-0fe58b863955","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb7dc","mniswId":"22600","name":"Elsevier","documentHash":"159aa552-a0f4-4616-8a63-8488cd70979f"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"1.05 - Thiiranes and Thiirenes: Monocyclic","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"60c6fbc02467f0330a7985d5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70939e878c28a0473adcbe","5e709325878c28a0473a3a10","5e709352878c28a0473a72fe","6523f6674097070ba46056df"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We attempted to summarize the latest achievements in theoretical and experimental methods used in thiirane chemistry, application of thiiranes and their derivatives in organic synthesis and reactions applied toward thiirane ring formation.

extensive analysis of iron-nitrogen-carbon (Fe–N–C) electrocatalysts synthesis and activity is presented concerning synthesis conditions such as initial Fe content, pyrolysis temperature and atmosphere (inert N2, reducing NH3, oxidizing Cl2 and their sequential combinations) and the influence of an external magnetic field on their performance in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Thermosetting porous polymers doped with FeCl3 were utilized as the Fe–N–C catalysts precursors. The pyrolysis temperature was varied within a 700–900 °C range. The temperature and atmosphere of pyrolysis strongly affect the porosity and composition of the resultant Fe–N–C catalysts, while the initial amount of Fe precursor shows much weaker impact. Pyrolysis under NH3 yields materials similar to those pyrolyzed under an inert atmosphere (N2). In contrast, pyrolysis under Cl2 yields carbon of peculiar character with highly disordered structure and extensive microporosity. The application of a static external magnetic field strongly enhances the ORR process (herein studied in an alkaline environment) and the enhancement correlates with the Fe content in the Fe–N–C catalysts. The Fe–N–C materials containing ferromagnetic iron phase embedded in N-doped microporous carbon constitute attractive catalysts for magnetic field-aided anion exchange membrane fuel cell

Moreover, a new find in Burmese amber locates the temporal boundary of the subfamily back to the mid-Cretaceous (probably ~100 Mya). We describe two new genera assigned to the tribe Pseudochironomini: Mesoacentron gen. nov. with the species Mesoacentron kaluginae sp. nov. (Taimyr amber) and Palaeocentrongen. nov. with the species Palaeocentron krzeminskii sp. nov. (Burmese amber), the oldest known representative of the subfamily.

preparation for a negotiation is considered critical for the achievement of successful relational and substantive results. Careful specification of preferences and determining the negotiation offer scoring systems is one of the most important preparation activities. To facilitate this process, preference elicitation aids have been designed and implemented in decision and negotiation support systems (NSSs). This paper shows that negotiators’ motivation affects the use of simple elicitation aid and elicited preferences. We identify three types of motivations: epistemic, social, identity, and assign the factors that describe them. Then, using the dataset from electronic negotiation experiments, we apply logistic regression to identify those motivations that allow distinguishing negotiators who make errors in the determination of the scoring systems from those who do not make them. The key result allows us to identify relational- and learning-oriented goals of the identity motivation as having a significant and direct impact on the negotiators’ classification. Accommodating and competing approaches of social motivation impact agents' accuracy with the differences observed for gender. Surprisingly, epistemic motivation represented by rationality and experientiality factors does not affect users’ accuracy in the prenegotiation phase.

To fill this gap, we present the results of a longitudinal study on the math anxiety of children that were followed in the first year of elementary school. We tested the level of math anxiety and its prevalence. We also investigated the reasons for math anxiety that were reported by the children at the beginning of elementary education. For this purpose, we adopted both individual-difference and developmental perspectives. The results show that first-grade students experienced mild math anxiety that peaked at the beginning of the school year. Most children experienced a low level of math anxiety; some of them were not anxious at all or experienced moderate anxiety, while only a few children were highly math anxious. The reasons for math anxiety that were most frequently reported by the students were associated with risk of failure, task difficulty, time pressure, and fear of receiving a bad grade. We discuss the obtained results in the context of actions aimed at improving the mathematical achievement of students."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051464576","journalIssue":{"objectId":"663881d24097076e57a4f319","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"24","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"99507a2a-80a0-41bc-89f9-8c236f203db9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"248-266","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10986065.2021.1882363","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709460878c28a0473bbc7c","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Barańska","uuid":"5540D267DCCCF51925BB82073E1524553005309B78226C9339FE31C55AF30304C513D6363E1E0F343855ABADF888783BCB6B2D7E31882852250B877F458096B7","orcidId":"0000-0002-4000-8408","documentHash":"072a952b-6a95-4859-a0a4-5823052876f1"},{"objectId":"5e70932c878c28a0473a4519","name":"Monika","lastName":"Szczygieł","uuid":"CB4A6B2CA9DCAD92454C2826A5BB45D22B0FC1038B374F61EE9BB2F93AEA11370353947E0FF9ACCA096A7333FF5BF32D5F01279EBC39028C3F120F8BC329C130","orcidId":"0000-0001-6544-0734","documentHash":"647bb46b-12a4-476e-a0bb-f9b0d0f65c36"}],"doi":"10.1080/10986065.2021.1882363"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Police robots","crowd control robots","AIethical issues","pandemic","transparency","biased data","LAWS"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","uid":"bLDwoyIU1jG5BHqZ9HzVPQg","uuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","parentUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","rootUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","name":"Wyższa Szkoła Informatyki i Zarządzania z siedzibą w Rzeszowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709413878c28a0473b5d3d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Ethical Issues in Police Robots.

A non-experimental online research project was designed to determine the predictors of the severity of psychopathological symptoms, such as depression and PTSD symptoms, and the nature of the feedback mechanism between them in groups of men, remaining in hospital isolation due to infection and at-home isolation during the COVID-19 epidemic. The presence of symptoms of depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and a sense of threat due to the pandemic were assessed using the following screening tests: IES-R by Weiss and Marmar, PHQ-9 by Spitzer et al., and a self-constructed sliding scale for assessing COVID-19 anxiety. The study was carried out on a group of 57 firefighting cadets, hospitalized in a COVID-19 isolation room (Mage = 23.01), staying in isolation due to SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and a control group of 57 healthy men (Mage = 41.38) staying at home during quarantine and national lockdown. COVID-19 pandemic causes many psychopathological reactions. The predictive models revealed that the predictors of symptoms of PTSD in isolated patients included depression and the experienced sense of COVID-19 threat resulting from the disease, while in the control group the symptoms of depression were the only predictor of PTSD. PTSD experiences are usually associated with depression. It may also be a form of the re-experiencing process or the effect of high affectivity, indirectly confirmed by the participation of hyperarousal in the feedback loop. Our findings highlight the importance of mental health aspects in patients treated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic requires social distancing, quarantine and isolation, which may cause psychopathological symptoms not only in affected people, but also in the general population. Moreover, the need for greater psychological support can be emphasized for both: the sick and the general population."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051482707","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"42","pagesFromTo":"6856-6865","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12144-021-01982-3","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"670f5cebfdbe831eabdf6b99","name":"Wioletta","lastName":"Tuszyńska-Bogucka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"16d5e9f8-f742-470e-bb4b-bc333df0dd35"},{"objectId":"670f5cebfdbe831eabdf6b98","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Kułakowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"65c4ad5e-468d-4650-b6aa-fe62195f2bff"},{"objectId":"670f5cebfdbe831eabdf6b97","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Szymańska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e4b416be-79a1-492a-bc2e-2e5ec2dc4443"},{"objectId":"670f5cebfdbe831eabdf6b96","name":"Agata","lastName":"Mikucka-Wituszyńska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b655eff2-5629-4bc4-9a55-d01c08ae0d8c"},{"objectId":"670f5cebfdbe831eabdf6b95","name":"Klaudia","lastName":"Dopytalska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0a7d3c9b-29fb-4c8c-b3ba-c55a9f787523"},{"objectId":"5ebed5b8752340254fc403c5","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Ciechanowicz","uuid":"744B1086A90FAC36F211273191DCDC3419B3DBA2936C9116C07CDC78370D41503D30AB1C672EF5564C79A54B7CFD98ECF58573ADD2D745D6970F04D78016C176","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b0a0b3ad-2dc4-4895-97f4-2c9442dd16ae"},{"objectId":"5e7094ab878c28a0473c1553","name":"Irena","lastName":"Walecka - Herniczek","uuid":"A84A5C8FE6355BDCBCD3F9D94A97125F6FB7351E2570AA58DE6F2D691BA9A10DED17562E708CAE2FFFC468BD22F597FEB921C555AFB02411BD94F2552F119CE5","orcidId":"0000-0002-3502-3339","documentHash":"5d73e80a-452d-47a8-8c75-43ab2551053a"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a0037","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Bogucki","uuid":"2DC075FF8BA295F1134420F4B011227778B958F27D6EA8AE45196237ADA2E9E15CF5919CD3EF0A0D86D87AAD43A9F84E00AFB936106DEE4307B8B5E1FCCB0972","orcidId":"0000-0002-8683-545X","documentHash":"b8ffd586-8250-498c-8639-4f892a65ee14"},{"objectId":"5e7092c8878c28a04739c7d4","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Kocki","uuid":"DB0C172C3CB2A645035156BCC8E06093B2E496F3F6E606A23DDD4C6758C862C9FFC6A8A7C83DF0C9412B6FB0844E4C67BA5763285F68EE92232D334FF61C8211","orcidId":"0000-0002-9541-6353","documentHash":"1374faf0-ea4f-4fe7-840a-c36c838b59df"}],"doi":"10.1007/s12144-021-01982-3"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Flies","drug resistance","hospitals","public health"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709241878c28a04739289e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Flies as a potential vector of selected alert pathogens in a hospital environment","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e7","mniswId":"8890","title":"International Journal of Environmental Health Research","doi":null,"issn":"0960-3123","eissn":"1369-1619","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"cdd6a34a-74dc-478b-8435-7eeb631b3b31"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"609a38c82467f07d4eaf3210","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["662a3e7f40970762633a6061","662a3e7f40970762633a6062","662a3e7f40970762633a6063","662a3e7f40970762633a6064","5e709241878c28a04739289e","662a3e7f40970762633a6065","662a3e7f40970762633a6066","662a3e7f40970762633a6067"]},"issue":"8","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Multi-drug resistant pathogens are a global problem. Flies are a potential vector of multi-drug resistant pathogens, which can be particularly dangerous in the hospital environment. This study aimed to evaluate flies as vectors of alert pathogens. The research material consisted of 100 flies (Musca domestica (46.0%), Lucilia sericata (28.0%), and Calliphora vicina (26.0%)) collected at the University Hospital No. 1 dr. A. Jurasz in Bydgoszcz (Poland) in 2018–2019 (summer months). The presence of bacteria of the genera: Enterococcus, Staphylococcus, Escherichia, Leclercia, Citrobacter, Hafnia, Providencia, Proteus, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Raoultella, Morganella, Moellerella, Bordetella, Pantoea, Serratia, Plesiomonas, Wohlfahrimonas, and Lelliottia was confirmed. The most frequently isolated species included: Enterococcus faecalis (n = 64), Escherichia coli (n = 43) and Moellerella wisconsensis (n = 24). The infection rate and antibiotic resistance of bacteria were assessed. One strain of Proteus mirabilis (isolated from Calliphora vicina) produced ESBLs (extended-spectrum beta-lactamases). The infection rate was 0.38%, 0.26%, and 0.20% for Musca domestica, Lucilia sericata, and Calliphora vicina, respectively. The flies from a hospital area were not a vector of alert pathogens. Monitoring flies as potential vectors of pathogens is an important aspect of public health, especially for hospitalized patients."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051485343","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"32","pagesFromTo":"1868-1887","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09603123.2021.1919605?needAccess=true","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a3e7f40970762633a6067","name":"Eugenia","lastName":"Gospodarek-Komkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"84783929-ebe6-4462-b3e8-53892af206d9"},{"objectId":"662a3e7f40970762633a6066","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Kraszewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"43b62d78-4c8e-490f-a57c-5aeb890c5823"},{"objectId":"662a3e7f40970762633a6065","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Grudlewska-Buda","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ec2a8a23-d0fc-4534-a5bf-7544d54858c0"},{"objectId":"662a3e7f40970762633a6064","name":"Agata","lastName":"Białucha","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f08a6383-8f5c-4b7b-96ce-121ae36b1414"},{"objectId":"662a3e7f40970762633a6063","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kwiecińska-Piróg","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"464f15fb-0db6-4be5-aa57-a40d9cb3d3fc"},{"objectId":"662a3e7f40970762633a6062","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Skowron","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"017234dc-5274-4011-b07f-d0841aaa809a"},{"objectId":"662a3e7f40970762633a6061","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Wiktorczyk-Kapischke","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7f8f1458-d18b-48e3-947e-22c502d98f47"},{"objectId":"5e709241878c28a04739289e","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Wałecka-Zacharska","uuid":"4C0866A11D63EEF40C5E3EB04923EEBDD951B75128A7A89CB0F7A2687162A5A37D60FC88693E590FE315268A3728DDA5C5F8E26A7EAB66C0E50D08471A6FAC67","orcidId":"0000-0002-1840-9731","documentHash":"fb8be2b0-364d-48d7-a102-576213042863"}],"doi":"10.1080/09603123.2021.1919605"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["lipid oxidation","spice extracts","Arrhenius model","Log-logistic model","Neural network"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6378","5e709346878c28a0473a6297"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Predictive modelling of TBARS changes in the intramuscular lipid fraction of raw ground pork enriched with plant extracts","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454786f8","mniswId":"11149","title":"Journal of Food Science and Technology","doi":null,"issn":"0022-1155","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"9affc1b7-69af-45d1-b9f5-f01adba115a4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-06-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"60db15d02467f02729157131","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709346878c28a0473a6297","5e709347878c28a0473a6378"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the study was to develop and compare the predictive models of lipid oxidation in minced raw pork meat enriched with selected plant extracts (allspice, basil, bay leaf, black seed, cardamom, caraway, cloves, garlic, nutmeg, onion, oregano, rosemary and thyme) by investigation TBARS values changes during storage at different temperatures.

The algorithm allows the analysis of thermogram sequences in both time and image domain. In the first stage of the algorithm operation, mathematical morphology or filtered contrast methods are used to remove the uneven heating from the sample, as well as to segment and detect defects using local and global thresholding methods. In the next stage, it is possible to determine the number of defects as well as automatically estimate their depth and characteristics (insulator/conductor) in relation to the background material (material without defect). The presented algorithm was tested on two material samples, i.e. PMMA and Expanded PVC, for two phases of the thermal process, i.e. heating and cooling. The study found that the best defect detection and characterisation results are obtained when processing thermographic data from the cooling phase in combination with a Top Hat morphological transformation, local thresholding (for defect detection), and relative incremental filtered contrast (for defect size estimation)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051498508","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.19","pagesFromTo":"196-219","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-85095796577&partnerID=MN8TOARS","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e6df","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Gryś","uuid":"ED1AD483F7DF5F40569487448147B4C091B8BE8BF07682B9DCD44D4A35F00FCE72B2B2EB719E2596FC9C7661BB54FB5CB3D3E82A69907EEB7CBE17B29BD7850E","orcidId":"0000-0001-7910-3659","documentHash":"468ac9ec-b765-447f-96b8-175d6f5f1d3c"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e6c4","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Dudzik","uuid":"81C5898D0A2514E85CC00E76CB3B34A4D03EDBCCE20CC5292238345D61597457975543C33B44160DEAA90FA1F4436EFE49667671B1AE0A5D8D3D64D617866A87","orcidId":"0000-0002-9559-7115","documentHash":"d9c78dc5-868c-4db6-8e0a-b86643d65265"}],"doi":"10.1080/17686733.2020.1841443"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["żylne owrzodzenia nóg","gojenie się ran","terapia przerywanym uciskiem pneumatycznym"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"60813cdd2467f0276870e132","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Instytut Fizjoterapii i Nauk o Zdrowiu, Akademia WychowaniaFizycznego im.

Two zones, subdivided further into subzones, are proposed. The zonal boundary interval corresponds to a pronounced latest Campanian turnover within the dinoflagellate cyst assemblages. The chronostratigraphic distribution of particular dinoflagellate cyst events, or groups of events, used to define particular zones/subzones in the Middle Vistula River section is shown to correspond well to those in other regions of Europe – including the Campanian–Maastrichtian boundary stratotype section – and beyond. Apart from dinoflagellate cyst events previously recognized as significant for the definition of the Campanian–Maastrichtian boundary (i.e., the last occurrences of Raetiaedinium evittigratia, R. truncigerum, Samlandia carnarvonensis, and S. mayi), the importance of some other events, such as the last occurrences of Apteodinium deflandrei, Areoligera microreticulata, Callaiosphaeridium asymmetricum, Callaiosphaeridium spp., Coronifera oceanica, Heterosphaeridium bellii, Odontochitina costata, O. dilatata, O. streelii, Xenascus ceratioides, X. gochtii, X. sarjeantii, and Xenascus spp., and the first occurrences of Cladopyxidium saeptum, C. velatum, C. verrrucosum, Glaphyrocysta expansa, Florentinia mayi, Pervosphaeridium tubuloaculeatum, and Riculacysta? pala, is ascertained. This study expands the knowledge of dinoflagellate cyst distribution in the Campanian–Maastrichtian boundary interval, and contributes to a better understanding of the correlations between the Boreal and Tethyan Realms during this timeframe.

The interplay between socio-cultural context and ON has been poorly investigated as well. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were: (1) to investigate the differences in ON and OCD symptoms and (2) to assess the relationship between ON and OCD symptoms among university students. Six hundred and sixty-six university students participated in the present study: 286 from Poland and 320 from Italy. No age, gender and marital status differences were identified between two samples of university students. However, on average, Polish university students had a higher Body Mass Index than Italian ones. Our findings showed that Polish students present more problems related to obsessive symptomatology, core beliefs of OCD, perfectionism traits, and a major ON symptomatology than Italian ones. Also, Polish students with a higher level of ON exhibited higher levels of OCD symptoms and parental expectations/parental criticism. While Italian students with a higher level of ON showed higher levels of perfectionism features (organization and concern over mistakes). In general, correlations were low as confirmation of partial independence ON from OCD symptoms and core beliefs of OCD in both Polish and Italian university students. The present results highlight a need for further investigation of the correlates of ON across different cultural groups. Future research may screen individuals with ON to determine the comorbidity between ON and OCD symptomology to facilitate appropriate treatment choices."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051553539","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"913-927","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40519-021-01228-y","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"639c510b40970723128a9730","name":"Caterina","lastName":"Novara","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5145657d-9c8d-4f61-b14e-ffe19c9173f7"},{"objectId":"639c510b40970723128a972f","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Szymańska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d1528901-9b25-4eaf-b584-8d9c72eefed2"},{"objectId":"639c510b40970723128a972e","name":"Adriana","lastName":"Modrzejewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2c734409-f328-40af-849d-33b8d6d50236"},{"objectId":"639c510b40970723128a972d","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Modrzejewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8ad9b9e0-73fe-474c-8924-9394ad0f2fda"},{"objectId":"639c510b40970723128a972c","name":"Susanna","lastName":"Pardini","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c9c0f1cd-ca99-4456-8d02-14d6b21e24b5"},{"objectId":"5e7092fb878c28a0473a0676","name":"Anna","lastName":"Brytek-Matera","uuid":"37344D3F4B6D7BB37697031380DDD603D430F3AA630374015013992CECC3F697A55D93115C9AB00C847DE364FC924D501AEE0414E982C22E40D85741B65993CB","orcidId":"0000-0001-5178-371X","documentHash":"3580af62-a311-417c-b465-4328c38f189d"},{"objectId":"5e7092d8878c28a04739dfa6","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Czepczor-Bernat","uuid":"F1B1203F3AFB53F60CA49C0292B7338995F7E1C1E83E1270B207F83A56B683AEEA4B9BF7DA387C2D01C578C266FF634D1346940622A869E8DC62258987DEE241","orcidId":"0000-0002-1707-0000","documentHash":"49426362-c988-4d91-903e-cbbad2eb164c"}],"doi":"10.1007/s40519-021-01228-y"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Biodiversity","Deep-seabed mining","Environmental assessment","Metabarcoding","Taxonomy"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Scientific and budgetary tradeoffs between morphological and molecular methods for deep‐sea biodiversity assessment","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c28514547810a","mniswId":"8422","title":"Integrated environmental assessment and management","doi":null,"issn":"1551-3777","eissn":"1551-3793","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"1f6e9802-8e5a-4cc5-96fc-40b369542fee"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"60bf89262467f0444bf26cfd","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60bf89262467f0444bf26cfe","60bf89262467f0444bf26cff","60bf89262467f0444bf26d00","60bf89262467f0444bf26d01","60bf89262467f0444bf26d02","5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e4d"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Deep-sea biodiversity, a source of critical ecological functions and ecosystem services, is increasingly subject to the threat of disturbance from existing practices (e.g., fishing, waste disposal, oil and gas extraction) as well as emerging industries such as deep-seabed mining. Current scientific tools may not be adequate for monitoring and assessing subsequent changes to biodiversity. In this paper, we evaluate the scientific and budgetary trade-offs associated with morphology-based taxonomy and metabarcoding approaches to biodiversity surveys in the context of nascent deep-seabed mining for polymetallic nodules in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, the area of most intense interest. For the dominant taxa of benthic meiofauna, we discuss the types of information produced by these methods and use cost-effectiveness analysis to compare their abilities to yield biological and ecological data for use in environmental assessment and management. On the basis of our evaluation, morphology-based taxonomy is less cost-effective than metabarcoding but offers scientific advantages, such as the generation of density, biomass, and size structure data. Approaches that combine the two methods during the environmental assessment phase of commercial activities may facilitate future biodiversity monitoring and assessment for deep-seabed mining and for other activities in remote deep-sea habitats, for which taxonomic data and expertise are

main objects of the paper are z-oriented triangulations of connected closed 2-dimensional surfaces. A z-orientation of a map is a minimal collection of zigzags which double covers the set of edges. We have two possibilities for an edge – zigzags from the z-orientation pass through this edge in different directions (type I) or in the same direction (type II). Then there are two types of faces in a triangulation: the first type is when two edges of the face are of type I and one edge is of type II and the second type is when all edges of the face are of type II. We investigate z-oriented triangulations with all faces of the first type (in the general case, any z-oriented triangulation can be shredded to a z-oriented triangulation of such type). A zigzag is homogeneous if it contains precisely two edges of type I after any edge of type II. We give a topological characterization of the homogeneity of zigzags; in particular, we describe a one-to-one correspondence between z-oriented triangulations with homogeneous zigzags and closed 2-cell embeddings of directed Eulerian graphs in surfaces.

objective of the paper was to compare values of the muzzle brake efficiency coefficient for a rifle with active or inactive automatics systems. Special laboratory stand designed for investigating the recoil process was used. The motion of the rifle was detected by the use of the laser interferometer and the optical camera. The recoil velocity time courses were determined by smoothing and differentiation of experimental position records. The results of the experiments indicated that in the case of an active automatics system two values of the recoil velocity can be used for calculation of the energetic efficiency coefficient: the maximum recoil velocity and the final recoil velocity at the end of the automatics action cycle. The values of the coefficient, calculated using these two values of the recoil velocity, distinctly differ. However, it was shown that their values indicate the same relation between the efficiency of various muzzle brakes. The value of the efficiency coefficient, determined on the basis of the final recoil velocity value, is practically the same as that determined on the basis of the final recoil velocity value for the rifle with an inactive automatics system."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051604830","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"1741-1747","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214914721001082","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebee51d752340254fc44871","name":"Damian","lastName":"Szupieńko","uuid":"8718AE6D4CD7AEAA5171384924FD65B781D74B978919AB845F2AF36BDACF95D5F0A292EBF7274FE9DC3201ED76451ABA068BD6FF81143DF356ADBA3B31F47643","orcidId":"0000-0003-0202-9213","documentHash":"1192c3be-5983-4210-94e0-556f0ebc7336"},{"objectId":"5e70949c878c28a0473c054c","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Goździk","uuid":"300E1F222E60D5F0E55BFDC3FD89898FED07F237C09B67FB2ABC5D485E9E38DFBB18D5EAB41A2731F5190768E61182D08F643A3D059769C2AFE8C826C7442342","orcidId":"0000-0003-3190-5745","documentHash":"50e8889f-5bb9-478b-a34c-03e9d92253f3"},{"objectId":"5e7092a4878c28a047399c7b","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Kijewski","uuid":"35C6E33F88F5840EB9F8C899DF9EB3E633183AB9A6E47113D94DB5327A22FE4A01F320EF11176D2D0D87F9E20F72D95B9B27F1AD77A8A90D64BDE8BE29AFD1BF","orcidId":"0000-0002-5779-0854","documentHash":"04f3b975-cb28-4d1c-afe8-af21e10370f4"},{"objectId":"5e7092a4878c28a047399c69","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Trębiński","uuid":"D020913170E1350E6E87307A178AB99EFFF8112B4C1A0D7FD201D8628B682EB23F69913453BE50CA6C36ACDFA2C43543416E42D75C47AF37F8A3077D0CC20664","orcidId":"0000-0002-4659-2318","documentHash":"0a62664a-8fcd-4e83-bef3-27977da040d7"},{"objectId":"5e7092a4878c28a047399c46","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Leciejewski","uuid":"C0F43E0FDE2BFE043B14E53C0FFFB3C3B6DA3DF2ACFBB18BD80BCB572FD9164AF6A8334CFB40F08B01CC512DDA2AC072A0F67EA825995714CB4F83FFD60F375C","orcidId":"0000-0003-3283-8820","documentHash":"f479db13-e5f3-4ee2-afc1-55ab1f64b3db"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.dt.2021.06.003"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bounded model checking","satisfiability modulo theories","security protocols","timed automata","verification"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709240878c28a0473926b9"]},{"id":"61d4fc737523401fc110c7ad","uid":"bU3jwPsjA7FS1p1x1_FN-lQ","uuid":"fcb2deee-3392-4307-84a7-751cc66be6e6","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","parentUuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","rootUuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","name":"Instytut Informatyki ","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709200878c28a04738e781"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Practical Approach in Verification of Security Systems Using Satisfiability Modulo Theories","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d15","mniswId":"13742","title":"Logic Journal of the IGPL","doi":null,"issn":"1367-0751","eissn":"1368-9894","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"54a1e5f1-78ed-42b2-9bbd-92a2b1a2dd2e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"60ccb16c2467f05c1b21476c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709240878c28a0473926b9","5e7093de878c28a0473b22ea","5e709200878c28a04738e781"]},"issue":"Iss.2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper presents a novel method for the verification of security protocols’ (SPs)time properties. The new method uses a translation to satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) problem. In our approach, we model protocol users’ behaviours using networks of synchronized timed automata. Suitably specified correctness properties are defined as a reachability property of some chosen states in an automata network. Then, the network of timed automata and the property are translated to an SMT problem and checked using an SMT-solver and a BMC algorithm. We consider the most important time properties of protocol executions using specially constructed time conditions. The new method was also implemented and experimentally evaluated for six well-known SPs. We also compared our new SMT-based technique with the corresponding SAT-based approach."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051611089","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6489862040970732284821f9","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"30","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"542ac560-6be4-473c-b759-474d3856ccb8"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.30","pagesFromTo":"289-300","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/jigpal/article/30/2/289/5943717","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093de878c28a0473b22ea","name":"Sabina","lastName":"Szymoniak","uuid":"9C4F724DA49B9CEF055B5B7E545A7EA6D56E773D5C792FBF4C588500AECAC83BF871B66FB3EDA3C54691EB30AF9EE81D8DBD4E14FBCEB926FAA48E77C081CD33","orcidId":"0000-0003-1148-5691","documentHash":"d27c8246-690c-492c-8888-799a5f45f904"},{"objectId":"5e709240878c28a0473926b9","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Zbrzezny","uuid":"BA294E244280D90AF77BFF5EF77D3BA0961B9FF3253E48F647A629E4CFB5AEBA01B951CEC69BC3C35A490FE07EB125984D73614BE00C983E1FF90315AC9A5E0A","orcidId":"0000-0001-9897-3561","documentHash":"e223d0fd-4d48-456a-a336-fd23a10e9147"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e781","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Kurkowski","uuid":"C557FE317CF3F8D5607126EC0EA45312A59BA1E3379D8A704E0442E2AA6CDA52D3BDCC6CD7833B71C1D33FEE2F757222319402FC417D88AF620753C3A53F7053","orcidId":"0000-0003-0900-3243","documentHash":"6c134101-e630-4fe2-9b80-8ac54e4ee6fa"}],"doi":"10.1093/jigpal/jzaa062"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df20","uid":"bMvn9i-Wb4qNqQKvtk7hgiw","uuid":"c6e84f2a-bbff-4e0b-8fd5-dc507baff821","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział

What is important is difference, the untranslatability of knowledge and languages, the contextual grounding of thinking and action, as well as the experience of the fragility of what is “locally human,” which makes us observe closely a local human being, attached to a place, wandering about with the notion of home, and thus dispelling his or her doubts here and now, even when they tend to recur eternally."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051628273","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62d51fcc4097074b28a7bca6","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"76","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"be60717a-edbc-4857-8a99-ba3e0107f18f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"76","pagesFromTo":"671-682","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hequ.12339","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70925e878c28a047394887","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Kunce","uuid":"AB7FCA95DF635D43909529A4D25FBAE2A41637DEB3092B5E44D8A0965950E08534E00465CE3910269EBD20AA63C714415C1F24D5D8091DFFEAF6BC4B1DEA4C13","orcidId":"0000-0002-2512-6852","documentHash":"a519cfbf-96f5-4a29-82a0-6497537b43a5"}],"doi":"10.1111/hequ.12339"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["squamous cell carcinoma","oral cavity","B7 antigens"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The B7 family molecules in oral squamous cell carcinoma: a systematic review.

of mental disorders from textual input is an emerging field for applied machine and deep learning methods. Here, we explore the limits of automated detection of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia (SCZ). We compared the performance of: (1) dedicated diagnostic tools that involve collecting textual data, (2) automated methods applied to the data gathered by these tools, and (3) psychiatrists. Our article tests the effectiveness of several baseline approaches, such as bag of words and dictionary-based vectors, followed by a machine learning model. We employed two more refined Sentic text representations using affective features and concept-level analysis on texts. Further, we applied selected state-of-the-art deep learning methods for text representation and inference, as well as experimented with transfer and zero-shot learning. Finally, we also explored few-shot methods dedicated to low data size scenarios, which is a typical problem for the clinical setting. The best breed of automated methods outperformed human raters (psychiatrists). Cross-dataset approaches turned out to be useful (only from SCZ to ASD) despite different data types. The few-shot learning methods revealed promising results on the SCZ dataset. However, more effort is needed to explore the approaches to efficiently training models, given the very limited amounts of labeled clinical data. Psychiatry is one of the few medical fields in which the diagnosis of most disorders is based on the subjective assessment of a psychiatrist. Therefore, the introduction of objective tools supporting diagnostics seems to be pivotal.

We claim that both groups perceive intergenerational learning with the use of ICT as a chance to get to know the other group despite the age and cultural differences. Through the use of ICT tools in intergenerational learning, digital tools can help those who lack a good command of language when communication problems occur.

The study aimed to evaluate changes in the microflora in patients treated with L sericata larvae due to leg ulcers and diabetic foot. One hundred twenty-nine patients diagnosed with lower limb ulceration and diabetic foot were enrolled in the study, of which 80 of them met the eligibility criteria for maggot debridement therapy (MDT). On the contrary, 49 unqualified patients were offered ozone therapy (22 with leg ulcers; 27 with diabetic foot). In each of these patients, a microbiological swab was performed before and after the start of therapy. The group of 80 patients was further divided into four equal groups in terms of the treated area (lower leg vs foot) and the number of larvae/cm2 (5 vs 10). Twenty-three particular species of bacteria in the infected wound were studied microbiologically in terms of presence/absence within the wound environment before and after treatment of patients with diabetic foot and lower limb ulceration. It was noted that there was a more intensive bacterial accumulation in the feet of patients compared to legs; furthermore, this applies to almost all analysed species. Diabetes status is also a clinical factor that generates a lower chance of bacterial appearance in the wound environment. Densification of MDT larvae per wound area unit also reduced the chance of the presence of Corynebacterium species, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus MSSA, and Streptococcus coagulase negativa; however, it increased the likelihood of occurrence for Proteus mirabilis and the Proteus species. A microbiological analysis in this non-reference study shows the efficacy of larval therapy for leg and foot ulcers.

To assess the possibility of using the varieties of industrial hemp for this goal, and their adaptation to the habitat conditions and the agricultural technology appropriate for them, we investigated three monoecious varieties of hemp (‘Futura 75,’ ‘KC Dora’ and ‘Tygra’) at different sowing densities (60 germinating seeds·1 m2 or 180 germinating seeds·1 m2) and nitrogen fertilization levels (0, 30, 60, 90 kg·ha−1). In none of the tested hemp varieties registered as fibrous did the concentration of Δ9-THC exceed 0.2%, satisfying the requirements of European legislation for industrial hemp varieties. The tested varieties did not differ significantly in the cannabidiol (CBD) and Δ9- tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9 -THC) content in the dry matter of inflorescences. Agronomic factors such as sowing density or nitrogen fertilization did not modify the content of CBD and Δ9-THC. This result is very helpful for farmers, because it allows them to select hemp varieties of dual-purpose production (stems and inflorescences or stems and seeds) adapted to the South-East Baltic environment."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051640579","journalIssue":{"objectId":"639af13e4097074c71d3c08c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"19","number":"13","doi":"","documentHash":"d1d4c41a-5aa2-473a-a02e-cd822fd2aca2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"6119-6133","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15440478.2021.1904482","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"60e2e5212467f022ff4a7cd2","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Poniatowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"13790c86-97d7-4a0d-840a-793e624c2571"},{"objectId":"5e7094a3878c28a0473c0cb8","name":"Milena","lastName":"Szalata","uuid":"CC530017C9CBB6A5E619A96F3F82886BA1D2BEFFBC0705EC4243D9B1A595288FEDDA9210152D611DD8EB2794C266D34E3F98E634EA11AE5B87E59B4A2D42E7BB","orcidId":"0000-0003-1500-8251","documentHash":"4e064599-ccca-472d-bb34-906bc21dd3d0"},{"objectId":"5e70949d878c28a0473c07a8","name":"KAROLINA","lastName":"WIELGUS","uuid":"F5E2580AE28D82AD650CE218839218D983BFA49CDF99C1713925B9A94A59605ACDA2E08BCE4B091A644987E06D1BFB3BB3BBB193B53C769236424549E78A5447","orcidId":"0000-0003-0629-2991","documentHash":"87708e1d-00eb-4d4e-b02b-83de8d17b324"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a63ba","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Panasiewicz","uuid":"7263EB7FF13E408F04AB2A06ECEE9882D6EE1D71A74634D64B83FF7B956012B83FE118C0A45D783CEA159C7F9C42E752E38794A6BB8491E60EBC54E19A59D52E","orcidId":"0000-0001-6447-9557","documentHash":"cfd18df3-b64f-4f3b-aeba-441d1b3277ab"},{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a04739919a","name":"Bogusława","lastName":"Jaśkiewicz","uuid":"48CC466DCFF6196CBF5BBAAB88BA635E75FC59BE00FF3CDC91FBEABCAA8C6A46D7E8682C0F510904417EC4C89102F3F2263FAEB86C0EEFB4F6389D877CD84D48","orcidId":"0000-0002-2861-5248","documentHash":"12d7e008-8b0a-48ac-97ad-41d7097c47ea"}],"doi":"10.1080/15440478.2021.1904482"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Arsenicals","Amorphization","Ab-initio quantum-chemical modeling","Molecular cluster","Nanomilling"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a6878c28a0473c101b"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","uid":"bHvub0W7DW61k4FKLYJQ3Zw","uuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","parentUuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","rootUuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Długosza w Częstochowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70923e878c28a047392570","5e709240878c28a047392670"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Cluster Modeling of Network-Forming Amorphization Pathways in AsxS100−x Arsenicals (50 ≤ x ≤ 57) Diven by Nanomilling","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478582","mniswId":"10542","title":"Journal of Cluster Science","doi":null,"issn":"1040-7278","eissn":"1572-8862","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"4a3225bc-3c08-4340-9999-8194fc1d96c6"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-05-08","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"60d457e12467f029736c5ed5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709240878c28a047392670","5e70923e878c28a047392570","5e7094a6878c28a0473c101b","60d457e12467f029736c5ed6","5e709223878c28a047390730","60d457e12467f029736c5ed7"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Complete hierarchy of network amorphization scenarios initiated in AsxS100-x nanoarsenicals within As4S4-As4S3 cut-Sect. (50 ≤ x ≤ 57) is reconstructed employing materials-computational approach based on ab-initio quantum-chemical modeling code (CINCA). Under nanostructurization due to high-energy mechanical milling, the inter-crystalline transformations to nanoscopic β-As4S4 phase accompanied by appearance of covalent-network amorphous matrix are activated. General amorphization trend under nanomilling obeys tending from molecular cage-like structures to optimally-constrained covalent-bonded networks compositionally invariant with parent arsenical. The contribution of amorphization paths in nanoarsenicals is defined by their chemistry with higher molecular-to-network barriers proper to As4S3-rich alloys. The generated amorphous phase is intrinsically decomposed, possessing double-Tg relaxation due to stoichiometric (x = 40) and non-stoichiometric (x > 40) sub-networks, which are built of AsS3/2 pyramids and As-rich arrangement keeping (i) two separated As-As bonds derived from realgar-type molecules, (ii) two neighboring As-As bonds derived from pararealgar-type molecules or (iii) three neighboring As-As bonds in triangle-like geometry derived from dimorphite-type molecules.

The aim of this study was to assess the serum concentrations of essential 18-carbon PUFAs and their long-chain derivatives in patients with SLE and healthy controls, and to analyse their associations with laboratory and clinical features of the disease.\r\n\r\nMethod: n-6 and n-3 PUFA composition was assessed in the sera of 30 SLE patients and 20 healthy controls using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We investigated the associations between PUFAs and disease activity measured with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Activity Index (SLEDAI) scores, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, complement C3 and C4 concentrations, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) titre, anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody concentration, and medications.\r\n\r\nResults: Serum linoleic acid (LA) and α-linolenic acid concentrations were significantly higher in SLE patients compared with healthy controls. LA concentration correlated positively with the ANA titre and corticosteroid doses; eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid correlated inversely with anti-dsDNA antibody concentration. Patients treated with immunosuppressants had significantly lower concentrations of LA, arachidonic acid, and EPA.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Both n-6 and n-3 PUFA precursors can participate in the inflammatory process in SLE patients. The mechanism of the PUFA metabolism disturbance needs further exploration.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747051651511","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"51","pagesFromTo":"230-236","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03009742.2021.1923183","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630c6bb4097076263e7acdc","name":"A.","lastName":"Czajkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c608881f-8673-4aac-b7a3-8a42ac0837cb"},{"objectId":"6630c6bb4097076263e7acdb","name":"M.","lastName":"Paściak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6f3dd391-47b3-4aaa-8168-7793094175dc"},{"objectId":"6630c6bb4097076263e7acda","name":"B.","lastName":"Szponar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0eea8b8a-85e3-473e-a5b3-191ef08efd41"},{"objectId":"5e709306878c28a0473a15ad","name":"Daiva","lastName":"Gorczyca","uuid":"A468EFA99718ECFF7B8939A74289ACCCFC32F42C4B78C3A01BA29A321ACD2F55033632506094FF89150EE6FE691A8C145396E1E39C8E65266F93E5B2496045CC","orcidId":"0000-0002-5044-5513","documentHash":"608ebaf6-cf9d-4f7f-8755-205ba3be8ae6"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a13c8","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Szmyrka","uuid":"1E0F68DACC240C83C18F5ED0B0F625013AD14117C6F3E18A0340F4BB0FD9E7E51D29EB3ECF7EDC399179A8FC1FAEFB560D8D870E5DD48C467DD9F8C4F6FDF33F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6885-6153","documentHash":"cda018f9-980e-4e66-acda-bea02bb0c005"}],"doi":"10.1080/03009742.2021.1923183"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dffd","uid":"b-XUkNqiveGAHdRs2LLuM5g","uuid":"d20019dd-29e1-4d01-95b4-17ce35d6e028","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","parentUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","rootUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","name":"Wydział Transportu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927e878c28a047396afb","60d9cdfe2467f02327cfce0f"]},{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e176","uid":"bu_pEE67a1BU39yobRpbYjQ","uuid":"813f25f1-a4eb-4a11-9146-4dcbb3861634","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wydział Elektroniki (Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna im.Jarosława Dąbrowskiego)","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a2878c28a047399b06"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df08","uid":"bkIJHJpQNKsrvtM8Wh9DD9w","uuid":"62b1bfdd-fc86-44b6-8f44-098cdc87f941","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df08","parentUuid":"62b1bfdd-fc86-44b6-8f44-098cdc87f941","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df08","rootUuid":"62b1bfdd-fc86-44b6-8f44-098cdc87f941","name":"Akademia Pożarnicza","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebeda2e752340254fc4176c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The analysis of the operational process of a complex fire alarm system used in transport facilities","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477487","mniswId":"2893","title":"Building Simulation","doi":null,"issn":"1996-3599","eissn":"1996-8744","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"3ee42fe2-3da8-419b-a151-46ca667c738c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-05-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"60d9cdfe2467f02327cfce0b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60d9cdfe2467f02327cfce0f","5e7092a2878c28a047399b06","5ebeda2e752340254fc4176c","5e70927e878c28a047396afb"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A fire alarm system (FAS) is a system comprising signalling-alarm devices, which automatically detect and transmit information about fire, but also receivers of fire alarms and receivers for damage signals.

For this purpose, concentration of dissolved heavy metals (lead, cadmium and nickel) was determined in water of watercourses on which the designed reservoirs will be constructed and also in sediments and water flowing into six reservoirs that are already in use. Based on the results of the heavy metal concentrations of six exploited reservoirs, a relationship was developed between heavy metal concentration in the sediment as a function of the concentration of these metals in the inflowing water. Using these relationships, the forecast concentrations of these metals in the sediments of the designed reservoirs were estimated. The mean concentrations of these metals in the planned reservoirs were 20.5 mg. kg-1 for lead, 3.4 mg. kg-1 for cadmium and 14.8 mg. kg-1 for nickel. No dangerous pollution of analyzed metal of water inflows to the planned reservoirs was found. The calculated geoaccumulation index indicates that in terms of the lead and nickel concentrations, sediments in the planned reservoirs will be unpolluted to moderately polluted, while for cadmium concentrations - they will be moderately to strongly polluted."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051657529","journalIssue":{"objectId":"60d05da32467f033c57c4ab4","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":"27","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"1ebef26a-ad0c-4924-9acd-8554812b7b04"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://eeer.org/upload/eer-2020-660.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709309878c28a0473a1874","name":"Bogusław","lastName":"Michalec","uuid":"34AEA87773CC787085A7455B4730BFC31787B66C5E8E5C7B19881CE07A00EDD6AABF7725A08870293ED6A28B0E7D8D83D2646CACBC884CC99C5A3D569F69AF15","orcidId":"0000-0002-0402-3416","documentHash":"a3b7190c-7153-46c5-9ed5-77d07288d321"},{"objectId":"5e709307878c28a0473a184e","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Cupak","uuid":"14F87FFF1A4DE866FA16CE34367CEC703A6AE3685173BDD4B2051849A9AC2C4229DF57031E2077FFB39B07F791693652379460CA047A8E55751E40759F922429","orcidId":"0000-0002-7756-4360","documentHash":"f9a1dc2d-68fc-4422-b52c-d996bf5feda7"}],"doi":"10.4491/eer.2020.660"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["intergeneracyjny","transfer wiedzy","mobilność geograficzna","mobilność wirtualna","model koncepcyjny"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["knowledge transfer","geographic mobility","virtual mobility","conceptual model","intergenerational"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df65","uid":"bYRtGzh9xym5GV9-ekXsSdA","uuid":"b213d6cd-40ee-48c3-a97a-bc79941abd65","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de19","parentUuid":"5011bcd5-dfb1-41ed-84b0-5bd51ce0832c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de19","rootUuid":"5011bcd5-dfb1-41ed-84b0-5bd51ce0832c","name":"Wydział Ekonomiczno-Socjologiczny","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c1878c28a0473c3331","5e709368878c28a0473a8dc0"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Intergenerational Knowledge Transfer through Geographic and Virtual Mobility in the Higher Education Context","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c8be","mniswId":"11515","title":"Journal of Intergenerational Relationships","doi":null,"issn":"1535-0770","eissn":"1535-0932","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"42bdefd6-ab4d-4012-b821-d0a76abce922"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"60d2f9a52467f02b4f1898d4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709368878c28a0473a8dc0","5e7094c1878c28a0473c3331"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Promoting intergenerational knowledge transfer (IKT) among scientists is an essential aspect of universities’ operations because it is a condition for the continuity of cultural values and scientific development.

Data from dozens of various lakes distributed at a larger distance are necessary to understand their spatial distribution and sensitivity to biotic and abiotic factors. Thus, the objective of this study was to analyze the diversity and distribution of cyanophages within the infected cells using marker genes (psbA, nblA, and g91) in 21 Polish and Lithuanian lakes. Physicochemical factors that might be related to them were also analyzed. The results demonstrated that genetic markers representing cyanophages were observed in most lakes studied. The frequently detected gene was psbA with 88% of cyanophage-positive samples, while nblA and g91 were found in approximately 50% of lakes. The DNA sequence analyses for each gene demonstrated low variability between them, although the psbA sequences branched within the larger cluster of marine Synechoccocuss counterparts. The principal component analysis allowed to identify significant variation between the lakes that presented high and low cyanobacterial biomass. The lakes with high cyanobacterial biomass were further separated by country and the different diversity of cyanobacteria species, particularly Planktothrix agardhii, was dominant in the Polish lakes and Planktolyngbya limnetica in the Lithuanian lakes. The total phosphorous and the presence of cyanophage genes psbA and nblA were the most important factors that allowed differentiation for the Polish lakes, while the pH and the genes g91 and nblA for the Lithuanian lakes.</p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747051671781","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"83","pagesFromTo":"284–295 ","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6405b60f409707703558153a","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Mankiewicz‐boczek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7e635d74-c683-4f2a-a926-8908cd9568a9"},{"objectId":"6405b60f4097077035581539","name":"Arnoldo Font","lastName":"Nájera","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"11fc3736-6863-4dcd-ae5e-00e28c9b2556"},{"objectId":"6405b60f4097077035581538","name":"Judita","lastName":"Koreivienė","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"71f865cd-3960-49bf-b61a-17682180b50a"},{"objectId":"6405b60f4097077035581537","name":"Sigitas","lastName":"Šulčius","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f759f253-6412-4abe-b42e-2353e749d62d"},{"objectId":"6405b60f4097077035581536","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Jaskulska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2501eabf-5944-4a04-9567-73b167bc67e3"},{"objectId":"5e709349878c28a0473a6814","name":"Mikołaj","lastName":"Kokociński","uuid":"7A3A1564390EE7BF40A930D4335DE46F033CD064884EA3A46FD489E3AA112694518550A8EB4CB7654A7BEF127B6DCF4DF9B34D327C07F437E622DEF0298FA096","orcidId":"0000-0002-0552-9769","documentHash":"a96bedc8-cbbf-45f0-afe0-bde5c474c4f7"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00248-021-01783-y"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["antidepressant-like substances","LPS","growth factors","Klotho","Testis"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","parentUuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","rootUuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

It is postulated that antidepressants may harm male fertility, but the cellular mechanism is still poorly understood. The role of growth factors and klotho protein in maintaining normal male reproductive function is well documented. Hence, the study aimed to investigate the effect of the antidepressant drug – imipramine (tricyclic AD), and other substances with antidepressant potential (ALS), administered in combination or in combination with LPS (an animal model of depression) on gene expression and protein synthesis of IGF-2 (insulin-like growth factor 2), TGF-β1 (transforming growth factor β1), NGF (nerve growth factor), KGF (keratinocyte growth factor) and protein synthesis of VEGF-A (vascular endothelial growth factor A), IGF-IR (insulin-like growth factor receptor 1), EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and klotho in the testis of mice. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with selected ALS and LPS or 10% DMSO (controls) (n = 7/group) once a day for 14 days. Animals were decapitated and testes collected for RNA and protein purification. PCR and western blot methods were employed for the evaluation of growth factors and klotho expression. The results obtained indicated a decreased level of most of the analyzed genes and proteins, except KGF; its expression increased after treatment with MTEP and IMI administrated individually and after NS-398, and IMI in combination with LPS. Our results may suggest that the tested ALS and LPS can contribute to a reduction of male fertility, but NS-398, IMI, and IMI+NS-398 may also act as stimulants after LPS."}],"lastRefresh":"1747051708370","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6273aa7340970720005ad3c5","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"38","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"3f6a1228-fa77-4e22-902d-18e494bcb014"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"38","pagesFromTo":"175-186","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s43188-021-00098-x.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"632470d54097076a532e3bb7","name":"Anna","lastName":"Tąbecka-Łończyńska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9dc1770d-b7da-44a7-a5fc-e87ace42281b"},{"objectId":"60e3e7c32467f0319463faba","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Jasiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"856e4628-cdbc-4431-b38a-f8e63360adfa"},{"objectId":"60e3e7c32467f0319463fab9","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Grzegorczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ef589a18-a86b-4f60-9f05-7b92b2b8aab8"},{"objectId":"60e3e7c32467f0319463fab8","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Sujkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dcbc0bd6-fec1-4c7e-aea7-616860424146"},{"objectId":"60e3e7c32467f0319463fab7","name":"Jennifer","lastName":"Mytych","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a1221f6b-6de0-4b94-ba89-18329b349832"},{"objectId":"5e7094d5878c28a0473c4e84","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Stachowicz","uuid":"AA377B03932472F79B47E9234102A2497066B481E6AA1165F35BF778F490A44E45502B2FD9F2439572C8EECA57CEECBB25042DBD669FCC1DDF988549EDF347F5","orcidId":"0000-0003-4330-7128","documentHash":"e0b7377b-caef-47f9-ab86-b5471cd0ae71"},{"objectId":"5e7093a1878c28a0473ae1ad","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Sołek","uuid":"3B369747BA6B95CEA79EC5CB34E9F221C102D0A041AF2C4593ACD8706637E34CE60B76FCB9CD1C7809C16CE9901F390D79954992F57692FBAAD0C5B3C1BA37F7","orcidId":"0000-0002-6194-0042","documentHash":"c1ea791f-1ba1-46ce-aa4d-e37be0fead0b"},{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fbde","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Sowa-Kućma","uuid":"3E51826DEF75C70FA2F790978F229EED09B3FEC3DFF2806AE08B26DADFD3EE8CF54B878D7FBDBCE2F471E9ACFE654FE9129728483C3C18F01DBF89F039249447","orcidId":"0000-0001-5956-7229","documentHash":"a402e674-bbd1-46b4-a05c-bf6396d9a6b3"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fa40","name":"Marek","lastName":"Koziorowski

Autor prezentuje ewolucję tej polityki, począwszy od nieefektywnego i destrukcyjnego etatyzmu, wprowadzającego górnictwo węgla kamiennego na tym obszarze w stan długoletniej stagnacji, aż po okres dynamicznego rozwoju po wdrożeniu „złotych ceł” i nastaniu ery protekcyjno-prohibicyjnej. Momentem przełomowym była wojna krymska, z której Rosja wyszła upokorzona. Zmusiło to Aleksandra II do wprowadzenia w państwie przeobrażeń kapitalistycznych. Gospodarka rosyjska została otwarta na przepływy kapitałowe, towarowe, wymianę handlową, procesy integracyjne i znalazła się w obrębie wpływów globalizacyjnych. Sankt-Petersburg rozwijał jednak w Rosji kapitalizm dynastii Romanowów, nie zaś opierający się na prawidłach rynkowych. Dążył do budowy ośrodka przemysłu ciężkiego z pełnym cyklem produkcyjnym, który miał być ekonomiczną podstawą polityki imperialnej, dlatego uprzywilejował węgiel i koks z okręgu donieckiego kosztem Zagłębia Dąbrowskiego.\r\nAutor książki dowodzi, że górnictwo węgla kamiennego z Zagłębia Dąbrowskiego, pomimo niekorzystnej polityki gospodarczej Sankt-Petersburga, rozwijało się prężnie.

Intensive breeding work resulted in the registration of a new oilseed hemp variety with high seed yield called Henola. Hemp of this variety is characterized by a vegetation period shorter by about a month, almost twice shorter technical length of plants and significantly larger inflorescences than fibrous hemp of the standard variety (Białobrzeskie).\n\nThis work analyzes the efficiency of the second-generation bioethanol production process derived from the processing of waste biomass remaining after deseeding the panicles of the Henola variety. The research material consisted of biomass samples obtained from three variants of the fertilization experiment carried out at the IWNiRZ Experimental Farm in Stary Sielec in temperate climate conditions. In order to find out about the properties of the raw material, the chemical composition of hemp straw was tested and the bioethanol yield per 1 ha of crops was determined.\n\nHenola oilseed hemp straw yield was the lowest (10.6 Mg∙ha−1) in the case of the control and the highest (11.3 Mg∙ha−1) with the use of complex phosphorus, potassium and nitrogen fertilization. The average content of cellulose in the analyzed samples was 35.5%, holocellulose 68%, and hemicellulose 32%. The amount of lignin, in turn, was independent of the type of fertilization. The lowest bioethanol content, in the amount 7.11 g∙L−1, was found in case of hemp fertilized with nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, and the highest content amounting to 9.93 g∙L−1 – for hemp fertilized with phosphorus and potassium, for which the ethanol yield, converted into straw yield was 2.7 m3∙ha−1.\n\nThe conducted research covers both the identification of pro-environmental solutions in the economy for the management of waste biomass and the implementation of the RED II Directive on the promotion of energy from renewable sources."}],"lastRefresh":"1747055667715","journalIssue":{"objectId":"639af13e4097074c71d3c08c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"19","number":"13","doi":"","documentHash":"d1d4c41a-5aa2-473a-a02e-cd822fd2aca2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"7283-7295","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/15440478.2021.1944439","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094cd878c28a0473c3fa3","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Burczyk","uuid":"98F09521D01690654709AD725AC1E4F5F9A1068487EA177517E6EFFA82721005AEB8290BDD600F13C26BC93694CDAA38982E74A20CD155998B0C602451993B0E","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3f666491-56e0-4a46-bd9a-3edc120d2d38"},{"objectId":"5e7094a3878c28a0473c0cbc","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Wawro","uuid":"66990FF866042761A2BA1D17B32BD193CB96FAC52CAB9312BEDED7835FABB0FC47E534A0BD713411AA8D112F0952A1AB066FDAF026E01005252DB631C6E048A5","orcidId":"0000-0003-3773-0982","documentHash":"3ff98a3a-a61a-4e00-9af3-42637a07484b"},{"objectId":"5e7093b3878c28a0473af699","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Batog","uuid":"7543AD436B73D92D068310F874AFD1A9854C3B981B7D8B0AE6E0893283427F44E6E81F4CD17BE27A496E01CB08DA8CFCC9AC32C5F17F57BC9466BB266852BBC6","orcidId":"0000-0001-6113-2160","documentHash":"8f53b360-2bbb-45a7-b81c-b8bbc0b1a789"},{"objectId":"5e7092cd878c28a04739d1d2","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Frankowski","uuid":"4BE246876D83EE034F0B2CB4521FA3068A508FF7B17C5A66BCC1037C411C4B3F3EFF2D9864EEA2A8B1E4511586502AAF490B77FCD0E005FBECF5AAF3EEBDE520","orcidId":"0000-0003-1657-9283","documentHash":"178a7602-e97a-4e84-b346-792fa0327fa9"}],"doi":"10.1080/15440478.2021.1944439"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Hordeum vulgare","HorTILLUS","Leaf angle","Tiller number","Biomass"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ec878c28a04739f44d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Identification of novel plant architecture mutants in barley","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775af","mniswId":"3431","title":"CEREAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS","doi":null,"issn":"0133-3720","eissn":"1788-9170","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"a23410b9-d697-4cda-a888-9451c22db8aa"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"MAY","releaseDateYear":2021,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"60ec14c32467f00a18db7d1c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60ec14c32467f00a18db7d1d","60ec14c32467f00a18db7d1e","60ec14c32467f00a18db7d1f","60ec14c32467f00a18db7d20","5e7092ec878c28a04739f44d"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In grasses, biomass and grain production are affected by plant architecture traits such as tiller number, leaf size and orientation. Thus, knowledge regarding their genetic basis is a prerequisite for developing new improved varieties. Mutant screens represent a powerful approach to identify genetic factors underpinning these traits: the HorTILLUS population, obtained by mutagenesis of spring two-row cultivar Sebastian, is a valuable resource for this purpose in barley. In this study, 20 mutant families from the HorTILLUS population were selected and evaluated for tiller number, leaf angle and a range of other plant architecture and agronomic traits using an unreplicated field design with Sebastian as a check cultivar. Principal Component Analysis revealed strong relationships among number of tillers, upper canopy leaf angle, biomass and yield-related traits. Comparison to the Sebastian background revealed that most mutants significantly differed from the wild-type for multiple traits, including two mutants with more erect leaves and four mutants with increased tiller number in at least one phenological stage. Heatmap clustering identified two main groups: the first containing the two erect mutants and the second containing Sebastian and the high-tillering mutants. Among the high-tillering mutants, two showed significantly higher biomass and grain yield per plant compared to Sebastian. The selected mutants represent promising materials for the identification of genetic factors controlling tillering and leaf angle in barley."}],"lastRefresh":"1747055673296","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"50","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42976-021-00178-6.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"60ec14c32467f00a18db7d20","name":"Salar","lastName":"Shaaf","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0992-8273","documentHash":"5056010d-d887-4d7c-a1fb-fd84fd06431d"},{"objectId":"60ec14c32467f00a18db7d1f","name":"Laura","lastName":"Rossini","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6509-9177","documentHash":"9ed940c5-5cd7-4a2c-98eb-e5fa8e7d36f9"},{"objectId":"60ec14c32467f00a18db7d1e","name":"Babak","lastName":"Abdollahi Mandoulakani","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3825-2759","documentHash":"11cd2d81-a442-4a74-a0c0-69bc4ac28b44"},{"objectId":"60ec14c32467f00a18db7d1d","name":"Sina","lastName":"Mohammadi Aghdam","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8128-2809","documentHash":"6b574877-fa03-4a0d-b046-838e2e230e6c"},{"objectId":"5e7092ec878c28a04739f44d","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Janiak","uuid":"84B8201AAD98DE0BF37007C0AE1B93586598105EA6BA4DF4AA007E2029361357B184FE90B13AA45BF6E940793D46887C89E5F57D4A713FEED462A6C4079B53A3","orcidId":"0000-0003-0225-7216","documentHash":"ff40471d-cc79-4f41-971e-1a16f04d40e9"}],"doi":"10.1007/s42976-021-00178-6"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["korporacje transnarodowe","globalizacja","aktorzy niepaństwowi","rynki międzynarodowe"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6407051d40970735349a6ef5","doi":null,"title":"Globalizacja i współzależność","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-7614-549-5","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://slownikispoleczne.ignatianum.edu.pl/pliki/globalizacja.pdf","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"94f0988a-7773-42be-8e36-f0d5c776d8ff","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb774","mniswId":"10900","name":"Akademia Ignatianum w Krakowie","documentHash":"86e8e2a9-9890-472e-b598-0912d192645f"},"openAccess":{"mode":"PUBLISHER_WEBSITE","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_ND","releaseDate":"2023-02-27","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":2}},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709195878c28a04737f49e","uid":"bXY_DMagKuf8Wt0-tVB5Guw","uuid":"f39171b5-f192-4064-bc1b-c5c84006a634","parentId":"5e709195878c28a04737f49e","parentUuid":"f39171b5-f192-4064-bc1b-c5c84006a634","rootId":"5e709195878c28a04737f49e","rootUuid":"f39171b5-f192-4064-bc1b-c5c84006a634","name":"Uniwersytet Ignatianum w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70932a878c28a0473a4241"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Korporacje transnarodowe","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"60e731262467f01e931618ac","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70932a878c28a0473a4241"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;DEFINICJA POJĘCIA: Korporacje transnarodowe ze względu na swoją charakterystykę często określane są mianem głównych kreatorów i beneficjentów globalizacji.

We use a life-cycle model with a rich asset structure as well as nominal and real rigidities, calibrated to the euro area using both macroeconomic aggregates and microeconomic evidence from the Household Finance and Consumption Survey. Life-cycle considerations allow to demonstrate the key role of maturing assets (in contrast to balance sheet holdings) for properly assessing the redistributive effects of monetary policy. The redistribution is mainly driven by nominal assets and labor income, less by real financial assets and housing. Overall, we find that a typical monetary policy easing redistributes welfare from older to younger generations, and decreases net worth inequality associated with life-cycle motives."}],"lastRefresh":"1747055708998","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/jeea/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jeea/jvab032/6316113","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"672e0db7fdbe83034991aaa6","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Bielecki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d4e85968-146d-42ed-b4ae-12b4a08f3133"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047395117","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Kolasa","uuid":"D17EC9E2E0ED267EA134C757FF6B651DF4967DD9515DF977EF4EB28FB1029B26E591592A421C1DAB9EADEE04A5E318C5F5C9A4A38246DFC9872283FA3E0340B5","orcidId":"0000-0003-4252-4622","documentHash":"56ed0ecc-f3f0-4224-b3db-1638a71a52b8"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a0473950ed","name":"Michał","lastName":"Brzoza-Brzezina","uuid":"0E992EC74CC42E9159BDF23C481338BE5EB1C4FF66F049DC88275489D7542013A407A5CC3EBBA613EB23784B9442DA62B936FB9EF662A916479A29193A45A234","orcidId":"0000-0001-9885-7069","documentHash":"57109597-24c2-4f53-8c31-c114e5c25b42"}],"doi":"10.1093/jeea/jvab032"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Antioxidant activity","coffeeinfusions/beverages","milkcomponents","bioactivebioavailability","chemicalinteractions","chlorogenic acids"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Addition of milk to coffee beverages; the effect on functional, nutritional, and sensorial properties","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547782e","mniswId":"4519","title":"Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition","doi":null,"issn":"1040-8398","eissn":"1549-7852","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"47505ed5-6e24-430c-a48d-53e0bbc57553"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"60ef4c782467f04c36e9648f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923b878c28a04739220b","648e05c940970775642821ce","648e05c940970775642821cf","648e05c940970775642821d0","648e05c940970775642821d1","648e05c940970775642821d2","648e05c940970775642821d3","648e05c940970775642821d4","648e05c940970775642821d5","648e05c940970775642821d6","648e05c940970775642821d7"]},"issue":"22","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"To date, there exists a debate on the effect of milk added to coffee infusions/beverages concerning the nutritional quality of coffee and the functional properties of its phenolic compounds. Yet, the full nutritional quality and functional properties of a coffee beverage without a significant negative impact on its sensorial profile are highly desired by the consumers. Negative/masking, positive, and neutral effects of milk on the antioxidant activity and bioavailability of coffee phenolics (particularly, chlorogenic acids) have been reported. Some potential factors including the type and amount of milk added, type of coffee beverage, the composition of both milk (protein and fat) and coffee (phenolic compounds), preparation method, assays used to measure antioxidant properties, and sampling size may account for the various reported findings. Interactions between phenolic compounds in coffee and milk proteins could account as the main responsible aspect for the reported masking/negative impact of milk on the antioxidant activity and bioaccessibility/bioavailability of coffee bioactives. However, considering the interactions between milk components and coffee phenolics, which result in the loss of their functionality, the role of milk fat globules and the milk fat globule membrane can also be crucial, but this has not been addressed in the literature so far."}],"lastRefresh":"1747055709226","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"62","pagesFromTo":"6132-6152","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10408398.2021.1897516","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"648e05c940970775642821d7","name":"S.M.","lastName":"Jafari","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8f1496f0-520b-4702-8767-fb1322660b2c"},{"objectId":"648e05c940970775642821d6","name":"S.","lastName":"Akbari-Alavijeh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b271e4ee-53ef-4103-8599-4ed251cd0a0a"},{"objectId":"648e05c940970775642821d5","name":"R.","lastName":"Shaddel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fcf824a6-b0ad-47fd-8ba8-36a35d5b5d08"},{"objectId":"648e05c940970775642821d4","name":"F.","lastName":"Garavand","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a6cb0543-df6e-4a27-8c11-9c061d9b6fd2"},{"objectId":"648e05c940970775642821d3","name":"S.","lastName":"Khoshnoudi-Nia","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d3023955-d5ca-47ed-a596-c33846b974a4"},{"objectId":"648e05c940970775642821d2","name":"S.","lastName":"Boostani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8d128aa6-b006-445f-99af-1a17dc020d19"},{"objectId":"648e05c940970775642821d1","name":"E.","lastName":"Capanoglu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a629af12-b57f-40a0-9ea0-42341ee1117d"},{"objectId":"648e05c940970775642821d0","name":"A.","lastName":"Rezaei","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"882113de-545a-44c4-aba5-a2f5b2062184"},{"objectId":"648e05c940970775642821cf","name":"O.","lastName":"Tarhan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3a8f4159-151a-42ee-9508-2661efefa1a7"},{"objectId":"648e05c940970775642821ce","name":"A.","lastName":"Rashidinejad","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"283e90c4-9d9a-4361-93df-44e1c204cdd1"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a04739220b","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Samborska","uuid":"C3B5F56182A037954A7B9B6AEFDAA5E01A153D6E72E7D02F5E4BEDC0558423628C86580DA217A06826366BF2D3DF2E724EDBCDA2C9DDCD7885F876B94E657329","orcidId":"0000-0002-1221-7261","documentHash":"6435cd57-62d5-4369-bd79-e344c0fd0444"}],"doi":"10.1080/10408398.2021.1897516"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["emergency","distance education","COVID-19","forced e-learning","online"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dca8","uid":"bi_Fnqu0gwQqqbxWSHeDHOg","uuid":"8f4f45a9-5c93-4073-8e0a-fcb2b63cb997","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dca8","parentUuid":"8f4f45a9-5c93-4073-8e0a-fcb2b63cb997","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dca8","rootUuid":"8f4f45a9-5c93-4073-8e0a-fcb2b63cb997","name":"Społeczna Akademia Nauk z siedzibą w Łodzi","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70932a878c28a0473a419a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"E-learning? : never again! : on the unintended consequences of COVID-19 forced e-learning on academic teacher motivational job characteristics","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d54878c28514547ad68","mniswId":"7573","title":"Higher Education Quarterly","doi":null,"issn":"0951-5224","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"646efd6b-93e6-4417-be4e-66d3aee84cfd"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2021-05-05","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"60effc8d2467f02be3f709de","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70932a878c28a0473a419a","5e709281878c28a047396e73","5e70928b878c28a04739797c"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W czasie pandemii COVID‐19 uniwersytety na całym świecie pracują w \"trybie awaryjnym\" - radykalnie zmieniając dotychczasowy sposób prowadzenia zajęć dydaktycznych, przechodząc na edukację online i e‐learning.
