The effectiveness of each step of the synthesis was confirmed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD) and fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) techniques. The Fe3O4@SiO2-cyclen nanoparticles were employed for Cd2+, Pb2+ and Cu2+ ions elimination from individual and mixed solutions by carrying out titration with a suspension of nanocomposites. The binding level for all ions both in the individual solutions and in the mixture was very similar at high levels. For Cd2+ and Cu2+ ions sorption efficiency level was from 83% to 89%, while for Pb2+ ions it was slightly lower at the level over 73%. In all cases, the equilibrium adsorption capacity parameter was over 1 mg/g and reached definitely higher values for individual ions solutions.

The TNTs were obtained by anodization and were modified by photodeposition with 0.25 mol% of Au, Pt or Pd.\nResults showed that solar photocatalysis led to higher degradation than UVA radiation, and under UVA radiation, the use of 3 Pt-TNTs (3 TNTs plates modified with Pt) and 3 Pd-TNTs present the same effect as the use of 5 and 7 pristine-TNTs plates, respectively. The best parabens removal was achieved for Pd-TNTs under UVA radiation and pristine TNTs under solar radiation, with 43% and 81% removal in 120 min, respectively.\nAll the catalytic and photocatalytic ozonation experiments led to less ozone consumption than single ozonation (transferred ozone dose (TOD) = 5.27 mgO3/L) with total parabens abatement. Catalytic ozonation experiments suggest that the presence of metals can promote the formation of oxidative radicals, with the Au-TNTs presenting best performance (TOD ≈ 3.59 mgO3/L) while pristine TNTs led to TOD = 4.98 mgO3/L. For photocatalytic ozonation, the pristine TNTs led to the lowest ozone consumption (TOD = 3.74 mgO3/L).\nMoreover, the use of hydroxyl radical scavenger showed that hydroxyl radical is formed during single and photocatalytic ozonation mechanism, which should be related to the natural and surface catalytic ozone decomposition."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219632","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"326","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d825fdbe831a38c313b7","name":"João","lastName":"Gomes","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3becf6a7-1d1d-4c41-9a00-2346a6c9e6a1"},{"objectId":"6777d825fdbe831a38c313b6","name":"Rui C.","lastName":"Martins","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2d3dc0d2-6cf8-45e5-b539-0144f6489107"},{"objectId":"6777d825fdbe831a38c313b5","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Klimczuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fe9628f8-b678-407a-b166-03fbbaf46ccc"},{"objectId":"6777d825fdbe831a38c313b4","name":"Eva","lastName":"Domingues","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"216fb0bb-cc45-419a-b029-5b31c5e27826"},{"objectId":"6777d825fdbe831a38c313b3","name":"João","lastName":"Lincho","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3e82b45c-6e9e-46b9-bade-18223b24171d"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bda","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Miodyńska","uuid":"EA844FA4EE04FEE606AD0F0DD6A30974146CE0BCD98967FCB1FCF7BD0C44FB3003CFD2C14DB4590DDF74E4EB3D55F3639A9AA934E9026CB2883ABB99FE2E3714","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"18b3a057-330e-431e-b6b7-3be8be4ec391"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac1ad","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Mazierski","uuid":"A09D3289B3EBAAB858589FE7FCAEC79094A621B893156BB9EC699995BBDDCB7EBB90B01E7344D3F3FF8FF125A2D612AC988F25F8F5EA94186B8051B00684CAA6","orcidId":"0000-0002-8674-0151","documentHash":"b42e86b1-4768-416f-a0cf-bee63e7faaa6"},{"objectId":"5e70925e878c28a04739474c","name":"Adriana","lastName":"Zaleska-Medynska","uuid":"FCC1A188E4F2AF56B568174FA189B741DCD83D0C831507B0115F615AEA31FC25C15AC5D683567B55D8E2D6F3A8CB9FDCE763EDABC58888F77D798CBE56855EAD","orcidId":"0000-0003-3817-296X","documentHash":"6dbe2d0a-b017-47cf-9762-4a9dd31b42d8"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.seppur.2023.124747"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["allergen immunotherapy","allergic rhinoconjunctivitis","allergen exposure chamber","allergic rhinitis","environmental chamber","allergen challenge"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Assessing the efficacy of allergen immunotherapy and other anti-allergic treatments requires precise and reproducible methods. Allergen exposure chambers (AECs) have emerged as advanced tools for evaluating clinical outcomes, offering controlled conditions that address many limitations of traditional field-based studies. This review explores the advantages of AECs in allergy management, emphasizing their role in providing standardized allergen exposure for both clinical research and routine assessments. AECs deliver consistent and reproducible data comparable to the nasal allergen challenge and natural allergen exposure, making them a valuable addition to the diagnosis and treatment effectiveness of allergic diseases. Although they are well suited to early-stage clinical trials, further standardization and validation are needed to gain broader acceptance in pivotal phase III studies. Future research should focus on refining AEC protocols and integrating them into regulatory frameworks, ensuring their role in the advancement of therapeutic approaches for allergic diseases."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219637","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"art.7268 [14 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/13/23/7268","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093f4878c28a0473b3e9e","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Zemelka-Wiącek","uuid":"D589DBBEB8EA5F8357E4120873367161389F2FA0797A4011A82FEFA2E7557BE9BF55D6DB316370C4DB080FC7367A9ACFF0CD159A870C49D6F72252007E2C8BBA","orcidId":"0000-0001-7201-8638","documentHash":"eace1d56-6b02-4feb-b131-45969fe8439c"}],"doi":"10.3390/jcm13237268"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924f878c28a04739382c","5e7092de878c28a04739e69a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The effect of saturation on hyperfine and Zeeman spectra in laser absorption spectroscopy","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478a19","mniswId":"12469","title":"Journal of Quantitative Spectroscopy and Radiative Transfer","doi":null,"issn":"0022-4073","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"c4e522c1-d2d5-4428-ad54-d53fa5ce7351"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"657981794097076c149b76bf","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092de878c28a04739e69a","5e70924f878c28a04739382c"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Using laser absorption spectroscopy, i.e. techniques such as optogalvanic spectroscopy or laser-induced fluorescence, it is often possible to separate and register individual components of a hyperfine or Zeeman structure. If these components are well separated (i.e. the distances between them are greater than their FWHM), it is relatively easy to determine their frequency position. However, when the atomic structure is very rich and the individual components overlap, problems arise with the correct determination of the position of the respective intensity peaks. Usually, only the envelope curve can be fitted to the observed structure, hence assumptions about the relative intensity ratios of the overlapping components as well as assumption about the line profile of a single component are necessary. An additional problem is the saturation effect. The saturation effect changes the theoretically predicted relative intensity ratios between the line components. In the current work, we present a method of analyzing experimentally observed hyperfine structure (hfs) patterns without and with an external magnetic field (Zeeman-hfs), which considers the saturation effect and allows for a relatively precise determination of the position of the individual components. In addition, we point out that, because of the saturation effect, hyperfine structure measurements should be carried out in conditions where the polarization of the exciting light (relative to magnetic stray fields) is known and this fact should be reflected in computer simulations which adjust a model function based on theoretical predictions to the experimental spectrum."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219643","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"293","pagesFromTo":"1-7","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jqsrt.2022.108384","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092de878c28a04739e69a","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Sobolewski","uuid":"1AF43D71A0EEE91EE99C398B1549BE2B3514D99A90CE2D9C21C3411D253FEB7F663007A24D0EE4557EEA8AA030380922FDF3E748FF614C3207DDC7A3CF7B514E","orcidId":"0000-0002-8498-0370","documentHash":"95167088-d8e5-4e4c-b422-46332a486ca6"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a04739382c","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Kwela","uuid":"5FEE184E4CAE2E6F7AB12469E9772C94BB178979A409206C39C10A58069EBDC9012B73424598660BBA86F7478AE9D101603551289D60D9500D8032B9EA11DBF4","orcidId":"0000-0002-3334-602X","documentHash":"b1249a71-7aac-4e7e-a0c3-62d0c151d262"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jqsrt.2022.108384"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["information science","quantum information science","quantum channels","quantum circuit"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924f878c28a047393843","602ca1119543c7410626e105","5e70924f878c28a047393867","5e709429878c28a0473b76e1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Optimal universal quantum circuits for unitary complex conjugation","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478000","mniswId":"7987","title":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":null,"issn":"0018-9448","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"7db237e3-5601-4c8c-8243-92d3ed9bad30"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65801c854097076c1496e9bd","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924f878c28a047393867","5e70924f878c28a047393843","602ca1119543c7410626e105","5e709429878c28a0473b76e1","6777c3d5fdbe831a38c2630d","6777c3d5fdbe831a38c2630e"]},"issue":"8","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Let Ud be a unitary operator representing an arbitrary d-dimensional unitary quantum operation.

Optimality is shown for average fidelity, robustness to noise, and other standard figures of merit. This extends previous works which considered the scenario of a single call ( k=1) of the operation Ud, and the special case of k=d-1 calls. We then show that our results encompass optimal transformations from k calls of Ud to f(Ud) for any arbitrary homomorphism f from the group of d-dimensional unitary operators to itself, since complex conjugation is the only non-trivial automorphism on the group of unitary operators.

which is mainly sustained by Aspergillus fumigatus, includes a broad spectrum of diseases. They are usually severe in patients with co-morbidities. The first-line therapy includes triazoles, for which an increasing incidence of drug resistance has been lately described. As a consequence of this, the need for new and alternative antifungal molecules is absolutely necessary. As peptides represent promising antimicrobial molecules, two lipopeptides (C14-NleRR-NH2, C14-WRR-NH2) were tested to assess the antifungal activity against azole-resistant A. fumigatus. Antifungal activity was evaluated by determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), time–kill curves, XTT assay, optical microscopy, and checkerboard combination with isavuconazole. Both lipopeptides showed antifungal activity, with MICs ranging from 8 mg/L to 16 mg/L, and a dose-dependent effect was confirmed by both time–kill curves and XTT assays. Microscopy showed that hyphae growth was hampered at concentrations equal to or higher than MICs. The rising antifungal resistance highlights the usefulness of novel compounds to treat severe fungal infections. Although further studies assessing the activity of lipopeptides are necessary, these molecules could be effective antifungal alternatives that overcome the current resistances."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219659","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"8","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/jof8080872","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d8b1fdbe831a38c3276e","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Barchiesi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f27d32d7-f128-4dee-b52a-6751d3d86cee"},{"objectId":"6777d8b1fdbe831a38c3276d","name":"Gianluca","lastName":"Morroni","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b5a05e14-ec37-4100-af42-db0b0a6f9107"},{"objectId":"6777d8b1fdbe831a38c3276c","name":"Lucia","lastName":"Brescini","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1eead774-0652-4357-a72b-8060a282a73b"},{"objectId":"6777d8b1fdbe831a38c3276b","name":"Benedetta","lastName":"Canovari","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b8d696df-0c3c-4d74-b0a7-b22ce32b70b8"},{"objectId":"6777d8b1fdbe831a38c3276a","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Kamysz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6a2f3f8b-a600-49d0-83e7-d187a0d03915"},{"objectId":"6777d8b1fdbe831a38c32769","name":"Damian","lastName":"Neubauer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e4784422-afe5-469a-ba02-0726969c8dbf"},{"objectId":"6777d8b1fdbe831a38c32768","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Pallotta","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1bed2d8f-3d10-4125-88ae-0d01418efb6b"},{"objectId":"6777d8b1fdbe831a38c32767","name":"Bianca","lastName":"Candelaresi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c3731708-cdda-468b-b6dc-d4640ccedd81"},{"objectId":"6777d8b1fdbe831a38c32766","name":"Lucia","lastName":"Franca","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d152636e-3ae0-48c1-a01d-d3feac3ea1c3"},{"objectId":"6777d8b1fdbe831a38c32765","name":"Oriana","lastName":"Simonetti","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4da014f4-3e0f-4d4a-8a99-68b61d6f10e7"},{"objectId":"6777d8b1fdbe831a38c32764","name":"Oscar","lastName":"Cirioni","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c978d40b-4210-42b6-9612-33aeb85582bb"},{"objectId":"6777d8b1fdbe831a38c32763","name":"Simona","lastName":"Fioriti","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"27e354c8-7a67-49e4-b1c4-de95b96ce1bd"},{"objectId":"5e7092b3878c28a04739aede","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Kamysz","uuid":"0939C3BA9EEEBCB8A602E22DA38A490A8B7CBBE5C4F1778C06A77D018401EFEDE86BBAB6180C077046131D72ADE8F84704CC95528BF5FE16E69F85F06F96DE56","orcidId":"0000-0002-9741-4562","documentHash":"f03d5d95-5a16-4d86-997c-a367d33f53cc"}],"doi":"10.3390/jof8080872"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e3c","5e7094f9878c28a0473c81e5","614e8e559543c7051ff01d77"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Contextuality without Incompatibility","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479269","mniswId":"16093","title":"Physical Review Letters","doi":null,"issn":"0031-9007","eissn":"1079-7114","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e928f814-eb5f-4137-8dc4-a90840cddcd6"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"657327d94097071b8e7003c7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094f9878c28a0473c81e5","614e8e559543c7051ff01d77","5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e3c","6777c409fdbe831a38c275bf","6777c409fdbe831a38c275c0","6777c409fdbe831a38c275c1"]},"issue":"23","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The existence of incompatible measurements is often believed to be a feature of quantum theory which\nsignals its inconsistency with any classical worldview.

In historiography, considerations of the mentioned issue appeared marginally in works devoted to the institution of marriage, and in studies on the development of canon law. The aim of the article on „Sexuality of the inhabitants of 12th-century Ruthenia in the light of »The Life of (St) Moses the Hungarian«” is to analyse intimate life in Ruthenia in the pre-Mongol period in the light of „The Life of (St) Moses the Hungarian”. The juxtaposition of the mentioned hagiographic work with its plot almost entirely set in the context of sexual behaviour, with other Old Russian writings (both normative and narrative in nature) has led to a conclusion that Old Russian customs were not only the result of local tradition and the effect of adopting Byzantine legal norms, but that contacts with Latin Europe also played an important role. The close family affinities of the Rurikids with other European dynasties, the influx of people from the Latin cultural milieu into the local elite, were conducive to the persistence of phenomena considered in literature on the subject to be typical of the Latin culture."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219668","journalIssue":{"objectId":"677709a0fdbe833e695a53eb","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"1d8eecfe-1625-4874-8125-0f9d8827eae5"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"43-65","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://czasopisma.marszalek.com.pl/en/10-15804/hso/1366-hso2024/1470-hso20244/13548-hso2024402","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a04739ff94","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Bartnicki","uuid":"47E7B894E48905AC5E4028E171AE5E8D442CC53499566C13638136D32648D4F178442C9B96285E8650F6188DBDE500DD3AFBB41974B0D1B4C214A8F6AAC98D6D","orcidId":"0000-0002-9021-359X","documentHash":"c9d8e7c4-bd80-4999-b843-67fe333b436e"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["5-fluorouracyl","anion","fluorowodór","przyłączenie elektronu"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["5-fluorouracil","anion","electron attachment","hydrogen fluoride"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924b878c28a0473931f2","5e709419878c28a0473b6315"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Electron attachment to 5-fluorouracil: the role of hydrogen fluoride in dissociation chemistry","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","doi":null,"issn":"1422-0067","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"850accc5-0c0e-4f6c-9a84-eaa108a84f20"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65760b764097071b8ef3672f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709419878c28a0473b6315","5e70924b878c28a0473931f2","6777d889fdbe831a38c32170","6777d889fdbe831a38c32171","6777d889fdbe831a38c32172","6777d889fdbe831a38c32173"]},"issue":"15","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We investigate dissociative electron attachment to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) employing a crossed electron-molecular beam experiment and quantum chemical calculations. Upon the formation of the 5-FU− anion, 12 different fragmentation products are observed, the most probable dissociation channel being H loss. The parent anion, 5-FU−, is not stable on the experimental timescale (~140 µs), most probably due to the low electron affinity of FU; simple HF loss and F− formation are seen only with a rather weak abundance. The initial dynamics upon electron attachment seems to be governed by hydrogen atom pre-dissociation followed by either its full dissociation or roaming in the vicinity of the molecule, recombining eventually into the HF molecule. When the HF molecule is formed, the released energy might be used for various ring cleavage reactions. Our results show that higher yields of the fluorine anion are most probably prevented through both faster dissociation of an H atom and recombination of F− with a proton to form HF. Resonance calculations indicate that F− is formed upon shape as well as core-excited resonances."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219676","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d889fdbe831a38c32173","name":"Stephan","lastName":"Denifl","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"43cd66c3-d6ee-4134-a59f-4759eafd0c3e"},{"objectId":"6777d889fdbe831a38c32172","name":"Milan","lastName":"Ončák","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8a593cc6-473e-401d-9989-72e160176c84"},{"objectId":"6777d889fdbe831a38c32171","name":"Gabriel","lastName":"Schöpfer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d710e1ba-d9a3-4b1a-b800-ce44c4fc10d8"},{"objectId":"6777d889fdbe831a38c32170","name":"Eugene","lastName":"Arthur-Baidoo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4c289aa4-c8fa-4047-8cdb-7bf6933912ac"},{"objectId":"5e709419878c28a0473b6315","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Chomicz-Mańka","uuid":"1B62A303C4D0B1B3C263B6C3F79220DBED3ACA284900849E13870F3AE72A93546CE441AAE715C81F570FBEE862E1904302EBE04AD43A3D8339DF1DA25E20DA24","orcidId":"0000-0002-0685-2883","documentHash":"09be3f98-091a-40a0-94e5-ec09f022026e"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a0473931f2","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Rak","uuid":"5C8DC8B6AAF5BBEC441D93F3C8E141DCC478F6F3103DA2A903442F21FEB4075A18F63E429572153F8CEB55EA73B29978B5DEB4858C6AECB350A4381F70CC74B7","orcidId":"0000-0003-3036-0536","documentHash":"cbdee6c7-791f-4896-ba1f-745a0672aab6"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms23158325"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091d7878c28a04738c67b","uid":"bOZNeeoLQGqxcbFAPXgr_Og","uuid":"04f6300d-c648-4009-85cf-0f3f50cf83a0","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd74","parentUuid":"336f05cc-b615-4f3c-94b2-65abc7f54264","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd74","rootUuid":"336f05cc-b615-4f3c-94b2-65abc7f54264","name":"Wydział

there has been a significant increase in awareness of the adverse effects of chemicals with known or suspected endocrine-acting properties on human health. Human exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) mainly occurs by ingestion and to some extent by inhalation and dermal uptake. Although it is difficult to assess the full impact of human exposure to EDCs, it is well known that timing of exposure is of importance and therefore infants are more vulnerable to EDCs and are at greater risk compared to adults. In this regard, infant safety and assessment of associations between prenatal exposure to EDCs and growth during infancy and childhood has been received considerable attention in the last years. Hence, the purpose of this review is to provide a current update on the evidence from biomonitoring studies on the exposure of infants to EDCs and a comprehensive view of the uptake, the mechanisms of action and biotransformation in baby/human body. Analytical methods used and concentration levels of EDCs in different biological matrices (e.g., placenta, cord plasma, amniotic fluid, breast milk, urine, and blood of pregnant women) are also discussed. Finally, key issues and recommendations were provided to avoid hazardous exposure to these chemicals, taking into account family and lifestyle factors related to this exposure."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219689","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"881","pagesFromTo":"1-26","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d84efdbe831a38c318e8","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Jatkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2c089e82-0e7b-404b-9919-2d775b9ab493"},{"objectId":"6777d84efdbe831a38c318e7","name":"Dimitra","lastName":"Lambropoulou","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c278c2e9-728a-4010-810b-d9bb0f92b341"},{"objectId":"6777d84efdbe831a38c318e6","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Sajid","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ccabf97c-4cf0-4122-8866-3dbe476601f4"},{"objectId":"6777d84efdbe831a38c318e5","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Kurowska-Susdorf","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fa5fa353-9d19-4a08-bb8b-0ca28b0cfc15"},{"objectId":"6777d84efdbe831a38c318e4","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Płotka-Wasylka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ed223107-3413-4e4d-b652-4806fc536365"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bcc","name":"Klaudia","lastName":"Godlewska","uuid":"1088C3BAEE2172B90195B47947E94E23920DF6BD8F2BE5D639DFA990EC712ACE5404706CBC91AC11C78433417C8F55BACB16AC85F6442DBF42D0062F6EF792B8","orcidId":"0000-0003-1318-2248","documentHash":"2b08a9b9-0a34-40d3-8e01-538012ebefe8"},{"objectId":"5e709299878c28a047398c53","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Lis","uuid":"DE44D6AC191C09FDB9C996C2291B9CC45BBED2D92F437F321E12EE15DDE9E3C571E5AD25F88E6702AFD74E1721C779B950A9DCAB57E7F62C0FBC293F5C543729","orcidId":"0000-0001-9580-6098","documentHash":"31724210-a0f2-47eb-8a7f-0176d9e53f30"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a0473931f0","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Mulkiewicz","uuid":"BA315125409918ABC224AD497A458065A9F5937B23815F8FE1C02EA09BD12D723746163534496F725F7CF7FE16431B12CBB763E43BAB6DD49A52D2D520E912F9","orcidId":"0000-0001-6144-1190","documentHash":"386e8d21-575a-4d0f-9784-9c8e0d3a62b9"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163350"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Borel ideal","Lineability","summable ideal","ideal","convergent series","convergence test","ideal convergence","Olivier’s theorem","spaceability","algebrability"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924f878c28a04739384c","5e7092de878c28a04739e6a4","5e709459878c28a0473bb1c7"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The ideal test for the divergence of a series","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454795b5","mniswId":"17596","title":"Revista de la Real Academia de Ciencias Exactas, Fisicas y Naturales - Serie A: Matematicas","doi":null,"issn":"1578-7303","eissn":"1579-1505","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"7b35e5d1-7ff7-4cd7-845b-49a5f65d3b5a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-07","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6576c9874097071b8ef77ca5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924f878c28a04739384c","5e709459878c28a0473bb1c7","5e7092de878c28a04739e6a4"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We generalize the classical Olivier’s theorem which says that for any convergent series ∑n an with positive nonincreasing real terms the sequence (nan) tends to zero.

Obesity is associated with quantitative and qualitative changes in the serum fatty acid profile that have a significant impact on metabolism and overall health. In turn, changes in lipid metabolism in organs such as the liver and adipose tissue can generate changes in the fatty acid profile of the patients’ serum. Although the development of obesity is associated with lipid disorders, laboratory tests of lipids are limited to the so-called lipidogram. Many authors argue in favor of extending the scope of tested lipid compounds and determining changes in other, previously unexplored lipid groups. Depending on the structure of FA, the length of the aliphatic chain, the number of double bonds, additional substituents, other lipid components, and the source of the acid – all these factors will determine its vector of biological activity. Certainly, nowadays, comprehensive quantitative, structural, and functional analysis of specific lipid groups can lead to the identification of new lipid disorders in obesity. This chapter presents the alterations of fatty acid profile in obesity, including so far little studied groups of fatty acids like those containing cyclic groups or branched-chain fatty acids."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219694","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"167-187","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d883fdbe831a38c3204c","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Pakiet","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2c9a6901-5ce6-411a-89b0-8e8d1f5711d9"},{"objectId":"5e709428878c28a0473b74fb","name":"Adriana","lastName":"Mika","uuid":"F6A3BF77A1274AD419362939E1400DA991896B23E1DEBD500BB2E031BC21082B87F1B57BE73D749A6B612386671F508755FA21A9A8B56FBEFEF980CF28F1EDCF","orcidId":"0000-0003-2877-5652","documentHash":"5c9ab8d1-947d-44f9-b8ca-242fead08afb"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a04739320a","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Stepnowski","uuid":"6E1315A45E3C8D09C3EE267052AAD1C60A569A460874126B8373B3B6D2F586BD5705BEA16397F24679657E1320E2E894A863F6233606B6B575C78426A27C7BB0","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7ecfa3c4-0c71-4746-9745-712eaf025413"}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-95660-8_8"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["harmful insects","SPME","Insecticides","unsaturated hydrocarbons","GC/ MS","saturated hydrocarbons"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924b878c28a04739320a","6777d93bfdbe831a38c33afd","5e7092b3878c28a04739aef4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Composition of volatile compounds in male and female Tenebrio molitor and Leptinotarsa decemlineata before and after the application of insecticides","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792a1","mniswId":"16159","title":"Phytoparasitica","doi":null,"issn":"0334-2123","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"c0a6c9a8-ff4e-4a10-af2a-71002252c7e0"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-27","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65760c1f4097071b8ef37124","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924b878c28a04739320a","5e7092b3878c28a04739aef4","6777d93bfdbe831a38c33afd"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Some insects can be used as food, while others can affect the destruction of crops and the reduction of food reserves.

Miniaturized SPE offers an interesting alternative to LLE. Nowadays, many types of sorbents are available and can be used as selective materials for extraction of varied analytes in different kinds of samples. The characteristic of sorbent plays a crucial role because determines the resulting extraction mechanism of particular technique. SPE techniques have numerous positive features. This review provides an updated, comprehensive overview of new types of sorbents used in SPE-based techniques. In addition, miniaturized SPE techniques applied to environmental problems are described, based on the most recent, relevant, and representative examples of successful application. The perspective of the most promising directions for the development of the SPE technology in the near future, and the greatest challenges that will have to be faced, are also outlined."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219701","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"165","pagesFromTo":"1-23","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d850fdbe831a38c3193c","name":"Miguel","lastName":"de la Guardia","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f2d08c90-1db3-48ed-8cc5-d81c687e8854"},{"objectId":"6777d850fdbe831a38c3193b","name":"Victoria F.","lastName":"Samanidou","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6f6e0277-d59f-4556-9123-f1c4f9f69b08"},{"objectId":"6777d850fdbe831a38c3193a","name":"Paweł Mateusz","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"312f4477-311e-4db1-b69b-705b3dbf5dd1"},{"objectId":"6777d850fdbe831a38c31939","name":"Natasa","lastName":"Kalogiouri","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"01729ef4-cff4-440b-80ac-c4f4fe6de72b"},{"objectId":"6777d850fdbe831a38c31938","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Manousi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"127c17fd-858f-4a46-83b2-d70dd078814b"},{"objectId":"6777d850fdbe831a38c31937","name":"Salvador","lastName":"Garrigues","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e0b05429-e11a-4774-9a0a-e345049e0ae8"},{"objectId":"6777d850fdbe831a38c31936","name":"Aysegul","lastName":"Dogan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aab9d6bb-7c85-4a04-a843-946e2dd5c218"},{"objectId":"6777d850fdbe831a38c31935","name":"Michel Y.","lastName":"Fares","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5de08d2e-b5a3-4084-b841-765ffcc23246"},{"objectId":"6777d850fdbe831a38c31934","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Jatkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7581c32f-4b0f-415a-b134-cf82d51f47ac"},{"objectId":"6777d850fdbe831a38c31933","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Płotka-Wasylka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a4ed9a11-420f-4a8f-860e-506f69524752"},{"objectId":"5e7093d1878c28a0473b1443","name":"Magda","lastName":"Caban","uuid":"3A4AA2A083920B5A2B0B1ADA5F526E06D289257CFBF3DB65EB5F3402846AA1FB23F52D1FCB67013DA7696139A79349244CAAA9984E81DD447145F3B9D20E53BA","orcidId":"0000-0002-8040-5862","documentHash":"4b533442-142a-47f7-ba96-547e1c3f7fff"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a047393208","name":"Monika","lastName":"Paszkiewicz","uuid":"BFF2B801AF2DD72591E9BEA07EF7155547FA7F610516734400FB73FF4ED8B1ED76CBA0C4A98FEE9955E3125972CF541138C6FED3486487FF5E4866FDEEB6C430","orcidId":"0000-0002-3163-145X","documentHash":"fa251294-9f05-4042-a63f-d43049af9e1b"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.trac.2023.117140"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Glycosaminoglycans","molecular docking","molecular dynamics","Hamiltonian Replica Exchange","RS-REMD","MM-GBSA","protein","carbohydrate interactions","free energy calculations"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094dd878c28a0473c58cf","6777d838fdbe831a38c315f2","6777d838fdbe831a38c315f1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Repulsive Scaling Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics in modeling protein-glycosaminoglycan complexes","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547e547","mniswId":"24956","title":"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","doi":null,"issn":"1064-3745","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"adbae95f-f9f7-4a6c-8a60-de8c4a2a673b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6572d3074097071b8e6de47a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094dd878c28a0473c58cf","6777d838fdbe831a38c315f1","6777d838fdbe831a38c315f2"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Glycosaminoglycans are long linear periodic anionic polysaccharides consisting of disaccharide units exhibiting different sulfation patterns forming a highly heterogeneous group of molecules. Due to their flexibility, length, high charge, and periodicity, they are challenging for computational approaches. Despite their biological significance in terms of the important role in various diseases (e.g., Alzheimer, cancer, SARS-CoV-2) and proper cell functioning (e.g., proliferation, maturation), there is a lack of effective molecular docking tools designed specifically for glycosaminoglycans due to their challenging physical–chemical nature. In this chapter we present protocols for the Repulsive Scaling Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics (RS-REMD) methods to dock glycosaminoglycans with both implicit and explicit solvent models implemented. This novel molecular dynamics-based replica exchange technique should help to elevate our current knowledge on the complexes and interactions between glycosaminoglycans and their protein receptors."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219703","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2619","pagesFromTo":"153-167","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d838fdbe831a38c315f2","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Maszota-Zieleniak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9abaedc4-b079-4d92-81d9-2e06a6636ad5"},{"objectId":"6777d838fdbe831a38c315f1","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Marcisz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"663a1ed8-56c9-456e-b001-d412d69db407"},{"objectId":"5e7094dd878c28a0473c58cf","name":"Sergey","lastName":"Samsonov","uuid":"0A696C8802E71A3A89F3AF367E2CEA8CC0EA07478D60E9F4C08683C9707E2904AFE17930A29C903F2FFC8DA1032E57DEF00B2199857435DB613F28F5CF334581","orcidId":"0000-0002-5166-4849","documentHash":"736332c7-8850-4b23-9312-3e4bab0971fa"}],"doi":"10.1007/978-1-0716-2946-8_12"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Comorbidities","Migraine","Refractory migraine","Resistant migraine"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Several comorbidities, mostly psychiatric conditions, have been linked to migraine worsening; however, there is little knowledge of the comorbidity profile of individuals with resistant and refractory migraine.\n\nMethods: REFINE is a prospective observational multicenter international study involving individuals with migraine from 15 headache centers. Participants were categorized into three groups based on the European Headache Federation criteria: non-resistant and non-refractory (NRNRM), resistant (ResM), and refractory (RefM). We explored the prevalence of 20 comorbidities at baseline in the three groups.\n\nResults: Of the 689 included patients (82.8% women), 262 (38.0%) had ResM, 73 (10.4%) had RefM and 354 (51.4%) NRNRM. A higher prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities, trigger points, temporomandibular joint disorders, thyroiditis, and cerebrovascular diseases was observed in the RefM group, followed by ResM and NRNRM. Multiple comorbidities were more common in the RefM group, followed by the ResM group and by the NRNRM group (41.6% vs. 24.5% vs. 14.1% respectively; p < 0.001). At the sensitivity analysis, exploring participants with chronic migraine, significant differences among the NRNRM, ResM, and RefM groups were found in the prevalence of anxiety (p < 0.001), asthma and rhinitis (p = 0.013), bipolar and other psychiatric disorders (p = 0.049), cerebrovascular diseases (p < 0.001), depression (p < 0.001), obesity (p = 0.002), thyroiditis (p < 0.001), and trigger points (p = 0.008).\n\nConclusion: REFINE data indicate that individuals with ResM and RefM have a higher burden of comorbidities than those with NRNRM. It can be postulated that those comorbidities may have an impact on the progression of migraine from a form that is easy to treat to a form that is resistant or refractory to treatments. Longitudinal studies are needed to understand the direction of the association between ResM or RefM and those comorbidities and if proper treatment of comorbidities might help overcome treatment resistance or refractoriness."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219715","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"25","pagesFromTo":"art.212 [10 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://thejournalofheadacheandpain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s10194-024-01910-3","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6776b658fdbe831a38ba3c17","name":"S.","lastName":"Sacco","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"48b2b55a-52aa-4eaa-a3a5-d6b554d87e1c"},{"objectId":"6776b658fdbe831a38ba3c16","name":"Z.","lastName":"Katsarava","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fe62d761-4eaf-4865-b50b-56715b38341b"},{"objectId":"6776b658fdbe831a38ba3c15","name":"M.","lastName":"Carnovali","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"46f5bde3-a973-4399-bc85-d4b5a6b38198"},{"objectId":"6776b658fdbe831a38ba3c14","name":"G.","lastName":"Iaccarino","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fa8aad30-8006-4952-a615-1c80c47db0ba"},{"objectId":"6776b658fdbe831a38ba3c13","name":"F.","lastName":"Vernieri","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4f7439f6-805c-4c48-b7ea-2e01be5d6a01"},{"objectId":"6776b658fdbe831a38ba3c12","name":"M.

We have used novel capsule glycosylase-depolymerase (TP84_26 GD) from bacteriophage TP-84, infecting thermophilic Geobacillus stearothermophilus bacteria, as a representative enzyme to develop a method for rapid concentration and purification of the enzyme present in diluted crude host cell lysate. A novel variant of the polyethyleneimine (PEI)-based purification method was devised that offers a fast and effective approach for handling PEI-facilitated purification of bacteriophage-expressed native proteins. Due to the very basic nature of PEI, the method is suitable for proteins interacting with nucleic acids or acidic proteins, where either mixed PEI-DNA or RNA–protein complexes or PEI–acidic protein complexes are reversibly precipitated. (i) The method is of general use, applicable with minor modifications to a variety of bacteriophage cell lysates and proteins. (ii) In the example application, TP84_26 GD was highly purified (over 50%) in a single PEI step; subsequent chromatography yielded a homogeneous enzyme. (iii) The enzyme’s properties were examined, revealing the presence of three distinct forms of the TP84_26 GD. These forms included soluble, unbound proteins found in host cell lysate, as well as an integrated form within the TP-84 virion."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219719","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d82bfdbe831a38c3145f","name":"Beata","lastName":"Łubkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e0ff854f-c56b-4b4e-9f96-f19d107e538e"},{"objectId":"5e7094bd878c28a0473c2ded","name":"Ireneusz","lastName":"Sobolewski","uuid":"7A41686B28861A7AF2319A7A6A71426FDF2C61B61E866A687902040D3CFAF30B5AFD7EE555059FFE9FCECBF58AF4FF187ADCEF720100AA48E7C5CABFCB5C12AF","orcidId":"0000-0002-9510-2557","documentHash":"e644185c-b204-4d1d-b6c9-8ae8b461f6f9"},{"objectId":"5e709407878c28a0473b519b","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Krawczun","uuid":"1437111F95DA3F904A1BE1F47615E6A7BDBD03FBA493491E462170E8C46A513FCF115194582EE4E17508C362F5101080918340C8A4E76FE944BD334E712382D7","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fcbdae5d-e1a2-4a24-8b43-4911a99ad993"},{"objectId":"5e7092b3878c28a04739aee9","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Żylicz-Stachula","uuid":"286634F391DC8ED62DDA66A33DE2DC65158EAD4A3B55C55BD32AF664C614FFB9DE2DAE5DC5B43E646992A0A8985A100CE45EEE31A7EF320B1FCF4211C039E4DA","orcidId":"0000-0003-2479-3634","documentHash":"52144b2b-76a4-474b-9361-234a50f08cde"},{"objectId":"5e7092b2878c28a04739aed4","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Skowron","uuid":"26CEA9872C730272C5D3BAAD7CAE1551C9D7DD66BDC0551426644CB8085A378AB6CAFDC90B56CD139F45713DB944FC1FF6438C9F69D2B138CC396746BCD31690","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f9bf21a4-bb65-41e1-b414-4e6e612516f0"},{"objectId":"5e709299878c28a047398c4f","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Czajkowska","uuid":"254B1DA6776A472EB41071886171606CA9E7E50B019B6C2E1F19EDF2F1958F38EF7A1FEF397F1269BB3E364E3C2B1BD890E128913BD22833056184318D60007C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ec82cc81-1b70-4ad9-8ca8-6dd52c1b8288"}],"doi":"10.3390/microorganisms11092340"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942c878c28a0473b79dd","5edf091b7523404d1000e95e","5e7092b3878c28a04739aee3"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Novel chalcone-derived pyrazoles as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":null,"issn":"2045-2322","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-08","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63b419f640970722144749b8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70942c878c28a0473b79dd","5edf091b7523404d1000e95e","5e7092b3878c28a04739aee3","6777d8e7fdbe831a38c32e1d","6777d8e7fdbe831a38c32e1e","6777d8e7fdbe831a38c32e1f","6777d8e7fdbe831a38c32e20","6777d8e7fdbe831a38c32e21"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Lung cancer is considered to account for approximately one-fifth of all malignant tumor-related deaths worldwide and is therefore one of the most lethal malignancies. Pyrazole scaffold possesses a wide range of biological and pharmacological activities, which play important roles in medicinal chemistry. The present study reports the synthesis and in vitro biological characterization of nine pyrazoles derived from chalcones as potential anticancer agents for non-small cell lung cancer A-549, H226, and H460 cell lines. Most of the compounds efficiently inhibited the growth of all the tested cancer cell lines at micromolar concentrations. One of the most active compounds (PCH-1) was further evaluated for its effect on cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, migration, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and oxidative stress. Furthermore, studies on the mechanism of action revealed that PCH-1 disrupts microtubule assembly, leading to cancer cell death. Molecular modeling studies confirmed the potent interaction of PCH-1 with the vinblastine binding site on tubulin. Overall, this study provides novel opportunities to identify anticancer agents in the pyrazole series."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219728","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-07691-6.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d8e7fdbe831a38c32e21","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Baginski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"80cefc16-f9be-40b3-a791-055579cb6415"},{"objectId":"6777d8e7fdbe831a38c32e20","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Serocki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0a0f2e18-45d5-4110-b90d-561d0b0ecc74"},{"objectId":"6777d8e7fdbe831a38c32e1f","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Jurasz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1b3ba0bc-90ef-41c0-b0be-13db77b887d0"},{"objectId":"6777d8e7fdbe831a38c32e1e","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Olszewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4615414c-566f-4478-9ccf-ab40e480bbbb"},{"objectId":"6777d8e7fdbe831a38c32e1d","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Maciejewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2a7d2e82-f8b3-4ecf-ab17-ff418c865d2d"},{"objectId":"5edf091b7523404d1000e95e","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Cekała","uuid":"2B5D705406FDF97EFB457F48B904EDDF352FF291D8C29C98C3201FAF872318D398365AD20EC1E9D2E62E8AD908358B27685D46248890A6F5B5E337797DC7296A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eb041d48-39be-416d-8d7c-a0004ccb8353"},{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b79dd","name":"Maria","lastName":"Dzierżyńska","uuid":"F1A6EAA4F3BF463EC1C5206AFC32FF0FDDFC597276EE2A085BDA27AA9B6DA253A23F0A1DA800A0D83B140C37D114128BA7C9D395ECD0D0479AF128EB6670ED59","orcidId":"0000-0003-0861-2514","documentHash":"42d517dd-3f2c-4ac9-b5f0-91a6053edd33"},{"objectId":"5e7092b3878c28a04739aee3","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Wieczerzak","uuid":"8EE3BF664D0894B79EDA6F98524D79C0B325765BCD4C4606ECBA7EFD50426B023AF68F8AF5BADB4A9C097916A303039E6A165913338B328F9B4F779CCBD113A0","orcidId":"0000-0003-2539-5160","documentHash":"b156787c-91a0-40c4-859f-9ecc80faab25"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-022-07691-6"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["pandemia COVID-19","uczenie się transformatywne","poczucie samotności","aktywne edukacyjnie kobiety"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pandemic COVID-19","transformative learning","feeling alone","educationally active educational women"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","uid":"bHvub0W7DW61k4FKLYJQ3Zw","uuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","parentUuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","rootUuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Długosza w Częstochowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70923e878c28a0473925a5"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcb0","uid":"b0r66eP7HoJMHsuBaW-45aQ","uuid":"add982ff-1e14-4375-84f5-07977f9fd994","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcb0","parentUuid":"add982ff-1e14-4375-84f5-07977f9fd994","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcb0","rootUuid":"add982ff-1e14-4375-84f5-07977f9fd994","name":"Uniwersytet WSB Merito w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709220878c28a0473903f4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Poczucie samotności aktywnych edukacyjnie kobiet w kontekście doświadczenia pandemii covid-19","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d54878c28514547a73b","mniswId":"200492","title":"HUMANITAS Pedagogika i Psychologia","doi":null,"issn":"2956-3992","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WCN","editor":null,"documentHash":"152299ff-80ae-4c2a-af8e-b490aafd2c58"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-06-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6555e92c4097077145e3a9b2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709220878c28a0473903f4","5e70923e878c28a0473925a5"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Celem badania jest: 1. określenie zmian poziomu samotności aktywnych edukacyjnie kobiet w okresie przed i w trakcie pandemii COVID-19; 2.

Methods: Data were collected using an online test method. The research sample consists of 258 educationally active women living in northwestern Poland. Age of women surveyed: from 19 to 87 years. Findings: During the pandemic, the emotional loneliness of the surveyed women increased. The level of social loneliness remained unchanged. Social support is a protective factor. The level of loneliness correlates negatively with life satisfaction and positively with perceiving in oneself manifestations of transformative learning.

Despite this, there is still insufficient knowledge regarding their properties. In this work, we tested the ionicity of selected ILMs and discussed their impact on the MALDI process. The targets were the following mixtures: CHCA/TEA, FER/TEA, HABA/α-MBA, 2,5-DHB/α-MBA (CHCA - α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, FER – ferulic acid, HABA − 2-(4-hydroxyphenylazo)benzoic acid, 2,5-DHB − 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid, TEA – triethylamine, α-MBA - α-methylbenzylamine). These are ILMs which in our previous study showed liquidity at room temperature. We decided to apply several empirical and theoretical techniques due to the complexity of the problem. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) with IR was used to test the process at a higher temperature (simulation of a laser shot). 1H NMR was used for the determination in pure ILMs of intermolecular interactions, which have a high impact on ionicity. Conductivity and rheological measurements were performed to determine the Walden plot, from which the excess of ionicity can be concluded. DFT calculations were used to support the statements of dissociation processes in the gas phase and solution. The auto-ionization of matrices in MALDI was also tested. The interpretation of the Walden plot shows that HABA/α-MBA is a very good ionic liquid, which can be derived from a proposed “pedal motion”-like mechanism. The ionicity of other matrices was reduced because of intermolecular interactions (proved by TGA-IR and 1H NMR). The MALDI-MS analysis shows that the obtained mass spectra, namely the base peaks, depend on amine gas proton affinity. Furthermore, the DFT calculation results and the TGA-IR analysis support the mechanism of retro-proton transfer after the laser shot in the gas phase. Finally, it was concluded that the four tested ILMs are differentiated in ionicity, but its extent has no impact on the auto-ionization of the matrix."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219746","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"349","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molliq.2021.118106","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d8ccfdbe831a38c32af2","name":"Marta","lastName":"Kasprzyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0ac587b4-a3fe-4b2c-a73b-5ac29f678ed2"},{"objectId":"6777d8ccfdbe831a38c32af1","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Kobylis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cac4e328-efd1-4a3e-befb-8231de653f59"},{"objectId":"5e7093d1878c28a0473b1443","name":"Magda","lastName":"Caban","uuid":"3A4AA2A083920B5A2B0B1ADA5F526E06D289257CFBF3DB65EB5F3402846AA1FB23F52D1FCB67013DA7696139A79349244CAAA9984E81DD447145F3B9D20E53BA","orcidId":"0000-0002-8040-5862","documentHash":"4b533442-142a-47f7-ba96-547e1c3f7fff"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a0473931de","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Nowacki","uuid":"4EB8F88B562BF5335747FCA7F5CB8B173216E6A11997CCEC6D7A2EF67037DF840983278DA3D2B9A9B7A9893FEEDF9043AA8460C6761A4BC1B69510BCADA4BACC","orcidId":"0000-0001-7587-1685","documentHash":"adce1d74-7664-4254-9199-ef10c18d111a"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.molliq.2021.118106"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["diabetes","ADAM17","combinatorial chemistry","fluorogenic peptides"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","parentUuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","rootUuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Bearing this in mind, wastewaters have to be completely purified from antimicrobial agents. In this context, a dielectric barrier discharge cold atmospheric pressure plasma (DBD-CAPP) system was used in the present study as a multifunctional tool for the deactivation of nitro-based pharmacuticals such as furazolidone (FRz) and chloramphenicol (ChRP) in solutions. A direct approach was applied to this by treating solutions of the studied drugs by DBD-CAPP in the presence of the ReO4− ions. It was found that Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and Reactive Nitrogen Species (RNS), generated in the DBD-CAPP-treated liquid, played a dual role in the process. On the one hand, ROS and RNS led to the direct degradation of FRz and ChRP, and on the other hand, they enabled the production of Re nanoparticles (ReNPs). The produced in this manner ReNPs consisted of catalytically active Re+4, Re+6, and Re+7 species which allowed the reduction of –NO2 groups contained in the FRz and ChRP.

Individuals with SCZ exhibited greater microbiota richness compared to HC (FDR P(Q)=0.028). Taxonomically, while no significant differences were observed between the microbiota of MDD and SCZ patients in a head-to-head comparison, both patient groups differed significantly when compared to HC. Interestingly, besides common patterns (such as a higher abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 and Streptococcus, and a lower abundance of Lachnospiraceae ND3007 group), unique patterns were exhibited only in MDD (with a higher abundance of Anaerostipes, Q=0.004) or SCZ (with a higher abundance of Sutterella, Q=0.001, and a lower abundance of Clostridium sensu stricto 1, Q=0.002). The Random Forest algorithm identified Ruminococcus torques group, Lachnospiraceae UCG-001, and Erysipelotrichaceae UCG-003 as highly discriminative features for both SCZ and MDD, while Suturella and Holdemania were unique features for SZC, and Lachnospiraceae genus CAG-56 and Anaerostipes for MDD. Additionally, between 50 % and 60 % of the differentially abundant taxa were found among the top 10 influential features in the RF models. In conclusion, while no significant differences were found between the microbiota of MDD and SCZ patients, distinct microbial patterns were found in each group when compared to HC. The study did not confirm universal microbial biomarkers reported in other studies but showed that the observed differences concern the bacteria associated with inflammation, the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA), and the synthesis of metabolites linked to mental health (lactic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid - GABA). The application of machine learning holds promise for further understanding the complex relationship between microbiota and these psychiatric disorders. The observed results should be treated with caution due to the limitations of this study (mainly sample size), therefore further researches under standardized environmental conditions with consistent analytical and bioinformatics approaches are warranted."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219761","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"171","pagesFromTo":"art.107208 [14 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306453024002531","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6776b7f7fdbe831a38ba3ed4","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Samochowiec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"63f07460-e9fc-4563-be5a-68d94aaf0fae"},{"objectId":"6776b7f7fdbe831a38ba3ed3","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Skonieczna-Żydecka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5536a74b-a275-4d6b-9b68-37eb6a292168"},{"objectId":"6776b7f7fdbe831a38ba3ed2","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Podsiadło","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1f2cf42a-107e-4f45-92a1-3e733c536db6"},{"objectId":"6776b7f7fdbe831a38ba3ed1","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Liśkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1f1d2900-55ca-4fe0-a67d-f84dd1501801"},{"objectId":"6776b7f7fdbe831a38ba3ed0","name":"Igor","lastName":"Łoniewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bde1c72b-1930-4bfd-aaa4-112cb709f64b"},{"objectId":"6776b7f7fdbe831a38ba3ecf","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Kaczmarczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b1386ed0-eebf-436e-bea8-a5c6fe4c40c8"},{"objectId":"6776b7f7fdbe831a38ba3ece","name":"Agata","lastName":"Misera","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1075b051-92c9-4894-8c6f-0a87bec6d399"},{"objectId":"5e709418878c28a0473b613b","name":"Błażej","lastName":"Misiak","uuid":"E9F21E3954A28FFAE505F6F2E8077BC7A73A99EB3D875718DDA3FF4973E870FD38DA96A7CA0EE56C37CA3B3CEB0D0C08A187410FB1B6FF42EC20B39AF54C554D","orcidId":"0000-0002-5392-6398","documentHash":"51e89ce1-52c3-4e16-9f0a-b244a7b117cf"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.psyneuen.2024.107208"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["visible light activity","heterogenous photocatalysis","Ag3PO4-graphene"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6777d8defdbe831a38c32cf5","5e70925e878c28a04739474c","5e709445878c28a0473b9596","6777d8defdbe831a38c32cf6"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"New approach for the synthesis of Ag3PO4-graphene photocatalysts","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d9b","mniswId":"13993","title":"Materials Science in Semiconductor Processing","doi":null,"issn":"1369-8001","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"4483d3ae-bca8-412f-ad07-ac31a5cc8b61"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-06-23","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca55c84097077ac1cfd7f6","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709445878c28a0473b9596","5e70925e878c28a04739474c","6777d8defdbe831a38c32cf5","6777d8defdbe831a38c32cf6","6777d8defdbe831a38c32cf7","6777d8defdbe831a38c32cf8"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Opracowano łatwą i skuteczną metodę napylania plazmowego do wytwarzania aktywnego fotokatalizatora w świetle widzialnym - rombowego dwunastościennego fosforanu srebra Ag3PO4 pokrytego nanografenem (Ag3PO4-GR) o podwyższonej stabilności.

In particular, the crucial point of the debate is whether it is possible to conclude anything on the quantum nature of the gravitational field, provided that two quantum systems become entangled solely due to the gravitational interaction. Typically, this question has been addressed by assuming a specific physical theory to describe the gravitational interaction, but no systematic approach to characterise the set of possible gravitational theories which are compatible with the observation of entanglement has been proposed. Here, we remedy this by introducing the framework of Generalised Probabilistic Theories (GPTs) to the study of the nature of the gravitational field. This framework enables us to systematically study all theories compatible with the detection of entanglement generated via the gravitational interaction between two systems. We prove a no-go theorem stating that the following statements are incompatible: i) gravity is able to generate entanglement; ii) gravity mediates the interaction between the systems; iii) gravity is classical. We analyse the violation of each condition, in particular with respect to alternative non-linear models such as the Schrödinger-Newton equation and Collapse Models."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060219815","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"6","pagesFromTo":"1-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777c434fdbe831a38c28212","name":"Flaminia","lastName":"Giacomini","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"82d34223-797f-4f6d-8d73-ccd3299d38f9"},{"objectId":"6777c434fdbe831a38c28211","name":"Thomas D.","lastName":"Galley","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"15d94d06-1d12-497a-9f79-955833a94500"},{"objectId":"5e7094f9878c28a0473c81e5","name":"John","lastName":"Selby","uuid":"B4AFE6663C92B0E4EEFF8A8EE5E6EFC9E0BA0BC961170D144B21CA43A64DAC92274C5012D73D0958E07E10339EC4960B24DE7CE17C443FC6F2A27E3E8AA525B7","orcidId":"0000-0002-4596-7501","documentHash":"20ed5004-ed8e-4a70-93c1-e4514e869e10"}],"doi":"10.22331/q-2022-08-17-779"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["probe-system interaction","pure-dephasing dynamics","Kolmogorov\nconsistency","commutativity","quantumness witness"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebedf1a752340254fc42d73"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Statistics of projective measurement on a quantum probe as a witness of noncommutativity of algebra of a probed system","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c28514547948f","mniswId":"16926","title":"Quantum Information Processing","doi":null,"issn":"1570-0755","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"08e2fa9a-fe30-4bf8-b883-996bc3595b32"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62fb47804097077a00cfd5bf","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5ebedf1a752340254fc42d73","6777c461fdbe831a38c29257"]},"issue":"7","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We consider a quantum probe P undergoing pure dephasing due to its interaction with a quantum system S.

By collating data from governmental, academic, and industry sources, it identifies key trends and evaluates the effectiveness of BIM policies in advancing technology within construction. A systematic literature review and text mining across major databases revealed an increasing focus on sustainability, particularly “life cycle assessment” and “energy efficiency”, aligning with the Industry 5.0 initiative. The research shows that 35% of European countries have or plan to introduce BIM mandates, highlighting BIM’s crucial role in enhancing construction practices and influencing policy frameworks. Insights from this study are valuable for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, guiding the adoption and operationalization of BIM and emphasizing the need for thorough market preparation, including funding, training, and standardization. Additionally, the study suggests a correlation between a country’s economic development and its propensity to enforce BIM mandates. Future research could explore regional policy variations and delve into the theoretical aspects of policy adoption and innovation diffusion to further understand BIM uptake dynamics."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060222479","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-28","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/11/4363","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70939a878c28a0473ad932","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Zima","uuid":"F5F99BC6468C3D09EBAB8324C962FBF4D62491065AB5A8B78877102F5C5941451218C215C7BE70D96FDFE29995DC7DDD3E64F68EC33FB705D770467CB10A6AA8","orcidId":"0000-0001-5563-5482","documentHash":"4e4d73b3-4fea-4804-9d7e-1bbe7c55ea17"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473a9df5","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Mitera-Kiełbasa","uuid":"1DA2963CF258A7A5A52F05DC21C00BE2D70D3C4A7E4EB4D9C2F07F6FA9A52954564BDFADB2473BC1BDADDD19DC467674D9BD7051C5A205A3D362DA152979C28E","orcidId":"0000-0002-1126-5798","documentHash":"41fa2d94-0a79-4d19-ad87-bd20fdeb4839"}],"doi":"10.3390/app14114363"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["klasyfikacja impulsów","uczenie maszynowe","aktywne ekranowanie","radioaktywność środowiska","pary rozpadów"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["environmental radioactivity","pulse classification","active shielding","machine learning","decay pairs"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924f878c28a0473936f8","5e7093cc878c28a0473b0ed4","5e7093c9878c28a0473b0b56","6777bbe4fdbe831a38c21de0","5e70937d878c28a0473aae60"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"μDOSE+: Environmental radioactivity and dose rate measurement system with active shielding boosted by machine learning","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478dd6","mniswId":"14078","title":"Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation","doi":null,"issn":"0263-2241","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"066c10ef-6b87-4756-9477-5fcd8dff8d12"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-05-06","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"674981e7fdbe8357176fc5c7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70937d878c28a0473aae60","5e70924f878c28a0473936f8","5e7093c9878c28a0473b0b56","5e7093cc878c28a0473b0ed4","6777bbe4fdbe831a38c21de0","6777bbe4fdbe831a38c21de1","6777bbe4fdbe831a38c21de2","6777bbe4fdbe831a38c21de3","6777bbe4fdbe831a38c21de4"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The μDOSE+ is a novel measurement system designed for environmental radioactivity measurements and trapped charge dating applications.

Conventional bricks are produced by utilizing fertile soil or ordinary Portland cement; both emit greenhouse gases to the environment during production. In an attempt to lessen the brick industry's significant carbon footprint, numerous academicians are working towards the development of innovative and sustainable bricks by utilizing numerous waste materials. This present paper provides an up-to-date review of the development of sustainable and environment-friendly geopolymer brick by utilizing solid industrial waste materials such as fly ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag, red mud, rice husk ash, mine tailings, sugarcane bagasse ash, and municipal solid waste incineration fly ash, respectively. Geopolymer bricks can be produced by the reaction between an aluminosilicate source material and an alkaline solution. The source material can be naturally occurring minerals like kaolinite, clays, etc. or by-product materials such as fly ash, slag, silica fume, metakaolin, rice husk ash, red mud, etc. The sodium and potassium-based alkali material solution can be used as an alkali liquid. Sometimes, the combinations of sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide and sodium silicate or potassium silicate solutions or various combinations are used. The selection of raw materials for geopolymer bricks depends on the availability, cost, and type of application. The geopolymer bricks specimen prepared with various waste materials shows excellent mechanical strength (compressive strength, flexural strength) and durability under harsh environments. To manufacture and use bricks from various waste materials on a large scale in a sustainable manner, more research and development are needed. This includes work on standardization, public education about waste reuse and recycling, government policies, etc."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060222483","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"445","pagesFromTo":"1-24","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2024.137876","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d71afdbe831a38c2ef44","name":"Prasanta Kumar","lastName":"Rout","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e889934e-7f36-4dd5-84ca-20e47278b0ca"},{"objectId":"6777d71afdbe831a38c2ef43","name":"Dipankar","lastName":"Das","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a350425f-9150-4976-b40b-2c00b6694c40"},{"objectId":"5e709445878c28a0473b9596","name":"Anna","lastName":"Gołąbiewska","uuid":"063483BDECF928846115219C1E9C87E9956446687727E981C3F03378E79975556576A71B538E976D2F520150151CF041CC0836E079D5F11C308DC14D83092450","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aec023e2-c52c-4270-a99a-a7ca9495aeac"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2024.137876"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":"978-83-63605-56-8","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709249878c28a04739316b"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Wybrane problemy technologii odlewniczych.

In this study, we investigated dissociative electron attachment (DEA) to 5-iodo-4-thio-2′-deoxyuridine, a potential radiosensitizer using a crossed electron-molecule beam experiment coupled with quadrupole mass spectrometry. The experimental results were supported by calculations on the threshold energies of formed anions and transition state calculations. We show that low-energy electrons with kinetic energies near 0 eV may effectively decompose the molecule upon DEA. The by far most abundant anion observed corresponds to the iodine anion (I–). Due to the associated bond cleavage, a radical site is formed at the C5 position, which may initiate strand break formation if the molecule is incorporated into a DNA strand. Our results reflect the conclusion from previous radiolysis studies with the title compound, suggesting its potential as a radiosensitizer."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060222493","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"8948-8955","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d85dfdbe831a38c31adf","name":"Stephan","lastName":"Denifl","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a2cef348-b578-45d6-87d5-c6a1bf3f9be1"},{"objectId":"6777d85dfdbe831a38c31ade","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Demkowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"65339bc5-4d16-4036-ad40-a2fa1e2d4008"},{"objectId":"6777d85dfdbe831a38c31add","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Datta","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2e2a7c3a-2223-4f22-b769-4512c3bbeb98"},{"objectId":"6777d85dfdbe831a38c31adc","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Szczyrba","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4277ab9c-8854-4045-a46c-b8a47d670177"},{"objectId":"6777d85dfdbe831a38c31adb","name":"Farhad","lastName":"Izadi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b1367945-54f3-45b8-b350-1eae84ab5a51"},{"objectId":"6777d85dfdbe831a38c31ada","name":"Eugene","lastName":"Arthur-Baidoo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4dffb963-08f0-484d-b9c6-972f42bb1a1c"},{"objectId":"6777d85dfdbe831a38c31ad9","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Saqib","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"40f5092b-5d20-41dc-84b4-8aaa0e47713b"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a0473931f2","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Rak","uuid":"5C8DC8B6AAF5BBEC441D93F3C8E141DCC478F6F3103DA2A903442F21FEB4075A18F63E429572153F8CEB55EA73B29978B5DEB4858C6AECB350A4381F70CC74B7","orcidId":"0000-0003-3036-0536","documentHash":"cbdee6c7-791f-4896-ba1f-745a0672aab6"}],"doi":"10.1021/acs.jpclett.3c02219"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["anodization","removal of microbiological pollutants","ternary alloys","nanomaterials fabrication","heterogeneous photocatalysis","semiconductors"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b2878c28a04739aed4","5e709388878c28a0473ac1ad","5e70945b878c28a0473bb45d","5e70925e878c28a04739474c","6777d74dfdbe831a38c2f637"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Detailed Insight into photocatalytic inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in the presence of visible-light-active multicomponent photocatalysts","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f54","mniswId":"14744","title":"Nanomaterials","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2079-4991","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e9c1c268-f5c5-4a83-85c6-d1782e88f3c5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-02-23","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"66d05a49fdbe8307ad296989","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709388878c28a0473ac1ad","5e70945b878c28a0473bb45d","5e7092b2878c28a04739aed4","5e70925e878c28a04739474c","6777d74dfdbe831a38c2f637","6777d74dfdbe831a38c2f638","6777d74dfdbe831a38c2f639","6777d74dfdbe831a38c2f63a"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The use of heterogeneous photocatalysis in biologically contaminated water purification processes still requires the development of materials active in visible light, preferably in the form of thin films.

In the samples made from Ti-based alloys, metal/metal oxide nanoparticles were formed, which were located on the surface and inside the walls of the NTs. The obtained results showed that oxygen species produced at the surface of irradiated photocatalysts and the presence of copper and silver species in the photoactive layers both contributed to the inactivation of bacteria. Photocatalytic inactivation of E. coli, S. aureus, and Clostridium sp. was confirmed via TEM imaging of bacterium cell destruction and the detection of CO2 as a result of bacteria cell mineralization for the most active sample.

We show that the inhibitor induces an increase of the enzyme radius of gyration due to the expansion on one of the dimer interfaces; the structural changes observed, including the active site pocket volume increase and the decrease in the monomer–monomer buried surface area and of the number of hydrogen bonds (as compared to the inactive enzyme control simulation), indicate that the catalytically competent (open) conformation of hTK1 can be assumed in the presence of an activating ligand."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060222502","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"62","pagesFromTo":"142-149","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c01157","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d910fdbe831a38c3330c","name":"Zoe","lastName":"Cournia","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"47b45d7f-17f4-44af-95fd-256068c92152"},{"objectId":"5e709299878c28a047398c47","name":"Samanta","lastName":"Romanowska","uuid":"3C0FEE370A0FA82ED7E8A6CFA7F04A9BBA6041E842F0D7BCDD3DDA9CA119A2C54ADFCB672F893C84A348D2BF77211F086AA696C8B95E01B9B8DDE03229351E82","orcidId":"0000-0003-2907-7725","documentHash":"4a13fa42-d968-44db-adf7-575ee74646e7"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a0473931f2","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Rak","uuid":"5C8DC8B6AAF5BBEC441D93F3C8E141DCC478F6F3103DA2A903442F21FEB4075A18F63E429572153F8CEB55EA73B29978B5DEB4858C6AECB350A4381F70CC74B7","orcidId":"0000-0003-3036-0536","documentHash":"cbdee6c7-791f-4896-ba1f-745a0672aab6"}],"doi":"10.1021/acs.jcim.1c01157"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["glycosaminoglycans","models","heparan sulfate","syndecans","moleculardynamics","intrinsically disordered proteins"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094dd878c28a0473c58cf","6777d83bfdbe831a38c3165a","5e70924b878c28a0473931ed"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Interplay of heparan sulfate chains with the core proteins of syndecans 2 and 4","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"658406de4097076c14bffc77","mniswId":null,"title":"Proteoglycan Research","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2832-3556","websiteLink":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/28323556","metadataSource":"USER","editor":null,"documentHash":"b87dbf9c-3ba9-49f3-b29e-72158493e87a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-17","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"658406de4097076c14bffc76","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924b878c28a0473931ed","5e7094dd878c28a0473c58cf","6777d83bfdbe831a38c3165a","6777d83bfdbe831a38c3165b"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We have previously shown that the extracellular domains of the four syndecans are intrinsically disordered, and adopt a wide range of conformations. We report here the building of coarse-grained models of the extracellular domains of human syndecans 2 and 4 using small-angle X-ray scattering restraints. One, two or three heparan sulfate (HS) hexadecasaccharides, (IdoA[2S]GlcNS[6S])8, were attached to three serine residues of the core proteins, resulting in eight variants for each syndecan that were used for all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (0.5–1 µs). Syndecan-4 had a larger conformational diversity than syndecan-2, and remained extended during MD simulations in absence of HS whereas syndecan-2 adopted more compact conformations. Their core proteins thus appeared to be structurally distinct. The HS chains also behave differently, the middle chain being more flexible in syndecan-4, and the third chain being able to interact with the core protein regions mediating cell adhesion. The cell adhesion sites on both core proteins were flexible, with or without HS chains, the NXIP motif of syndecan-2 being located in a particularly flexible region. In conclusion, the HS chains induce moderate changes in the conformational dynamics of both syndecans, depending on the number of HS chains and their location on the core protein, and on the core protein itself."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060222503","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d83bfdbe831a38c3165b","name":"Sylvie","lastName":"Ricard-Blum ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"652fa4a7-f86f-4c26-8a2e-ea708dddfb58"},{"objectId":"6777d83bfdbe831a38c3165a","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Maszota-Zieleniak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3d8fecf5-92da-46b6-96e9-4000ddc867b0"},{"objectId":"5e7094dd878c28a0473c58cf","name":"Sergey","lastName":"Samsonov","uuid":"0A696C8802E71A3A89F3AF367E2CEA8CC0EA07478D60E9F4C08683C9707E2904AFE17930A29C903F2FFC8DA1032E57DEF00B2199857435DB613F28F5CF334581","orcidId":"0000-0002-5166-4849","documentHash":"736332c7-8850-4b23-9312-3e4bab0971fa"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a0473931ed","name":"Józef","lastName":"Liwo","uuid":"3B5D8B8662D4EACFC86FEF607377CFE9786BD92C4A5706A9E9F988196F33388BF9CD1799C90A4F4F4914448BA5CDE495B8C57ECD015581CB0EA2EA651E7F69DD","orcidId":"0000-0001-6942-2226","documentHash":"41611fe5-3cdf-4921-b6dd-7985a64b4e04"}],"doi":"10.1002/pgr2.10"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["quantum teleportation","random access code","no-signalling"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6226cdb87523402df08ea9bf","5e709429878c28a0473b76e1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Two instances of random access code in the quantum regime","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479023","mniswId":"15036","title":"New Journal of Physics","doi":null,"issn":"1367-2630","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"66969f49-7e62-40fc-8f5b-e34e5e75d259"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65858c924097076c14c40aaa","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709429878c28a0473b76e1","5e709438878c28a0473b851d","5e70925d878c28a047394647","6226cdb87523402df08ea9bf"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We consider two classes of quantum generalisations of random access code (RAC) and study the\nbounds for probabilities of success for such tasks.

After the initial selection of papers found in the databases used, over 600 publications were qualified for this review, of which 216 were subjected to detailed analysis. In the review, issues related to the following problems are described: applications of classic PSSs, applications of new stabilizer structures based on new algorithms (including artificial intelligence), development of new methods for tuning PSSs, and operation of PSSs in PSs with high power generation by renewable sources.

Additionally, for extended chain segments, the correlation terms contribute to propagating the conformational change at one end to the other end, which is characteristic of allosteric interactions.

The following authors have been\nselected to represent this kind of literature: Camille Flammarion and Sir James\nJeans. Particular consideration is given (from the perspective of photography as\nscientific proof ) to the question of the ontological status of the objects of as-\ntronomy and physics research (stars, galaxies, planets, elementary particles, etc.).\nThis status has, with the emergence of the theory of relativity and quantum me-\nchanics in the first quarter of the twentieth century, undergone a significant change\ndue to the need to include the awareness of the researcher into physical processes.\nThe article recalls the outlooks of prominent physicists and science theoreticians\n(such as Sir Arthur Eddington, Bertrand Russell, Wolfgang Pauli and other rep-\nresentatives of the so-called panpsychism), who argued for the granting of a dis-\ntinctively understood awareness not only to the subject (the researcher), but also\nto the object of study. Against this backdrop, the author endeavours to portray the\nambivalent role of the photography of space objects, which, on the one hand,\nstrengthens their autonomy in the process of the humans’ experience of them, but\nwhich, on the other hand, would be written into the expansionist narrative, sug-\ngesting the possibility of a neo-colonial exploitation of the riches of Space. The\nconclusion presents an allegorical interpretation of a short story Inwazja [Invasion]\nby Stanisław Lem, which, according to the author, is excellent at summarising the\nissue of the boundaries of human knowledge, experienced when confronting un-\nknowable phenomena, in a narrow ‘Galileo-Cartesian’

the ability of non-hyperaccumulator plants to grow in soils polluted by cadmium (Cd) and their potential for phytostabilization or phytoextraction is essential for assessing their use in phytomanagement efficiency. Therefore, we evaluated the tolerance of high-biomass grasses to Cd by measuring biomass production and element accumulation and valued them for their suitability for phytoextraction or phytostabilization purposes on moderately Cd-polluted land (total Cd concentration of 7.5 mg kg−1) by determining Cd accumulation in the plants and calculating the bioconcentration (Cd BCF) and translocation factors (Cd TF). Among the ten species under investigation, Panicum maximum cv. Massai and Pennisetum glaucum cv. Purpureum Schum showed lower root biomass due to Cd exposure. Cadmium exposure altered element accumulation in some grass species by reducing P, K, and Mg accumulation in P. glaucum cv. Purpureum Schum; K accumulation in P. maximum cv. Massai; Mg accumulation in P. maximum cv. Mombaça; Ca, Fe, and Zn accumulation in P. maximum cv. Aruana; and B accumulation in Brachiaria brizantha cv. Piatã. However, this was not correlated with lowered biomass production, except for K, which was associated with lowered root biomass allocation in P. maximum cv. Massai and P. glaucum cv. Purpureum Schum. Cadmium concentrations decreased from roots to shoots, indicating a clear limitation of upward Cd transport. Although some grasses exhibited a Cd BCF &gt; 1, the Cd TF remained below 0.4 for all tested species. These results indicate that, under moderate Cd pollution, the evaluated grasses are more suitable for Cd phytostabilization than phytoextraction, except for P. maximum cv. Massai and P. glaucum cv.

complex of B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) and herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) plays a critical role in immune regulation and has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for cancer treatment. In this study, we investigated the potential of the peptide inhibitor HVEM(14-39) to restore peripheral T cell activity in patients with advanced melanoma. In these patients, CD8+ T cells downregulated BTLA expression and increased HVEM expression upon activation. The addition of HVEM(14-39) reduced the percentage of BTLA+ CD8+ T cells and increased the subpopulation of HVEM+ CD8+ T cells. Additionally, HVEM(14-39) enhanced T cell activation, proliferation, and the shift toward effector memory T cell subpopulations. Finally, this peptide affected the proliferation rate and late apoptosis of melanoma cell line in co-culture with T cells.

The EDC (Eddy Dissipation Concept) model was used to simulate the combustion process with the UCSanDiego mechanism. The lean premixed flames studied were characterized by high turbulence intensity. Transport processes are likely to be faster than chemical reactions for fuel nitrogen compounds, so the EDC time constants were modified to compensate for simplifications in the EDC model implementation (Ansys Fluent). The change in the turbulence model did not significantly affect the maximum values of the monitored parameters, but the final NO content in the flue gas increased from 2900 to 3070 ppm.

Despite observational limitations, the rough details of this picture have been now confirmed by the results of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration on the imaging of the M87 and Milky Way supermassive central objects. However, the precise characterization of both features—ring and shadow—depends on the interaction between the background geometry and the accretion disk, thus being a fertile playground to test our theories on the nature of compact objects and the gravitational field itself in the strong-field regime. In this work we use both features in order to test a continuous family of solutions interpolating between regular black holes and horizonless compact objects, which arise within the Eddington-inspired Born–Infeld theory of gravity, a viable extension of Einstein’s general relativity (GR). To this end we consider seven distinctive classes of such configurations (five black holes and two traversable wormholes) and study their optical appearances under illumination by a geometrically and optically thin accretion disk, emitting monochromatically with three analytic intensity profiles previously suggested in the literature. We build such images and consider the sub-ring structure created by light rays crossing the disk more than once and existing on top of the main ring of radiation. We discuss in detail the modifications as compared to their GR counterparts, the Lyapunov exponents of unstable nearly-bound orbits, as well as the differences between black hole and traversable wormholes for the three intensity profiles. In addition we use the claim by the EHT Collaboration on the radius of the bright ring acting (under proper calibrations) as a proxy for the radius of the shadow itself to explore the parameter space of our solutions compatible with such a result."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060222541","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"40","pagesFromTo":"1-37","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777c3f9fdbe831a38c270ca","name":"Diego","lastName":"Sáez-Chillón

study presents innovative anti-seismic protection systems using PolyUrethane Flexible Joints (PUFJ) at the frame-infill interface and bonding of glass fiber meshes to the weak masonry substrate to

Due to the possibility of using the systems in existing and newly built structures in areas of increased risk of seismic excitations, the authors made an attempt to define the life cycle scenarios of these systems in terms of the possibility of extending the service life of these structures. The definition of the construction life cycle scenarios and the estimation of the corresponding investment costs and costs related to the operation and decommissioning of a given system were based on the approach presented in the ISO 15686 standard package \"Buildings and constructed assets\", part 2 – Service life prediction procedures and part 5 – Life cycle costing. The simulations covered a total of five variants of the systems application: (i) prefabricated PUFJ at 4 interfaces (in newly constructed buildings), (ii) injected PUFJ at 3 interfaces (improvement of existing buildings) and application of FRPU as a quick emergency or strengthening system (for buildings damaged by earthquakes) in variants (iii) at infill diagonals, (iv) at infill edges, and (v) as combination of the systems presented above (according to requirements). The cost analysis also took into account the potential impact of changes in the value of money over time and an increase in the production costs of building materials."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060222548","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"11-29","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.aydin.edu.tr/tr-tr/arastirma/universite-yayinlari/Pages/e-kitap.aspx","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"676874a2fdbe837ab14ec63f","name":"Damian","lastName":"Wieczorek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fb03f355-45a2-494c-94c3-f59c9c54ed3a"},{"objectId":"5e70939a878c28a0473ad932","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Zima","uuid":"F5F99BC6468C3D09EBAB8324C962FBF4D62491065AB5A8B78877102F5C5941451218C215C7BE70D96FDFE29995DC7DDD3E64F68EC33FB705D770467CB10A6AA8","orcidId":"0000-0001-5563-5482","documentHash":"4e4d73b3-4fea-4804-9d7e-1bbe7c55ea17"},{"objectId":"5e709397878c28a0473ad6b6","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Kwiecień","uuid":"53543722898AD8F1A8460F9C0F11C0EF36244977978DF027D793849F815DDE6E8F5F38C5CE736A930880320D76BA5241CDBB3F80B11370A8FACA3C04DBD240CD","orcidId":"0000-0002-6169-5585","documentHash":"4c9b79f1-dbd0-46d0-9d7f-bc012df73458"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de37","uid":"b-PdnZEwPPqnj7lgYIEYVlw","uuid":"ad77ae28-a912-4f87-8be3-40ac466442c8","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de37","parentUuid":"ad77ae28-a912-4f87-8be3-40ac466442c8","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de37","rootUuid":"ad77ae28-a912-4f87-8be3-40ac466442c8","name":"Politechnika Bydgoska im.

Side-slip for various attack angle has to be investigated. The main area of interest of research that is shown in the project is energy demand calculation of skid-steered wheeled vehicles in various terrain conditions. Certain cases of all-electric vehicles with individual electric motors per wheel demand a precise assessment of longitudinal and lateral forces in order to perform the fully controlled turn. Experimental stand designed and developed by authors allows to test the wheel-surface interaction for various terrain conditions and different driving directions. Test data were acquired for dry and wet sand and granite pavement. Traction and side forces were acquired and used to identify the wheel-soil interaction model parameters for unpropelled wheel. Results in a form of time series including longitudinal and lateral forces show the relation between attack angle, load and surface conditions in terms of stick and slip phenomenon that is essential for skid-steering dynamics calculations. Measurement results are then used for calculation of longitudinal and lateral forces coefficients as a function of attack angle and vertical load.

Their popularity\r\nis due to excellent mechanical properties, durability combined with low weight.\r\nGlobal production of plastics in 2020 reached 387 million tons and a great amount\r\nof waste from plastics is generated as they are usually non-biodegradable and often\r\nare used only once before disposal. Since the 1970s, the problem of plastics\r\npollution started to be noticed, and then the first regulations on their production,\r\nlimiting and management options were introduced. There are several methods\r\npreventing the plastics waste going to landfill. Among the plastics management\r\nmethods are mechanical recycling, solvent based purification, chemical recycling,\r\nenergy recovery and biodegradation (Figure 1). Mechanical recycling is\r\nthe reprocessing of the plastic waste to its original form (polymer) using simple\r\nphysical operations like grinding, separating, extruding. This option is the most\r\npopular for thermoplastics as they are easily reprocessed and the cost operations are\r\nlow. During solvent based purification the plastics products are purified from\r\ndifferent additional compounds like colorants, antioxidants, fillers to obtain original\r\npolymer. Biodegradation is available only for some polymers. Energy recovery\r\nprocess releases the energy contained within plastics through combustion and is\r\nsuitable only for materials which are difficult to recycle.\r\nNowadays chemical recycling of plastic waste is the most noteworthy\r\npolymers recovery technique as it is complementary to mechanical recycling.\r\nChemical recycling can be divided into two main processes: chemical and thermal\r\ndepolymerization (Figure 2). Thermal depolymerization processes are conducted\r\nusing heat and in the absence of oxygen, or with limited access to oxygen or other\r\ncompounds (H2, CO2). It converts plastics into monomers or basic chemical\r\n(hydrocarbons, oil, H2) and is typically used for polyolefins, PMMA, PS. During\r\nchemical depolymerization plastics are broken down into oligomers or monomers\r\nas a result of a chemical reaction with a low molecular weight agent (H2O, alcohols,\r\namines, glycols, acids) and usually refers to condensation and addition polymers\r\n(PET, PC, PA, PU). Chemical recycling enables for multiple recycling of plastics to\r\nits monomers, which can be polymerized to produce the original polymer.\r\nThe manuscript presents a literature review on chemical recycling of\r\ncommonly used plastics such as vinyl polymers, polycondensation polymers,\r\nthermosets and polymer blends."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060222572","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"76","pagesFromTo":"157-181","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://repozytorium.bg.ug.edu.pl/info/article/UOG29db824b2bcc4aa5a9eb3bcb81629089/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f81551d085dcb410a25ec8d","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Jutrzenka Trzebiatowska","uuid":"AB737A14DCE030AA98B106C656B89B75144C6FDEA986BD7997F3C852146DDBD3CFA354087AFAFA47A94D23AB73643CBC7331D9A0107DE96C2D0CED2F0B0049FE","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"80a6d756-b1be-4267-a7bd-4efc00c64751"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["MLR","molecular docking","virtual screening","perfluoroalkyl compounds","thyroid receptor","QSAR","binding probability","peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor","in silico","PFAS"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f5878c28a0473b4083","5e7092b3878c28a04739aee7"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"How the structure of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) influences their binding potency to the peroxisome proliferator-activated and thyroid hormone receptors - an in silico screening study","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":null,"issn":"1420-3049","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"85ea3d3d-2670-4384-98ee-1b5b44edab21"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-04","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"658d75354097076c14584afa","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b3878c28a04739aee7","5e7093f5878c28a0473b4083","6777d818fdbe831a38c311bb","6777d818fdbe831a38c311bc","6777d818fdbe831a38c311bd","6777d818fdbe831a38c311be","6777d818fdbe831a38c311bf"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, we investigated PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) binding potencies to nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs): peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) α, β, and γ and thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) α and β.

Theoretical assumptions and computer simulation tests are presented. The starting point was the theory and experience of gas entrapment caused mainly by a poorly designed gating system and the down sprue. Simulations were performed using Magmasoft software. First, initial studies were carried out to determine how the geometry (mainly the channel cross-section) of the sprue affects the problem, and then a detailed experiment was carried out on the so-called ‘short sprue’ version. The air entrapment process was analyzed, as were the parameters of the liquid alloy flow that passes through the analyzed channels. Nine geometric versions of the sprue were proposed and analyzed, and the results allowed us to conclude which sprue geometry is the best from the point of view of minimization of the gas entrapment problem.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060222577","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-31","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/14/4937","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6777d8bafdbe831a38c328d8","name":"Michał","lastName":"Szucki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f3cd8007-3b1b-4de2-8a22-da569a433ba3"},{"objectId":"6777d8bafdbe831a38c328d7","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Dojka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6a98147a-6389-45f5-8f6a-5b86a8c95aaa"},{"objectId":"5e709262878c28a047394c00","name":"Jan","lastName":"Jezierski","uuid":"FAC4FC80C3A0EC66464AFA33EE79582E9FC25A3F3316D1A7ADB603CED96484112497E204B83B45B1811F1D458C3157053B7B7B2BA744B3F20F08084C865B7221","orcidId":"0000-0003-2078-196X","documentHash":"f585694e-0720-4c2b-8ec5-669d431dcd7c"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15144937"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["CSR","AI","zarządzanie","innowacje"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["innovations","CSR","management","AI"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","uid":"b1CAWFlsJj7f886P9BWoCUQ","uuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","parentUuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","rootUuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","name":"Uniwersytet Radomski im.

The research hypothesis states: Artificial intelligence is a significant factor influencing the perception of a company's image in contemporary economic reality. Design/Methodology/Approach: A detailed literature review was contained in the theoretical section. In the empirical part a survey was conducted among 160 enterprises to identify factors influencing company image and assess the impact of AI technologies. In this section were used the exploratory factor analysis, which serves to identify key factors and explicate correlations among variables, to verify the research hypothesis. The number of factors was indicated by means of Cattel’s method and Kaiser criterion. Findings: The research confirms the hypothesis that AI is a significant factor influencing a company's image in today's economic reality. The analysis of 20 variables revealed that most companies perceive AI as beneficial for various aspects of their operations, with applications like monitoring online reviews, detecting social trends, and user recommendation analysis receiving high ratings for enhancing brand reputation. Factor analysis identified four key determinants impacting a company's image through AI: Automation/Optimization, Strategic Analysis, Content Management, CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility). Practical Implications: The results are applicable to the work of both scientists and practitioners. Businesses should leverage AI technologies to automate and optimize processes, strategic analysis and support CSR initiatives. Implementing AI can enhance brand reputation, customer satisfaction, and long-term growth. Originality/Value: This study contributes to the understanding of how AI can be used to achieve sustainable organizational growth while simultaneously shaping a positive company image. Moreover the identification of four key determinants through factor analysis provides valuable insights for businesses seeking to strategically integrate AI into their operations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060222579","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"188-200","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ersj.eu/journal/3570","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae67e","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Wójtowicz","uuid":"49CF78B35D805EBF6A63DBD0F2E744501C68154EEFBE62E1FE5E3D8A81F664F1F23312E423EAE1F4ED01B15F85CECE2D95E7783DF9220A5F613E225FD449FB7F","orcidId":"0000-0003-3426-8550","documentHash":"ffc90bcc-a04f-4418-b3b9-b1544ac5b994"},{"objectId":"5e70929d878c28a047399320","name":"Adam","lastName":"Weinert","uuid":"F98B903CCE841A764CD22D71A675117E41BF09233CC70B13874E47BBEEB9645A3A85F8ED2527FA8709595DE24DA9A0E52F8DCAF84FFA7BF2B56C8FFF982A3DEF","orcidId":"0000-0002-8697-8944","documentHash":"e6df1123-06f5-4698-892f-5c41f70c32be"},{"objectId":"5e709271878c28a047395bef","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kalinowska","uuid":"AECBAB24019026DBD8B4D9DC8EFF2DE73284E9EABCD3BD8683E23A730F4A918AD9AE18E943B51313308CCA5DA2ABC99F99B455F4CC111B2CAB22C123899C43D0","orcidId":"0000-0002-4723-3261","documentHash":"8424a781-7e9b-472f-9b68-804ca372f241"}],"doi":"10.35808/ersj/3570"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cyber security","Explainable AI (xAI)","machine learning"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de37","uid":"b-PdnZEwPPqnj7lgYIEYVlw","uuid":"ad77ae28-a912-4f87-8be3-40ac466442c8","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de37","parentUuid":"ad77ae28-a912-4f87-8be3-40ac466442c8","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de37","rootUuid":"ad77ae28-a912-4f87-8be3-40ac466442c8","name":"Politechnika Bydgoska im.

It does introduce the Interior Architectural Design for Adaptive Reuse (IADfAR) conceptual framework. This design scheme is based on the acquisition of the selected reclaimed building products, originally making the structural elements of building or its external finishes, from the refurbished or demolished buildings, and followed by their transfer into indoor environment to form the interior constitutive components. This article discusses the main assumptions and requirements of the proposed conceptual design framework, which covers the transformation of the secondary building products into the new valuable building substance. It identifies the two perspectives from which the design model then is to be analysed. The study examines the substance context, which refers to the material potential of pre-used building products, in particular the sustainability-related problems of retaining or resources effectiveness. Then, the immaterial context, relating to intangible values represented by the salvaged building products featuring the structure of interior components, is examined. It comprises the questions of the users’ perception of interior components as being specific compound products absorbing the pre-used building products, cultural references, as well as users’ emotional engagement.

For clarifying the nature and mechanisms of the drug-matrix interactions the salicylic acid (SAL) molecule was selected as the model active ESIPT compound, whose physicochemical properties in different media are well understood. The solute-solvent interactions (non-specific (dipole-dipole) versus specific (hydrogen bonding) molecular interactions of DIF and SAL with different neat solvents) were investigated using the steady-state spectroscopic technique. The solvent effect on spectral behaviours of DIF and SAL was analyzed based on the parametric solvent scales. In order to identify functional groups in the PVA matrices, determine the structure present in the studied molecule-PVA system and thus obtain information about the potential interactions between PVA and the studied molecules, the Raman spectra of pure PVA, SAL-PVA and DIF-PVA systems were measured. It has been shown that the molecular structure of the active substance entrapped in the polymer matrix affects the structure of the polymer, i.e., isotactic (SAL-PVA) versus syndiotactic (DIF-PVA) structure. The analysis of drug release kinetics revealed that the DIF is more strongly bound to PVA in comparison to SAL, which confirms conclusions drawn from the analysis of the Raman spectra i.e., the isotactic structure of SAL-PVA material results in a faster initial release process of weakly bound, located on the surface of the polymer SAL molecules."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060222595","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"284","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.saa.2022.121802","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70947d878c28a0473be541","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Lewkowicz","uuid":"EA1C04A9BFEA7D269822DE4A7B8BD6D62B33BA7061D6D1C453BF7713A86A99A329710C17CDC65184E3968E72DA0DDD9EBFA210EB838D626EE30AC4B7AA0DC74C","orcidId":"0000-0002-4308-2291","documentHash":"bc45a0dc-c284-4b50-a227-82ebab7b3fb4"},{"objectId":"5e709368878c28a0473a8f7c","name":"Marta","lastName":"Miotke-Wasilczyk","uuid":"A64AD83C68CE180DFB6087EB54A2CCDE860F363CFFD2AF5978AD8178413E06B8674BEBE93B4C711F70FE71BF0F1AA63F793312D10C2AD0E9B8BF644B48F06C18","orcidId":"0000-0002-0507-6800","documentHash":"ddff3918-6a36-400a-a127-bf2ca586ded1"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b41a","name":"Marek","lastName":"Józefowicz","uuid":"F784B472D8A0ADB3CB9DF85342E31FA71534E7E8644765E70CC39DBCE35708E977B07C62C66C50D902B2B9CF7FCBA6ED293D46BEEEB5D9685331B32B52B06245","orcidId":"0000-0002-0607-986X","documentHash":"b72586fc-da87-4ef1-a293-71b8537b3c9a"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a04739382c","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Kwela","uuid":"5FEE184E4CAE2E6F7AB12469E9772C94BB178979A409206C39C10A58069EBDC9012B73424598660BBA86F7478AE9D101603551289D60D9500D8032B9EA11DBF4","orcidId":"0000-0002-3334-602X","documentHash":"b1249a71-7aac-4e7e-a0c3-62d0c151d262"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.saa.2022.121802"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5f5c1eac752340073806a9b7","uid":"bQguJlY7YSAbsff0rfgVzVQ","uuid":"89dfd9c7-5576-465d-8936-c50bea28c963","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział

is highly important to determine eigenvalues before and after certain extreme events that may cause damage accumulation, such as earthquake, blasts and mining or seismic tests on research models. Unique experiment design and shake table testing was performed to investigate seismic performance of a 3D RC building model with infill walls and advanced protection with polyurethane-based joints and fiber polymer reinforced light and emergency jackets. For the purpose of wider experimental activities, three methods for determination of the dynamic characteristics were used during multiple successive shake table tests following a dynamic pushover approach, and they are presented in detail. They are: inertance function through impact hammer tests, standard Fourier transformation of measured acceleration time history and digital image correlation. The expected differences in the results are related to the type and intensity of excitation used, the involvement of materials with different mechanical and physical properties, and with the different rate and extent of damage accumulation, as well as to local or global measurements. Y et, all methods lead to reliable results when a consistent methodology is being used, that takes into account locality or globality of measurements, leaving a choice for the most suitable one, depending on the site conditions. The inertance function method presented manifested its high efficiency in analysis of dynamic properties of large-scale structures and in monitoring of their changes caused by the damage and repair process. It offers quite a wide range of useful information, does not require very expensive equipment and its transportation cost is negligible. This method seems to be a proper diagnostic tool for simple experimental modal analysis of real structures and their structural elements, where detection of changes in the structural condition and in dynamic properties is required, also as a non-destructive testing and monitoring method. Digital image correlation proved to be a promising non-contact tool, strongly supporting the conventional instrumentation of shake table testing, while the Fourier transformation was used as a benchmark method yielding the most reliable results."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060222610","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"71","pagesFromTo":"[1-13]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/bpasts/144573#tabs","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67687218fdbe837ab14d059a","name":"Vachan","lastName":"Vanian","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e90c4d79-88f1-4970-8ada-cf60eea47a63"},{"objectId":"67687218fdbe837ab14d0599","name":"Theodoros","lastName":"Rousakis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"71d883c6-4ba4-40cd-ad7f-67ab10b7204e"},{"objectId":"67687218fdbe837ab14d0598","name":"Omer Faruk","lastName":"Halici","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"34523fcc-1fd8-4aa1-a5a2-21d2e58fc039"},{"objectId":"67687218fdbe837ab14d0597","name":"Antonio","lastName":"Soklarovski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1e167c15-cd71-444f-803b-54a11160f64b"},{"objectId":"67687218fdbe837ab14d0596","name":"Filip","lastName":"Manojlovski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"810dd44a-06d2-46d0-b466-3d68f9ae4cdc"},{"objectId":"67687218fdbe837ab14d0595","name":"Matija","lastName":"Gams","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eede4681-5bcc-42c8-91a5-f6590e45d56d"},{"objectId":"67687218fdbe837ab14d0594","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Tekieli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a6a0acda-0cbc-4755-8617-46292dbe8181"},{"objectId":"67687218fdbe837ab14d0593","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Bogdanovic","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2601be91-e041-4312-823a-77c0aa5d3195"},{"objectId":"67687218fdbe837ab14d0592","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Chełmecki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fa273921-0261-4988-87be-1baf8dff06e3"},{"objectId":"67687218fdbe837ab14d0591","name":"Zoran","lastName":"Rakicevic","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4cb9da77-74af-4611-9345-8810bd1528a4"},{"objectId":"5e709397878c28a0473ad6b6","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Kwiecień","uuid":"53543722898AD8F1A8460F9C0F11C0EF36244977978DF027D793849F815DDE6E8F5F38C5CE736A930880320D76BA5241CDBB3F80B11370A8FACA3C04DBD240CD","orcidId":"0000-0002-6169-5585","documentHash":"4c9b79f1-dbd0-46d0-9d7f-bc012df73458"},{"objectId":"5e709396878c28a0473ad669","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Krajewski","uuid":"F0C9F553AF6910DEED03CAD9E489894FA792B43EAFDEF400121F698915DE7D0AA5FAB815FB54672D446209449564E2C14497F7DC53080ACAB5C4D2EECF8F6FF4","orcidId":"0000-0002-4695-2977","documentHash":"d626a678-eea9-48dd-9f84-b99c46a04740"},{"objectId":"5e709396878c28a0473ad617","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Hojdys","uuid":"6ADDAFD6A1554C969164505CC49ECAF90FE664A55A203893CCC29E61689CDFA9002997181ADC0B780F6E53875F81A2A09379CB4956957A8A412B4ED9200C56B2","orcidId":"0000-0002-4977-4715","documentHash":"a8e7fbfc-e11b-4d91-a236-98f3e576929f"}],"doi":"10.24425/bpasts.2023.144940"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de91","uid":"bCyqGrQUiCnB8dh-M4N_AzQ","uuid":"218e39fb-d7f2-405a-a114-dbb87dc59898","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de91","parentUuid":"218e39fb-d7f2-405a-a114-dbb87dc59898","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de91","rootUuid":"218e39fb-d7f2-405a-a114-dbb87dc59898","name":"Centrum Astronomiczne im.

The colliding ejecta of successive RN events are predicted to always generate very large (tens of parsecs) super-remnants; only two examples are currently known. T CrB offers an excellent opportunity to test this prediction. As it will almost certainly undergo its next, once in ∼80 yr RN event between 2024 and 2026, we carried out very deep narrowband and continuum imaging to search for the predicted, piled-up ejecta of the past millennia. While nothing is detected in continuum or narrowband [O iii] images, a ∼30 pc diameter, faint nebulosity surrounding T CrB is clearly present in deep Hα, [N ii], and [S ii] narrowband Condor Array Telescope imagery. We predict that these newly detected nebulosities, as well as the recent ejecta that have not yet reached the super-remnant, are far too optically thin to capture all but a tiny fraction of the photons emitted by RN flashes. We thus predict that fluorescent light echoes will not be detectable following the imminent nova flash of T CrB. Dust may be released by the T CrB red giant wind in preeruption outbursts, but we have no reliable estimates of its quantity or geometrical distribution.

We consider two\nfamilies of boson stars supported by quartic and sixth-order self-interaction potentials, and choose three\nsamples of each of them in growing compactness; only those with large enough compactness are\ncapable to hold light rings, namely, null bound orbits. For the hot spots, using inclination angles\nθ ¼ f20°; 50°; 80°g we find a secondary track plunge-through image of photons crossing the interior of\nthe boson star, which can be further decomposed into additional images if the star is compact enough.\nFor accretion disks we find that the latter class of stars actually shows a sequence of additional\nsecondary images in agreement with the hot-spot analysis, a feature absent in typical black hole spacetimes. Furthermore, we also find a shadowlike central brightness depression for some of these stars in\nboth axial observations and at the inclination angles above.

Józefa Tischnera, jedynie sporadycznie sygnalizują znaczenie antropologiczne  i  metafizyczne  związku  słowa  i  miłości.  Tymczasem,  w  moim  przekonaniu,  związek ten jest bardzo ważny w przedstawionym przez tych dwóch filozofów źródłowym rozumieniu  ludzkiego  istnienia  jako  wydarzania  się  prawdy  bycia  człowieka.  Dlatego  w  niniejszym  opracowaniu  koncentruję  się właśnie na opisie tego związku,  na  tym,  jak  on  funkcjonuje  w  myśleniu  dialogicznym  tych  dwóch  filozofów.  Z  filozoficznego  punktu  widzenia  jest  on  godny  uwagi  przede  wszystkim  z  tej  racji,  że  pokazuje  jak  tętni życiem  filozofia  człowieka  w  swym  metafizycznym wymiarze. Inaczej mówiąc, więź słowa i miłości pokazuje, jak istnieje dialogicznie  ugruntowana  metafizyka  człowieka  w  jej  wydarzeniowym  charakterze.  Słowo  i  miłość żyją w człowieku jak obiektywne, a zarazem subiektywne, czyli podmiotowe wyrazy jego duchowego życia.  Poświęcając  uwagę  tej  problematyce,  wskazałem  nie  tylko  na  podobieństwa  antropologii  tych  dwóch  filozofów,  lecz  wykazałem  przede  wszystkim,  że  wyeksponowana  przez  nich  więź słowa i miłości  stanowi  ważny  klucz  do  odnowienia  źródłowego  myślenia o człowieku  w  dobie  zachwiania się pewności tego, co najbardziej podstawowe w jego życiu."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The studies – and not only Polish ones – which have been conducted in the field of the philosophy of man that we encounter in the works of Ferdinand Ebner and Rev. Józef Tischner – two outstanding representatives of the 20th-century dialogic thinking – in fact only occasionally and merely signal the anthropological and metaphysical significance of the relationship between the word and love. However, in my opinion, this relationship is extremely important in the originary understanding of human existence, which these two philosophers present as the occurrence of the truth about man’s existence. Therefore, in the present study I focus my attention precisely on describing this relationship, and the way it functions in the dialogic thinking of these two philosophers. From a philosophical point of view, it is noteworthy above all because it shows how vibrant philosophy of man is in its metaphysical dimension. In other words, the link between the word and love shows the mode of existence of the dialogically-grounded metaphysics of man in its occurrence-related character. The word and love live in man as objective and at the same time subjective expressions of his spiritual life. In the present article, as I pay attention to these issues, I will not only point to the similarities in the anthropology of these two philosophers, but I will show, above all, that the relationship between the word and love that they expose is an important\nkey to renewing originary thinking about man in the day and age when certainty about what is most fundamental in his life is being shaken."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060222636","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"72","pagesFromTo":"129-153","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://czasopisma.ignatianum.edu.pl/rfi/issue/view/2024.3003","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afd18","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Jagiełło","uuid":"568FF77218E6B69BDF21076965D70A7C72CB7200288D6CDB0FEC22DA568848237EC4C76013F18F97E5A36797B1D53B508013604D80C13A1A50641EE33D277C22","orcidId":"0000-0001-7420-2973","documentHash":"3c5826b9-0751-4cb4-aefe-fc737440c72c"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["gatunek","genologia germanistyczna","genologia polonistyczna","wzorzec tekstu","badania kontrastywne"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["genres","German genology","Polish genology","contrastive textology","linguistic traditions"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709229878c28a047390e21","5e709216878c28a04738fb61","5e709227878c28a047390c97"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Zastosowania dorobku metodologicznego Marii Wojtak w badaniach genologicznych i kontrastywnych w obszarze germanistycznym","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a536","mniswId":"200434","title":"Studia Medioznawcze","doi":"","issn":"2451-1617","eissn":"","websiteLink":"studiamedioznawcze@uw.edu.pl","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"1d49fd93-fc97-4833-950d-2ac2e1d807ba"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2023-04-06","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6465de1b4097074d0a8fb268","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709216878c28a04738fb61","5e709227878c28a047390c97","5e709229878c28a047390e21"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Opracowanie ma na celu skonfrontowanie i ukazanie wykorzystania wybranych dokonań Marii Wojtak w zakresie opisu kategorii wzorca gatunkowego i analiz genologicznych w pracach germanistycznych i kontrastywnych.

Results and conclusions: The contrasting view of concepts stemming from two different linguistic traditions makes it possible to elucidate the phenomena described in the paper from different perspectives, which,  on  the  one  hand,  appears  as  a  challenge  regarding  the  research  process,  but,  on  the  other,  may  indicate  new  directions  of  exploration,  trigger  inspiration  or  research  impulses  leading  to  creative  methodological  refl ection.

It points out similarities and differences in the methodology of genological concepts and their application, it familiarizes the Readers with the study of the above-mentioned literary cultures, inspiring further research in this area."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060222638","journalIssue":{"objectId":"643fbfca4097073cb69ae949","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"24","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"ee636ee6-d159-46ac-8964-503f1044d327"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"55-69","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"Applications of Maria Wojtak’s Methodological Achievements in Genological and Contrastive Research in German Studies"}],"publicUri":"https://studiamedioznawcze.eu/index.php/studiamedioznawcze/article/download/737/600","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709229878c28a047390e21","name":"Anna","lastName":"Hanus","uuid":"DB3AC2C5B30CE205FE6C2640D777014F82541E079A19E0029F75AA168E3F789DFB674818FC978ED0DE30D6A2C87E180D00BFFA0AF611D240BB2EE8AB67AF201F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5850-2511","documentHash":"adb1823e-b909-47fc-8cfa-51e6b3be6b2d"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390c97","name":"Zofia","lastName":"Bilut-Homplewicz","uuid":"56EEA75DC88C95EABFE1BA1E7F0C16B473318EE42DBBCCBF191398B79FF9E1F3BBAF7095CFD8196D986B5F46929480662B2069985121EF88682197BA099B0050","orcidId":"0000-0001-6445-9679","documentHash":"28214ef8-97ad-4194-999a-1d1a2129bcc5"},{"objectId":"5e709216878c28a04738fb61","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Mac","uuid":"A9D7F8A42676BCD46E33AC42DEEE9CA55AC217358258F1353519246C8C5B6BCCA1DD0CDD7351A65D70CEDBD0EFCF859DA4DEA7A15E82BFF5883EE3410E8DA9A1","orcidId":"0000-0002-2670-6656","documentHash":"57a35064-7692-4a09-bdb7-09a4c3ee0720"}],"doi":"10.33077/uw.24511617.sm.2023.1.737"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70921d878c28a04739023b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Między fikcją a prawdą o wojnie w Wietnamie.

During a naturalistic driving study in Poland major mistakes associated with signage were noticed and analysed: road works were announced and speed limits were reduced from 120 km/h to 70−80 km/h, but no road construction could be found. Measurements of drivers’ speed showed their complete disregard of the limitations: average speed of light vehicles remained at 113 km/h and lorries at 88 km/h. Assessment of the encountered 683 road signs revealed 12.5% of them to be inadequate (10.9% falsely informed drivers). Evaluation of contrast ratio of road markings (their replacement was the claimed reason for road work) showed low values both before and after replacement (Weber contrast 0.6). It is hypothesised that erroneous road signage and its contradiction with the visible road features are contributing to the permanent disobedience of traffic rules in Poland and are decreasing road safety."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060222653","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"385-396","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://sciendo.com/article/10.2478/ttj-2023-0030","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"676877e5fdbe837ab150cc36","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Piegza","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dc87d345-a04a-48b0-b250-911c7e963879"},{"objectId":"676877e5fdbe837ab150cc35","name":"Antoni","lastName":"Krawiec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cac10edf-92dc-426a-bb0d-6de5702e0c06"},{"objectId":"676877e5fdbe837ab150cc34","name":"Tomasz E.","lastName":"Burghardt","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b0714d81-9e86-415c-a5ce-233fcc2a6eb3"},{"objectId":"676877e5fdbe837ab150cc33","name":"Anton","lastName":"Pashkevich","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"963be966-f188-44aa-9ad6-a7e39d3bfa54"},{"objectId":"5e709247878c28a047392df8","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Żakowska","uuid":"697AFC52A7847730E12B58275981FE9D8D57BDF1CA6AD9CD4B5525082060E9DD26E25FD576A717EAE026480C43BD58BF2B404B453C0C9152AC6452EFFADBA162","orcidId":"0000-0001-7806-3886","documentHash":"edeeeca6-b3a0-4385-8c7e-629e6ca66393"}],"doi":"10.2478/ttj-2023-0030"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA2MDIyMjY1Mw=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
