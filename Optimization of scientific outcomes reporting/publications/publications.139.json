infection is still spreading worldwide, and new antiviral therapies are an urgent need to complement the approved vaccine preparations. SARS-CoV-2 nps13 helicase is a validated drug target participating in the viral replication complex and possessing two associated activities: RNA unwinding and 5'-triphosphatase. In the search of SARS-CoV-2 direct antiviral agents, we established biochemical assays for both SARS-CoV-2 nps13-associated enzyme activities and screened both in silico and in vitro a small in-house library of natural compounds. Myricetin, quercetin, kaempferol, and flavanone were found to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 nps13 unwinding activity at nanomolar concentrations, while licoflavone C was shown to block both SARS-CoV-2 nps13 activities at micromolar concentrations. Mode of action studies showed that all compounds are nsp13 noncompetitive inhibitors versus ATP, while computational studies suggested that they can bind both nucleotide and 5'-RNA nsp13 binding sites, with licoflavone C showing a unique pattern of interaction with nsp13 amino acid residues. Overall, we report for the first time natural flavonoids as selective inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 nps13 helicase with low micromolar activity."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058261885","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63342c3b4097070fbdd68f22","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"5","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"bdcd2a2e-cfd3-4913-92c9-af32ad2c5174"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"5","pagesFromTo":"226-239","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsptsci.1c00253","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63342c3b4097070fbdd68f2f","name":"Enzo","lastName":"Tramontano","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f7a74d8d-9862-439a-9821-9a10f0827820"},{"objectId":"63342c3b4097070fbdd68f2e","name":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Summa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1b0921f9-5a58-4f99-87a3-85a2d60c3c73"},{"objectId":"63342c3b4097070fbdd68f2d","name":"Andrea

not only is an essential micronutrient for mammals but also marks itself as important in organic synthesis, especially in the field of catalysis. Various useful reactions, such as alkene hydroformylation, hydrogenation, heterofunctionalizations of carbon–carbon double bonds, C–H activation, and cross-coupling reactions, have been realized with the aid of this metal. At the same time, cobalt deserves special attention as a catalyst for radical processes; in fact, in the form of vitamin B12, it was designed by Nature as a reversible carrier for radicals. Since this molecule is a native Co-complex, it is very attractive for the development of sustainable transformations, and it has already been demonstrated that vitamin B12 and its derivatives mediate numerous reactions that have found applications in both the construction of complex molecules and the degradation of polyhalogenated pollutants. However, in this Perspective, we focus the readers’ attention on radical C–C bond forming reactions catalyzed by vitamin B12, which are particularly important as a tool for the synthesis of important molecules in a greener manner. We also ponder over the challenges that remain to be addressed and the solutions that are expected to come."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058261888","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6224b9ac2467f03fd93109ce","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"0a0b03df-0dc9-4470-92f1-6614e0d8a924"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"6517-6531","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acscatal.2c01596","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6108eb619543c7220b70a956","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Wdowik","uuid":"1BBCCB66486E497D2D16141D4396E2ECF5C3C172D0D69F7AE17811346D2125E3E18F1889C638ED09FC13B06F40465845FCC837048345202A0B08C193F6584EDD","orcidId":"0000-0002-9840-1501","documentHash":"3f978145-7abc-460a-89c0-396a6475f18e"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa965","name":"Dorota","lastName":"GRYKO","uuid":"440D7FFFC856B88CBDC67281FC8AC11A142B7F0C34B6FDF5562B68562072290C05AF821761D28C4CD31C5EBA77D02F0F687A64A3BB73ABCD7D421672A9DD7C1D","orcidId":"0000-0002-5197-4222","documentHash":"6bd7ccda-1d32-4e93-88d3-704aed0c678d"}],"doi":"10.1021/acscatal.2c01596"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["tractive force","thrust force","normal reaction","geometric parameters","traction-transportation vehicle"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61ae2b552467f00bc8cce46a","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Dnipro State Agrarian and Economic University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62974e3b40970702be5279e1"]},{"id":"61a780062467f03711e73e7c","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Dmytro Motornyi Tavria State Agrotechnological University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62974e3b40970702be5279e0","62974e3b40970702be5279df"]},{"id":"61eacce52467f06f09e4edce","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"State Biotechnological University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62974e3b40970702be5279dd","62974e3b40970702be5279dc","62974e3b40970702be5279db","62974e3b40970702be5279de"]},{"id":"623460e22467f00ffe950a44","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"National Academy of the National Guard of Ukraine","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62974e3b40970702be5279e3","62974e3b40970702be5279e2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Determining the influence of geometric parameters of the traction-transportation vehicle's frame on its tractive capacity and energy indicators","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62974e3b40970702be5279d6","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62974e3b40970702be5279db","62974e3b40970702be5279dc","62974e3b40970702be5279dd","62974e3b40970702be5279de","62974e3b40970702be5279df","62974e3b40970702be5279e0","62974e3b40970702be5279e1","62974e3b40970702be5279e2","62974e3b40970702be5279e3"]},"issue":"7 (116)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper reports results of studying the influence of geometrical parameters of the frame in a traction-transportation vehicle on its traction and energy indicators. A method for estimating the influence of geometrical parameters of the frame in a traction-transportation vehicle on its traction and energy indicators has been substantiated, based on the traction calculation of the tractor and taking into consideration the change in the distance from the hinge of the traction-transportation vehicle to the front and rear drive axles. The method makes it possible to determine the normal reactions, tangent thrust forces, and traction power on the wheels of the machine. The method reported here enables defining the optimal geometric parameters for improving the traction-adhesion and fuel-economic indicators of the traction-transportation vehicle. It was theoretically established that the normal reactions on the front wheels of the studied traction-transportation vehicle are 27,800 N and exceed by 1.95 times the normal reactions on the rear wheels of 14,200 N. This is due to the fact that the distance from the hinge to the corresponding axles of the wheels is 1.89 m and 0.97 m. Increasing the distance from the hinge to the axle of the rear wheels to 1.17 m produces a positive effect on improving the tractive performance of the traction-transportation vehicle. There is an increase in the tractive power on rear wheels to 24.39 kW. The experimental study of the traction-transportation vehicle was performed using an all-wheel-drive machine with a hinge-connected frame as an example. The maximum traction power is 121 kW, which is achieved at a speed of 12 km/h, traction efficiency of 0.68, and a thrust force per hook of 30.2 kN. The difference between the results obtained theoretically and experimentally is 8 %. Applying the method could make it possible to provide designers and manufacturers with recommendations for the construction and improvement of a traction-transportation vehicle, to improve traction and adhesion properties, and reduce the anthropogenic impact on the soil"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058261890","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62973b4740970702be51694e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"7 (116)","doi":"","documentHash":"86c274e0-ae46-4b8d-bb73-12547b3a99dd"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"60-67","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/254688/252856","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62974e3b40970702be5279e3","name":"Ivan","lastName":"Tsebriuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4246-8854","documentHash":"3aec4c72-944e-4366-96f0-ad6713392303"},{"objectId":"62974e3b40970702be5279e2","name":"Sergey","lastName":"Diundik","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3558-0028","documentHash":"2b15a12a-a6e9-4e22-b3bd-4a41bc8a306d"},{"objectId":"62974e3b40970702be5279e1","name":"Nataliia","lastName":"Ponomarenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8263-2914","documentHash":"5ef1e352-7362-49f6-ae5f-08a818fa678b"},{"objectId":"62974e3b40970702be5279e0","name":"Serhii","lastName":"Sushko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2933-2573","documentHash":"acc2e87b-131b-40de-9f56-74a21dbcbf83"},{"objectId":"62974e3b40970702be5279df","name":"Ivan","lastName":"Chyzhykov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3022-4828","documentHash":"c1042dac-27e8-4727-8b6f-9a1ed216899a"},{"objectId":"62974e3b40970702be5279de","name":"Halyna","lastName":"Cherevatenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8972-3875","documentHash":"efed4520-991a-4975-84c5-597adf31befe"},{"objectId":"62974e3b40970702be5279dd","name":"Аnton","lastName":"Nykyforov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7788-8878","documentHash":"cbfc18be-19a1-42ef-a832-3c8a571091d2"},{"objectId":"62974e3b40970702be5279dc","name":"Ivan","lastName":"Halych","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9137-036X","documentHash":"92a7057b-ec96-447e-9c9e-9bad84e367b5"},{"objectId":"62974e3b40970702be5279db","name":"Roman","lastName":"Antoshchenkov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0769-7464","documentHash":"5e7d68f8-4507-4a51-b951-f168958dc41e"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.254688"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A Sustainable Transport System -

Celem badań było poznanie wpływu terminu siewu na plonowanie i opłacalność produkcji pszenicy ozimej i jarej w stanowisku po buraku cukrowym zbieranym późną jesienią. Oceniono plony ziarna, koszty bezpośrednie i efekty ekonomiczne produkcji pszenicy. Stwierdzono, że poziom plonów ziarna zależał od lokalnych warunków, a koszty i opłacalność produkcji od cen zakupu środków produkcji (nasion, nawozów i środków ochrony roślin) i cen zbytu ziarna pszenicy. Plony ziarna były znacznie zróżnicowane w poszczególnych miejscowościach. Na plonowanie pszenicy wpływały istotnie warunki pogodowe; w warunkach dużych niedoborów wilgoci (opadów) przeciętny poziom plonów był najniższy (ok. 4,5 t∙ha–1), a w korzystnych warunkach pogodowych osiągano plony najwyższe (ok. 6,5 t∙ha–1). W badanych lokalizacjach siew pszenicy jarej wiosną prowadził do obniżki plonów ziarna (o 0,8–1,5 t∙ha–1) w porównaniu z osiąganymi w warunkach siewu jesiennego. Na opłacalność produkcji pszenicy wpływał również dobór jej odmiany. W strukturze bezpośrednich kosztów produkcji na ogół przeważały nawozy mineralne, a mniejszy udział miały nasiona i środki ochrony roślin. Wyniki badań wskazują, że ze względu na wielkość plonu ziarna i efekty ekonomiczne produkcji bardziej jest uzasadniona uprawa pszenicy jarej (przewódkowej), wysiewanej późną jesienią niż wiosną."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058261894","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"77","pagesFromTo":"91-103","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://czasopisma.up.lublin.pl/index.php/as/article/view/4599","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a0473991c5","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Sułek","uuid":"47ACFBA3DEE7E598924D9CA19219D6C9CD647210F29DFE3DC51F80E7B6CE01E5361E788F08593E49ED397DAAE6105909997B0F622B462EBFC667C09EE3BEE0C7","orcidId":"0000-0002-7175-5713","documentHash":"544d8c7f-9cb2-45d4-973c-dc88337ccb57"},{"objectId":"5e709298878c28a047398b4d","name":"Adam","lastName":"Harasim","uuid":"B603953283578670AB02804AA10DAB6F4DBD7DCBB1D9F8F9C8EC9D5D03C33F14E3EA9527A822832D0C2E69FEEC3EF5D08D69598B3647BB9173F50AC6E0E506E6","orcidId":"0000-0001-6395-1661","documentHash":"56dbe821-26d3-4973-844c-4860d9221225"}],"doi":"10.24326/as.2022.2.8"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["encefalografia","EEG","BCI"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["encefalography","EEG","BCI"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"632d91db4097073ab883f178","doi":null,"title":"Sztuczna inteligencja oraz nowe rozwiązania w zarządzaniu w naukach technicznych","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-67104-57-9","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://bc.wydawnictwo-tygiel.pl/publikacja/18AE1B82-6C54-A1C4-CE20-261E5E950CD8","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"a2d9796e-a81d-47ae-87ca-3b68fbf50702","publisher":{"objectId":"610809959543c70b144e702c","mniswId":"85900","name":"Wydawnictwo Naukowe TYGIEL Sp. z o. o.","documentHash":"0d57bd73-1897-49e3-a7d9-d36929fd7806"},"openAccess":{"mode":"PUBLISHER_WEBSITE","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2022-09-15","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null}},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de69","uid":"b8lEq4e8f8p1V09_nBsO4Ew","uuid":"7b1ecf5e-1c1d-40d0-91a9-cbde801c4409","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de69","parentUuid":"7b1ecf5e-1c1d-40d0-91a9-cbde801c4409","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de69","rootUuid":"7b1ecf5e-1c1d-40d0-91a9-cbde801c4409","name":"Akademia Bialska im.

To this end, radial and tangential elastic ligaments are introduced into the estimation scheme, which make it possible to simulate elastic soil pressure, as well as friction forces that occur when the soil comes into contact with the pipe.\n\nThe deformed state of the transport structure \"embankment-fiberglass pipe\" was calculated by the method of forces and by a finite-element method under the action of load from the railroad rolling stock, taking into consideration the different cross-sections of the pipe.\n\nIt has been established that with an increase in the diameter of the fiberglass pipe, the value of deformations of the subgrade and fiberglass pipe increases. With a pipe diameter of 1.0 m, the deformation value in the vaulted pipe is 2.12 mm, and with a pipe diameter of 3.6 m – 4.16 mm.

Our construction follows the topological description of brain activity, where particles (neurons) are activated by an external environment, represented by a topological space X with an open cover {Ui:i∈I}. The brain builds the model of this external space via the nerve (trace) of a topological space X. Here the body of Physarum polycephalum or a swarm made of networks of tubular structures represents a nerve (trace) of X also which means that Physarum polycephalum or a swarm gains orientation in the space of external stimuli even in the absence of any neural system. The logic of living organisms is based on open subsets of X and thus can be represented by Heyting algebra (i.e. intuitionistically). We also consider the generalisation of the nerve construction to a categorical context, where the category is determined by the network structures of multi-agent biological system. This model can be generalised up to simulating the behaviour of any swarm by means of intuitionistic logic."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058261904","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ef241c4097075fda3e5384","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"16","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"d67fcec6-cebe-41e9-a168-ee5eb8aa25e3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"671–687","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11787-022-00319-3.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6356308a4097076f28bb41ae","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Bielas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"29686c67-3984-498d-b538-09a86bfc0751"},{"objectId":"5e7092ea878c28a04739f15a","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Król","uuid":"8B7BF643A3638515A926A966872556229D400A0D2B121DEE85C03210E336426E1F7CBE33842546FE832528D6CF4B41932523D63EA1586CE6B9C2CB7A14C687B5","orcidId":"0000-0002-7296-7355","documentHash":"814b8c2a-bdc9-448e-b55b-38760802e593"},{"objectId":"5e7091f3878c28a04738d99c","name":"Andrew","lastName":"Schumann","uuid":"3E4E2600E696286D3659269155619454708345463C127B33E66F54CAC273AA0F5C430DC6B012AB7AEE1D11D963989F1753840EE57F530ABEA28C797C89FC86C5","orcidId":"0000-0002-9944-8627","documentHash":"ead61411-c552-483c-869f-3ee6cde267bf"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11787-022-00319-3"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["safety","road bridge","stress condition","technical inspection","static and dynamic tests"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"62344e682467f00ffe947de1","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Academy of Logistics and Transport","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62973f3740970702be51a3d0","62973f3740970702be51a3cc","62973f3740970702be51a3cb","62973f3740970702be51a3ce","62973f3740970702be51a3cd","62973f3740970702be51a3cf"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Influence of the deformed state of a road bridge on operational safety","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62973f3740970702be51a3c9","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62973f3740970702be51a3cb","62973f3740970702be51a3cc","62973f3740970702be51a3cd","62973f3740970702be51a3ce","62973f3740970702be51a3cf","62973f3740970702be51a3d0"]},"issue":"7 (116)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article deals with the issues of vehicle traffic safety on artificial constructions. Ensuring safety in the field of rail transport is an essential element in the activities of all subjects of the market of railway services, including passenger carriers. To fully study the issues of the deformed state of beam superstructures, it is necessary to conduct static and dynamic tests. Before the start of the tests, it is mandatory to check the technical condition of the artificial structure:\n\n1) visual inspection, special checks with verification of necessary parameters;\n\n2) carrying out control linear measurements;\n\n3) selective determination of concrete strength by non-destructive methods.\n\nFirst, the static tests is conducted to determine the total deformations of each beam of the superstructure at the control point with maximum deformations of ½ L. Then dynamic tests with determination of periods of natural oscillations and deformations (stresses). Processing of the results of surveys and tests of the overpass with an assessment of the possibility of passing design loads on the road bridge, after which a dynamic passport of the transport structure is compiled. The study of the stressed state of vehicles gives a clear idea of the causes of deformations in the structural elements when analyzing the work of the span of the automobile bridge in conditions of increasing axial loads and traffic flow speeds. Deformation processes lead to defects, structural failures and accidents on the vehicle, which leads to premature wear, material damage and environmental damage. Periodic measurements of deformations (stresses) of the superstructure structure over several years will make it possible to predict changes in its condition over time and determine the remaining resource in terms of load-bearing capacity and load capacity. As a result of experimental studies, it was proved that the presented technique, developed in the classical version for detecting structural defects between a single-layer coating and a base of various types, can also work effectively in the case of non-destructive testing of multilayer structures"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058261906","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62973b4740970702be51694e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"7 (116)","doi":"","documentHash":"86c274e0-ae46-4b8d-bb73-12547b3a99dd"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"29-34","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/255275/252852","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62973f3740970702be51a3d0","name":"Assem","lastName":"Akbayeva","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0446-6003","documentHash":"fd91146f-b232-4bf2-bb54-272914cb1e5d"},{"objectId":"62973f3740970702be51a3cf","name":"Aliya","lastName":"Izbairova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-1727-7498","documentHash":"a5ecb420-4be1-406c-80ec-1db14fb19498"},{"objectId":"62973f3740970702be51a3ce","name":"Saule","lastName":"Bekzhanova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6272-9567","documentHash":"58f861c1-5756-4d0d-9898-5d34490803b6"},{"objectId":"62973f3740970702be51a3cd","name":"Dinara","lastName":"Aldekeyeva","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7671-8383","documentHash":"1a90624e-067f-4344-b43f-fac325d916cb"},{"objectId":"62973f3740970702be51a3cc","name":"Mikhail","lastName":"Kvashnin","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3969-9299","documentHash":"2f0acd33-2966-401c-bb8c-496681dce964"},{"objectId":"62973f3740970702be51a3cb","name":"Ivan","lastName":"Bondar","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7376-5643","documentHash":"b2d8efb3-79b8-4a56-8ff9-843f925630f3"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.255275"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ab878c28a0473aecc3","5e709217878c28a04738fd14","602deceb9543c7410626e845"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The experience of the Polish real estate market as a guide to transition of real estate sector in Vietnam","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479b82","mniswId":"27946","title":"Acta Scientiarum Polonorum.

the present study, we continue our work related to the synthesis of 1,8-naphthalimide and carborane conjugates and the investigation of their anticancer activity and DNA-binding ability. For this purpose, a series of 4-carboranyl-1,8-naphthalimide derivatives, mitonafide, and pinafide analogs were synthesized using click chemistry, reductive amination, amidation, and Mitsunobu reactions. The calf thymus DNA (ct-DNA)-binding properties of the synthesized compounds were investigated by circular dichroism (CD), UV–vis spectroscopy, and thermal denaturation experiments. Conjugates 54–61 interacted very strongly with ct-DNA (∆Tm = 7.67–12.33 °C), suggesting their intercalation with DNA. They were also investigated for their in vitro effects on cytotoxicity, cell migration, cell death, cell cycle, and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a HepG2 cancer cell line as well as inhibition of topoisomerase IIα activity (Topo II). The cytotoxicity of these eight conjugates was in the range of 3.12–30.87 µM, with the lowest IC50 value determined for compound 57. The analyses showed that most of the conjugates could induce cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase, inhibit cell migration, and promote apoptosis. Two conjugates, namely 60 and 61, induced ROS production, which was proven by the increased level of 2′-deoxy-8-oxoguanosine in DNA.

It is the result of cooperation of academics and practitioners from major tax advisory firms as well as in-house tax experts. Political changes in Poland (electoral victory of the right-wing PiS party) coincided with changes on the global tax scene, which were associated with the BEPS project (Base Erosion and Profit Shifting), implemented by the OECD. The struggle to rebuild countries’ tax revenues began. The ambitious social policy in Poland, which involved substantial transfers of funds to the less well-off, required an increase in budget revenues. Thus, the Polish government quickly became an ardent supporter of BEPS. The radicalism of the tax policy changes raised many doubts among practitioners, who accused the authorities of excessive fiscalism. On the other hand, the legal rules previously in force did indeed poorly protect the fiscal interests of the state. The study of the Polish tax system and Polish tax policy based on the contributions collected in this volume enriches knowledge of developments in one of the largest and most rapidly changing states in Europe."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058261924","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":"Legal Area Studies","translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb76c","mniswId":"3400","name":"Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht Verlage","documentHash":"759c30c8-cdbb-4973-a218-efb42e4d8550"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://d-nb.info/1250933129","numberInSeries":"4","authors":[],"doi":"10.7767/9783205215295"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["heart rate","psychophysical state","UAV operator"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a9878c28a0473aea21","5f6ad166752340073806aa4f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Case Study of the Psychophysical State of Student-Operators During UAVO Training, Based on Heart Rate Parameter","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a054","mniswId":"24160","title":"Journal of Konbin","doi":null,"issn":"1895-8281","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"59759771-3c4b-4d01-8e02-7b4b63b3c8df"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6333eed8409707021a3d82f9","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f6ad166752340073806aa4f","5e7093a9878c28a0473aea21","615fad2875234017e0505dec"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article focuses on the human factor in UAV operations.

The theoretical foundations for the construction and practical application of the information environment of educational institutions are given, a model of an individual educational trajectory is designed, and the methodology for modeling the information environment of educational institutions based on systems theory is described. This is important, since the information environment helps to improve the efficiency and quality of the educational process through the implementation of information technology capabilities. An individual educational trajectory is considered as a process of making a decision by a student based on a system of individual values and personal meanings; contains a qualification model of a specialist in the world of professions and opportunities for the implementation of vital plans. The qualification model of a specialist includes a qualification portrait of a specialist, regulatory requirements – a set of linguistic assessments and a set of numerical assessments that meet the requirements of employers.\n\nAs a result of the study, a systematic approach was applied, which makes it possible to determine the limitations of the system's functioning, the procedure for planning activities and the system for stimulating elements of the organization. A detailed review of the main models of interaction between the elements of the organization is made: bureaucratic, democratic participation and parity compromise. The bureaucratic model is characterized by a clear hierarchy of rules and decisions, strict regulation of job descriptions. The model of democratic participation is focused on the development of creative abilities of an employee, when, performing a particular function, he expects to achieve personal goals, directing his efforts to achieve the goals of the organization.\n\nThe results of the study are aimed at an effective choice of interaction models depending on the main elements of systemic activities in educational institutions related to improving the quality of work and education"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058261935","journalIssue":{"objectId":"629632974097072fefbd1feb","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"2 (116)","doi":"","documentHash":"66306056-c4e9-4369-b4b9-5795a1b0b49e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"51-60","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/255084/252961","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629648194097072fefbdd262","name":"Zhanat","lastName":"Aitymov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0451-0644","documentHash":"bf0c3807-6841-4990-8ece-493623b6868e"},{"objectId":"629648194097072fefbdd261","name":"Agibay","lastName":"Kushumbayev","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6387-7075","documentHash":"079b74e5-fc0b-4191-9ed1-13c21c230a06"},{"objectId":"629648194097072fefbdd260","name":"Oksana","lastName":"Kopnova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6299-3728","documentHash":"7fe82763-f96b-4917-8069-42a031b45d0d"},{"objectId":"629648194097072fefbdd25f","name":"Anna","lastName":"Shaporeva","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6211-5634","documentHash":"ab9474f4-4a50-4869-9ec5-3507def4ceee"},{"objectId":"629648194097072fefbdd25e","name":"Aliya","lastName":"Aitymova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-1128-6924","documentHash":"9d2f8939-92a3-4198-be32-237a6662b873"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.255084"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Imigranci","Pracodawcy","Pracownicy","Rynek pracy","Zarządzanie"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"632dab6b4097073ab886e17b","doi":null,"title":"Fakultatywne działania prawne administracji publicznej wobec wyzwań gospodarki i marketingu w Polsce","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-67104-39-5","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://sin.akademia.mil.pl/publications/details/i7461","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"c4373b0b-3f2a-419a-8de4-7b8028ec2b13","publisher":{"objectId":"610809959543c70b144e702c","mniswId":"85900","name":"Wydawnictwo Naukowe TYGIEL Sp. z o. o.","documentHash":"0d57bd73-1897-49e3-a7d9-d36929fd7806"},"openAccess":{"mode":"PUBLISHER_WEBSITE","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2022-09-15","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null}},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","uid":"bABmAiyO82JgMB2LqzOepAg","uuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","parentUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","rootUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","name":"Akademia Sztuki Wojennej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61a98f3975234066bac87116"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Wyzwania dla zarządzania wynikające z imigracji pracowników – wybrane problemy","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"632dabe34097073ab886e475","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61a98f3975234066bac87116"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W pierwszej połowie XXI wieku migracja ludności jest jednym z najbardziej dynamicznych procesów społecznych, dotyczącym również Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej.

In computer science and mathematical examples, metaheuristic is high-level procedures or guidelines designed to find, devise, or select algorithmic research methods to obtain high-quality solutions to an example problem, especially if the information is insufficient or incomplete, or if computational capacity is limited. Many metaheuristic methods include some stochastic example operations, which means that the resulting solution is dependent on the random variables that are generated during the search. The use of higher evidence can frequently find good solutions with less computational effort than iterative methods and algorithms because it searches a broad range of feasible solutions at the same time. Therefore, metaheuristic is a useful approach to solving example problems. There are several characteristics that distinguish metaheuristic strategies for the research process. The goal is to efficiently explore the search perimeter to find the best and closest solution. The techniques that make up metaheuristic algorithms range from simple searches to complex learning processes. Eight model data sets are used to calculate the proposed approach, and there are five classification data sets and three proximate job data sets included in this set. The numerical results were compared with those of the well-known evolutionary trainer Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO). The statistical study revealed that the MOABT algorithm can outperform other algorithms in terms of avoiding local optimum and speed of convergence to global optimum. The results also show that the proposed problems can be classified and approximated with high accuracy"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058261938","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62964f434097072fefbe1a21","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"4 (116)","doi":"","documentHash":"d2dd5a43-0263-4969-a70a-5bf4d22c10eb"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"6-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/254023/252743","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62964e6a4097072fefbe11a7","name":"Kais I.","lastName":"Ibraheem","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2776-6263","documentHash":"67541e6c-505e-4bf7-aa9c-be2775cb8d27"},{"objectId":"62964e6a4097072fefbe11a6","name":"Hisham M.","lastName":"Khudhur","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7572-9283","documentHash":"29ace74b-960c-4065-b1dc-b77a0352f0ed"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.254023"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["FT-Raman Spectroscopy","Gluten secondary structure","Phenolic acids","Gluten-polyphenols interactions"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","parentUuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","rootUuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

In the course of the studies, 4 species of hydrobionts were found that formed massive fouling on water supply facilities: filamentous algae Oedogonium sp. and Ulotrix zonata with a total biomass of 123.6±18.44 g/m2, tropical molluscs Melanoides tuberculata and Tarebia granifera of the Thiaridae family with a biomass of 20.09 g/m2. The shells of dead mollusks drifted along the pipes of the circulation system with the flow of water and interfered with the operation of pumping stations. Also, the blue-green algae Microcystis aeruginosa, which dominated the phytoplankton of the cooling pond, belonged to the potential bio-hindrances. The hydrobiological regulation was developed with the aim of timely detection of hydrobionts capable of active reproduction and creation of biological obstacles. It provides for four types of monitoring: current (operational), extreme (control), deployed (research) and background (hydrobiological monitoring of the Kakhovka reservoir in the zone of influence of waste warm waters). For each type of monitoring, the subjects of control (a group of hydrobionts), control parameters (species composition, abundance, biomass) and frequency of control are determined.\nThe regulation of hydrobiological monitoring makes it possible to minimize the consequences or prevent the occurrence of accidents and emergencies in the operation of the ZNPP cooling circulation systems associated with biological obstacles, and can be used as an example for solving similar problems at other power facilities.

Jej podstawa uwi- dacznia się w zjawisku, jakim jest rosnąca ilość energii zużywanej przez społe- czeństwo i wynikające z tego różnorakie problemy o charakterze społecznym, ekonomicznym, energetycznym, ekologicznym, które stanowią obecnie naturalną konsekwencję i cenę, jaka jest płacona za wzrost gospodarczy i postęp cywilizacyjny. Rozwijająca się gospodarka, dążenie do dobrobytu oraz chęć podnoszenia jakości życia społecznego – w tym gospodarstw domowych – są w coraz większym stopniu uzależnione od energii i niezwykle wrażliwe na wszelkie zmiany z nią związane, jak chociażby zakłócenia w jej dostawach czy trudności w swobodnym z niej ko- rzystaniu. Te ostatnie zjawiska, jak pokazują badania i codzienne doświadczenia wielu gospodarstw domowych, stają się coraz bardziej powszechne nie tylko wśród społeczeństw ubogich, lecz także bardziej zamożnych. Porównywalnie, w wymia- rze globalnym, zjawisko to jest obecne zarówno wśród państw mniej zamożnych, jak i wśród tych wysoko rozwiniętych.\nPomimo globalnego wymiaru doświadczania ubóstwa energii cieplnej, zjawi- sko to, ze względu na swoją złożoność i wielowymiarowość zagadnienia, jest mało znane, a tym samym w dalszym ciągu mało integralnie zbadane i opisane. Dużą trudność sprawia także precyzyjne oszacowanie jego obecnego poziomu (skali i za- kresu) w państwach Europy oraz jego wpływu na jakość i komfort życia obywateli. Badania pokazują, że dwie trzecie państw Wspólnoty Europejskiej nie prowadzi monitoringu postępu ubóstwa energii cieplnej w formie pomiarów ilościowych1. Pomimo że zjawisko to – jak podaje Międzynarodowa Agencja Energetyczna – obecnie dotyka ok. 1,3-2,5 mld ludzi na świecie, w tym ok. 11% mieszkańców Unii Europejskiej, czyli ok. 50-125 mln Europejczyków, większość państw Europy nadal nie wskazuje odbiorców energii znajdujących się w trudnej sytuacji bytowej (w któ- rej gospodarstwa domowe nie są w stanie np. odpowiednio ogrzać swojego domupo przystępnej dla nich i akceptowalnej przez nich cenie czy też regularnie opłacać rachunków za usługi energetyczne), a także nie określa ich liczby.\nWiększa część uwagi, zarówno na poziomie badań naukowych, jak i podej- mowanych działań pragmatyczno-zaradczych na szczeblu administracji między- narodowej, krajowej czy lokalnej, koncentruje się na zjawisku ubóstwa energii elektrycznej. Jednakże również i w tej grupie państw Unii Europejskiej mniej niż jedna trzecia oficjalnie uznaje ubóstwo energetyczne, a tylko nieliczne spośród nich mają wypracowaną urzędową definicję w ustawodawstwie krajowym, do- pasowaną do specyficznych uwarunkowań swojego kraju2. Niepokojący jest fakt braku dostrzegania oraz opracowywania odpowiednio ukierunkowanych środków (instrumentów) przeciwdziałających ubóstwu energii cieplnej, a także braku podej- mowania konkretnych działań zaradczych przez podmioty i osoby odpowiadające za niwelowanie owego zjawiska."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058261945","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":"978-83-7938-370-2","volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":"WAT","translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb920","mniswId":"64300","name":"Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna im.

Research has been done to investigate the convective heat transfer of hybrid nanofluid, using CuO and TiO2 nanoparticles and water-ethylene glycol (RC) as base fluids on a radiator. The mass concentration of the hybrid nanoparticles varied from 0.25 %, 0.30 %, and 0.35 %. For the preparation of the hybrid nanofluid through a two-step method, by mixing dry samples of CuO and TiO2 nanoparticles (50:50) and then the mixture of radiator coolant, RC (60 % water and 40 % ethylene glycol). The fluid flow varies from 20 liters per minute to 28 liters per minute. Temperature variations range from 70 °C to 90 °C by using controlled heating. Four thermocouples measure the inlet and outlet hot fluid flow and the airflow before and after the radiator. The experiment showed that the overall heat transfer coefficient increases remarkably with the increase of the hybrid nanoparticle concentration under various flow rate values. The maximum overall heat transfer coefficient increases by about 83 % compared to pure radiator coolant under 0.35 % mass concentration at a flow rate of 22 liters per minute and a temperature of 70 °C. It has also been found that the heat transfer rate is highly dependent on the radiator's mass fraction and flow rate. Increasing the mass concentration shows maximum enhancement in heat transfer rate. Inlet temperature also enhances the heat transfer rate, but its effect is small compared to nanofluid's mass concentration and flow rate. This study reveals that hybrid nanofluids can be suitable as a working fluid, especially in small-scale heat transfer devices."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058261947","journalIssue":{"objectId":"633163e14097073dc8696529","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"4","number":"5 (118)","doi":"","documentHash":"527d2fa9-30ec-43f6-a15d-4bf9da341eaa"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"4","pagesFromTo":"21-29","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/263649/259981","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63316f504097073dc86a1b26","name":"Sugeng Hadi","lastName":"Susilo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"50a0c9eb-ea2b-4d69-b0d4-e39e4fb16d5a"},{"objectId":"63316f504097073dc86a1b25","name":"Bambang","lastName":"Irawan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f367748d-ea13-457a-9758-b7001b5a12e5"},{"objectId":"63316f504097073dc86a1b24","name":"Sudarmadji","lastName":"Sudarmadji","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2a85e6be-082e-4950-af49-c5482c0e0f9b"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.263649"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Imperial Politicy","Julia Domna","Venus","Religion","Numismatic"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","uid":"bz_6XXECFL3_CFkpms5BsDQ","uuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","parentUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","rootUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","name":"Uniwersytet w Siedlcach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602f4e2f9543c7410626f309"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Goddess Venus on Julia Domna’s coins.

It has been shown that manurefree management is possible, but requires farmers to have knowledge and professional skills. Balances of mineral components and soil organic matter have to be done by farms with no livestock in order to optimize fertilization and achieve satisfactory yields and prevent soil degradation. In non-livestock farms, maintaining the optimal level of soil fertility depends on the straw management, beet leaves utilization for fertilization purposes and the cultivation of catch crops for green manure. Manure should also be purchased (if possible)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058261953","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"50","pagesFromTo":"12-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pja.iung.pulawy.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/PJA50doInternetu12_18.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709298878c28a047398b4d","name":"Adam","lastName":"Harasim","uuid":"B603953283578670AB02804AA10DAB6F4DBD7DCBB1D9F8F9C8EC9D5D03C33F14E3EA9527A822832D0C2E69FEEC3EF5D08D69598B3647BB9173F50AC6E0E506E6","orcidId":"0000-0001-6395-1661","documentHash":"56dbe821-26d3-4973-844c-4860d9221225"}],"doi":"10.26114/pja.iung.493.2022.02"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["metering unit","electricity meter","measurement uncertainty","fuzzy function","current transformer"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091c4878c28a047388864","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"National Aviation University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6331a6404097073dc86d8687"]},{"id":"5e7091dc878c28a04738d4a3","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"National University of Water and Environmental Engineering","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6331a6404097073dc86d8689"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Refinement of the mathematical model of electrical energy measurement uncertainty in reduced load mode","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"Eastern-European Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-4061","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"3937afea-5395-4435-850d-06bbeb29d2c9"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6331a6404097073dc86d8685","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6331a6404097073dc86d8687","6331a6404097073dc86d8688","6331a6404097073dc86d8689"]},"issue":"8 (118)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The object of the study is a three-phase commercial electricity metering unit for 380 V electrical grids. The uncertainty of electricity measurement in the reduced load mode is estimated by the relative deviation of the active energy, measured by the metering unit, from the actual value. The specified deviation is considered as the value of relative deviations on measuring channels, weighted by phase currents. The method of estimating the uncertainty of electricity measurement by one channel of the metering unit is based on the approach to estimating non-random uncertainty using the fuzzy set theory. The parameters of membership functions for the relative deviation of the metering unit readings are estimated at fixed levels of the channel current. Approximation of such functions for different current levels allows you to obtain a set of boundaries of the L-R type fuzzy function corresponding to a set of confidence levels. This allows determining the impact of the load phase current on the measurement uncertainty if the amount of empirical data is limited. The mathematical model for estimating the uncertainty of electricity measurement at reduced load using a fuzzy function was refined. The proposed model differs from the known ones by taking into account the influence of load values for each phase of the metering unit on the measurement uncertainty indicators. The method for determining the membership function and the marginal confidence level, which characterize the uncertainty of energy metering by the metering unit, is proposed. The mathematical modeling results are confirmed as adequate to the experimental data. The proposed model for estimating the measurement uncertainty allows estimating the level of underestimation and clarifying financial calculations between the seller and the buyer of electricity."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058261955","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6331a6404097073dc86d8686","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"4","number":"8 (118)","doi":null,"documentHash":"10f19067-0425-4390-853f-4c7fa4c152b2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"4","pagesFromTo":"6-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/262260/259835","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6331a6404097073dc86d8689","name":"Sviatoslav","lastName":"Vasylets","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9ffcc08b-4971-48c4-bf38-87624cd3a021"},{"objectId":"6331a6404097073dc86d8688","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Kvasnikov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0456f4de-ac02-4f18-999f-f58f5e43b6bf"},{"objectId":"6331a6404097073dc86d8687","name":"Kateryna","lastName":"Vasylets","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aaf6c2ce-773c-4231-a8eb-0c4a4aaa6609"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.262260"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["pelety","biomasa","wytrzymałość mechaniczna"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b2878c28a047385416","uid":"b5WMmvHpMpawcCbXoZ64AvA","uuid":"ccfa9469-688c-44e0-83e8-89e451d53a62","parentId":"5e7091b2878c28a047385416","parentUuid":"ccfa9469-688c-44e0-83e8-89e451d53a62","rootId":"5e7091b2878c28a047385416","rootUuid":"ccfa9469-688c-44e0-83e8-89e451d53a62","name":"Instytut Nafty i Gazu - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b46ec"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Porównanie metod pomiaru wytrzymałości mechanicznej peletów z biomasy","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c2851454793fd","mniswId":"16683","title":"Przemysł Chemiczny","doi":"10.15199/62","issn":"0033-2496","eissn":"2449-9951","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"6bbff151-5f43-4978-b18d-9433b052abac"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629860a54097075714372ede","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b46ec"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Przedstawiono korelację pomiędzy wynikami badań wytrzymałości mechanicznej peletów wytworzonych z biomasy otrzymanymi w badaniach odporności na zrzut (drop test) a wynikami wg metody znormalizowanej.

The main goal of this paper is to analyze and compare out-of-field neutron and non-neutron organ doses inside 5- and 10-year-old pediatric anthropomorphic phantoms for the treatment of a 5-cm-diameter brain tumor. Proton irradiations were carried out at the Cyclotron Centre Bronowice in IFJ PAN Krakow Poland using a pencil beam scanning technique (PBS) at a gantry with a dedicated scanning nozzle (IBA Proton Therapy System, Proteus 235). Thermoluminescent and radiophotoluminescent dosimeters were used for non-neutron dose measurements while secondary neutrons were measured with track-etched detectors. Out-of-field doses measured using intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) were compared with previous measurements performed within a WG9 for three different photon radiotherapy techniques: 1) intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), 2) three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D CDRT) performed on a Varian Clinac 2300 linear accelerator (LINAC) in the Centre of Oncology, Krakow, Poland, and 3) Gamma Knife surgery performed on the Leksell Gamma Knife (GK) at the University Hospital Centre Zagreb, Croatia. Phantoms and detectors used in experiments as well as the target location were the same for both photon and proton modalities. The total organ dose equivalent expressed as the sum of neutron and non-neutron components in IMPT was found to be significantly lower (two to three orders of magnitude) in comparison with the different photon radiotherapy techniques for the same delivered tumor dose. For IMPT, neutron doses are lower than non-neutron doses close to the target but become larger than non-neutron doses further away from the target. Results of WG9 studies have provided out-of-field dose levels required for an extensive set of radiotherapy techniques, including proton therapy, and involving a complete description of organ doses of pediatric patients. Such studies are needed for validating mathematical models and Monte Carlo simulation tools for out-of-field dosimetry which is essential for dedicated epidemiological studies which evaluate the risk of second cancers and other late effects for pediatric patients treated with radiotherapy."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058261961","journalIssue":{"objectId":"629da6ca4097073d58657d8b","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"52b5cc3c-67dd-485f-b00f-b8fc9e9321c9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"904563","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2022.904563/full","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6332cf4f409707247a1f47bf","name":"Roger

climate affects aquatic ecosystems worldwide, yet the most dramatic impact has been observed in Polar Regions. The presented study aimed to test the hypothesis that changes in biodiversity are linked to changes in the food web functioning under different temperature conditions, with large species dominant in cold waters and smaller species dominant in warmer waters. Two sites with contrasting hydrology were surveyed in summer 2005 in Hornsund (west Spitsbergen). The first site was located close to the fjord entrance and was strongly influenced by the Atlantic waters (WARM). The second was located deep inside the fjord, where the water is fresher and colder due to glacier meltwater runoff (COLD). Temperature, salinity and photosynthetic active radiation were measured, nutrient concentrations and chlorophyll a were analyzed. Plankton biota, including different fractions of zooplankton, phytoplankton and bacteria was collected and enumerated. The temperature differences were the most pronounced out of the abiotic parameters measured. In particular, the COLD site was characterized by lower water temperature and higher turbidity due to the influence of meltwater. Significant differences in the composition and the quantitative ratios of plankton biota were noted, with the most dramatic variation in the number of microplankton taxa and their biomass. The overall plankton biomass at the WARM site (91 mg C ⋅ m–3) was higher than that at the COLD site (71 mg C ⋅ m–3), as well as the primary production rates. Microplanktonic assemblages at the WARM site included twice as many taxa. The protists constituted more than half of the plankton biomass at the WARM site (53.2%), whereas their share at the COLD site was slightly higher (63.6%). The nanoplankton fraction was numerically dominant among the protists, whereas copepods were the main component of the zooplankton biomass. The differences in planktonic communities’ compositions observed between the two sites might have arisen due to the influence of turbid meltwater runoff, which eliminates larger, strictly autotrophic and decreases primary production."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058261967","journalIssue":{"objectId":"632da7544097073ab886579a","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"20","number":"1(24)","doi":null,"documentHash":"66713f27-65d8-4b64-9029-872104966f68"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"20","pagesFromTo":"67-84","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.33275/1727-7485.1.2022.690","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"632da7544097073ab886579d","name":"K.","lastName":"Dmoch","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"056c03a2-b76c-4263-af17-b7092784a55e"},{"objectId":"632da7544097073ab886579c","name":"K.","lastName":"Jankowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fc4e0ac3-791f-45e9-a22b-342995b9750f"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5b2f","name":"Marta","lastName":"Głuchowska","uuid":"06CBE3D59DC14CBE09FB73635ADBB4E995D1982AA396A38790681F9254FD20FC302593539E220C6961F9191EC4DB193A0D6AFBBC024C04893983841970F8338C","orcidId":"0000-0002-3032-4925","documentHash":"550563d4-4df6-4803-a008-600c081f997e"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5907","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Kwaśniewski","uuid":"8365CC02046923AD10F327E0A9DF80A2A87646DD41F10E1B4BA9B189ECBDAF4BC4DDB9C2AE001CE03926A8551D8319BB4076255C7C53DDF5522FBDA2313D5552","orcidId":"0000-0003-3104-0761","documentHash":"8b17d9b8-6501-443c-a119-2fcad7a66046"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a655c","name":"Józef","lastName":"Wiktor","uuid":"E8901DD6BAD74E4F0A531BC69DC86134B02AC9BDAB17361AAFA79F2ED26ABBC473DFEDC614DF70B146B917A0E212BFD4740299FB5AB0C805A789195BA88BE5E4","orcidId":"0000-0002-2344-0047","documentHash":"6a141822-0a06-4fc9-83c5-d08f585c8615"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6520","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Błachowiak-Samołyk","uuid":"8C6AD77D97DA3D9D5230CB20B5B200FB76893BFE72A48BE0BAB6068DBB7BD96049B3C885C6414B2EF04BBFB8AFD27AC9468868A23DB7A01FB8AEBEECC4EDAD0F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8076-2168","documentHash":"5036109f-207f-446c-bac6-ec8dd36677f9"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6500","name":"Jan","lastName":"Węsławski","uuid":"1533D27BF3D862DB3E45977DE2B00DFD8574D55283D2387607BAE04CA48DC30A112F487F1ED676E69B09664A13815ACA81E497676BC02FC118B29C4F75CA0537","orcidId":"0000-0001-8434-5927","documentHash":"453e81a0-6c93-4d62-b250-6692c6f7626e"},{"objectId":"5e70932f878c28a0473a490c","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Piwosz","uuid":"14475DCF5DE7D1E3315331537B3FBFD85ECF1484CA0955CFA345692EE2E6D30C749308EBFA2D02F0F9CE0A80A7B1D309809FB44AA113FA39E9B81324AC0A8DB4","orcidId":"0000-0002-3248-3364","documentHash":"3b7811fb-c4bc-4ed5-8aaa-a33035ed8601"}],"doi":"10.33275/1727-7485.1.2022.690"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["women with epilepsy","pregnancy","caesarean delivery","seizures","antiseizure treatment"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","uid":"bfUR7pyerT3GiQw3TRkatRw","uuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","parentUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","rootUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","name":"Centrum Medyczne Kształcenia Podyplomowego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093de878c28a0473b242d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Rate of and Factors Associated with Delivery by Caesarean Section among Women with Epilepsy: Time Trend in a Single-Centre Cohort in Mazovia, Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c754","mniswId":"10517","title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2077-0383","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcm","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"dd8b920e-6e74-4566-b0cf-d3ec7b7d448a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-06","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6295d5eb4097072fefb8a19d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6295d5eb4097072fefb8a19f","5e7093de878c28a0473b242d"]},"issue":"9","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Data from literature suggest that the rate of caesarean section (CS) in women with epilepsy (WWE) is higher than in the general population. In Poland, there is neither a national registry nor another data set to access the outcome of pregnancy in WWE. Therefore, we address this gap by prospectively studying CS rates among 1021 WWE pregnancies at a single centre, their trends over time, and factors increasing the likelihood of the CS. To determine whether the diagnosis of epilepsy itself increased this likelihood, mixed models were used to analyse the contributions of specific variables, including the presence of seizures at different pregnancy-related timepoints. Over 20 years, the mean rate of CS in WWE was progressively growing and was higher than in the general population in Mazovia (47% vs. 32%). Generalized seizures in the third trimester increased the likelihood of CS with the highest odds (OR 4.4). The most frequent indication for a CS was obstetric (58.1%), followed by epilepsy-related (25.2%). Almost half of women who indicated epilepsy as the sole reason for CS had no seizure during pregnancy, and nearly 70% did not have generalized seizures.

We present a comparison of ARG abundance across various animal species, production environments and humans in Europe. AMR variation sources were quantified. The correlation of ARG abundance between qPCR data and previously published metagenomic data was assessed.\nA cross-sectional study was conducted in nine European countries, comprising 9572 samples. qPCR was used to quantify abundance of ARGs [aph(3′)-III, erm(B), sul2, tet(W)] and 16S rRNA. Variance component analysis was conducted to explore AMR variation sources. Spearman’s rank correlation of ARG abundance values was evaluated between pooled qPCR data and earlier published pooled metagenomic data. ARG abundance varied strongly among animal species, environments and humans. This variation was dominated by between-farm variation (pigs) or within-farm variation (broilers, veal calves and turkeys). A decrease in ARG abundance along pig and broiler production chains (‘farm to fork’) was observed. ARG abundance was higher in farmers than in slaughterhouse workers, and lowest in control subjects. ARG abundance showed a high correlation (Spearman’s ρ > 0.7) between qPCR data and metagenomic data of pooled samples. qPCR analysis is a valuable tool to assess ARG abundance in a large collection of livestock-associated samples. The between-country and between-farm variation of ARG abundance could partially be explained by antimicrobial use and farm biosecurity levels. ARG abundance in human faeces was related to livestock antimicrobial resistance exposure."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058264649","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6299d7ae4097072c2b7a9041","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"a337107d-1e18-4e63-85df-b0ce1cd7e867"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/jac/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jac/dkac133/43446277/dkac133.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6299d7ae4097072c2b7a903e","name":"Heike","lastName":"Schmitt","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c367407d-c5b4-41b7-817c-184ac3d1c34a"},{"objectId":"6299d7ae4097072c2b7a903d","name":"Lidwien A.

These viruses have a quite distinct S gene from North American isolates. The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of TCoV strains in a Polish turkey farm during a twelve-year period, between 2008 and 2019, and to characterize their full-length S gene. Out of the 648 flocks tested, 65 (10.0%, 95% CI: 7.9–12.6) were positive for TCoV and 16 of them were molecularly characterized. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains belonged to two clusters, one formed by the early isolates identified at the beginning of the TCoV monitoring (from 2009 to 2010), and the other, which was formed by more recent strains from 2014 to 2019. Our analysis of the changes observed in the deduced amino acids of the S1 protein suggests the existence of three variable regions. Moreover, although the selection pressure analysis showed that the TCoV strains were evolving under negative selection, some sites of the S1 subunit were positively selected, and most of them\nwere located within the proposed variable regions. Our sequence analysis also showed one TCoV strain had recombined with another one in the S1 gene. The presented investigation on the molecular feature of the S gene of TCoVs circulating in the turkey population in Poland contributes interesting data to the current state of knowledge."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058264652","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1023","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://mdpi-res.com/d_attachment/viruses/viruses-14-01023/article_deploy/viruses-14-01023.pdf?version=1652264537","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebedd26752340254fc424a4","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Opolska","uuid":"F2D203374927E61071F70F279457FCDEFEFE43BE99759D0541924DC75911D6F4794D79CB30CDB551FAF5825A4196644915458A253C5026E78037ED49D228FDE3","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"53883f6c-5a56-4112-822e-536e165a956c"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0def","name":"Anna","lastName":"Lisowska","uuid":"DACDB5B33E016683B6C3AE247380BF2E5EC908115FAF7C45643A476F1F28A8371F1D6B6411BC388B5BCEC61BDF90732F3C336AD8313EA5CCA4D909A17D46412C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"92988d97-a378-4a23-94cb-76d9a9e67f4a"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c3","name":"Anna","lastName":"Pikuła","uuid":"A283B6B2F9E05F2D0E1FAEE12806ECE15D9CABC0E6866E08C1F96C30B82D46ACBF225A28ACC0ACEC7D764DBABA3C442150A97FD6381E3F12E114994BBE205BFB","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7e3962ab-978c-4183-9b98-9dd234001dd8"},{"objectId":"5e7093f1878c28a0473b3c5c","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Sajewicz-Krukowska","uuid":"DDB7A0F5B8C8D5B834B319010AF5032BC9DF8CAE6291DFE20CCC4DE2DF7DBD0E6BD0D557C21141F5A30E0A757284EFFCAF42A80CBDACCECA72FA564F58754E0F","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bba12a9c-3a4d-4dac-8be6-fd85904df577"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b5a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Domańska-Blicharz","uuid":"44C5DFE3C33AA49F72079D496E2377ECFB06FF9CECAF80BDDBA1D06D13EA5BC0296FA0DF1BE18E01648F10BC82C3BF11F8D0520B236A22625EBD476B49E108A6","orcidId":"0000-0002-0642-3931","documentHash":"be2eaa91-303e-4813-a127-8bc4b12d6232"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["loneliness","Meaning in life","positive orientation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","uid":"b_ZPtKgtv4v90uInHkYp6dg","uuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","parentUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","rootUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Kochanowskiego w Kielcach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922a878c28a047390eb5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Mediating Role of Positive Orientation in the Relationship between Loneliness and Meaning in Life","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","doi":null,"issn":"1661-7827","eissn":"1660-4601","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e236e16e-7430-4ac3-800c-033637860e22"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6336aa6a409707141628d428","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922a878c28a047390eb5"]},"issue":"16","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Previous research revealed that increased loneliness resulted in decreased meaning in life (MIL).

The aim of the study was to determine if the set of positive evaluations of oneself, one’s life, and one’s future discussed by Caprara as positive orientation (POS) was a mediator between loneliness and MIL. (2) Methods: A sample of 304 Polish participants aged 19–45 (M = 25.61 years, SD = 6.1) completed the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale, the Presence subscale of the Meaning in Life Questionnaire, and the Positivity Scale. (3) Results: The study showed that loneliness was negatively associated with POS and MIL, while POS and MIL were positively correlated with each other. It also turned out that POS partially mediated the relationship between loneliness and MIL. (4) Conclusions: The results suggest that, by inhibiting POS, loneliness makes it difficult to perceive life as meaningful. The interrelationships between loneliness, POS, and MIL are discussed in light of the evolutionary theory of loneliness."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058264655","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63047bcd40970739a761f724","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"19","number":"16","doi":null,"documentHash":"6fcf689c-4343-4220-b2a8-f7a2b280debd"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"[1-8], [poz.] 9948","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/16/9948/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70922a878c28a047390eb5","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Borawski","uuid":"114D21B7F0D3653E85D75E94BFE4DEFF0097F116934F387E0FBF9244C2CD217DA0CADEE0E583682D5B522AA08FB070FACD815B04EE6B0B61154AE0C58258D6A6","orcidId":"0000-0002-1504-2145","documentHash":"d63b4f66-6964-4db1-9dd4-5e64eb028a67"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19169948"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["1-alkyl-1-methylpiperidinium bromides","Pesticide","Biomembrane","Langmuir monolayer","Fungicide"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70934d878c28a0473a6dda","5e70934d878c28a0473a6dc0","5e7093db878c28a0473b210a","5e70934d878c28a0473a6dc5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Effect of 1-alkyl-1-methylpiperidinium bromides on lipids of fungal plasma membrane and lung surfactant","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775e9","mniswId":"3503","title":"Chemistry and Physics of Lipids","doi":null,"issn":"0009-3084","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"1dc8eb1f-60b3-4118-ae80-5fc6a4acdd7e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"633a8147409707021a316669","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093db878c28a0473b210a","5e70934d878c28a0473a6dda","5e70934d878c28a0473a6dc0","5e70934d878c28a0473a6dc5"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058264657","journalIssue":{"objectId":"633a8147409707021a31667a","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"248","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"591d62f1-d8bb-4202-8a35-7a9744c106a9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"248","pagesFromTo":"105240-1 -

The study aimed to determine the main factors driving unusual differentiation of forest vegetation into four communities, all coexisting on the same geological substrate. The fieldwork, conducted on the fluvioglacial sand area in Central Poland, consisted of vegetation sampling, together with soil identification and sampling, up to depths of 150 cm. Additional soil parameters were measured in the laboratory. A Geographical Information System was applied to assess variables related to topography and forest continuity. Vegetation was classified and forest communities identified. Canonical Correspondence Analysis indicated significant effects of organic horizon thickness, forest continuity, soil disturbance and soil organic matter content on vegetation composition. We found that the coexistence of four forest communities, including two Natura 2000 habitats, a Cladonia-Scots pine forest and an acidophilous oak forest (codes–91T0 and 9190 respectively), resulted from former agricultural use of the land followed by secondary succession. The lowest soil-disturbance level was observed within late-successional acidophilous oak forest patches. Nearly complete soil erosion was found within the early-successional Cladonia-Scots pine forest. We propose that both protected habitat types may belong to the same successional sere, and discuss the possibility of replacement of the early- and late-successional forest habitat types in the context of sustainable forest management and conservation.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058264660","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/13/2/198","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629cd6664097070cd3483878","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Marciszewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3e33d144-172f-4c2a-a22f-9a764e9a237f"},{"objectId":"5e709425878c28a0473b71ec","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Zaniewski","uuid":"8290F34222F6C4FCE5322CE86A774A7F157D798432AF172E7041C79282D7E49D9203178CFC4FC2B60526DE34C73B76D00B1F35A46265C086F567B614A72EC12B","orcidId":"0000-0002-0792-9854","documentHash":"3799c94c-b15a-4475-a820-23f7df387082"},{"objectId":"5e70923a878c28a04739214c","name":"Artur","lastName":"Obidziński","uuid":"3E4C0A1F7F2BA4AB85FF75B370108E031E06A980C166A7B012EE500A82ECF19C2CD26D9B7E5252840E71546C757BA62972D3522F6E284AC348665ED547DD34B9","orcidId":"0000-0002-8750-7845","documentHash":"09843fb7-8b42-4fcb-b378-da8c6ba2a2f7"},{"objectId":"5e7091f3878c28a04738d9d2","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Ciurzycki","uuid":"4274E0064716624763AF232184A31BCBFB054D944E98C2E7445B916B4DE4F978D0DE87E2D6CFDF2CD95C1EAAA37E5430402D18BCF72C4D6F42B10FCA23B0EFA3","orcidId":"0000-0001-7544-9011","documentHash":"949a8a4f-d2c7-4b0b-aeea-07b8a088e927"}],"doi":"10.3390/f13020198"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709307878c28a0473a1638"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Nemolizumab efficacy in prurigo nodularis: onset of action on itch and sleep disturbances","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478b26","mniswId":"12892","title":"Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology","doi":"10.1111/jdv","issn":"0926-9959","eissn":"1468-3083","websiteLink":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1468-3083","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"1ffe66e7-3edb-4275-ba32-23c0369c0c8c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2022-06-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6335660e4097074d8cb1bc3b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6335660e4097074d8cb1bc3d","6335660e4097074d8cb1bc3e","6335660e4097074d8cb1bc3f","6335660e4097074d8cb1bc40","6335660e4097074d8cb1bc41","5e709307878c28a0473a1638","6335660e4097074d8cb1bc42","6335660e4097074d8cb1bc43","6335660e4097074d8cb1bc44"]},"issue":"10","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"BackgroundPatients with prurigo nodularis (PN) have multiple itchy nodules, impaired quality of life and sleep depriva-tion. Prurigo nodularis patients have a high burden of disease, primarily due to the intensity of the itch. It is reasonable toexpect that rapid relief of itch–and associated improvement of sleep–are highly valued clinical outcomes for patients.Nemolizumab is an IL-31A-receptor inhibitor that modulates the neuroimmune response with reported positive efficacyand safety data in a phase 2 study of PN.ObjectivesTo evaluate the onset of action of nemolizumab on itch and sleep disturbances.MethodsPost  hocanalysis of a phase 2 trial of nemolizumab 0.5 mg/kg SC vs. placebo in patients (n=70) withmoderate-to-severe PN (≥20 nodules) and severe pruritus (NRS≥7). Time to significant reduction was assessed forpeak pruritus (PP) and sleep disturbance (SD) using numerical rating scales (NRS), also assessed was scratching timeduring sleep.ResultsNemolizumab significantly reduced itch vs. placebo within 48 h (PP NRS\u000119.5% vs.\u00015.8%, respectively,P=0.014). Significant difference between nemolizumab and placebo in reducing itch by≥4 on PP NRS was achieved atDay 3 (23.5% vs. 0%,P<0.001). A significant difference in SD NRS was reported by Day 4 (\u000124.0% vs.\u00014.3% pla-cebo,P=0.012). In addition, there was a separation between groups in SD responders (decrease of≥4 points) in favourof nemolizumab by Day 2 (8.8% vs. 0%,P=0.037).

main purpose of this article is to identify the determinants of Internet use in Poland in terms of its economic and social applications, from the perspective of the individual user. The survey was conducted in April 2022 in the academic environment using the CAWI method. The research sample consisted of 408 individuals. The survey was comprehensive and exploratory in nature since it was used to assess both the major trends and preferences regarding Internet-based activities such as shopping, learning or entertainment. Additional aspects being evaluated were respondents’ approaches to data privacy, cybersecurity and online marketing. The limitations of the study consisted in the fact that it was conducted in an academic setting, covered a wide range of topics (general assessment of digital consumer trends) and covered a transitional period where the present is difficult to evaluate and the future is difficult to predict. Nevertheless, its undoubted advantage and innovation is the determination of the status of work-life Internet use in early 2022. The study findings may be useful both as a prelude to expanding research in this direction and a source of useful knowledge for economic practitioners analyzing Internet use at the time which is described as “transitioning out of the COVID-19 pandemic phase”."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058264664","journalIssue":{"objectId":"634fc5c340970779e45ede38","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"207","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"143169aa-50c5-47ec-8c88-a2f7c5fd3a70"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"634fc5c340970779e45ede37","mniswId":null,"startDate":"2022-09-07","endDate":"2022-09-09","fullName":"26th

pathogen Candida albicans causes systemic infections named candidiasis. Due to the increasing number of multi-drug resistant clinical isolates of Candida sp., currently employed antifungals (e.g., azoles) are insufficient for combating fungal infection. One of the resistance mechanisms toward azoles is increased expression of plasma membrane (PM) transporters (e.g., Cdr1p), and such an effect was observed in C. albicans clinical isolates. At the same time, it has been proven that a decrease in PMs sphingolipids (SLs) content correlates with altered sensitivity to azoles and diminished Cdr1p levels. This indicates an important role for SL in maintaining the properties of PM and gaining resistance to antifungal agents. Here, we prove using a novel spot variation fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (svFCS) technique that CaCdr1p localizes in detergent resistant microdomains (DRMs). Immunoblot analysis confirmed the localization of CaCdr1p in DRMs fraction in both the C. albicans WT and erg11Δ/Δ strains after 14 and 24 h of culture. We also show that the C. albicanserg11Δ/Δ strain is more sensitive to the inhibitor of SLs synthesis; aureobasidin A (AbA). AbA treatment leads to a diminished amount of SLs in C. albicans WT and erg11Δ/Δ PM, while, for C. albicanserg11Δ/Δ, the general levels of mannose-inositol-P-ceramide and inositol-P-ceramide are significantly lower than for the C. albicans WT strain. Simultaneously, the level of ergosterol in the C. albicans WT strain after adding of AbA remains unchanged, compared to the control conditions. Analysis of PM permeabilization revealed that treatment with AbA correlates with the disruption of PM integrity in C. albicanserg11Δ/Δ but not in the C. albicans WT strain. Additionally, in the C. albicans WT strain, we observed lower activity of H+-ATPase, correlated with the delocalization of both CaCdr1p and CaPma1p.

barberry fruit is native small fruit in Iran. To examine the impact of various drying methods and storage on the biochemical attributes (Vitamin C, Anthocyanin, Phenol, pH, TA), color index (a*, b*, L*, ab, and Chroma), drying time, and fruit microstructure (by SEM) of seedless barberry (Berberis vulgaris var. asperma), and effective moisture diffusivity coefficient (Deff), specific energy consumption (SEC), energy efficiency (EE) of the dryers, this experiment was performed. Drying treatments include microwave (100, 170, and 270 W), oven (60 and 70 °C), cabinet (50 and 70 °C), shade, sun, and fresh samples (control) and storage 6 months after drying (in polyethylene packaging and at a temperature of 5–10 °C). Results showed minimum and maximum drying times (50 min and 696 h), were related to microwave (270 W) and shade methods, respectively. The highest color values were observed in fruits treated with control, shade and sun treatments and the lowest values were observed in cabinet (70 °C) methods. According to the SEM results, microwave significantly affected surface structure of the dried sample compared to others. The findings indicated that the use of artificial drying methods than natural methods (sun and shade) cause a more significant reduction in color indexes, while vitamin C, soluble solids, and anthocyanin were significantly maintained at a high level. Storage reduced anthocyanin content of fruits almost 12%. Moreover, it was discovered EE and SEC values varied in the range of 1.16–25.26% and 12.20–1182 MJ/kg, respectively.

Its effectiveness is associated with perceptual-cognitive modulation. As the factors affecting it are still not completely known, the aim of our study was therefore to analyse the association between selected variables (demographic, training, anthropometric, genetic) and sensorimotor adaptation in reactive agility tasks in youth team-sport athletes. The study group consisted of 85 youth athletes (aged 12.61 ± 0.98 years). Based on an initial evaluation, participants were divided into faster and slower agility groups. The resultant differences between change of direction speed tests and reactive agility tests provided the REAC-INDEX as a dependent variable. The independent variables were as follows: gender, calendar age, body mass, height, BMI, maturity offset, training status and the BDNF rs6265 polymorphism. Multiple linear regression showed that the maturity offset (ß = 0.269; p = 0.012) and calendar age (ß = -0.411; p < 0.001) significantly contributed to the REAC-INDEX of all participants (R2 = 0.13). In the slower group, the c.196G BDNF allele had a significant influence (ß = -0.140; p = 0.044) on the REAC-INDEX. The best predictive model comprised female gender (ß = 0.799; p < 0.001), maturity offset (ß = -0.586; p < 0.001) and training experience (ß = -0.225; p = 0.009), contributing to 49% of RA variance. Sensorimotor adaptability is mainly dependent on gender and age, and can be improved through systematic sports training. The BDNF rs6265 polymorphism may be considered a contributing factor to SA variability in the initial stages of training, although polymorphism-related differences blurred as the effect of participation in sports training

microscopy (SEM) and confocal microscopy (CM). SEM and CM were used to determine MDN crystal thickness and study its relationship with crystal retardation colours using the Michel-Levy Birefringence approach.\n\nResults: Dimensions (mean±SD) of diamond shaped MDN crystals were confirmed using SEM and CM.

There were significant differences between SEM and CM thickness measurements (U=1283, p<0.05), as the SEM exhibited thinner diamond crystals. The combined use of PLM and Michel-Levy chart enabled the observation of a predominantly yellow coloured MDN crystal, mean thickness at (428 nm) mean retardation value.\n\nConclusion: The SEM was superior and successfully determined MDN crystal dimensions for the first time, whilst the CM results were affected by the Rhodamine dye staining process used for visualisation.

The paper presents the results of research on the assessment of the availability of texts presented on educational boards. The study was conducted on the basis of photographs of educational boards located on six educational paths in the forests of the Regional Directorate of State Forests in Lublin. Using the Google Lans application, the main text from each board was read and then analyzed in the Promovolt software program to determine the level of text accessibility using the Fog Index. The results were then compared with the opinion of respondents using an online survey, which indicated that most of the boards are written in language that is either simple, understandable to middle/high school students, or quite difficult but understandable to first-degree students. On the other hand, the respondents generally indicated the level of accessibility of the text to be easier because, in their opinion, it is enough to have a primary education to understand the content of the boards.

In our studies, we used data from international guidelines, clinical protocols that regulate the organization of medical and pharmaceutical care for these patients in the USA, Australia, Japan, Germany, Great Britain, Finland, India, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. The actual state of pharmaceutical provision of these patients in Ukraine was studied using a depersonalized database of medical prescriptions, which operates based on a number of specialized healthcare institutions. In addition, data from the Morion information search system were used. We used general theoretical (historical, formal, graphic, hypothetical-deductive, etc.) and applied (clinical-economic, organizational-economic, mathematical-statistical, etc.) research methods.\n\nResults. It has been established that a consolidated opinion has been formed in the world scientific community regarding the possibility of effective use in the pathogenetic treatment of patients with dementia in Alzheimer's disease of drugs from the groups N06DA Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N06DX-Other drugs for use in case of dementia. Thus, the pharmaceutical component of international recommendations, clinical protocols for the treatment of patients with dementia in Alzheimer's disease contains four drugs used in pathogenetic therapy. These are N06DA02 Donepezil, N06DA03 Rivastigmine, N06DA04 Galantamine and N06DX01 Memantine. It has been reported that all the above drugs are included in the domestic clinical protocol for the treatment of patients with dementia in Alzheimer's disease, the State Drug Formulary (with the exception of N06DA03 Rivastigmine), and the State Drug Registry. At the same time, all of them were absent from the National List of Essential Drugs, which has an important socio-economic and medical-pharmaceutical significance in the health care system. It was found that patients (200 people) received 2487 prescriptions (100.0 %), among which 9.41 % (234 prescriptions) were drugs used in pathogenetic treatment. There is a highly disproportionate nature of the distribution of prescriptions and consumption by international generic names of drugs. Thus, drugs N06DX01 Memantine accounted for 80.41 % (188 prescriptions) of all prescriptions in the group N06D Drugs for use in dementia, and the consumption rate was UAH 84420.20, which accounted for 91.48 % of the amount of expenses directed to patients with carrying out pathogenetic treatment. Significant dominance of drugs N06DX01 Memantine in the structure of prescriptions and consumption indicates the presence of severe, advanced forms of dementia in patients. This fact once again emphasizes the need for early detection and treatment of cognitive impairment, primarily for the rational use of limited health care resources. We have found that there are no prescriptions for N06D A04 Galantamine preparations, which are recommended by the relevant international recommendations in different countries of the world, as well as by the domestic clinical protocol for the pathogenetic treatment of mild and moderate forms of Alzheimer's disease. At the same time, N06DA05 Ipidacrine preparations were used in the treatment of domestic patients, which are not presented in the pharmaceutical component of international recommendations and protocols governing the pathogenetic treatment of the above-mentioned groups of neuropsychiatric patients.\n\nConclusions.

The aim of this study was to perform an epidemiological and molecular analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains cultured from tuberculosis patients in Poland in 2020 and to compare the results of monitoring drug-resistant tuberculosis in Poland with previous studies in 2012 and 2016. The analysis was based on questionnaires and strains sent by regional laboratories during the 12 months of 2020. Molecular analysis was performed by spoligotyping 20% of the strains sensitive to the four primary antimycobacterial drugs and all of the drug-resistant strains. The number of strains sent for analysis dropped threefold, from 4136 in 2012 to 1383 in 2020. The incidence of tuberculosis among men was higher than among women. There was an increase in strains' resistance to antimycobacterial drugs in both newly diagnosed patients, from 4.4% in 2012 to 6.1% in 2020, and previously treated patients, from 11.7% to 12.3%. Four-year resistance increased to 1% and 2.1%, respectively.

However, in recent years, this view started to change, and now it is recognized that GABAergic synapses show distinct forms of activity-dependent long-term plasticity, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Herein, we asked whether signaling mediated by beta 1 or beta 3 subunit-containing integrins might be involved in regulating the efficacy of GABAergic synapses, including the NMDA receptor-dependent inhibitory long-term potentiation (iLTP) in the hippocampus. We found that activation of beta 3 integrin with fibrinogen induced a stable depression, whereas inhibition of beta 1 integrin potentiated GABAergic synapses at CA1 pyramidal neurons in male mice. Additionally, compounds that interfere with the interaction of beta 1 or beta 3 integrins with extracellular matrix blocked the induction of NMDA-iLTP. In conclusion, we provide the first evidence that integrins are key players in regulating the endogenous modulatory mechanisms of GABAergic inhibition and plasticity in the hippocampus."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058264692","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"42","pagesFromTo":"5830-5842","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.jneurosci.org/content/42/30/5830","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630bf094097076263e75024","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Gmerek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8d1ec5cb-e678-46d5-ade7-b1744f6dd086"},{"objectId":"6630bf094097076263e75023","name":"Jadwiga","lastName":"Jabłońska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"531c3efc-1e42-4fd9-94c7-e7ef818602a1"},{"objectId":"6630bf094097076263e75022","name":"Anna Maria","lastName":"Lech","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"971b454b-33f5-4cff-9480-b01097c2aff9"},{"objectId":"6630bf094097076263e75021","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Brzdąk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"39929516-6c1c-4eef-81c8-8b444cd816fd"},{"objectId":"5e7094ab878c28a0473c1598","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Lebida","uuid":"B8D668E00FD64F9170EEC2C16260EBA9517BEC7B97CAAC90CB1DE804AC048F191088C054DF3AE85E3C1774F79DBA426E274C30190BA82E4857F2C735A7C424A8","orcidId":"0000-0002-9299-0624","documentHash":"a547fd8e-2290-40d4-be69-e3362ce2034f"},{"objectId":"5e709437878c28a0473b846c","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Wiera","uuid":"E3D90A583366252769C8E18A159C1BDEF1149F497CB8344373D030DDA06D678ADA3B635D16B424FFFEFC80F7714891291796E9A52601A917181F25CC20471497","orcidId":"0000-0003-2489-4451","documentHash":"f57c1f21-e99c-4246-b3f7-5f7dcfd5d7b3"},{"objectId":"5e70922f878c28a047391608","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Mozrzymas","uuid":"B4C74D0EDFEF6BD47D1CEECD49DA921F3FF00EC2D2C879305F1CF9D0AAE1F790E811CE0D545A1B759D6FE6FA85A7562C5616771919F9DD7199C0B69AE141A812","orcidId":"0000-0003-1674-1818","documentHash":"4074253f-dc29-42d5-8b4f-7777814b6e18"}],"doi":"10.1523/jneurosci.1458-21.2022"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Planning for Sustainable Development of Tourism in the Tatra National Park Buffer Zone Using the MCDA Approach","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a1a9","mniswId":"14450","title":"Miscellanea Geographica","doi":null,"issn":"0867-6046","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"89aee2d7-8c06-4d5f-88a6-e4f8d34b2bcc"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629c9c734097070cd3480b3b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923d878c28a047392376","5e7091f3878c28a04738d9ff"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\r\n               <jats:p>This study aims to develop practice guidelines for the preparation of local regulations promoting sustainable tourism planning for the area located at the entrance to the Tatra National Park, Poland.

These activities were divided into two priorities: sustainable tourist activities (hiking and walking, cycling, horseback riding) and investments that would have an environmental impact (downhill skiing, recreational infrastructure, commerce, catering). The analysis criteria covered the tourist attractiveness of the area and its suitability for a given activity (benefit), as well as requirements concerning the protection of nature, topographical relief, landscape, and traditional land use (cost). These criteria were evaluated using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and summarized using the Weighted Linear Combination (WLC). The results showed the high attractiveness of the area for both priorities. However, due to the area's unique nature, investments having an environmental impact must be limited to the vicinity of the existing built-up areas. The use of MCDA supports decision-making at the local scale, significantly enhances the transparency of the results, and facilitates communication with local communities. The comparison with the current local law provisions showed the shortcomings of the methods used to date when preparing planning

Based on these values, the lifespan of PRBs were\r\ncalculated for variable hydraulic gradient (0.005–0.020) and P–PO4 concentrations (0.1–5.0 mg L–1).\r\nThe lifespan of AAC ranged from 1 to 5 y for the highest tested concentration (5.0 mg L–1) regarding\r\nto hydraulic gradient.

According to Żelazowski, the novel is historically credible and faithfully depicts the reality of the third century AD, especially with regard to the aspects of the world presented mentioned in the title. However, several serious reservations can be formulated with respect to Żelazowski’s argument. Żelazowski does not pay sufficient attention to the dispute over the existence of an original from that period — some scholars regard versions A and B of the novel, from the fifth/sixth century as independent works in their own right — and does not refer to arguments against the emergence of such a text that would challenge his conclusions. When arguing for a realistic use of money in the novel, Żelazowski refers to Richard Duncan-Jones’ study, excessively moderating his criticism of the inadequacy of the sums in the novel with regard to the reality and failing to mention his conclusion concerning the lack of usefulness of the work to historians in this respect. In his argumentation Żelazowski also quotes an article by Jean-Pierre Callu, who proposes considerable and unjustified modifications of amounts in the work to make them more credible, and, in addition, does not take into account elements of the novel, indicated by Duncan-Jones, that contradict the thesis concerning coherence of the monetary system outlined in it. Żelazowski does present the question of the significance of money and culture in the work generally correctly, though one-sidedly, writing mainly about the historical and social aspects. The failure to consider the role of these elements in the structure of the action of the novel, their literary nature as well as the failure to take into account philological research lead to overinterpretations and inaccuracies in the analysis of the piece. The polemic ends with an observation that the failure to take into account a literary studies-based approach in the analysis of the novel leads to an overestimation of its credibility and significance as a source faithfully presenting the reality of the third century AD."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058264714","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"347-358","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.przegladhistoryczny.pl/sites/ph.ihuw.pl/files/ph/zbadzki_347-358.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602f89fe9543c7410626f5c1","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Zbądzki","uuid":"6989DFDD74E3460D92C0D11777A6F025914DA3CB4BB027667206D3135422E971667E85A68F0B723223FE49CC1A84CD202580D6ABF9C93D180F3A2E169C4D5B39","orcidId":"0000-0002-6268-5469","documentHash":"830ce4e3-2c6d-4e30-8c72-0e4be8244af1"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-242-3838-5","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[],"type":"BOOK","title":"Od doświadczenia estetycznego do doświadczenia języka.

For some time now, however, experience has seen its resurgence, reconstituting its cognitive value in academic reflection, while also yielding a significant transfiguration in literature research. The turn towards experience, observable in Polish literature studies for almost two decades, may derive from the conviction, aptly phrased by Ryszard Nycz, that “Literature devoid of the bond with experience would inevitably become an empty, self-reversible game.” The main purpose of the thesis is to situate reflections on ekphrasis in the perspective of the category of experience, with particular emphasis on aesthetic and experience of language experience. The starting point is to adopt a view of aesthetic experience that renders the phenomenon a methodologically valuable reference system in a research project with the primary task of exploring the phenomenon of ekphrasis. The argument is formulated that the subjective opening to the world of art, the encounter with a work of art drives the process of writing. On the analytical ground, however, the description of an art object is approached as a special form of articulation of aesthetic experience. Provided that the interpretative key to modernist ekphrases may be the category of aesthetic experience, on the level of the research concept, the assumption is made that the act of literary expression, which to some extent is any description of a work of art, adopts the structure of subjective reference to reality, which is invariably mediated by language. Language also mediates the act of perception of a work of art and its interpretation, since these are processes that take place under the constraints set by discourse. The work has a tripartite structure, but the main considerations are preceded by an introduction and thorough prolegomena, consisting of two separate chapters. The preface and the first chapter are of a purely methodological nature, while the subsequent chapter introduces a historical discussion of ekphrases from antiquity to modernism. The broad historical and literary outline is extended by reflections on aesthetics, which situates ekphrasis in the context of categories of experience; the individual links of the chapter are also accompanied by analyses of different literary examples. The first part of the thesis has a fairly homogeneous structure, as it consists of a series of analyses, to some extent taking on the character of a series of a few “case studies,” captured through the distinguished modernist modalities of aesthetic experience: path and encounter, contemplation and ecstasy, followed by analyses of significant textual examples from the area of native modernist literature. The second part of the thesis presents greater diversity and brings a reflection on the bundle of various issues and problems, which, in contrast to the considerations in the first part, are rather on the side of ekphrastic techniques and writing strategies. In the following chapters of the second part of the work, the argumentation gradually advances to the level of a broader conceptual approach, based on a diagnosis of the challenges and difficulties faced by the authors in their efforts to describe the work of art, seeking to identify and discuss selected discursive practices and concrete writing solutions. In the first part of the thesis, the most important contexts complementing the analysis of literary texts are structured against philosophical and aesthetic theories that prevailed in early modernism. In the second part, however, this essential context is outlined with reference to theoretical and literary reflections focused on issues closely related to ekphrasis. In the first chapter of the second part of the work, the influence of pioneering trends in European art on the formation of the language of ekphrasis is thoroughly analyzed. The reflections focus on the search for examples of how methods of artwork description adapted to new artistic phenomena. The material for analysis is based on critical texts and reviews published in the modernist press, analyzing ekphrases of Japanese ukiyo-e woodcuts and descriptions of avant- -garde artworks. The following chapter addresses the ekphrastic device for rendering voice to silent works of art. Reflections and analyses of poetic texts refer to issues of mutual relations and struggles between verbal and visual representation that organize the space of relations between word and image. The next, and last, chapter of the second part of the work examines the issue of ekphrasis as a means of artwork interpretation. It identifies and discusses two basic directions of its development, 1) a work of art is the starting point of a broader reflection, which, by detaching from the work itself, transcends the ekphrastic description and, concurrently, delineates the direction of interpretation; 2) the interpretation is elaborated against a meticulous description and an insightful analysis of a selected piece or detail. The last part of the thesis comprises two additional chapters, furthermore supplements and concludes the considerations opened in its second part. The first chapter discusses the transformations of the language of ekphrasis, illustrated by examples found in the poetry of Zbigniew Herbert and Aleksander Wat. The second chapter explores the issue of inexpressiveness, addressing this issue with the examples of essays by Zbigniew Herbert. The chapters of the third part of the thesis define a certain point of access, stemming from the presumption that the reflection on the texts of the early modernists has to be related to the development of ekphrasis in the following decades, to how its language(s) evolved in the face of new phenomena in art, new aesthetic and existential experiences (including war experiences). Concurrently, the last part of the work suggests a certain starting point for the analysis of ekphrastic writing in postmodern literature by expanding relevant contexts and applying the tools elaborated in the first chapters of the work. The inclusion of reflections on ekphrasis in the Polish modernist literature under the category of experience is a way to adopt such a research perspective and view of the analyzed literature so as to highlight existence, transition, and involvement in the text. The research conclusions result in formulating a conviction that at the source of ekphrasis lies the desire to express the subjective experience of a work of art, a broad complex of experiences developing between admiring art and writing about art. Moreover, the model of experience always organizes in a certain way the manner of description, and is tangible in that way, being the source that initiates a specific process, and remains constantly present in its course."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058264717","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8cd","mniswId":"55200","name":"Towarzystwo Autorów i Wydawców Prac Naukowych Universitas","documentHash":"47eb0c9e-b87a-484a-adb7-2ce22a9cf735"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://repo.uni.opole.pl/info/book/UO562f44fe9f9a417382cfe55d3a5542d8/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61f3633875234061bbd73ae1","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Swoboda","uuid":"D0F031A5682B6C99DF1858EE2E1B8C8FA61014D6400271623BAE7BC0E1ED6DF059F2B8D9CE9C451247509946C198FB424E21450DDAC1A7D7F831E3082EE5FBAA","orcidId":"0000-0002-5868-5562","documentHash":"7367b0d3-3971-4568-82ca-a301f7f2e557"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["asthma","allergy","children","copper","selenium","vitamins","zinc"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Micronutrients and the Risk of Allergic Diseases in School Children","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","doi":null,"issn":"1661-7827","eissn":"1660-4601","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e236e16e-7430-4ac3-800c-033637860e22"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6335870b4097074d8cb35371","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b00a6","5e7092e2878c28a04739eae1","5e7094e7878c28a0473c699e","5e7094ec878c28a0473c6e67","658c2f334097076c14535ffd","5e70940c878c28a0473b573d","658c2f334097076c14535fff"]},"issue":"19","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Microelements and vitamins are believed to have immunomodulatory effects.

The EFL curriculum is largely based on Catholic doctrine. The current study examined the opinions and attitudes of students attending a university in Poland regarding sexuality education in public secondary schools. A sample of 498 first- and second-year university students completed a questionnaire that collected information on demographic characteristics, the student’s sources of information about sexual health, and their opinions and attitudes related to sexuality education. Over 80% of the students used the Internet as a source of sexual health information while far fewer students cited teachers/classroom activities (24.3%). Over three-quarter of females (79.5%) and males (75.9%) agreed that it is important to have sexual health education as part of the secondary school curriculum. Students’ responses to the question on the importance of sexual health education in schools did not differ significantly based on their level of religious commitment. However, few women (12.9%) and men (9.2%) rated the current effectiveness of sexuality education in schools as “high.” For topics that should be covered in the curriculum, the students rated birth control methods, abortion, sexual orientation/lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender issues, and sexually transmitted diseases the highest. The findings indicate that Polish university students view school-based sexual health education as important but currently ineffective. Policies to reform public school-based sexual health in Poland are needed to ensure that Polish youth have the information and skills to protect and enhance their sexual health."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058264723","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6298b2f340970757143b1d7f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"31","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"68ba0fa1-a49a-4328-bb57-5cc985f024bb"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"31","pagesFromTo":"1-7","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/cjhs.2021-0025","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709228878c28a047390d38","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Perenc","uuid":"BB2E46E1255F2F6D1B96A6FE9F58F696F51BE770CEA9E9E0EF2A14904BBF558560FA7769CB76E88E379A74C86DF2E2034030BA5A31C8A5ADAE6C171CBBB6EBA5","orcidId":"0000-0001-8378-2340","documentHash":"c80b3680-890f-4484-ab7c-34c6b48a377f"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fa69","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Pęczkowski","uuid":"F628148644A0B345897772991E6FF5AED67A85321C0A1830FC2B543913B21AE222ED181B4571D5888DF7287E24E5F33451C7D36018D0812DC96D7463E82201A8","orcidId":"0000-0001-5200-4845","documentHash":"46c55083-d64c-47df-8ea0-2b4bf9e700d7"}],"doi":"10.3138/cjhs.2021-0025"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Upper Silesia","Borderland","Microliterature","Minor literature","Transculturalism","History of literature"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709438878c28a0473b8500"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Confluences: On the possibility of describing a transcultural history of (micro)literature – the Upper Silesian perspective","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d631","mniswId":"20390","title":"World Literature Studies","doi":null,"issn":"1337-9275","eissn":"1337-9690","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f0da3dbb-6a35-4dee-af2d-96af9a5fc11f"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"635796344097072c1f9eebd7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709438878c28a0473b8500"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Any attempt to fully describe the history of a particular literature is doomed to fail. Such a description requires simplifications and generalizations, and necessitates selection. The same is true for literatures of contact zones, which are transcultural in their nature. The history of such literatures should reflect their character and accommodate their transcultural dimension. By using the example of Upper Silesian microliterature, the author presents the challenges a researcher would be confronted with even while approaching literatures of small range, both geographically and in number of recipients (microliteratures), referring to the theory of polysystems and transcultural studies. She discusses the nodal points of the postulated transcultural history of Upper Silesian microliterature, namely: 1) works in the Silesian language, 2) works in dominant languages, 3) translations, and 4) proposals for its literary canon. Concurrently, she argues that Upper Silesian literature cannot be examined in isolation from its transcultural context, the confluences of German and Slavic cultures, as well as the history of the cultural melting pot in which it was developed and the character of which is still noticeable today."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058264725","journalIssue":{"objectId":"635796344097072c1f9eebd8","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"b856deac-26cc-47b6-832c-935311e8c71b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"60-78","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sav.sk/?lang=sk&doc=journal-list&part=article_response_page&journal_article_no=29018","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709438878c28a0473b8500","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Pospiszil-Hofmańska","uuid":"9E91CB2FE9976F2138F2A5D95626F0F19DCDED2E86F2EB12E1FB4CA4094301FF4BF5FCD1D4B97E7AE3218B9D4C7E526BB42B9B3360829F38099155A75E271254","orcidId":"0000-0001-7622-5394","documentHash":"ae8ed573-856a-4e85-bb0e-922520ee2cb0"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["linear mixed models","commodity funds","determinants of effectiveness","Poland"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","uid":"bnV99khMVeG3t9dh4evZESg","uuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","parentUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","rootUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","name":"Politechnika Koszalińska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092c5878c28a04739c54b","5e7092c4878c28a04739c525","5e7092c4878c28a04739c4ef"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Application of linear mixed models to evaluate the determinants of effectiveness of commodity funds","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e710e5046e0fb0001bb6a1d","mniswId":null,"title":"Procedia Computer Science","doi":null,"issn":"1877-0509","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"dbe5d51e-2d97-4014-bfa6-9c68f019e6cb"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-09-07","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":{"objectId":"6351126e409707413d314bbc","doi":null,"title":"26th KES International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information & Engineering Systems KES2022","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":null,"ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/procedia-computer-science/vol/207/suppl/C","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"20eb8e6e-bf10-4fa2-b0ee-39125286b842","publisher":null,"openAccess":null},"_version":4,"objectId":"6358bf254097076d01894199","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c28771574195a","mniswId":"1113","startDate":null,"endDate":null,"fullName":"International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information and Engineering Systems","shortName":"KES","city":null,"country":null,"website":null,"isEdition":false,"documentHash":"bb65bc19-2aab-4b61-9a0e-d6b41e5b1e74"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c4878c28a04739c4ef","5e7092c5878c28a04739c54b","5e7092c4878c28a04739c525"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper presents the methodological assumptions for the linear mixed model and shows its usefulness in research on the factors determining the efficiency of investment funds.

The Sharpe ratio was adopted as the fund's efficiency criterion. The subjective scope of the research covered all funds in Poland which at the end of December 2019 declared their investment portfolio exposure to commodity markets. The time scope of the study was 5 years, and annual data were used for the analysis. Based on the use of a linear mixed model, it was shown that there is a statistically significant negative relationship between the effectiveness of the studied funds and their operating time. This means that commodity funds that have been operating on the market for a shorter period of time achieve better investment

This is especially important because NEB overlaps with the resumption of the reproductive cycle, which determines the profitability of herds. This study analysed the relationship between NEB and the time of resumption of reproductive activity in cows with varying genetic potential (Simmental and Holstein-Friesian), fed a similar diet (TMR). The aim of the study was to analyse the dependencies between NEB markers and changes in progesterone levels between 25 and 31 days postpartum. A strong positive correlation was shown between daily milk production (DMP) and loss of body condition (LBCS; 0.772; p ≤ 0.05). These parameters were associated with the levels of NEB biomarkers. Higher values of NEB indicators (LBCS, C16:0, C18:1, NEFA, and BHBA) were usually noted during periods with higher DMP (II and III). The trends observed were confirmed by positive correlation coefficients (r), which ranged from 0.324 to 0.810 (p ≤ 0.05). The reverse trend was noted for glucose and leptin, which decreased as productivity increased, as confirmed by r values from −0.368 to −0.530 (p ≤ 0.05). In both breeds, the glucose and leptin levels decreased as DMP increased. Higher values for NEB indicators were shown to be negatively correlated with progesterone levels (r from −0.300 to −0.712; p ≤ 0.05), and a lower progesterone level was associated with a longer calving-to-first-service interval and calving-to-conception interval. The rate of postpartum triglyceride release depends on daily milk production, and therefore the adaptability of the liver should be considered an important element of mitigation of the consequences of NEB. This may have practical applications by extending productive life, which is often shortened due to deteriorating reproductive performance."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058264731","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6299ff444097072c2b7cdf82","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"5475c55d-b192-438c-8561-c33f1be87b27"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/12/5/448/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6299ff444097072c2b7cdf80","name":"Beata","lastName":"Głowińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"20b8243e-46b7-4940-a00b-b71f0e43c2e3"},{"objectId":"61a1a6387523402fabdffba0","name":"Ilona","lastName":"Strączek","uuid":"9EF37C541AA9C52C8130EEC969BE1BCEAD82E60D98B1896DD9AD7829F4E3EE9DD95BECADD7BBED4FFC3FF19C75ADEF388CD4CA07CE0AC8CD03B56C4FA4977A8D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8d30dd6b-854d-4e13-80a6-ca39905ee5af"},{"objectId":"5e709294878c28a0473984eb","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Młynek","uuid":"5BE6BC361D9582B15084708066D8619B4ABDB0911CA66FC93EDD6B5FD619D5922AB5DD52392BE497493E553B342A24E9FB1214CF5ED58D143E19DF7711929455","orcidId":"0000-0002-0202-3340","documentHash":"7a3b19da-557d-4335-ab76-a45802e5e421"}],"doi":"10.3390/metabo12050448"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"9786156474032","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Comparative Constitutionalism in Central Europe : Analysis on Certain Central and Eastern European Countries","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":448,"publicationPlace":"Miskolc-Budapest","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6336be48409707141629539d","editors":[{"objectId":"6336be48409707141629539f","name":"László","lastName":"Trócsányi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3a419d13-9e8a-4003-a3b2-939172021bae"},{"objectId":"6336be48409707141629539e","name":"Lóránt","lastName":"Csink","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b17d8c0e-eccd-4af5-97ae-a228087c59cc"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["6336be48409707141629539e","6336be48409707141629539f"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058264733","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":"2786-359X","series":"Legal Studies on Central Europe","translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"619f7c5f2467f07d9871b581","mniswId":null,"name":"Central European Academic Publishing","documentHash":"1ce17365-f276-4278-ad09-20d4c07eee17"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.54171/2022.lcslt.ccice","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":"10.54171/2022.lcslt.ccice"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["napoje energetyczne","przygotowanie sportowe","ćwiczenia fizyczne"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"608135d42467f0276870e0c9","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Instytut Nauk o Sporcie, Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The effectiveness of physiotherapy for CuTS is inconclusive. The aim of\nthis systematic review was to evaluate the effects of physiotherapy in the conservative treatment of\nCuTS. Methods: The six databases were searched from December 2020 to March 2022. The inclusion\ncriteria were randomised controlled trials, case series, and case reports that evaluate the effects of\nphysiotherapy in the treatment of adult participants with diagnosis CuTS. A total of 11 studies met the\neligibility criteria, capturing a total of 187 participants. Results: In three types of papers, pain, muscle\nstrength, and limitation of upper limb function were the most frequently assessed characteristics.\nPhysiotherapy was most often based on manual therapy, neurodynamic techniques, and electrical\nmodalities. One clinical trial rated the risk of bias “high” and the other two “some concerns”. In\ncase-series designs, five studies rated the risk of bias as “serious” and three as “moderate”. Most\nof the studies showed a significant improvement in the clinical condition, also in the follow-up\nstudy. Only one clinical trial showed no therapeutic effect. Conclusion: There is no possibility of\nrecommending the best method of physiotherapy in clinical practice for people with CuTS based on\nthe results of this systematic review. More high-quality studies are required."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058264740","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62d0091040970733e796a87d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"11","number":"14","doi":null,"documentHash":"c92dfc2b-1675-42a5-9f03-7dcc0077e434"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/11/14/4247/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6336ba184097071416293db1","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Granek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8b43a880-c0c7-40d2-ac56-864373aa00dc"},{"objectId":"6336ba184097071416293db0","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Domin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d39ed179-cb02-4d54-9455-c9d16ad8e301"},{"objectId":"6336ba184097071416293daf","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Buczek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bfd42c1b-41ad-4b44-a960-8dff84751724"},{"objectId":"6336ba184097071416293dae","name":"César","lastName":"Fernández-de-las

Oficjalnie mówi się o kryzysie autorytetu nauczyciela, ale i o jego braku. Dzisiejsza edukacja – być może bardziej niż kiedykolwiek – wymaga zatem pochylenia się nad teoretycznymi i praktycznymi aspektami autorytetu nauczyciela, który w dobie zmian społeczno-kulturowych i wyzwań edukacji dla zrównoważonego rozwoju staje przed zupełnie nowymi wymaganiami w podejściu do wiedzy i ucznia. Stąd też celem podjętych badań była próba poznania opinii i postaw uczniów ze szkół podstawowych i średnich na temat autorytetu współczesnego nauczyciela. Badaniami objęto 158 uczniów szkoły podstawowej (N = 87) i szkoły średniej (N = 71). Wyniki badań wykazały, że – mimo obserwowanego kryzysu autorytetów – zarówno dzieci, jak i młodzież potrzebują nauczycieli będących godnymi naśladowania wzorami osobowymi. Wobec celów i zadań, wynikających z idei edukacji dla zrównoważonego rozwoju, pojawia się więc oczywista potrzeba przywrócenia należnej rangi autorytetowi nauczyciela. Należy podkreślić, że autorytet, stanowiąc istotne źródło wpływu pedagogicznego, powinien stawać się nie celem, lecz sensem działań nauczyciela."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Nowadays appreciating an authority undergoes perspective and relative assessment. Officially it is stated that we not only face an authority crisis but even lack of it. Due to the above, current education may require much more than ever before to give attention to theoretical and practical aspects of a teacher authority which in times of social and cultural changes together with innovative ideas towards a balanced development, still faces entirely new demands in an approach both towards knowledge and the student. Thus, the aim of the research was an attempt to learn about opinions and attitudes of primary and upper secondary school students on the issue of contemporary teacher authority. The study comprised 158 students including: primary school (N = 87) and upper secondary school (N = 71). The results revealed that even though there is an authority crisis, children and the youth need teachers who may be perceived as a role model. In view of the aims and tasks resulting from the idea of a balanced growth there appears an obvious need to regain proper respect of a teacher authority. Moreover, an authority, which denotes a significant source of educational influence, should not become the aim in itself but the meaning of teacher’s actions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058264750","journalIssue":{"objectId":"633aad8a4097076a063c701d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"35","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"7db1069b-84a6-4243-9452-4d98dc3b40ea"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"35","pagesFromTo":"125-138","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"pol","title":"Kryzys autorytetu nauczyciela – konsekwencje i wyzwania wobec edukacji dla zrównoważonego rozwoju"}],"publicUri":"https://journals.umcs.pl/j/article/view/12938/9953","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b63c","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Antas-Jaszczuk","uuid":"18C21AD1AB9CA8EB7A736F391E96152812B70C0472F4F14FF465535E2627CBA5A8F8AACE64D5622B559F304784B61D3BBADFE8245DB3B48FAA80CB9268561430","orcidId":"0000-0002-0558-8953","documentHash":"d7c9710d-950d-436e-a6c7-f24bb64248a4"}],"doi":"10.17951/j.2022.35.2.125-138"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["bankowość inwestycyjna","zielone finanse","sekurytyzacja"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"633586374097074d8cb34a12","doi":null,"title":"Podstawy bankowości.

The evaluation of natural resources of landscape is a basic environmental research method useful for environmental modeling, landscape planning and tourism development. Vegetation is an important landscape natural resource (a component of environment) having a great meaning including tourism. The aim is to present the original methodic approach to evaluation of landscape natural values, with special regard to vegetation using its high indicative environmental value, for needs of tourism aspect at local level o planning. This methodic approach has been implemented and tested in Otwock commune area, central Poland, the European Lowland. The assessment took place in several stages: field research, division of the studied area into spatial-landscape units, mapping of vegetation and other distinguishing natural elements, selection of criteria of assessment and system of evaluation, conducting the assessment, classification of landscape values into categories and formulating guidelines to management including tourist use. The criteria used in the assessment were selected in consideration of landscape components with emphasis on vegetation, as well as elements connected with tourist attractiveness. The following criteria were used in landscape evaluation: occurrence of natural protected areas, occurrence of natural protected objects, degree of vegetation naturalness, vegetation resistance to recreational use, vegetation attractiveness for tourists, diversity of vegetation, occurrence of surface water, diversity of terrain relief. Values of vegetation/landscape have been proven and four value categories of terrains distinguished in tourist aspect. The results have shown that presented approach to landscape evaluation, with using vegetation indicative role in the context of the whole landscape, is relatively simple and may be helpful for various decisions of local governments concerning tourist use and other functions. The originality of this approach lies in giving more importance to vegetation in assessing the overall landscape. It may be convenient in cases, where values of inanimate nature are not highly spectacular and/or information on vegetation is more detailed and also if commune authorities want to do the study on their own, with a limited number of experts. It has been shown what and how to use possible evaluation criteria in practical application with certain available landscape resources. The criteria used in the assessment are very universal, especially in areas of rich vegetation, as Otwock commune is. The assessment method and results were understandable to a wide range of officials and specialists in Otwock. The results confirmed high quality of natural values in tourist aspect in the study area.

W jej słowach mają swoje miejsce wszyscy zakochani od początku świata aż do ostatniego dnia ludzkości. Odnajdzie w niej siebie miłość nastoletnia, czasem zaskoczona i bezradna, i ta, którą odmierzają kolejne jubileusze. Odnajdzie w niej siebie dojrzała wierność małżonków i młodzieńcze zauroczenie od pierwszego wejrzenia. Starałem się tak formułować komentarz aktualizujący sens dosłowny, aby żadnej miłości nie wykluczyć z szerokiego i otwartego kręgu oddziaływania biblijnego poematu. Jest on na tyle inkluzyjny, że każdy człowiek może w nim odczytać swoją relację z najbliższą mu osobą. Aktualizacja poematu obejmuje też sens duchowy, zwany symbolicznym, alegorycznym, ponaddosłownym, figuratywnym lub mistycznym. Wychodzę z założenia, że nie jest on sprzeczny z sensem dosłownym, lecz został nabudowany na jego bazie przez pokolenia czytelników, którzy w Pieśni nad pieśniami widzieli nie tylko utwór erotyczny, ale i słowo Boże. Ośmielę się nawet stwierdzić, że im głębiej wnikniemy w bogactwo sensu dosłownego, tym większe będą nasze szanse, by sens duchowy mógł rozwinąć swoje skrzydła. W tradycji Kościoła oba te sposoby rozumienia Pieśni nad pieśniami współistniały na przestrzeni wieków. Wymownym może być fakt, że św. Jan Paweł II odwoływał się do Pieśni nad pieśniami w swoim nauczaniu etycznym skierowanym do chrześcijańskich małżonków, natomiast Benedykt XVI wydobył w swoich katechezach całe piękno miłości Jezusa do Kościoła zawarte w tradycji starożytnych i średniowiecznych teologów komentujących Pieśń nad pieśniami. Zauważmy też, jakże często papież Franciszek, mówiąc o Kościele, dodaje jakby jego drugie imię Sposa di Cristo (Oblubienica Chrystusa)” (fragm. Wstępu)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058264760","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":"1","volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":"Biblia Impulsy","translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb864","mniswId":"39400","name":"Księgarnia św.

The main aim of the research was to evaluate the mechanism of formation of the surface texture and to assess the intensity and effectiveness of the machining process. It is shown that additional movements of the workpiece significantly affect the formation of the machining traces generated by the elementary phenomena of micro-cutting, scratching, grooving, etc. As a result, these combined and complex interactions lead to the formation of the surface topography of the workpieces. Based on the research results, it can be concluded that the use of an active workpiece holder in the CDF process allows changes in the intensity of the machining process. Moreover, the active holder allows modification of the surface smoothing process. The intensity of the treatment process depends primarily on the location of the workpiece holder in the appropriate energy area of the work charge. On the other hand, the efficiency of the workpiece surface smoothing depends on the parameters of the oscillation and rotational movements of the workpiece mounted in the active holder. The presented research results show that the use of an active holder, enabling rotation and oscillation of the workpiece, may lead to a more effective use of smoothing processes in CDF machines. The analysis of the results shows that the values of the Sdr and Sa parameters are more strongly dependent on the vibration frequency and increase with its increasing frequency. This is undoubtedly the result of the concentration of smoothing marks on the smoothed surface. However, with regard to the rotational speed of the object, this relationship is non-monotonic, and its greatest influence occurs at its intermediate values. It follows that this activity does not have a significant impact on the generation of the number of smoothing marks and the degree of their concentration. The research methodology proposed in the work allows the initial determination of the dependence of the results of the CDF process on the machining parameters, including the parameters of the active holder. This methodology can also be used for machining materials other than AISI 304 steel."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058264762","journalIssue":{"objectId":"632c496d4097076d6d4414a4","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"19","doi":null,"documentHash":"499a419e-9b9b-4c7c-8bcf-7aa662450454"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"6762","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/19/6762/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63371cc540970714162c36cd","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Juniewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1b681992-0096-4101-bf38-cab6473def7d"},{"objectId":"6160fea975234017e050df29","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Zawadka","uuid":"5E0E63FC1D67B177147C081EABAFCA8E1C48C6A8ED31B0E79955BD63F5F14EEACEE865554CB79B606258240A9390B49A7C58D5A9FE6F3B7228E0839751BB1D2B","orcidId":"0000-0003-1867-0048","documentHash":"03c684cc-5096-40fc-ad4a-f167a5a06abf"},{"objectId":"5e70942b878c28a0473b77fc","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Sutowska","uuid":"E0AADCC3E6829E93C23107983D5E3920E2628CBAAA8531AA45F5890890F48435C7DAA92209A69F46F1C4D071CE3319EA654C4118C1346CC86A8058A475A5ABC7","orcidId":"0000-0003-0321-0022","documentHash":"3aa930ca-2bb7-4c7f-be80-ef7f95236607"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a9b4","name":"Czesław","lastName":"Łukianowicz","uuid":"D345BF058D949E8D16AA10010878BABB939B73B38C129963E74FB1E9E8326776CA59A0D966015423F3C733D16CC6FD45916801E64F160FDAD3BD98BCCE335FD0","orcidId":"0000-0001-8885-1317","documentHash":"38efdb86-b313-4a53-9956-c586e7cd6f3a"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a99a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kukiełka","uuid":"4EABDEB719358ABC35ECD16A42366C463FF07EE1BEB571D5F8CE0B7EE6F86769AAE372C24A7B023718A372057198DE544A81D720A4B6F04995A37B358C155D6E","orcidId":"0000-0002-3271-3852","documentHash":"5882e009-d302-40da-827f-e120eb7a5546"},{"objectId":"5e709204878c28a04738ead2","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Plichta","uuid":"923330B8F852434BB01351E1CFCDDDF5029C7BC26E5DABB30A473EEFD5723FAD1DCC77CDE305A67A76A599DA46D01F3A3CF188099826BF7FC11F8C38013FA6A4","orcidId":"0000-0002-6642-5517","documentHash":"dd9d8186-e2d9-4eb7-b08c-b06408629a18"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15196762"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"635790124097072c1f9e78c5","doi":null,"title":"Między ideowością a pragmatyzmem - tworzenie, wykładnia i stosowanie prawa.

consider classical dynamics of a one-dimensional system of N particles bouncing on an oscillating mirror in the presence of gravitational field. The particles behave like hard balls and they are resonantly driven by the mirror. We identify the manifolds the particles move on and derive the effective secular Hamiltonian for resonant motion of the particles. Proper choice of time periodic oscillations of the mirror allows for engineering of the effective behaviour of the particles. In particular, the system can behave like an N-dimensional fictitious particle moving in an N-dimensional crystalline structure.

Dexamethasone-induced Ras-related\nprotein 1(Dexras1) has been reported to be involved in nervous system damage in autoimmune\nencephalitis and multiple sclerosis. However, whether Dexras1 participates in dysdifferentiation\nof oligodendrocytes and myelin injury after SAH has yet to be examined, which is the reason for\ncreating the research content of this article. Here, intracerebroventricular lentiviral administration\nwas used to modulate Dexras1 levels in order to determine its functional influence on neurological\ninjury after SAH. Immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, and Western blotting\nmethods, were used to investigate the effects of Dexras1 on demyelination, glial cell activation, and\ndifferentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) after SAH. Primary rat brain neurons were\ntreated with oxyhemoglobin to verify the association between Dexras1 and cAMP-CREB. The results\nshowed that Dexras1 levels were significantly increased upon in vivo SAH model, accompanied by\nOPC differentiation disturbances and myelin injury. Dexras1 overexpression significantly worsened\nOPC dysdifferentiation and myelin injury after SAH. In contrast, Dexras1 knockdown ameliorated\nmyelin injury, OPC dysdifferentiation, and glial cell activation. Further research of the underlying\nmechanism discovered that the cAMP-CREB pathway was inhibited after Dexras1 overexpression in\nthe in vitro model of SAH.

These compounds crystallise with a tetragonal structure (space group I41/acd) and are characterised by a deficiency of R atoms in their formula unit (R5−δRh6Sn18, δ≪1). Recently, we documented that the vacancies δ and atomic local defects (often induced by doping) are a reason for the enhancement in the superconducting transition temperature Tc of these materials, as well as metallic (δ=0) or semimetallic (δ≠0) behaviours in their normal state. Our band structure calculations show the pseudogap at a binding energy of −0.3 eV for the stoichiometric compounds, which can be easily moved towards the Fermi level by vacancies δ. As a result, dychotomic nature in electric transport of R5Rh6Sn18 (metallic or semimetallic resistivity) depends on δ, which has not been interpreted before. We have shown that the densities of states are very similar for various R5Rh6Sn18 compounds, and they practically do not depend on the metal R, while they are determined by the Rh d-and Sn s- and p-electron states. The band structure calculations for Sc5Rh6Sn18 have not been reported yet. We also found that the electronic specific heat coefficients γ0 for the stoichiometric samples were always larger with respect to the γ0 of the respective samples with vacancies at the R sites, which correlates with the results of ab initio calculations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058264774","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6241a3072467f0290d2dfe70","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"7","doi":null,"documentHash":"b570d4dc-59ac-4043-b660-8f9a1479c58d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"2451","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/7/2451/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092e6878c28a04739eef5","name":"Józef","lastName":"Deniszczyk","uuid":"7E18126C1737EA35DD84AEBA1469869A0DBCBF5A10C38794F6BD03D4256A187249520C876071C55DA6160FC649F7AAB283BC705EA0303C0437B6D67F2DADE1BA","orcidId":"0000-0002-6340-8447","documentHash":"6016fa6a-a6bd-48c1-ba97-79809f7ca893"},{"objectId":"5e7092e6878c28a04739ee82","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Ślebarski","uuid":"8F32D48BD55FC22159D305FC61BCF68B4ACF6F3FCD2A777B35F4728D830380ED0419DB7ECF2F23F1078E6FAB6163C0765C25F05E5012E4CF01DA308D471D2623","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e05adeff-bbf9-4e65-b869-ab4dcbc9736b"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15072451"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Atmospheric Science","Environmental Science (miscellaneous)"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df08","uid":"bkIJHJpQNKsrvtM8Wh9DD9w","uuid":"62b1bfdd-fc86-44b6-8f44-098cdc87f941","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df08","parentUuid":"62b1bfdd-fc86-44b6-8f44-098cdc87f941","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df08","rootUuid":"62b1bfdd-fc86-44b6-8f44-098cdc87f941","name":"Akademia Pożarnicza","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a1878c28a0473997dc","5e70935e878c28a0473a8436","5e7092d3878c28a04739d892"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Health Exposure Assessment of Firefighters Caused by PAHs in PM4 and TSP after Firefighting Operations","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547724b","mniswId":"2021","title":"Atmosphere","doi":null,"issn":"2073-4433","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"00275c51-5236-4dd8-bc8c-39af87e7bbb0"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6339abef4097072262495ef7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d892","5e7092a1878c28a0473997dc","5e70935e878c28a0473a8436"]},"issue":"8","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>Among the many different chemicals in the air, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) pose a serious threat to human health.

A polycrystalline powder of silica-based material with crystalline honeycomb structure (of SBA-15 type) was synthesized. The primary material was calcined and then lined with N-[3-(tri-methoxy-silyl)propyl]ethylenediamine to coordinate to cations Ba2+, Sn2+, Fe2+ or Cu2+. All six specimens’ properties were investigated using X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and nitrogen adsorption techniques. The unit-cell constant being edge-length of the hexagonal frame was determined for each sample and occurred the largest one for the pure silica material, smaller for the ethylenediamine-covered silica support and the smallest one (and approximately the same) for immobilized specimens. The shrinkage of internal nanotubes resulted from subsequent treatment of the basic siliceous skeleton with N-[3-(tri-methoxy-silyl)propyl]ethylenediamine and creating the charge-transfer complexes with cations Ba2+, Sn2+, Fe2+ or Cu2+. The specific surface areas of mesopores and whole crystallites, together with the volume of mesopores, were determined from low-temperature N2-physisorption isotherms. A mathematical model of crystalline microstructure explaining the sizes and shapes of crystalline grains in relation to adsorption features was proposed and successfully confronted with the results following experimental data. The roughness of the surface is different from one that occurred to be necessary to explain the experimental characteristics quantitatively. The estimated silicon-organic layer thickness was close to the corresponding molecule length for hybrid specimens."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058264785","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6357d18e4097072c1fa2bc3a","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"346","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"0089b2a9-6fc6-4f48-bfbe-9e367969c2f2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"346","pagesFromTo":"112242-1 -
