Trehalose has been proposed as a potential therapeutic agent to attenuate neuropathology in MPS III. We conducted a single-arm, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy of trehalose treatment in patients with MPS IIIA and MPS IIIB.\n\nMethods: Five patients with MPS III were enrolled. Trehalose was administrated intravenously (15 g/week) for 12 weeks. Health-related quality of life and cognitive function, serum biomarkers, liver, spleen, and lung imaging were assessed to evaluate trehalose efficacy at baseline and trial end (week 12).\n\nResults: TNO-AZL Preschool children Quality of Life (TAPQOL) scores increased in all patients, and the mean scores for quality of life were increased after the intervention. Serum GAG levels were reduced in all treated patients (however, the differences were not statistically significant). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were reduced in all patients post-treatment (p=0.0039). The mean levels of aspartate transaminase (AST) were also decreased after 12 weeks of treatment with Trehalose. Decreased serum pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance and increased GPX activity were observed at the end of the study. Decreases in mean splenic length were observed, whereas the liver volume did not change.\n\nConclusion: Improvements in health-related quality of life and serum biomarkers (GAGs, liver aminotransferase levels, antioxidant status), as well as liver and spleen size, were found following 3 months of trehalose administration in patients with MPS IIIA and MPS IIIB."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060232836","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67790e9bfdbe835408b93257","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"31","number":"20","doi":null,"documentHash":"41f18fe5-9719-4e0a-9c22-c1edc46f3b57"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"31","pagesFromTo":"3033-3042","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.eurekaselect.com/article/download?doi=10.2174/0929867330666230406102555","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67790e9bfdbe835408b93266","name":"Amirhossein","lastName":"Sahebkar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"79d48419-81a5-42d7-bdc0-271c2fcacb96"},{"objectId":"67790e9bfdbe835408b93264","name":"Ali

recent years, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have gained major attention as potentially useful photovoltaic technology due to their ever-increasing power-conversion efficiency (PCE). The efficiency of PSCs depends strongly on the type of materials selected as the electron transport layer (ETL). TiO2 is the most widely used electron transport material for the n-i-p structure of PSCs. Nevertheless, ZnO is a promising candidate owing to its high transparency, suitable energy band structure, and high electron mobility. In this investigation, hybrid mesoporous TiO2/ZnO ETL was fabricated for a perovskite solar cell composed of FTO-coated glass/compact TiO2/mesoporous ETL/FAPbI3/2D perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au. The influence of ZnO nanostructures with different percentage weight contents on the photovoltaic performance was investigated. It was found that the addition of ZnO had no significant effect on the surface topography, structure, and optical properties of the hybrid mesoporous electron-transport layer but strongly affected the electrical properties of PSCs.

Bacteria have developed numerous ways of dealing with this stress, including reprogramming of global cellular processes. However, specific molecular adaptation mechanisms to osmotic stress have mainly been investigated in terrestrial model bacteria. In this work, we aimed to elucidate the basis of adjustment to prolonged salinity challenges at the proteome level in marine bacteria. The objects of our studies were three representatives of bacteria inhabiting various marine environments, Shewanella baltica, Vibrio harveyi and Aliivibrio fischeri. The proteomic studies were performed with bacteria cultivated in increased and decreased salinity, followed by proteolytic digestion of samples which were then subjected to liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry analysis. We show that bacteria adjust at all levels of their biological processes, from DNA topology through gene expression regulation and proteasome assembly, to transport and cellular metabolism. The finding that many similar adaptation strategies were observed for both low- and high-salinity conditions is particularly striking.

presented work deals with the investigation of mechanical tribological properties on Inconel 625 superalloy, which is welded on a 16Mo3 steel pipe. The wall thickness of the basic steel pipe was 7 mm, while the average thickness of the welded layer was 3.5 mm. The coating was made by the cold metal transfer (CMT) method. A supercritical bending of 180° was performed on the material welded in this way while cold. The mechanical properties evaluated were hardness, wear resistance, coefficient of friction (COF) and change in surface roughness for both materials. The UMT Tribolab laboratory equipment was used to measure COF and wear resistance by the Ball-on-flat method, which used a G40 steel pressure ball. The entire process took place at an elevated temperature of 500 °C. The measured results show that the materials after bending are reinforced by plastic deformation, which leads to an increase in hardness and also resistance to wear. Superalloy Inconel 625 shows approximately seven times higher rate of wear compared to steel 16Mo3 due to the creation of local oxidation areas that support the formation of abrasive wear and do not create a solid lubricant, as in the case of steel 16Mo3. Strain hardening leads to a reduction of possible wear on Inconel 625 superalloy as well as on 16Mo3 steel. In the case of the friction process, the places of supercritical bending of the structure showed the greatest resistance to wear compared to the non-deformed structure.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060232867","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/14/5014","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"676a76edfdbe831a38261805","name":"Naďa","lastName":"Beronská","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"89467869-2bce-450a-b29f-1258d67c842c"},{"objectId":"676a76edfdbe831a38261804","name":"Milan","lastName":"Jus","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a624832b-a46d-461d-b80e-fb755ef33c29"},{"objectId":"676a76edfdbe831a38261803","name":"Marta","lastName":"Kianicova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1235df71-5eb0-43bd-8f43-e07019921bc8"},{"objectId":"676a76edfdbe831a38261802","name":"Igor","lastName":"Barenyi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5d0bc608-743c-4d92-b1bb-2ee2083a03af"},{"objectId":"676a76edfdbe831a38261801","name":"Maroš","lastName":"Eckert","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4ed00f8c-e52a-46ce-81e8-d8f36a5471a3"},{"objectId":"676a76edfdbe831a38261800","name":"Marcel","lastName":"Kohutiar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7347d800-092b-424d-8113-328fa49c6bb8"},{"objectId":"676a76edfdbe831a382617ff","name":"Robert","lastName":"Ciger","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f4b28911-60a8-4152-871f-6b50b81379d6"},{"objectId":"676a76edfdbe831a382617fe","name":"Michal","lastName":"Krbata","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"26b4080a-6de7-415f-8f62-bd4c5209aab7"},{"objectId":"5e709237878c28a047391e06","name":"Maria","lastName":"Sozańska","uuid":"BAFF77D276176F951E345FFE644E64C6592FF92F2212E62D630FC6E8C02405FFB57D9E60A3779E5C52769BAFEBA7B8D4A66D9B49AC401CACF8BBA82448CEF8B4","orcidId":"0000-0002-0317-3949","documentHash":"1ec5891e-9a2e-4320-abd3-16dcec52485e"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047390f3e","name":"Bogusław","lastName":"Mendala","uuid":"55AB5B33D10673010A9DDFF0D39D07B75775A619183E1607047FAC2FE94957BCCF60FB7727C8A22C8C0520E3A2BBDB8ACE949F34E364488456FFB9BBA83E3E6E","orcidId":"0000-0002-4736-0439","documentHash":"f0b29177-1e58-438a-b7ff-65a75355102b"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma16145014"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-66277-40-3","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Aktualne aspekty zdrowia, choroby oraz funkcjonowania człowieka w różnych okresach życia","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63d7c6fc4097074c742d25bb","editors":[{"objectId":"676a805dfdbe831a3826c111","name":"Mariola","lastName":"Głowacka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"84a7b1a5-bdf7-4d1d-a1af-2e7a931a33ed"},{"objectId":"676a805dfdbe831a3826c110","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Słodki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1a1e3320-5786-4984-a857-313dd7d420a0"},{"objectId":"676a805dfdbe831a3826c10f","name":"Adrianna","lastName":"Frydrysiak-Brzozowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ec2ba3e7-c81b-40f1-bccd-1fc339d97544"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["676a805dfdbe831a3826c10f","676a805dfdbe831a3826c110","676a805dfdbe831a3826c111"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060232882","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d4187be878c2809a72ec5af","mniswId":"71800","name":"Wydawnictwo Naukowe Mazowieckiej Uczelni Publicznej w Płocku","documentHash":"fa994c5a-c673-4cae-b7c6-bea71bc54e12"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://katalogi.bn.org.pl/discovery/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["VEGFR-2 inhibitors","molecular docking","antimetabolites","oxazolo[5","anticancer activity","4-d]pyrimidines","isoxazole","cytotoxicity"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

The main challenge in designing a modern anticancer therapy is to develop selective compounds that exploit specific molecular targets. In this work, novel oxazolo[5,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated in vitro for their cytotoxic activity against a panel of four human cancer cell lines (lung carcinoma: A549, breast adenocarcinoma: MCF7, metastatic colon adenocarcinoma: LoVo, primary colon adenocarcinoma: HT29), along with their P-glycoprotein-inhibitory ability and pro-apoptotic activity. These oxazolo[5,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives, which are structurally similar to nucleic purine bases in general, are characterized by the presence of a pharmacologically favorable isoxazole substituent at position 2 and aliphatic amino chains at position 7 of the condensed heterocyclic system. In silico analysis of the obtained compounds identified their potent inhibitory activity towards human vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2). Molecular docking was performed to assess the binding mode of new derivatives to the VEGFR-2 active site. Then, their physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacological properties (i.e., ADME—administration, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) were also predicted to assess their druglikeness. In particular, compound 3g (with a 3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl substituent) was found to be the most potent against the HT29 cell line, with a 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of 58.4 µM, exceeding the activity of fluorouracil (CC50 = 381.2 μM) and equaling the activity of cisplatin (CC50 = 47.2 µM), while being less toxic to healthy human cells (such as normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs)) than these reference drugs.

main aim in this study was to investigate cognitive functioning in young gymnasts. The study group consisted of 86 children, aged 10–12 years: (a) a criterion group of 41 juvenile athletes (Mage = 11.23; SDage = 0.93) who trained six times per week; and (b) a comparison group of 45 children (Mage = 11.11; SDage = 0.61) who were not involved competitively in sports but who were mostly quite physically active. We measured attention, memory processes, and bioelectrical brain activity in the central region (Cz; where there are connections to motor control, movement, and sensation). We found significant differences between our two participant groups in short-term memory, deferred naming memory, and long-term memory of visual material. Children who practiced gymnastics had a better attention span than those who did not, and children who were non-athletes but who undertook physical activity more frequently than five times per week had a different theta/sensory motor rhythm (SMR) brain wave ratio (with SMR higher), meaning that they felt calmer and more relaxed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060232896","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"130","pagesFromTo":"714-731","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677cf108fdbe831a382b685c","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Jochimek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0e4d2c26-71be-49cc-aba2-a27bc36b4ae4"},{"objectId":"5ebedefc752340254fc42ce7","name":"Ilona","lastName":"Bidzan-Bluma","uuid":"B1BFA6AF5A4342FFD45FCBCBCAFECBA919B1EBDE8766AB6D82FDD8BFE7CED66D61653CA77D11606C48749CD2D07560D371FAA6E98188752527EB36CD13EEA7E6","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7c0bb4de-3bc8-41b6-9d93-370719a30ff0"},{"objectId":"5e70923e878c28a0473924fd","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Lipowska","uuid":"044D3C17320342716FE512C351DF8A7011D20597BA893001ABC5B69AC948975A1BCC35E3653A822F3CD251A4E3D78FE4EFD00DAAAE98D6818C05B93FDECE6125","orcidId":"0000-0002-7422-159X","documentHash":"ee433aa4-a1df-4941-a265-d30113136d6c"}],"doi":"10.1177/00315125231156722"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6437eb5e4097076e1e34260a","doi":null,"title":"The 2nd BELT and ROAD Sino-Polish University Consortium Art & Design Competition 2020.

Here, we studied a colonial waterbird, the black-headed gull Chroicocephalus ridibundus, nesting in three colonies. We aimed to investigate whether fatty acid composition of its eggs is affected by the location of the colony (reflecting the spatial variation in habitat composition and, in turn, female diet at the time of egg formation), and the egg laying sequence (reflecting the temporal variation in female diet). We found that the composition of fatty acids in eggs of black-headed gulls differed among colonies, but not among subsequent eggs within the clutch. We interpret these results in the context of spatial differences in the diet of females breeding in different colonies and a lack of temporal variation in the diet of individual females. The pattern of the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids reflected the contribution of aquatic/terrestrial prey to their diet, and was consistent with the area of water courses around the colonies. High levels of omega-6:omega-3 can promote inflammation and thus lead to increased susceptibility to antigens. Further studies with prey sampling are required to reconstruct the diet composition of females during egg formation in more detail."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060232912","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"90","pagesFromTo":"677-690","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d2fe8fdbe831a382e170c","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Szady-Grad","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d0b96980-bdf1-4e0a-9cd4-769cecc46ae3"},{"objectId":"677d2fe8fdbe831a382e170b","name":"Ignacy","lastName":"Kitowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b00cb2d6-c74a-4914-b466-eb9ee876f287"},{"objectId":"677d2fe8fdbe831a382e170a","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Kowalczyk-Pecka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"00fc1570-1f5a-428d-83aa-2a693b5c62e2"},{"objectId":"677d2fe8fdbe831a382e1709","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Indykiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1a083e0c-7ed6-4005-9ee7-4f24feaeb1d5"},{"objectId":"5e709249878c28a0473931a1","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Jakubas","uuid":"8CB5C68968CB72D2141B8A05EDF54D9FC4C06E68AA50E9F882796C88AB7FF694485E3222D3A93D69355BB8F233C2BA3803BD5C11C8012170BBCE9E129FC3EBA1","orcidId":"0000-0002-1879-4342","documentHash":"fb64d2c2-6642-47df-a865-9e64f7c77b1a"}],"doi":"10.1080/24750263.2023.2252838"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-966721-0-0","book":null,"typeName":"Książka

in optogenetics and the increasing use of implantable devices for therapies and health monitoring are driving demand for compliant, biocompatible optical waveguides and scalable methods for their

Molding, thermal drawing, and dip-coating are the most prevalent approaches in recent literature. Here the authors demonstrate that extrusion printing at room temperature can be used for continuous fabrication of compliant optical waveguides with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) core and crosslinked Pluronic F127-diacrylate (Pluronic-DA) cladding. The optical fibers are printed from fluid precursor inks and stabilized by physical interactions and photoinitiated crosslinking in the Pluronic-DA. The printed fibers show optical loss values of 0.13–0.34 dB cm–1 in air and tissue within the wavelength range of 405–520 nm. The fibers have a Young's Modulus (Pluronic cladding) of 150 kPa and can be stretched to more than 5 times their length. The optical loss of the fibers shows little variation with extension. This work demonstrates how printing can simplify the fabrication of compliant and stretchable devices from materials approved for clinical use. These can be of interest for optogenetic or photopharmacology applications in extensible tissues, like muscles or heart."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060232925","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"7","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/admt.202101539","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d0b39fdbe831a382d4a0f","name":"Aránzazu","lastName":"del Campo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e1e3f973-8257-4304-a33e-7546c6e55294"},{"objectId":"677d0b39fdbe831a382d4a0e","name":"Samuel","lastName":"Pearson","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"262d2f76-a9a9-4c4e-b5c1-6c175b330ec9"},{"objectId":"677d0b39fdbe831a382d4a0d","name":"Qiyang","lastName":"Jiang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c4a7c95-8b4f-42c1-93a8-9f4589d4d034"},{"objectId":"677d0b39fdbe831a382d4a0c","name":"Yijun","lastName":"Zheng","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5984203f-5820-4fbf-85a0-bad27d405c3f"},{"objectId":"677d0b39fdbe831a382d4a0b","name":"Jun","lastName":"Feng","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"de9fda5d-4748-40d8-845a-7709aa970ec3"},{"objectId":"6040c3c49543c711bc6ea851","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Włodarczyk-Biegun","uuid":"129013123EB506E81E23A429A304C9255ADCFFF4C822D42C7E32ECFD5A52972714CF03BADA041E97EB274F8615F866E320FD58A7072511DD3B9ADF5B4FC9C4E1","orcidId":"0000-0003-1419-6166","documentHash":"a855f24e-dc37-47eb-97d0-cb8876d0f648"}],"doi":"10.1002/admt.202101539"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["mikrostruktura","rozkład wielkości ziarna","szybkość wyciskania","uszlachetnianie ziarna","korozja","stop magnezu"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["corrosion","magnesium alloy","microstructure","grain refinement","grain size distribution","extrusion rate"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709237878c28a047391d86"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Evolution of microstructure dependent corrosion properties of ultrafine AZ31 under conditions of extrusion with a forward backward oscillating die","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c92c","mniswId":"11761","title":"Journal of Materials Research and Technology","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2238-7854","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ce8a8bb8-a249-4187-aef0-9d54dcea7549"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-06","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65b1fa14409707197792cac8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709237878c28a047391d86","676a7f98fdbe831a3826bb20","676a7f98fdbe831a3826bb21","676a7f98fdbe831a3826bb22","676a7f98fdbe831a3826bb23","676a7f98fdbe831a3826bb24","676a7f98fdbe831a3826bb25","676a7f98fdbe831a3826bb26"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The present work aims to elucidate the role of microstructural changes induced by the extrusion with a forward backward oscillating die, thus verifying a novel approach to developing deformation methods for Mg-based alloys at ambient temperature. The main aim of this study was to show the process which enables the reduction of the hcp-structured AZ31 rods (40 mm in diameter) to the wires with diameters of 6 mm, 4 mm and 2 mm, without initial preheating of the billet. In contrary to the studies up to date, the significant microstructure refinement led to the decline in corrosion resistance of the wires with 6 mm and 4 mm diameters slightly relative to the original material. The highest extrusion ratio resulted in the formation of an ultrafine, equiaxed microstructure, which caused a tremendous corrosion resistance decrease. The significant decline in corrosion resistance of this alloy is a result of the highest number of HAGBs and is promoted by the accumulation of tangled dislocations. Summing up, the corrosion behaviors of the extruded alloys were mainly affected by the recrystallization stage that occurred during deformation, and not by the grain size alone."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060232927","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"4486-4496","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmrt.2022.04.131","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"676a7f98fdbe831a3826bb26","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Mizera","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fe503942-4f8c-4888-8996-a21f11a6effe"},{"objectId":"676a7f98fdbe831a3826bb25","name":"Milena","lastName":"Koralnik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"54be53af-0355-4904-9b16-3dbf9dfbd2f0"},{"objectId":"676a7f98fdbe831a3826bb24","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Zielińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"254bf9c9-b5ea-433d-83e7-59f558050cb6"},{"objectId":"676a7f98fdbe831a3826bb23","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Towarek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"da7364b2-6770-4765-944c-083735f9d949"},{"objectId":"676a7f98fdbe831a3826bb22","name":"Monika","lastName":"Chlewicka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"43e4b26f-6d02-4ad2-8b45-1a2839c5da50"},{"objectId":"676a7f98fdbe831a3826bb21","name":"Bogusława","lastName":"Adamczyk-Cieślak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6380b372-25ee-4a32-bfab-b26a1914ec48"},{"objectId":"676a7f98fdbe831a3826bb20","name":"Anna","lastName":"Dobkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"65996cc8-8875-4975-a1c1-f9f46952db5f"},{"objectId":"5e709237878c28a047391d86","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Kuc","uuid":"1F9425DA19ADB41EB847623A108DF47E68D4C61BE0D963FB7194767396C7C8BEE3B1A89C60471FA1577390A07E27641C3BE48BFDA6914F89B3CDB1818CCA23CF","orcidId":"0000-0002-0844-463X","documentHash":"95e06082-0787-4928-b94d-88659ae6dd7b"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jmrt.2022.04.131"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet

and economic manufacturing of carbon nanotube (CNT) greases addresses the current challenges of nanofluids. The key problems remain the complex and non-obvious nature of nanotube-base fluid interactions with the diversity of nanotube morphological variants as the main aspect. Here, we prove that successful formation of stable and multifunctional CNT-polyalphaolefin (PAO) greases is possible only by employing two types of multi-wall CNTs (MWCNTs) as the thickening as well as thermo- and electro-active agents, i.e., (1) thin, entangled, less crystalline nanotubes and (2) thick nanotubes connected via few-mismatched-layer graphenoid joints. Using mechanical spectroscopy, SEM, TEM, Raman spectroscopy, inverse gas chromatography (IGC), and Hansen solubility parameters, we analyze the mechanisms governing fast-thickening behavior and CNT-PAO affinities, revealing a reversible formation of a 3D CNT-network which mimics a mesh of the conventional lithium soaps. Finally, we reveal the multifunctionality of the CNT-PAO greases, expressed in as high as 58%- and 700%-enhancements of thermal and alternating current conductivity, respectively, compared to PAO base fluid."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060232950","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"391","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d29b2fdbe831a382dd8ff","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Giżewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"73961e42-d175-46b9-92ac-e82aeaa2100e"},{"objectId":"677d29b2fdbe831a382dd8fe","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kolanowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"83161140-ec7e-43ac-bc87-565e1f70db47"},{"objectId":"677d29b2fdbe831a382dd8fd","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Błaszkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d8600794-63ee-41bf-b6e4-ffe35e525252"},{"objectId":"677d29b2fdbe831a382dd8fc","name":"Artur P.","lastName":"Terzyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"279713a0-17b8-4059-ac93-4dbe5b4983ae"},{"objectId":"677d29b2fdbe831a382dd8fb","name":"Emil","lastName":"Korczeniewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5f6dad3f-5e6a-4824-97d5-407c342d3991"},{"objectId":"677d29b2fdbe831a382dd8fa","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kujawa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"518c65ab-c399-4d92-a7bd-0585a12383d7"},{"objectId":"677d29b2fdbe831a382dd8f9","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Wojciechowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"929d0b9f-3658-498f-bcfd-ae146d98efe4"},{"objectId":"677d29b2fdbe831a382dd8f8","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Runka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3ef8fe19-6d37-4f60-92ba-3d08a01acb0a"},{"objectId":"677d29b2fdbe831a382dd8f7","name":"Beata","lastName":"Strzemiecka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dd8f78af-f94d-4002-877e-05cb9ea87837"},{"objectId":"677d29b2fdbe831a382dd8f6","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Różański","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"46638375-0d6e-4f50-931c-c2be4424d588"},{"objectId":"677d29b2fdbe831a382dd8f5","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Kałużny","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1636c879-49fc-4514-9279-327852aacbbb"},{"objectId":"635c90287523405a7dcc92c4","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Ruczka","uuid":"7A3191C81649064936D0FF9E7B0456DAC5DDF7A46EAB2669A823653804604226058630E7F19033FD4DBE54C6005A0E885BE27E25E14E894412EF90EEC8644E10","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9ac308c2-aa19-44ca-9931-1c72cd7974cd"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b0747","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Boncel","uuid":"5B6F9899B70CE4B98A7E69AC2D1E181B1479A5D469FBDDB077476F789C04383E029C29A8993F84E40F1A12918D866B859D0CE10CB8BA8E857F0F3D747CBC4E89","orcidId":"0000-0002-0787-5243","documentHash":"fd590e22-7d8e-43a3-9ec5-a8d67bf8b5f2"},{"objectId":"5e709281878c28a047396eae","name":"Adam","lastName":"Marek","uuid":"893E56B975D889E2CC41CD9E8C714B2A0362D0996B3D275E03F335E69CCA21107452655D7E118AD1FAA299F700F0BE5488A28FAE0A676706580C8E6E887CB666","orcidId":"0000-0002-1238-4123","documentHash":"eec17073-2ce7-46a8-af84-7802abbedc27"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a047392353","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Jędrysiak","uuid":"09A1679BB51AA6740CFF131566490262A7E6EB6768469400FA3E176E13AE9F2CE82111E1FF2A91B8E504E83140005050E52343D47102624A63352BFCD0ACDBDA","orcidId":"0000-0002-4635-0028","documentHash":"c3583404-957d-479d-91d5-414815d9e084"},{"objectId":"5e709220878c28a047390344","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Dzido","uuid":"390314CE7E8D92889A0FB55845078F839B6C5A8048F97DC482685AD3187DEFE5F6DF872FD58AF8A355493169378E269D606509FA2951EA638420EC05288E9664","orcidId":"0000-0002-0732-6607","documentHash":"bcd60d74-c732-4882-91f9-cfd0ea7258b1"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.molliq.2023.123215"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["project based learning","rzeczywistość rozszerzona w nauczaniu","urbanistyka","struktura miasta","rzeczywistość wirtualna w nauczaniu","modele struktury miasta","analiza urbanistyczna"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["project based learning","urban analysis","augmented reality in teaching","virtual reality in teaching","city structure models","city structure","urban planning"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-7880-833-6","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["677ce1d2fdbe831a382a24d3","5e709237878c28a047391d80","677ce1d2fdbe831a382a24d2"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Modele struktury miasta Gliwice.

Pomysłodawcą cyklu zajęć, których każda edycja kończy się wystawą, publiczną prezentacją i publikacją jest dr inż. arch. Tomasz Bradecki. Publikacja powstała dzięki współpracy z miastem Gliwice i Politechniką Śląską oraz wsparciu partnerów: GAPR, iDreams, GZM, EMT-Systems. Praca zawiera szereg analiz struktury miasta Gliwice m.in. analizę struktury komunikacji drogowej oraz publicznej, analizę według metody Kevina Lyncha czy analizę udziału powierzchni zabudowy. Część analiz została przeprowadzona za pomocą autorskich modeli przestrzennych. Szczególną uwagę poświęcono obszarom Nowych Gliwic oraz dzielnicy Akademickiej, które można uznać za rozwojowe i strategiczne dla miasta ze względu na ich rolę i potencjał. Wybrane analizy zostały odwzorowane w formie makiet fizycznych. Wykonano je za pomocą maszyny Styrocad należącej do Wydziału Architektury. W publikacji wykorzystano m.in. oprogramowanie GIS, narzędzia do tworzenia modeli 3D, fotografie z wykorzystaniem dronów oraz aplikację do tworzenia fotografii panoramicznych o zakresie 360 stopni. Użyto również aplikacji, które pozwalają na doświadczanie modeli w rzeczywistości rozszerzonej i wirtualnej. Odwzorowanie przestrzeni miejskich oraz danych, które je opisują za pomocą modeli należy uznać za przydatne w procesie dydaktycznym oraz do celów prezentacyjnych rozległych obszarów. W publikacji zawarto odnośniki do modeli, które mogą pełnić rolę informacyjną w orientacji przestrzennej na większych obszarach miejskich.\r\n"},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The models of the Gliwice city structure are the result of a semester work carried out in an international team of female students and teachers. Classes were conducted in the PBL (project based learning) formula, i.e. teaching through the implementation of a joint venture. The originator of the series of classes, each edition of which ends with an exhibition, public presentation and publication, is Dr. Eng. arch. Tomasz Bradecki. The publication was created thanks to the cooperation with the city of Gliwice and the Silesian University of Technology and the support of partners: GAPR, iDreams, GZM, and EMT-Systems. The work contains a number of analyzes of the structure of the city of Gliwice, among others analysis of the structure of road and public transport, analysis according to the Kevin Lynch method or analysis of the share of built-up area. Some of the analyzes were carried out with the use of proprietary spatial models. Particular attention was paid to the areas of New Gliwice and the Academic District, which can be considered developmental and strategic for the city due to their role and potential. The selected analyzes were mapped in the form of physical mockups. They were made with the Styrocad Machine belonging to the Faculty of Architecture. The publication uses, inter alia, GIS software, 3D modeling tools, drone photography and 360 degree panoramic photography application. Applications were also used that allow the models to be experienced in augmented and virtual reality. Mapping urban spaces and the data that describe them with the help of models should be considered useful in the didactic process and for the presentation of large areas. The publication contains references to models that can play an informative role in spatial orientation in larger urban areas."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060232956","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb89b","mniswId":"48600","name":"Politechnika Śląska","documentHash":"3da4d71c-3d47-4afc-9bd0-9d1580f1bc55"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"Models of the gliwice city structure.

However, upon UV irradiation low-fidelity translesion polymerases: Polη, Polζ and Rev1, participate in an error-free replicative bypass of UV-induced lesions in mtDNA. We analysed how translesion polymerases could function in mitochondria. We show that, contrary to expectations, yeast PCNA is mitochondrially localized and, upon genotoxic stress, ubiquitinated PCNA can be detected in purified mitochondria. Moreover, the substitution K164R in PCNA leads to an increase of UV-induced point mutations in mtDNA. This UV-dependent effect is highly enhanced in cells in which the Mec1/Rad53/Dun1 checkpoint-dependent deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) increase in response to DNA damage is blocked and RNase H1 is lacking, suggesting that PCNA plays a role in a replication damage bypass pathway dealing with lesions in multiple ribonucleotides embedded in mtDNA. In addition, our analysis indicates that K164R in PCNA restricts mostly the anti-mutagenic Polη activity on UV-damaged mtDNA, whereas the inhibitory effect on Polζ’s activity is only partial. We also show for the first time that in conditions of dNTP depletion yeast Rnh1 neutralizes deleterious effects of ribonucleotides for mtDNA replication, thereby preventing the enhanced instability of rho+ mitochondrial genomes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060232960","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6597d34e40970755be5e2b9e","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"7b2bf3c4-186e-4bd9-8908-044ad024e285"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"31017 (1-17)","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-82104-4#rightslink","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67765cc2fdbe833e6950a9c1","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Bagińska-Drabiuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9e97ffa5-e9ad-4244-b0ee-82ce2d729e87"},{"objectId":"60c3029d9543c723365439ef","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Latoszek","uuid":"D1E16BDC99A9EEC8FD6C6174D02828D25C9D0A37B072A5AEE87E9ABF4C9B4B42F78F624CC9353BD8B87F772BAC549032893BFDC93FD6DBF98E5F50BBC57BE531","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eea92e13-398e-4243-a314-dfbcd50f134d"},{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f50","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Śledziewska-Gójska","uuid":"C3D3F584094DF21CBCD6A57BE336940461271BBF5FEAEFC78F5FD2603A0A2A2851F41EA87D158E06C16F0C3BF116FC157EA1FF48A5222C66281C68C42E70DFC0","orcidId":"0000-0001-8409-0864","documentHash":"f463cfbc-cf1d-4a83-ae25-b09e19faa1e3"},{"objectId":"5e7093bb878c28a0473afe79","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Kaniak-Golik","uuid":"D630F6758A14C10A3059F32B3ABF2AA1235AA10BB78C4867910A3732F0E2AA792EB59EA068D4F44922956047B34C50D7CE3D97C640C61AD14764265A92EE25A8","orcidId":"0000-0003-4027-6282","documentHash":"61d81e15-bb9a-4d35-9921-667703c457b4"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-024-82104-4"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["ciało migdałowate","stan zapalny","cytokiny"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["amygdala","inflammation","IL-1β","IL-6"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709249878c28a0473931b5","5e70929c878c28a04739905a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Mutual relations between the amygdala and pro-infammatory cytokines: IL-β and IL-6","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"61d557ec580ac28cb94dcde3","mniswId":"201230","title":"European Journal of Translational and Clinical Medicine","doi":null,"issn":"2657-3148","eissn":"2657-3156","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"MINISTRY","editor":null,"documentHash":"8aa4d3c6-38bc-48ee-9f74-f0a3a2ee5f9d"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2022-01-23","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63aaeee140970732a0a4b779","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929c878c28a04739905a","5e709249878c28a0473931b5","677d30a2fdbe831a382e2e6a","677d30a2fdbe831a382e2e6b","677d30a2fdbe831a382e2e6c"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Interleukin 1 (IL-1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) are typical examples of multifunctional pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the regulation of the immune response, hematopoiesis, and inflammation. Both peripheral and intraventricular administration of these cytokines causes acute phase symptoms, e.g. fever, activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and psychological depression. The amygdala belongs to the structures of the limbic system involved in the regulation of the immune response.

If gases are present in a discontinuity, they expand during solution treatment, forming surface blisters. The largest blisters form on cold flakes, mainly in casting areas near the gating system.\r\nHowever, smaller blisters form on porosity - both gas and shrinkage.

The in vitro analyses on biofilm formation and susceptibility to antibiotics are frequently carried out using methods that do not reflect conditions at the site of infection. To evaluate the influence of nutrient accessibility on Staphylococcus aureus biofilm development in vitro, a cohesive set of analyses in three different compositional media was performed. Next, the efficacy of four antibiotics used in bone infection treatment, including gentamycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and vancomycin, against staphylococcal biofilm, was also assessed. The results show a significant reduction in the ability of biofilm to grow in a medium containing elements occurring in the serum, which also translated into the diversified changes in the efficacy of used antibiotics, compared to the setting in which conventional media were applied. The differences indicate the need for implementation of adequate in vitro models that closely mimic the infection site.

Next, the designed materials were tested on human osteosarcoma cell lines. The cells adhesion, proliferation, viability, and differentiation were investigated. The cell growth wasevaluated using SEM, and the metallic ion release was measured. The results revealed that the NPs concentration in the hybrid layers decreased with the incubation time. In the last stage, the implants were tested in vivo on six canine patients. Three months after the operation, the radiological evaluation of the performed anastomosis was carried out as well as the histopathological evaluation of tissue regeneration. The strongest bactericidal efficacy was observed for the layers containing AgNPs. Along with an increased concentration of metallic additives, a growing toxic effect was clearly observed. The most pronounced toxic effect was especially evident with the AgNPs concentration exceeding 1 mol %. In all the operated patients, no deviations were found during the follow-up examinations in the postoperative period. The low dose of AgNPs in the hybrid layer facilitated the tissue healing process. It was proven that silver nanoparticles may accelerate the bone healing process.

The complex background of MS is associated with autoimmune inflammation and neurodegeneration processes, and is potentially affected by many contributing factors, including altered composition and function of the gut microbiota. In this review, current experimental and clinical evidence is presented for the characteristics of gut dysbiosis found in MS, as well as for its relevant links with the course of the disease and the dysregulated immune response and metabolic pathways involved in MS pathology. Furthermore, therapeutic implications of these investigations are discussed, with a range of pharmacological, dietary and other interventions targeted at the gut microbiome and thus intended to have beneficial effects on the course of MS.

Genes associated with motility were\ninduced by maize but repressed by tomato. The shared response to exudates seemed to be afected\nboth by compounds originating from the plants and those from their growth environment: arsenic\nresistance and bacterioferritin synthesis were upregulated, while sulfur assimilation, sensing of\nferric citrate and/or other iron carriers, heme acquisition, and transport of polar amino acids were\ndownregulated.

membranes, as primary places of the perception of environmental stimuli, are a source of various oxygenated polyunsaturated fatty acids-oxylipins-functioning as modulators of many signal transduction

Among exogenous factors acting on plant\r\ncells, special attention is given to drought, especially in highly sensitive crop species, such as yellow\r\nlupine. Here, we used this species to analyze the contribution of lipid-related enzymes and lipidderived plant hormones in drought-evoked events taking place in a specialized group of cells-the flower abscission zone (AZ)-which is responsible for organ detachment from the plant body. We revealed that water deficits in the soil causes lipid peroxidation in these cells and the upregulation of\r\nphospholipase D, lipoxygenase, and, concomitantly, jasmonic acid (JA) strongly accumulates in AZ tissue. Furthermore, we followed key steps in JA conjugation and signaling under stressful conditions by monitoring the level and tissue localization of enzyme providing JA derivatives (JASMONATE\r\nRESISTANT1) and the JA receptor (CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1).

These findings point to the need for a revision of the Neolithisation model, not only regarding dating but also in terms of reassessing the role played by demographic pressure. The authors believe that the impact of the latter is widely overestimated, because the migration could also be caused by conflicts resulting from ethnic diversity and competition for prestige and access to the most valuable lands.

Even so, it remains a rare, protected species, and one susceptible to varied threats, including diseases. It has a specific parasitofauna, comprising only a few specific species retained with the last hosts in the restitution process, and some others acquired from other ungulates, or via environmental interactions. The current data on parasitic arthropods originated from the winter season, and less frequently, from autumn and early spring. The present study contains the first information on the occurrence of arthropods in the European bison (n = 6) in the summer season, which is the period of their increased activity. Data on the seasonal and populational dynamics of ectoparasites have been verified; specific parasite species (Demodex bisonianus, Bisonicola sedecimdecembrii, and recently described Demodex bialoviensis) and typical parasite species (Chorioptes bovis, Ixodes ricinus) have been recorded. The data refer to the information from other study periods, summarizing and valorizing data on parasitic arthropods in the form of a global checklist. These arthropods occur in European bison frequently (prevalence reaches up to 100%), but they are present in small numbers, and do not present a burden for the host; only sometimes, with high intensity of infection, they cause parasitoses (chorioptosis, mallohagosis). However, as an effect of regular activity, by penetrating the skin of the host, they create gateways for secondary infections, and hematophagous parasites (e.g., ticks) can be vectors of pathogens that can be hazardous, even at low infection levels. The identification of the parasitological threats faced by European bison is not only important from the standpoint of the study object, i.e., the Białowieża Forest European bison population, from which the existing bison population of Europe has been derived, but also the fact that their transfer to different parts of Europe can entail the additional transfer of their parasites.

Stimulation of PChRs evokes hyperventilation and hypertension to maintain adequate oxygenation of critical organs. A relationship between increased sensitivity of PChRs (hyperreflexia) and exercise intolerance (ExIn) in patients with heart failure (HF) has been previously reported. Moreover, some studies employing an acute blockade of PChRs (e.g., using oxygen or opioids) demonstrated improvement in exercise capacity, suggesting that hypertonicity is also involved in the development of ExIn in HF. Nonetheless, the precise mechanisms linking dysfunctional PChRs to ExIn remain unclear. From the clinical perspective, there are two main factors limiting exercise capacity in HF patients: subjective perception of dyspnoea and muscle fatigue. Both have many determinants that might be influenced by abnormal signalling from PChRs, including: exertional hyperventilation, oscillatory ventilation, ergoreceptor oversensitivity, and augmented sympathetic tone. The latter results in reduced muscle perfusion and altered muscle structure. In this review, we intend to present the milieu of abnormalities tied to malfunctioning PChRs and discuss their role in the complex relationships leading, ultimately, to ExIn."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233052","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"art.878363 [9 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2022.878363/full","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d37eefdbe831a382edb08","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kulej-Łyko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"79f1c921-52a4-4a3f-9cd0-870679fc9433"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bde95","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Niewiński","uuid":"63FD38803B9A4600C4ADD0FA5739FDA04BE9D75D342AB71057FC80180FFD2DFA013AFA66F8825DA8A765C65B524D94461FDFD9600ABD0E4520161754DA0074E5","orcidId":"0000-0001-8148-071X","documentHash":"8118d4d7-fe5a-4b0d-bfda-adaf1750513e"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473b9ef4","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Tubek","uuid":"EA15B4A2E83D7EA174AEA69C06104049122DB9B7E808EA336103E2298A59C2C1E442708C7BF9436FB0F049B2E98D261D233C7AC18E7D4709BD8F6029814C8439","orcidId":"0000-0002-0059-5150","documentHash":"393fea5d-2c59-4b2b-9ff6-f375a915a159"},{"objectId":"5e709305878c28a0473a1458","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Ponikowski","uuid":"4BA43AD81191E72DA939FC5D83BEA90B9477144E13175E0C90F36EE4CB3FEE9042BB27EBF84E4EC7BA5B8F74BCDAD927438A7A29631A6A4168BC1347284129FD","orcidId":"0000-0002-3391-7064","documentHash":"85c7bbe3-e979-4c59-ab11-59e57cb9e09e"}],"doi":"10.3389/fphys.2022.878363"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"64390eae4097076e1e3a83a2","doi":"10.4324/9781003038658","title":"The age-friendly lens","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-0-367-48211-4","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003038658","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"279229f2-6567-4f92-b285-1637332e1d40","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb764","mniswId":"2600","name":"Taylor & Francis Group","documentHash":"186b7a58-eacb-453a-bc81-dbcca285e881"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70926d878c28a04739572f","5e709409878c28a0473b549f"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"An age-friendly lens on the renewal of housing resources in Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64390eb24097076e1e3a83af","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709409878c28a0473b549f","5e70926d878c28a04739572f"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This chapter analyses pilot residential projects implemented as part of the Laboratory of Architecture 60+ (LAB 60+) initiatives.

Attitudes toward the body are thought to work in conjunction with other established risk factors for dietary pathology, including body dissatisfaction, dieting, and negative effects. Negative appearance evaluation had the potential to expand work in measuring factors and potential causal relationships associated with body image and eating problems. Therefore, this study aimed was to determine the association of negative appearance evaluation with a combination of eating attitudes and sociocultural attitudes towards appearance, the mediating effect of negative appearance evaluation in the relationship between eating attitudes and sociocultural attitudes towards appearance.\r\nMethods: We have invited 339 Chinese people to undergo the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26), Fear of Negative Appearance Evaluation Scale (FNAES), and Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance (SATAQ-3), and used AMOS 24.0 for model construction and mediating effects testing.\r\nResults: There was a significantly positive correlation of EAT-26 with FNAES (p < 0.001), and SATAQ 3 (p < 0.001) with all dimensions except Internalization general had significant positive correlations (p < 0.05); there was a significant positive correlation between FNAES and SATAQ 3 and all dimensions (p < 0. 01). There was no significant direct effect of eating attitude on sociocultural attitude towards appearance, while there was a significant mediating effect of fear of negative appearance evaluation (β = 0.321, p < 0. 001, 2/df=2.831, AGFI = 0.931, CFI = 0.945, GFI = 0.966, IFI = 0.946, RMSEA = 0.074, SRMR = 0.045, TLI = 0.915).\r\nConclusion: Our results demonstrated that negative appearance evaluation fully mediated the effect between eating attitude and sociocultural attitude towards appearance. An individual's attitude to eating can affect negative body perceptions and therefore their perception of their own body shape. Through the results, we explored the specific effects of eating attitudes on body perceptions and provide a psychological basis for guidance and interventions in Attitudes toward the body."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233093","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.776842","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677cf1d4fdbe831a382b8620","name":"Hongying ","lastName":"Fan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"835dc616-e89a-4968-a49f-6da3446a3428"},{"objectId":"677cf1d4fdbe831a382b861f","name":"Yin ","lastName":"Yang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8574fa5b-578c-4a8e-add2-63aa1bdbd0bd"},{"objectId":"677cf1d4fdbe831a382b861e","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Lipowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f4939734-874d-46e2-862a-e27f639bde6f"},{"objectId":"677cf1d4fdbe831a382b861d","name":"Shuai ","lastName":"Guo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"96e6ce4b-57ce-48cd-96fe-b0d36c3a54ef"},{"objectId":"677cf1d4fdbe831a382b861c","name":"Bernadetta ","lastName":"Izydorczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bef8bf0e-2d08-4ab8-a70d-2501ac2cbbee"},{"objectId":"677cf1d4fdbe831a382b861b","name":"Jianye ","lastName":"Li","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6f38ffea-f4a0-49fc-a2ff-23d1e58aae88"},{"objectId":"677cf1d4fdbe831a382b861a","name":"Xueyu ","lastName":"Wang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fce40827-a9f6-4c8b-862d-a6c2ce0c9c0d"},{"objectId":"677cf1d4fdbe831a382b8619","name":"Youteng ","lastName":"Gan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"81cde935-bd31-4d48-8cae-166bde5e6602"},{"objectId":"677cf1d4fdbe831a382b8618","name":"Ruohang ","lastName":"Wang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ae08605f-bdec-4b72-9cde-ef62a75bbe46"},{"objectId":"5e70923e878c28a0473924fd","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Lipowska","uuid":"044D3C17320342716FE512C351DF8A7011D20597BA893001ABC5B69AC948975A1BCC35E3653A822F3CD251A4E3D78FE4EFD00DAAAE98D6818C05B93FDECE6125","orcidId":"0000-0002-7422-159X","documentHash":"ee433aa4-a1df-4941-a265-d30113136d6c"}],"doi":"10.3389/fpsyt.2022.776842"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929a878c28a047398ca2","677d2d5bfdbe831a382de49c","5e70925e878c28a04739474c","677d2d5bfdbe831a382de49d","677d2d5bfdbe831a382de49e","5e70924b878c28a0473931e6","5e70924b878c28a0473931f7"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Bis(5-chloroquinolin-8-olato)-bis(pyridine)-cobalt(II) as new catalytic material","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":null,"issn":"2045-2322","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-09","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"621ca0602467f05c960e32f7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929a878c28a047398ca2","5e70924b878c28a0473931f7","5e70925e878c28a04739474c","5e70924b878c28a0473931e6","677d2d5bfdbe831a382de49c","677d2d5bfdbe831a382de49d","677d2d5bfdbe831a382de49e","677d2d5bfdbe831a382de49f","677d2d5bfdbe831a382de4a0"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Nowadays, studies are carried out on the design and synthesis of new catalysts for olefin oligomerization and polymerization, which would contain non-toxic metals and at the same time show high catalytic activities. Complex compounds of transition metal ions such as Fe(II), Cr(III) and Zr(II) containing pyridine or quinoline as ligands show at least moderate catalytic activity in ethylene and propylene polymerizations. To investigate the catalytic activity of the complex containing pyridine ligands and quinoline derivatives, here we have synthesized the crystals of new bis(5-chloroquinolin-8-olato)-bis(pyridine)-cobalt(II) solvate. The synthesized cobalt(II) complex compound was tested in reactions of 2-chloro-2-propen-1-ol and norbornene oligomerizations. Our studies showed that bis(5-chloroquinolin-8-olato)-bis(pyridine)-cobalt(II) after activation by MMAO-12 catalyzes the formation of oligomers in nitrogen atmosphere, under atmospheric pressure and at room temperature. Bis(5-chloroquinolin-8-olato)-bis(pyridine)-cobalt(II) possesses moderate catalytic activity in the formation of norbornene oligomers process and low catalytic activity in 2-chloro-2-propen-1-ol oligomerization."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233095","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06312-6","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d2d5bfdbe831a382de4a0","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Gawdzik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"29e81d52-4ea0-43b9-a156-0d015e8e390c"},{"objectId":"677d2d5bfdbe831a382de49f","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kwiatkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"859fdd1d-930a-4ad0-aead-0e4a978844a0"},{"objectId":"677d2d5bfdbe831a382de49e","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Malinowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7abc7021-fb94-41b7-8d36-fc120cf8a143"},{"objectId":"677d2d5bfdbe831a382de49d","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Parnicka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"867bb452-34de-4bd8-9ff2-fade67f11aee"},{"objectId":"677d2d5bfdbe831a382de49c","name":"Celina ","lastName":"Mokwa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"239e734d-af07-4c85-a89b-8998ca324ee9"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398ca2","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Drzeżdżon","uuid":"11341D53B031101337E8DB61AC07E451BE9F7B174FF9278554155194567700A8D7814D9456FCCB263B1F202CC381BECC3E2884EC80C11E7C49D8272413921022","orcidId":"0000-0002-9964-3027","documentHash":"557e7bb8-0d3b-4f14-8c3f-521f03de7e43"},{"objectId":"5e70925e878c28a04739474c","name":"Adriana","lastName":"Zaleska-Medynska","uuid":"FCC1A188E4F2AF56B568174FA189B741DCD83D0C831507B0115F615AEA31FC25C15AC5D683567B55D8E2D6F3A8CB9FDCE763EDABC58888F77D798CBE56855EAD","orcidId":"0000-0003-3817-296X","documentHash":"6dbe2d0a-b017-47cf-9762-4a9dd31b42d8"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a0473931f7","name":"Artur","lastName":"Sikorski","uuid":"5D7943CFAAEADF3F6049F8F00F3BBB6B04062010DC929098A77E98EAC2E01C7806BF88D0FAB186F56DA69E8B3919F4E57D752B83B888511D18B22CEACBC7BA00","orcidId":"0000-0002-4559-7870","documentHash":"36851ee1-e7b5-4be7-9b56-002725f5a834"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a0473931e6","name":"Dagmara","lastName":"Jacewicz","uuid":"C475CC38646FEA103CDE104248F69E047D912C3D433CD0428D5A5480766933ADD631EAE8554BED04E5065560777CE8F6B666BD1B17502909FEDD6573E13A07C1","orcidId":"0000-0002-6266-5193","documentHash":"abccd7a5-b517-451f-a4a7-5aeb3627b53d"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-022-06312-6"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["muzeum","kryzys","eksponat","architektura dla dzieci"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["crisis","museum","children architecture","exhibit"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927a878c28a047396722"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Architektura wobec kryzysu społecznego projektu dzieciństwa – muzeum dziecięce jako pole innowacji","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d51878c285145479cf6","mniswId":"200206","title":"Builder","doi":null,"issn":"1896-0642","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"3ecf748f-152d-42ff-9d8a-9cace8cb92dd"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_SA","releaseDate":"2022-02-23","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63b67ee7409707109b2919f5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70927a878c28a047396722"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"<jats:p>Artykuł w syntetycznej formie przedstawia kierunki rozwoju współczesnej\r\narchitektury dla dzieci, gdy tradycyjna dychotomia dziecko/dorosły zanika, ustępując miejsca rozwiązaniom zintegrowanym.

For this reason, for over 40 years, skincare peptides have been the subject of interest for many research groups. From time to time, new peptides are introduced to the cosmetics industry as they are promising and attractive active ingredients in the growing and innovative cosmetics market. We report herein the results of a study on the interactions between Cu2+ ions and two tetrapeptides: a) peptide with sequence Ac -βAHSH-OH (B1), having cosmetic potential which is used in a preparation called Eyeseryl, and b) a new derivative of B1 with the following sequence: Ac-HAEH-OH (B2). Potentiometric titration was used to study acid-base properties as well as the binding properties of the investigated peptides. Furthermore, the stoichiometry of the peptide complexes with Cu2+ ions was evaluated by the isothermal titration calorimetry and mass spectrometry. Additionally, based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we propose the most likely structures of the complexes of the peptides B1 and B2 with Cu2+ ions. It was found that both peptides are not toxic against human fibroblasts and keratinocytes and form thermodynamically stable complexes with the Cu2+ cation. A modification in the Eyeseryl sequence enhances the affinity of the investigated peptides towards Cu2+. The longer distance between histidine residues favors the formation of the main peptide chain in the complex without an excessive backbone tension and also has an impact on the stability of formed complexes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233106","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"222","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poly.2022.115948","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d3168fdbe831a382e4675","name":"Robert","lastName":"Wieczorek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2d1d66ff-9a6e-44e1-9c45-7e68b8ea1d6d"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ad7a","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kloska","uuid":"62F3438B37EA27AB37E2A95CD831B796466A61A65D4C3D2220D2BD19A50B4CC2FFF3F8154820BA41681653DE3CB8CA9C89A7896526B639AE76F8BD01B33F4F91","orcidId":"0000-0002-5168-0232","documentHash":"28ef2ede-af4d-4c8c-a2fb-8f428edf9364"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398c96","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Zdrowowicz-Żamojć","uuid":"3FB36AF387E8F58F815406E4CEED5FAFAC835648D621C64380291E74D0FB2370C270578428D93DE3D53D77C55A06AA68F19587114AC96BF689A7060C2B8D607D","orcidId":"0000-0003-4377-6004","documentHash":"ae256810-7299-498c-a2ba-1f5f7493ea1d"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a0473931fb","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Wyrzykowski","uuid":"3B956F9C0B7686ED59275CFF3B8648BA8F9C3CB89F93EE35AB167E88A6838A0B159273F225F93E005C235A3E473106580C59CB88CEC569E4F34A6BC83DBE7B2F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3823-3286","documentHash":"f1e4ddf0-1ffe-4622-a596-7c9ab1503df1"},{"objectId":"5e709249878c28a0473931da","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Makowska","uuid":"F5ED27CBCBC8FEF4539239EA4F2C0114432217C993610C3D893A1CB7C26DD254F7DBD34AD6B961BBC9BACC27856B8E80A4462FD96649108D408AD383F3E9E5D4","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d5e7a8a4-af08-452a-a490-4d623d2ff996"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.poly.2022.115948"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["athlete-coach relationship","sport emotions and motives","young athletes","sport psychology"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709375878c28a0473aa177"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Dimensions of athlete-coach relationship and sport anxiety as predictors of the changes in psychomotor and motivational welfare of child athletes after the implementation of the psychological workshops for coaches","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","doi":null,"issn":"1661-7827","eissn":"1660-4601","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e236e16e-7430-4ac3-800c-033637860e22"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-15","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"623c73342467f04a32f1a988","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709375878c28a0473aa177","677cf1d7fdbe831a382b867c","677cf1d7fdbe831a382b867d","677cf1d7fdbe831a382b867e","677cf1d7fdbe831a382b867f"]},"issue":"6","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"(1) Background: Coach workshops based on seven principles (inspiration, explanation, expectation, support, reward, appreciation, growth, and winning) enhance the sport experience of adult athletes.

The work is focused on quantitative and qualitative microstructural characterization of selected γ-γ′ type Co-based superalloys obtained by gravity casting. The four Co-based alloys were prepared via vacuum induction melting. The microstructure was analyzed by means of light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The microstructural parameters such as porosity and secondary dendrite arm spacing (SDAS) were evaluated by image analysis. The new Co-based superalloys are characterized by proper as-cast microstructure owing to low SDAS and limited microporosity. The values of secondary dendrite arm spacing are comparable for all alloys. The W-free alloys containing Mo and Nb exhibit substantially lower shrinkage porosity compared to those of Co–Al–W and Co–Ni–Al–W. Due to crystallization of Mo and Nb rich phases at lower temperatures, these alloys are characterized by higher solidification range.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233111","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"2147-2156","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40962-022-00918-2","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"676a75befdbe831a38261605","name":"Damian","lastName":"Migas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"11027689-173c-4c88-98b5-725e2fb6b8fd"},{"objectId":"5e709245878c28a047392d1d","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Moskal","uuid":"78C02F7E257C44906FFD96A25B79CE805A883E092168DBB1C916E8C0421591B7D21DBAE421486318FE761EBD6790F1978B94EB690598741EF5087FF8B957C5EA","orcidId":"0000-0001-7396-6568","documentHash":"30f43abd-3ddb-475b-bab8-a2f62e94c049"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047390efe","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Roskosz","uuid":"14A27C406973480D84B051FFA4C3FC669611D25439A2CAED6006F33FD24763D2FB9B426640F2A0C17B2C940C828FA3844D5200AF4196A4169071E090C10DC80B","orcidId":"0000-0002-7540-1410","documentHash":"11118d4b-0a3b-4787-8b2a-287a811eae0d"}],"doi":"10.1007/s40962-022-00918-2"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6437eb514097076e1e3423b6","doi":"10.34918/84434","title":"Multifaceted research in architecture.

In Poland, the primary sources of pollution emissions come from road transport and combustion processes from municipal and residential sources. One of the air pollution parameters is particulate matter (PM), a complex mixture of solid particles and liquids. Aim: The study discusses the most severe effects of particulate matter on child development.\n\nMaterial and methods\nLiterature search was performed using the medical database PubMed in time period from 2007 to 2021 using the following MESH-terms: air pollution, child, particulate matter, low birth weight, asthma, environmental pollutions, respiratory system.\n\nResults\nThe harmful effects of air pollution on foetal growth and the development of the child’s internal organs and its endocrine system are presented in this paper. In the prenatal phase, endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs), by mimicking or even blocking the action of specific human hormones, may affect the endocrine balance of oestradiol and progesterone, which have a significant influence on the child’s organ development. Air pollution can trigger and exacerbate asthma in children who already have it, while the role of air pollution in asthma development is debatable. Components of air pollution, including PM0.1, can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and activate inflammatory protein markers IL-6 and TNF-α, and induce inflammatory microstates.\n\nConclusions\nEven a slight reduction in air pollutant emissions has a positive effect on a child’s health."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233125","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"9","pagesFromTo":"179-185","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/The-impact-of-particulate-matter-on-prenatal-and-infant-child-development,123,47747,1,1.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d37defdbe831a382ed991","name":"Michał","lastName":"Surdacki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2a7df29b-665b-41be-aebf-f23a9d93b465"},{"objectId":"5e709233878c28a04739195c","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Sobieszczańska","uuid":"82A3B6C8401D69C250606DF7F88C94E9E83D812AA30A10809C5D35C4BD286C2D90C8C4439144B85363AE6C40658377CF5FD84BE2017E0754FBE81A4F7493ABE0","orcidId":"0000-0003-4374-9866","documentHash":"650d4f30-df49-49c2-98f4-54a2ab876b57"}],"doi":"10.5114/pja.2022.119230"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["IP3R","paraptosis","ER stress","apoptosis","anticancer activity","usnic acid"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["677d3120fdbe831a382e3da5","5e70945c878c28a0473bb546","5e7092b1878c28a04739ad73","5e7092b1878c28a04739ad85","5e70935e878c28a0473a849a","5e709249878c28a04739319f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The isoxazole derivative of usnic acid induces an ER stress response in breast cancer cells that leads to paraptosis-like cell death","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","doi":null,"issn":"1422-0067","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"850accc5-0c0e-4f6c-9a84-eaa108a84f20"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-04","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62444fa32467f070c45e4484","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094dd878c28a0473c58a5","5e7092b1878c28a04739ad85","5e70935e878c28a0473a849a","5e70945c878c28a0473bb546","5e7092b1878c28a04739ad73","5e709249878c28a04739319f","677d3120fdbe831a382e3da3","677d3120fdbe831a382e3da4","677d3120fdbe831a382e3da5"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Derivatives of usnic acid (UA), a secondary metabolite from lichens, were synthesized to improve its anticancer activity and selectivity. Recently we reported the synthesis and activity of an UA isoxazole derivative, named 2b, against cancer cells of different origins. Herein, the molecular mechanisms underlying its activity and efficacy in vivo were tested. The viability of breast cancer or normal cells has been tested using an MTT assay. Cell and organelle morphology was analyzed using light, electron and fluorescence microscopy. Gene expression was evaluated by RNAseq and protein levels were evaluated by Western blotting. In vivo anticancer activity was evaluated in a mice xenograft model. We found that 2b induced massive vacuolization which originated from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ER stress markers were upregulated both at the mRNA and protein levels. ER stress was caused by the release of Ca2+ ions from the ER by IP3R channels which was mediated, at least partly, by phospholipase C (PLC)-synthetized 1,4,5-inositol triphosphate (IP3). ER stress led to cell death with features of apoptosis and paraptosis. When applied to nude mice with xenografted breast cancer cells, 2b stopped tumour growth. In mice treated with 2b, vacuolization was observed in tumour cells, but not in other organs. This study shows that the antiproliferative activity of 2b relates to the induction of ER stress in cancer, not in healthy, cells and it leads to breast cancer cell death in vitro and in vivo."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233126","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms23031802","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d3120fdbe831a382e3da5","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Ryś","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"358c0451-59a6-42bf-acab-0afd2787d5ae"},{"objectId":"677d3120fdbe831a382e3da4","name":"Tristan","lastName":"Reekie","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ea28ad43-6193-4973-a02f-044f8f09fd49"},{"objectId":"677d3120fdbe831a382e3da3","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Pyrczak‐Felczykowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"27012408-3ae6-4c31-be98-2ee47022e182"},{"objectId":"5e7094dd878c28a0473c58a5","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Jąkalski","uuid":"759EBEDD6DFCC9FF18CC4CD74A9268B8D925F358539EA9D5AFEE3A822B0906E62673D29DABBE5924BCC4DFDEB837EA3338BD8C90E4640A0E6781CE101657AD85","orcidId":"0000-0002-5481-9148","documentHash":"17802d31-5578-4955-9aef-0ecde1a1137a"},{"objectId":"5e70945c878c28a0473bb546","name":"Anna","lastName":"Pawlik","uuid":"FFE3C0C0056CA331D40D2B3A922BB2B35DDE2BBB4C35FCA90BC514BA54BDEDEBBD301103AD0C4250465EA4AEEF1BAA62AD822D0599859CC974D56CBF3D81BD1F","orcidId":"0000-0001-9566-0025","documentHash":"7f818a81-f5ac-4bf7-8a7c-8d584160ca95"},{"objectId":"5e70935e878c28a0473a849a","name":"Marcelina","lastName":"Malinowska","uuid":"4B2E7ADF0C47777CAE51A60C9B6832F50EB5C614FAB5830D79AE94A9BA523AAA285D0C220AC33457E9BA9056129A1D6692958A6C422EF8B6F76A321750C08C9D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"12e29008-7d66-4310-b7c8-2bfad59f8b0d"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ad85","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Hać","uuid":"6282499D993D385F8EAA9F777DA254998389C0B18DB5438CFB0F29DB79EA4289A47683CA92C6D413A65D2EA07D166D0185DAAB021D4B3CCAAB8147849409D60B","orcidId":"0000-0002-0478-3263","documentHash":"0badc709-cd0f-4c23-8075-263b70324cac"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ad73","name":"Beata","lastName":"Guzow-Krzemińska","uuid":"B9BF6FAA3DEB421C91771703D293D0DA85463050D4F88AD77DD8BDC7BD551C7D7051D98306E455CC5491A24CBF81E0A9893AC8EF6A455FE354E29F4F7A078D68","orcidId":"0000-0003-0805-7987","documentHash":"3a684223-f851-4b4f-b3ab-c514e93ea88a"},{"objectId":"5e709249878c28a04739319f","name":"Anna","lastName":"Herman-Antosiewicz","uuid":"1A08B766C33FD2F19A05AD33E2ADDD6F000A57FB79DD99FBC2A39A303FA93C914F857ACCFED682F42BC24985F7C3C08BFD530EE4F13401414B2E4C8D8D3800BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-0526-2168","documentHash":"eda548ff-c13c-4d92-add7-f493a76e5ddc"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms23031802"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["odlew

Three types of developed structures S1, S2, S3 differed significantly in topography and surface morphology. Thanks to the use of pulse overlapping in both scanning directions, the structures S1 and S2 were highly homogeneous, while in structure S3 the parallel grooves were obtained by pulse overlapping in one direction. The modified surfaces were examined for morphology (scanning electron microscopy), roughness (optical profilometry), wettability (measurement of the contact angle) and changes in the chemical structure of the polymer (infrared spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography). The possibility of modifying these surface properties in a broad range was also discussed. The conducted cellular studies showed that there was no cytotoxicity with regard to all samples and that the pace of fibroblast colonization of samples S1 was higher compared to that of the control during the first 24 h of experiment. Moreover, the ability of S. aureus (pathogenic bacteria) and of a biotechnologically useful fungus Saccharomyces boulardii to colonize the manufactured structures was also assessed. In this case, no significant differences in the number of biofilm-forming cells were observed between the analyzed samples and the control setting. Obtained results indicate that applicability of such surface modifications should be further investigated, especially for the development of bone implants and these biotechnological processes in which microbes are used to produce the desired yield of

to unique features, proline residues may control protein structure and function. Here, we investigated the role of 52PPQ54 residues, indicated by the recently established experimental 3D structure of bovine herpesvirus 1-encoded UL49.5 protein as forming a characteristic proline hinge motif in its N-terminal domain. UL49.5 acts as a potent inhibitor of the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), which alters the antiviral immune response. Mechanisms employed by UL49.5 to affect TAP remain undetermined on a molecular level. We found that mutations in the 52PPQ54 region had a vast impact on its immunomodulatory function, increasing cell surface MHC class I expression, TAP levels, and peptide transport efficiency. This inhibitory effect was specific for UL49.5 activity towards TAP but not towards the viral glycoprotein M. To get an insight into the impact of proline hinge modifications on structure and dynamics, we performed all-atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics studies on the native protein and PPQ mutants. The results demonstrated that the proline hinge sequence with its highly rigid conformation served as an anchor into the membrane. This anchor was responsible for the structural and dynamical behavior of the whole protein, constraining the mobility of the C-terminus, increasing the mobility of the transmembrane region, and controlling the accessibility of the C-terminal residues to the cytoplasmic environment. Those features appear crucial for TAP binding and inhibition. Our findings significantly advance the structural understanding of the UL49.5 protein and its functional regions and support the importance of proline motifs for the protein structure."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233148","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"435","pagesFromTo":"1-24","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2023.167964","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677cdb10fdbe831a382852a4","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Lubocki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ee6fefe9-75be-4f24-a0ba-2b9d0296bf29"},{"objectId":"677cdb10fdbe831a382852a3","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Krupa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d99b34bd-3754-4e07-8b14-e64216a4273a"},{"objectId":"677cdb10fdbe831a382852a2","name":"Magda","lastName":"Wąchalska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f4aa4f24-6822-417b-b1a4-3e9c10e76aec"},{"objectId":"5e70945c878c28a0473bb4d1","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Graul","uuid":"0C2B71CF6BCFD514A93F090E47E592CB2EC8646340BEB71EBDD866C77A1EA33F8B684E0B2B56AE40F15958ED5E4E681F5531F002E7A54C17A2E69B6367684B7C","orcidId":"0000-0002-4769-1991","documentHash":"87e8c775-93e3-4354-8a91-9b9995479626"},{"objectId":"5e70945b878c28a0473bb457","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Karska","uuid":"11850476324F3EEF5ED0D7A54EB5D0C4A6CB20A6B4644D1DEEFE5FC5AC025C08F4A79A817B99793036DC3EE0ED1B4138CA127F80B93EC8CFCE03881F297B8AA5","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c40c5e96-4512-4e07-a4ca-1eee5f16e175"},{"objectId":"5e70941f878c28a0473b6957","name":"Adam","lastName":"Sieradzan","uuid":"91AE28AA8E9D17E2D793BC99725763459D566DB75574D3AE619E73A99E2633E593F2BD8AEE441156BE0C8681790D7299421EA26448014A5C63D192ADECA7449B","orcidId":"0000-0002-2426-3644","documentHash":"42fb16aa-04a9-4e93-9f4e-02fe5a1a7d7e"},{"objectId":"5e7092b3878c28a04739aef6","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Ślusarz","uuid":"EFDF4A146EB446C6A16A01194B8C62FB30261B6739CB49429B520D02F63C51D091967C8E7A7B398202256969D7FDB802C01DA019095B1EF4B4904A14466C8A50","orcidId":"0000-0002-9411-4679","documentHash":"3194cfd3-7b5c-494b-adde-e2e614c7a3f4"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a0473931f4","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Rodziewicz-Motowidło","uuid":"DC1BA0FAC2CC1F07647DBDB64AFFC519F282E6ED5F74ED61933F2E6778A3E1B8AB4202511635282C89E36B6BD60DCC69643787FC203C73C6D7105C93FA51968A","orcidId":"0000-0002-4471-5951","documentHash":"78ad2a69-6641-4a64-9507-2d01299f8e34"},{"objectId":"5e709249878c28a0473930ea","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Lipińska","uuid":"839A455CE6F53DD4D63A4E809E67CF2922096B3445DC52C30F941F623AAA2345C1C9C798F5665F49F33D6D7F6A822CE179BFCF9893608071E52C65533B996A2F","orcidId":"0000-0002-8115-9499","documentHash":"504927d8-d976-4ca0-9130-115435de469c"},{"objectId":"5e709249878c28a0473930e2","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Bieńkowska-Szewczyk","uuid":"7D8A713A219F21B4D69763C0FDD7FC84D45C24E398A2A102E7772455DBF518C48E26A391D663EDC5688096615B1F574C2C274F87BC2170BA88FC82336DD09896","orcidId":"0000-0003-3650-2902","documentHash":"ae4cabaf-bc2a-422d-b3fe-cb5fe3d0ce31"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jmb.2023.167964"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["odwodnienie

study’s aim was assessing of the relationship between mentalization and life satisfaction and the level of adaptation to oncological disease in patients with breast cancer. The study involved 41 women (M = 59.88; SD = 8.81) with breast cancer who completed their treatments and participated in a cancer rehabilitation program. In the study, we used the Mentalization Questionnaire (MZQ), the Satisfaction Life Scale (SWLS), and the Mini-Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale (Mini-MAC). The mean of declared level of mentalization was 45.54 (SD = 11.65). The significant correlation between mentalization (its general value and individual dimensions) and satisfaction with life/mental adjustment to cancer was observed. The strongest positive correlations were noted between refusing self-reflection, helplessness–hopelessness, and anxious preoccupation and the negative correlation between mentalization and satisfaction with life. Mentalization was a predictor of satisfaction with life and mental adjustment to illness. Mentalization was related with life satisfaction and adjustment to cancer in patients with breast cancer, which is in line with previous studies suggesting the crucial role of subjective psychological factors in maintaining mental health."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233161","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677cf19bfdbe831a382b7e7f","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Cieślak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d076c73a-7954-4cd1-9830-37bc7ad0862c"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a047399452","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Golińska","uuid":"C0FE14D90232C30AE0E315B1AEA61C8B949DCDA9273E7128587BF76AA165456670A02DC4EC2A2740779233A0583F0C805B56D2B127B5FFF8D20221732EEBADCA","orcidId":"0000-0001-7407-0720","documentHash":"be3b89a3-1a6c-4665-a0e3-fdea1d4bafc1"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a047397866","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kozaka","uuid":"5FFAF68DC0EF714DE45E5D6B81801539C1F9666B9E9B638430B60DFECB9EC03CB1B99B84E5B148646D843DB0FCFFFD5DF46488BC0BC8E987017B9B35C83D4203","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"21a1f25b-1e01-409b-901e-4ea8aff87f51"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a047397851","name":"Mariola","lastName":"Bidzan","uuid":"1869BD33761551788A683EC850679AC84D90127BF13E7E5D3C9AFC6EB33D7ABEE0C4308AD5631DBE19E33076F2E915553E075780DAF2500954C32965EF5B8CF8","orcidId":"0000-0003-0224-1994","documentHash":"8707fb87-5f58-4c8f-9fc5-6e109660a67d"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph191610323"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["quality

field studies were conducted in three ephemeral river islets of the middle Pripyat River, southern Belarus in 2006–2007. Nestlings of the Northern Lapwing (Vanellus vanellus) were ringed soon after hatching, and reencountered during subsequent visits. Post-hatching survival was estimated by capture-mark-recapture models. Daily survival rates of the Northern Lapwing chicks were very high, varying between 0.90 and 0.99, and the cumulative survival rates over 35 days between hatching and fledging were 0.54 and 0.70 in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Survival rate was lower in the first ten days of life, which is similar to that reported in other precocial species. The key factor supporting this high breeding success is low predation due to nesting of lapwings on periodic river islets that naturally restrict access by mammalian predators and apparent scarcity of terrestrial and avian predators. River islet habitats with co-occurrence of dry and wet fertile microhabitats provide optimum feeding conditions for the Lapwing chicks with a wide range of aquatic, ground and surface invertebrates. Moreover, semicolonial breeding of the Northern Lapwing (about 30 nests/ha) with other waders, terns and gulls increases the effectiveness of anti-predator behaviour. Consequently as a result of low predation pressure and good foraging conditions, in 2006 and 2007, productivity was 2.1 and 2.8 fledged young per single nest with four chicks respectively, a value hardly reported in Europe, except in managed sites."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233169","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"100","pagesFromTo":"17-26","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d3032fdbe831a382e2005","name":"Pavel","lastName":"Pinchuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5aeda8e4-6b56-4342-947e-6db0a38abace"},{"objectId":"677d3032fdbe831a382e2004","name":"Natali","lastName":"Karlionova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a57f41c5-eb89-49ac-9593-bfb6abac9252"},{"objectId":"677d3032fdbe831a382e2003","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Neubauer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fb4f59d5-ef5a-498d-a853-463baf6be61e"},{"objectId":"677d3032fdbe831a382e2002","name":"Lucyna","lastName":"Pilacka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"07c39e48-def2-4756-b8a2-9d03d92267c4"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a047393845","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Meissner","uuid":"B216FC1695AF75B8F6A762180599E05E2A9FFA3A6437FB172A210382791D79AF0FA2F52AD25BB0D10382FB9882AFECF563C5795B1729B014693966A594EAEDD5","orcidId":"0000-0001-5995-9185","documentHash":"e33e5ec7-21ff-4a0a-b754-2f00dbacce8f"}],"doi":"10.51812/of.124843"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["jonopłyny","ciecze jonowe","izobaryczna pojemność cieplna","nanorurki węglowe"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["carbon nanotubes","isobaric heat capacity","ionic liquids","ionanofluids"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70923d878c28a047392353","5e7093c5878c28a0473b0747","677d1ef9fdbe831a382db2f7","5fc4c39e085dcb1e6ae0b8ee"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"On isobaric heat capacity of ionanofluids with carbon nanotubes – an experimental study","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454788ad","mniswId":"11911","title":"Journal of Molecular Liquids","doi":null,"issn":"0167-7322","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e2167a97-56be-4ac4-81e7-457a12a26deb"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-07-08","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6548d21b4097072019f287ab","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923d878c28a047392353","5e7093c5878c28a0473b0747","5fc4c39e085dcb1e6ae0b8ee","677d1ef9fdbe831a382db2f3","677d1ef9fdbe831a382db2f4","677d1ef9fdbe831a382db2f5","677d1ef9fdbe831a382db2f6","677d1ef9fdbe831a382db2f7","677d1ef9fdbe831a382db2f8"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Ionanofluids (INFs) are defined as ionic liquids (ILs) with therein dispersed nanoparticles. The addition of nanoparticles results in an increase in the thermal conductivity of INFs. In terms of specific isobaric heat capacity (cp) this influence is not yet clear due to contradictory results published up to date. In this work, we assessed the influence of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on the cp of INFs by means of DSC. We selected 13 different types of ILs and two mixtures of them as the base for INFs. 9 different types of CNTs were chosen: (singlewalled carbon nanotubes) SWCNTs, helical CNTs, Nanocyl multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and in-house 16h MWCNTs, MWCNTs functionalized with carboxylic groups (single bondCOOH), hydroxylic groups (single bondOH), C18 n-alkyl chain or polyethylene glycol (PEG). Functionalized MWCNTs have never been investigated in terms of the cp of INFs. A total of 43 INFs were obtained and studied. The influence of CNTs on the cp of INFs was critically analyzed with consideration to the cp of base liquid and its agreement with data available in the literature, and with consideration to measurement uncertainty. Also, the cp of some pristine CNTs (as a bulk material), namely Nanocyl MWCNTs and in-house 16h MWCNTs, was examined. In the most of systems, the addition of CNTs did not affect the cp of INFs. In the others, the effects were minor and not greater than 3.1 %. In the end, the model proposed to estimate the cp of nanofluid, including the existence of nanolayer of IL on the CNT, was critically examined."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233171","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"387","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molliq.2023.122535","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d1ef9fdbe831a382db2f8","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Dzida","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9f3fff95-c9d8-4c3b-b318-dfd2995fb2b3"},{"objectId":"677d1ef9fdbe831a382db2f7","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kolanowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b83faff2-7edf-43d6-978c-7846c64e2826"},{"objectId":"677d1ef9fdbe831a382db2f6","name":"Edward","lastName":"Zorębski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1543a858-7e55-476d-a3cc-5980cdb2059d"},{"objectId":"677d1ef9fdbe831a382db2f5","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Scheller","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b2deaf75-b5ae-40a0-968a-0e205d191239"},{"objectId":"677d1ef9fdbe831a382db2f4","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Dziadosz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"17c61bf9-beaf-4393-947b-478365848b87"},{"objectId":"677d1ef9fdbe831a382db2f3","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Cwynar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a78c16ae-8e1d-463b-b09e-bae1a6c998b2"},{"objectId":"5fc4c39e085dcb1e6ae0b8ee","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kuziel","uuid":"5309F58649AC86F43EC84C1C8D70F80BB937283476C6777DC616301B99AF38C7B69E2D17056C1D74E0956DA046F5F62696C9E2DEDF6820030B54D943BC9030D4","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4de8124d-5a52-4165-93d9-49297292fa1f"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b0747","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Boncel","uuid":"5B6F9899B70CE4B98A7E69AC2D1E181B1479A5D469FBDDB077476F789C04383E029C29A8993F84E40F1A12918D866B859D0CE10CB8BA8E857F0F3D747CBC4E89","orcidId":"0000-0002-0787-5243","documentHash":"fd590e22-7d8e-43a3-9ec5-a8d67bf8b5f2"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a047392353","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Jędrysiak","uuid":"09A1679BB51AA6740CFF131566490262A7E6EB6768469400FA3E176E13AE9F2CE82111E1FF2A91B8E504E83140005050E52343D47102624A63352BFCD0ACDBDA","orcidId":"0000-0002-4635-0028","documentHash":"c3583404-957d-479d-91d5-414815d9e084"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.molliq.2023.122535"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["emisje

A huge number of people dive in different places. The most obvious are natural places such as seas or lakes. Among other directions of diving activity there are also disused open-air mines flooded with water. It is clear that there are not the same number of natural attractions. The management of the diving centre on Lake Zakrzówek, in order to increase the attractiveness of the site, carried out a number of underwater works. This is an old stone mine flooded with water. The maximum depth is 33 meters, but most of the architectural attractions are between 5 and 15 meters deep. The things placed there created an architectural space. Hundreds of divers have visited this place. The collection of architectural attractions was very diverse. Some things underwater were very original. There are simple structures such as: training platforms, shelters, mirrors, monuments, and some sunken things that are not architectural, such as an airplane, bus, car, and ship model. The study is a case study, describing how primitive construction activity can create an attractive underwater architectural space. Despite the very interesting natural shape of the lake bottom, the underwater architectural space was one of the greatest attractions of this place and a destination for diving trips. Presented work is the case study shows that the space built under the water in Zakrzówek was of great value as a document of the human creation in unusual conditions. Currently, the reconstruction of the border of Zakrzówek is underway. It is interesting if the architectural space will exist there, after.

The anodized implant surface was covered by a poly(sebacic anhydride) (PSBA) layer with amoxicillin. SEM analysis showed an irregular distribution of the antibiotic on the surface. However, confocal microscopy images revealed the formation of a uniform polymer layer. The thickness of the oxide and polymer layers was similar, between 6 and 9 μm. PSBA is an easy, hydrolysable polymer. After the polymer with amoxicillin was immersed in phosphate buffered solution (PBS) for 1 h, >53 % of hydrolysis products were detected by 1H NMR spectroscopy. After 9 days of polymer immersion, the hydrolysis product content was >67 %. Drug release was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). After 1 h of implant immersion in PBS an average of 6.0 μg/mL of amoxicillin was released. Importantly, the released concentration of amoxicillin was enough to inhibit S. aureus and S. epidermidis growth, minimal inhibitory concentration (inhibition zones between 27 mm and 30 mm) and decrease bacteria adhesion to the implant surface were achieved. This paper presents the cytocompatibility results of PSBA, amoxicillin, and extracts collected from the implants exposed to mouse fibroblast L929 and osteoblast-like MG-63 cells. PSBA concentrations up to 1 % did not significantly affect cell viability. Amoxicillin concentrations up to 150 μL/mL were cytocompatible with both cell lines.

Practitioners reclaim the post-excavation sites over a long time to repair the environment. The areas that could not be used for agricultural or forestry purposes need to be reclaimed. The common practice used fertilization of the mineral soil substrate and planting herbaceous plants, shrubs, and trees. Unfortunately, alien plants were frequently planted. Global environmental change shows that these practices were not successful. Environmentalists around the world studied the reasons for the failure of reclamation practices. The study of spontaneous succession, which took place on the same post-mineral excavation sites, has shown that the natural processes are more effective in recovering ecosystem functioning on post-mineral excavation sites. The spontaneous vegetation development and ecosystem functioning on post-mineral excavation sites are non-analogous to any known natural and seminatural habitats. The non-analogous Novel Ecosystems on post-mineral excavation sites are very poorly understood. Adaptation processes are very intense on post-mineral excavation sites. Studies provide evidence that Novel Ecosystems support Ecosystem Services for citizens in the densely populated urban-industrial areas. Understanding the Novel Ecosystems’ functioning is crucial for the right actions on the sites that need to be managed to enhance ecosystem functioning (Natural Capital) and Ecosystem Services. Understanding the functioning of the Novel Ecosystems and urban-industrial ecosystems and their proper management is crucial for preventing global change."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233211","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"375-386","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://opus.us.edu.pl/info/article/USL7bbb7f389a014a2ea715265c157c62fc/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602dfb7d9543c7410626e996","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Ryś","uuid":"877227101D713CF5CEA035B488BD40FB4388E138A56DB85DEDCC7227E0C14628EEB672A2CE353BE32FBF2A4C8A9BD5A6A30DC12A51E47CF5A444674C76EAE141","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aa593845-f81f-4b32-b6d6-670638275ec5"},{"objectId":"602b67869543c7410626dcf4","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Radosz","uuid":"392CD7B92FC6E5161652F018E3DCB90A49E8FE1B382B3B2168620CF12978ED944055E8F11B54B9E0FD3975E28E917065EFAC21F5B66EDB401D6FE837A99C863F","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2f0f2af3-d4c2-4215-97e8-81abf30e590d"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473beab2","name":"Artur","lastName":"Dyczko","uuid":"89A90BE47B33188D72DB120229F0AE2C512AD3DB49FD20F72D1289B9B588FD8E2A6695AC68B5BBF649805E854CCBB468E5293795B66F3D7DCDBBE1847C091DB5","orcidId":"0000-0001-6387-5339","documentHash":"b2f0ab36-c883-406b-9a40-d89bfdd66da9"},{"objectId":"5e7092e7878c28a04739f022","name":"Gabriela","lastName":"Woźniak","uuid":"2D9FBD547ED5A35CF5E1E8D2C5DD7679C3C0131E7732BE3AC783A27D55AC85FF0DA6826E6609ED403B95EF9697D29BDBD2B4621647DA0B5DEB0701E6C4E2184A","orcidId":"0000-0003-1936-2880","documentHash":"9db4886c-beb8-4af7-a752-7933a8390aa4"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19","thrombosis","thrombocytopaenia","vaccines","platelet factor 4"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Klementyna Sobieska po poważnych perturbacjach i ucieczce z cesarskiego więzienia poślubiła Jakuba Stuarta i zamieszkała w Rzymie. Natychmiast dostała się w wir walk toczących się w zajadle rywalizującym środowisku jakobitów. Główne fakcje tworzyli faworyci królewscy James Murray i John Hay oraz ich wróg John Erskine, diuk Mar. Maria Klementyna – zapewne za namową faworytów – została pozbawiona dam do towarzystwa, którymi powinny być małżonki arystokratów, niechętnie postrzegane przez Stuarta. Tymczasem Sobieska bez entuzjazmu powitała w swoim apartamencie Marjorie Hay. Wkrótce stało się jasne, że królowa współpracuje z gronem niechętnym faworytom, domagając się uwagi małżonka, a może nawet dostępu do jego politycznej korespondencji i kontaktów z jakobitami. Gdy Stuart powierzył opiekę na starszym synem Jamesowi Murrayowi, pozbawiając królową jedynego poważnego obowiązku i ograniczając jej kontakty \nz synem, Maria Klementyna opuściła pałac i schroniła się w klasztorze. Wskutek pośrednictwa i nacisku dworów europejskich powróciła do męża, którego otoczenie opuścili John i Marjorie Hayowie. Królowa zdołała wywalczyć niezależność, a mąż stworzył dla niej odrębny dwór. Nieporozumienia dotyczyły także finansowania otoczenia Sobieskiej, a kilka zachowanych rachunków pozwala wskazać, na co ona sama przeznaczała swoje pieniądze."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233223","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ad425740970728ba306626","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"39","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"279c8d71-fab9-4808-988f-5f7010e7a5a6"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"39","pagesFromTo":"141-159","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://czasopisma.ignatianum.edu.pl/pk/article/view/2521/2197","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092e7878c28a04739f04d","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Skrzypietz","uuid":"9FC2BF97D97C73386AA062020D693C290CF9FEE1981E92120077CB1B2263A7A4584E8D55BDF70C438EB39158B3C1D1B2F2C1666448CF67AB8B0F20C344D9F8E5","orcidId":"0000-0003-1504-9950","documentHash":"64059115-953a-4e0c-9741-dbaa251ef239"}],"doi":"10.35765/pk.2022.3904.12."},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["AgInS2/ZnS","AgInS2","AgInS2/HgS","AgInS2/CdS","defekt","kropki kwantowe"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["quantum dots","AgInS2/ZnS","defect","AgInS2","AgInS2/HgS","AgInS2/CdS"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924c878c28a0473933dc"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Spectroscopic and structural implications of hosting Zn2+, Cd2+ and Hg2+ ions in the AgInS2 quantum dots","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478447","mniswId":"10084","title":"Journal of Alloys and Compounds","doi":null,"issn":"0925-8388","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"37cda613-9b9d-4318-be81-d3f797a14da5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-18","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63cc19894097070d6acce824","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924c878c28a0473933dc","677cd5ddfdbe831a38278c52","677cd5ddfdbe831a38278c53","677cd5ddfdbe831a38278c54","677cd5ddfdbe831a38278c55"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This work address the issue of spectral implications provided by doping AgInS2 QDs with Zn2+ and its higher homologues including Cd2+ and Hg2+. The impact of alloying AgInS2 QD with IIB group atoms is here discussed in terms of comprehensive spectroscopic measurements as well as theoretical predictions performed within the Density Functional Theory. It is shown that each of the admixtures used induces a completely different spectral response including complete reversal character for Cd2+ and Hg2+ ions. Observed differences were here associated with changes in the native defects structure and possible relaxation pathways due to doping. It is shown that Zn2+ ions results in quite weak impact on the emission properties of the AgInS2 QDs. Highest impact was found for Cd2+ and Hg2+ ions. Doping AgInS2 QDs with Cd2+ results in successive deactivation of the relaxation pathways which were typical for pristine AgInS2 QDs leading to significant shortening of the photoluminescence lifetime and partial band symmetrisation. Doping with Hg2+ ions was found to be of completely opposite character. It was found that mercury adatom has the lowest affinity to the AgInS2 surface giving rise to formation of metallic Hg-Ag complexes on a surface which may be responsible for anomalous behaviour of Hg-doped AgInS2 QDs."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233236","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"911","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.164977","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677cd5ddfdbe831a38278c55","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Cichy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9610c067-3eef-4cb8-9865-f85f58e45fe5"},{"objectId":"677cd5ddfdbe831a38278c54","name":"Oleksii","lastName":"Bezkrovnyi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0865ced7-2758-4b7d-836f-70bebc6ff9bf"},{"objectId":"677cd5ddfdbe831a38278c53","name":"Adam","lastName":"Olejniczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"051cebd3-0e7d-4231-b433-9c0c837e0618"},{"objectId":"677cd5ddfdbe831a38278c52","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Kosman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ac9163d0-2f56-4603-b084-57570053708d"},{"objectId":"5e70924c878c28a0473933dc","name":"Mirosława","lastName":"Pawlyta","uuid":"3B6053FD9AC34BCBD9CBA5C495137F1B1B262DC01E4EB17F9AD88EEA3FE9E2877E505A1823CDA7B8054EB2E1BE1591763B077FC206DD4244C4867CE76EABB9E4","orcidId":"0000-0001-9072-3306","documentHash":"0f84f6d5-a6c6-4a86-83c6-de0965b4f9bb"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jallcom.2022.164977"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Gliwice","przestrzeń publiczna"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Gliwice","public space"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6437eb2c4097076e1e341a7b","doi":"10.34918/83377","title":"Modele struktury miasta Gliwice.

Adsorption on porous materials is considered one of the most promising technologies for VOC removal due to its cost-effectiveness, operational flexibility, and low energy consumption. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of VOC adsorption on various porous adsorbents and indicate future research directions in this field. It is focused on (i) the molecular characterization of structures, polarity, and boiling points of VOCs, (ii) the adsorption mechanisms and adsorption interactions in the physical, chemical, and competitive adsorption of VOCs on adsorbents, and (iii) the favorable characteristics of materials for VOCs adsorption. Porous adsorbents that would play an important role in the removal of benzene and other VOCs are presented in detail, including carbon-based materials (activated carbons, active carbon fibers, ordered mesoporous carbons, and graphene-based materials), metal-organic frameworks, covalent organic frameworks, zeolites, and siliceous adsorbents.

Deficits within the attentional system were previously signaled in preterm children; however, studies lacked in consideration of an intragroup differentiation. Thus, this study aimed to verify whether deficits in the attentional mechanisms are inter-individually differentiated among very prematurely born children and if so, which biomedical and non-biomedical factors are associated with the profile of deficits within the attentional system. We tested the efficiency of attentional processes among 5-year-old children with the Attention Network Task – Child Version. The results have indicated that 26% of very preterm children presented with the suboptimal functioning of the attentional system (more than 1 SD below mean score of full-term children in attentional alerting and orienting), whereas 74% were characterized by the normal efficiency of attention. The profile of attentional deficits observed among very preterm preschoolers was associated with significantly lower birth weight and decreased family living standard.

It has been shown that the elimination of coelomic fluid cytotoxicity to\nnormal human cells was crucial for the generation of the non-toxic Venetin-1\nprotein-polysaccharide complex, which exhibits selective activity against Candida\nalbicans cells as well as A549 non-small cell lung cancer cells. To find the\nmolecular mechanisms behind the anti-cancer properties of the preparation,\nthis research investigated the proteome response of A549 cells to the\npresence of Venetin-1. The sequential window acquisition of all theoretical\nmass spectra (SWATH-MS) methodology was used for the analysis, which\nallows for a relative quantitative analysis to be carried out without\nradiolabelling.

The structures of the compounds were confirmed by spectroscopy (IR, NMR), mass spectrometry (HRMS or MALDI-TOF/TOF), elemental analysis (C,H,N) and X-ray crystallography. The cytotoxic activity of the obtained compounds toward three tumor cell lines, HCT-116, MCF-7 and HeLa, was examined. The results showed that some of the most active compounds belonged to the R1 = 4-trifluoromethylbenzyl and R1 = 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzyl series and exhibited IC50 values ranging from 3.6 µM to 11.0 µM. The SAR relationships were described, indicating the key role of the R2 = 4-phenylpiperazin-1-yl substituent for the cytotoxic activity against the HCT-116 and MCF-7 lines. The studies regarding the mechanism of action of the active compounds included the assessment of the inhibition of MDM2-p53 interactions, cell cycle analysis and apoptosis induction examination. The results indicated that the studied compounds did not inhibit MDM2-p53 interactions but induced G0/G1 and G2/M cell cycle arrest in a p53-independent manner. Furthermore, the active compounds induced apoptosis in cells harboring wild-type and mutant p53. The compound design was conducted step by step and assisted by QSAR models that correlated the activity of the compounds against the HCT-116 cell line with molecular

conifers thrive in challenging environments by maintaining multiple sets of needles, optimizing photosynthesis even under harsh conditions. This study aimed to investigate the relationships between needle structure, photosynthetic parameters, and age along the light gradient in the crowns of Abies alba, Taxus baccata, and Picea abies. We hypothesized that: (1) Needle structure, photochemical parameters, and photosynthetic pigment content correlate with needle age and light levels in tree crowns. (2) The photosynthetic capacity of ageing needles would decline and adjust to the increasing self-shading of branches. Our results revealed a non-linear increase in the leaf mass-to-area ratio. The maximum quantum yield of photosystem II photochemistry decreased linearly with needle age without reaching levels indicative of photoinhi- bition. Decreased maximum electron transport rates (ETRmax) were linked to declining values of saturating photosynthetic photon flux density and increasing non-photochemical quenching of fluorescence (NPQ), indicating energy losses as heat. The chlorophyll a to chlorophyll b ratio linearly decreased, suggesting older needles sustain high light capture efficiency. These findings offer new insights into the combined effects of needle ageing and self-shading on photochemistry and pig- ment content. This functional needle balance highlights the trade-off between the costs of long-term needle retention and the benefits of efficient resource utilization. In environments where air temperature is less of a constraint on photosynthesis due to climate warming, evergreen coniferous trees could sustain or enhance their photosynthetic capacity. They can achieve this by shortening needle lifespan and retaining fewer cohorts of needles with higher ETRmax and lower NPQ compared to older needles."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233292","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6765c438fdbe832d0ce9f947","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"163","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"8e7f0227-c716-4a6b-b7c4-ca83719e1fe0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"163","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11120-024-01125-2.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6765c438fdbe832d0ce9f949","name":"Zi-Piao","lastName":"Ye","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d5f4ea34-b6ca-42e5-8459-f563204e1db0"},{"objectId":"6765c438fdbe832d0ce9f948","name":"James","lastName":"Oluborode","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"668acee9-1215-4b7f-be02-5cc7b45b5431"},{"objectId":"5e709447878c28a0473b997f","name":"Magda","lastName":"Formela-Luboińska","uuid":"F7709B2B4CAA0FC23A345CCF18D895E50A0F22B6B6FADC590A81BCAD3EAB9F8ADF7F832F70F37DA1CA1118C17993CA724F67BCD35658FABA01EC983F72AEBD22","orcidId":"0000-0003-4341-5399","documentHash":"c2c17b42-e59f-45fe-8d86-53e43eccce2b"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a643e","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Robakowski","uuid":"C08571EC4996C26F2CA93649ED5315470FA83850B47E4A58C8DF77487871A140BC6E7529BCB5D06289995B7F895EBEBE8808A0B5880881FFA04908E0171081BB","orcidId":"0000-0001-5564-7360","documentHash":"2ebc0be5-e987-470d-9850-5b6ac2443de2"},{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a61f0","name":"Tamara","lastName":"Chadzinikolau","uuid":"A1ADA46775A9B057AF59C490496066E16DD85B1DAAB579A61FC2FE6D98A95A479930CAF94ACB80BF2742B0805DEECB5D488ED9AA1F4513B0D106299C733D6602","orcidId":"0000-0001-8283-8779","documentHash":"f4ff2059-618a-43e4-bf37-43332ab0c9e3"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11120-024-01125-2"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["transformacja ustrojowa w Polsce","wymiar instytucjonalny","społeczny i prawny transformacji","dyskurs naukowy o transformacji"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["political transformation of Poland","institutional","social and legal aspects of transformation","scientific discourse on transformation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-8229-626-6","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928b878c28a0473978ba"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Transformacja ustrojowa w Polsce: nowe perspektywy","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":440,"publicationPlace":"Gdańsk ; Warszawa","translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64708f1e4097076e9c41b14c","editors":[{"objectId":"677d26defdbe831a382dc890","name":"Michał","lastName":"Przeperski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c1569b10-4396-4c99-9247-a066e9f4c195"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a0473978ba","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Wicenty","uuid":"EF6C174DAE4B7230C43E64BF62E8417F6BE4AB4D4511ED08513E67B062249B726FE034D90B0DCCFABA1997AF524B17E977A8F131DCDD3BC221745C648DEB27FA","orcidId":"0000-0003-0296-3882","documentHash":"e2579ce5-8ba0-4050-a431-bf9e72ab8e97"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["5e70928b878c28a0473978ba","677d26defdbe831a382dc890"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Tom \"Transformacja ustrojowa w Polsce.

Background: To evaluate volume of subcortical structures such as hippocampus, globus pallidus, putamen, thalamus, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, caudate in patients with non-specific digestive diseases

(2) Material: The analysis included data obtained from 57 patients (FD-18, IBS-20, IBD-19) and 19 persons in control group. Both groups underwent examination in a 3T scanner (Achieva TX Philips Healthcare). (3) Results: Significant differences between the IBD group and Control group in volume of left thalamus and IBD group vs Control group in volume of right thalamus. (4) Conclusions: The brain-gut axis hypothesis explains connection between biological behavior, emotions and cognitive functions in patients with gastrointestinal disease. We found that there is a difference between volume of thalamus in IBD patients in comparison to both IBS and control group and it occurred to be smaller. Excess inflammation can be linked with psychological disorders like depressive symptoms, sleep difficulties and/or fatigue. Therefore, there is a need for using treatment both for depressive symptoms and IBD to reduce the causes and effects of inflammation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233300","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677cf1ccfdbe831a382b84fb","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Szurowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e49a5f3a-d76e-4140-ab44-62fdc169f8fa"},{"objectId":"677cf1ccfdbe831a382b84fa","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Markiet","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0fab2712-30c1-45ec-be71-3cfdd3fbe8a6"},{"objectId":"677cf1ccfdbe831a382b84f9","name":"Agnieszka ","lastName":"Sabisz ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e7e7406c-5f0b-4a46-956d-3f731161c516"},{"objectId":"677cf1ccfdbe831a382b84f8","name":"Grażyna","lastName":"Piotrowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"90727892-24cc-4bd3-8722-78dd7d744137"},{"objectId":"677cf1ccfdbe831a382b84f7","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Skrobisz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3cd473e7-624f-4d46-b9f7-d8aa518bd2d1"},{"objectId":"5e709437878c28a0473b8470","name":"AGATA","lastName":"RUDNIK","uuid":"653E25FCB42A82BB16D69648057DF43F23B708D2AAD59F9835D1EC574D7CCC77A805AA5E9EFA92AD606E0BA3D98A8565CE16BF53633701DDFF6637DEC05BC1C3","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"243c955f-c56b-4451-b9d7-4ae19c6d58be"},{"objectId":"5e7092cb878c28a04739cca9","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Naumczyk","uuid":"53F45F0084A81682B8473DC37062378E13F91E8783CC1A684DB4C2C596EBB601F5A78A655A414D89A10EADFEA29E690843F0A240D55A363D01F62F8EB6AB3955","orcidId":"0000-0002-2063-222X","documentHash":"73a54c23-407d-443f-8acc-bade69011e12"}],"doi":"10.3390/diagnostics12092199"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929a878c28a047398c98","5e70924b878c28a0473931df","5e709249878c28a0473930e7","677d312efdbe831a382e3f72","5e709434878c28a0473b8106","677d312efdbe831a382e3f74"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Novel Venetin‑1 nanoparticle from earthworm coelomic fuid as a promising agent for the treatment of non‑small cell lung cancer","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":null,"issn":"2045-2322","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-02","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"636b5e0b4097071001052551","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709434878c28a0473b8106","5e70924b878c28a0473931df","5e709249878c28a0473930e7","5e70929a878c28a047398c98","677d312efdbe831a382e3f6e","677d312efdbe831a382e3f6f","677d312efdbe831a382e3f70","677d312efdbe831a382e3f71","677d312efdbe831a382e3f72","677d312efdbe831a382e3f73","677d312efdbe831a382e3f74","677d312efdbe831a382e3f75"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The present research shows the antitumor activity of a protein-polysaccharide complex Venetin-1 obtained from the coelomic fluid of Dendrobaena veneta earthworms against A549 cancer cells. The investigations are a continuation of experiments on the antitumor activity of coelomic fluid obtained from this species. The Venetin-1 nanoparticle was obtained after thermal treatment of the coelomic fluid, separation from coelomocytes, filtration, and lyophilization. The preparation showed a selective effect on cancer cells, whereas normal cells were unaffected. Venetin-1 was effective against the lung cancer cells at doses of 31.3 and 62.5 µg/ml, and the results were imaged using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The cells died mainly via the apoptosis pathway. Necrotic cells appeared sporadically in the microscopic view. SEM imaging revealed complete destruction of the A549 cells after the incubation with Venetin-1. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses showed changes in the topography, peak force error images, and Young’s modulus (elasticity) of the A549 cells after the incubation with Venetin-1. The transmission electron cryomicroscopy (Cryo-TEM) analysis indicated a polymeric nature of the analyzed preparation. The samples of Venetin-1 showed a very homogeneous size profile with the microparticle size of approximately 58.23 nm. A significant decrease in Venetin-1 binding to sphingomyelin was observed.

The complications of pregnancy, such as hypertensive disorders (HDP), may be therefore associated with this immune compartment.\r\n\r\nMethods: The current study included 41 pregnant women diagnosed with HDPs (Gestational Hypertension; GH or Preeclampsia; PE) and 21 healthy women. All the patients were under continuous obstetric care during the pregnancy and labour. The number of mother-child mismatches within killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), their ligands [MM], and missing KIR ligands [MSLs] was assessed. KIRs and their ligands were assessed with Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and Polymerase Chain Reaction Sequence-Specific Oligonucleotide (PCR-SSO) typing. The subsets of NK cells were assessed with multicolor flow cytometry and correlated to the number of MSLs.\r\n\r\nResults: The number of MSLs was significantly higher in HDP patients when compared to healthy non-complicated pregnancy patients. Some MSLs, such as those with 2DS2 activating KIR, were present only in HDP patients. The percentage of CD56+CD16-CD94+ NK cells and CD56+CD16-CD279+ NK cells correlated with the number of MSLs with inhibiting KIRs only in healthy patients. In HDP patients, there was a correlation between the percentage of CD56-CD16+CD69+ NK cells and the number of MSLs with inhibiting and activating KIRs. As compared to the healthy group, the percentage of CD56+CD16-CD279+ NK cells and CD56-CD16+CD279+ NK cells were lower in HDP patients. HDP patients were also characterized by a higher percentage of CD56+CD16+perforin+ NK cells than their healthy counterparts.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Patients with HDP were characterized by a higher number of MSLs within the KIRs receptors. It seemed that the number of MSLs in the healthy group was balanced by various receptors, such as CD94 or inhibitory CD279, expressed on NK cells. Conversely, in HDP patients the number of MSLs was associated with the activation detected as the increased level of CD69+ NK cells."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233322","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677cdb98fdbe831a382898cf","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Zieliński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eb905107-3ac0-4dcf-9e07-65bbbf207567"},{"objectId":"677cdb98fdbe831a382898ce","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Trzonkowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ff40afe4-df73-48b4-8fe1-f30708fd1f4d"},{"objectId":"677cdb98fdbe831a382898cd","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Preis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ce76844d-f822-4ab7-81b8-e133f258fcba"},{"objectId":"677cdb98fdbe831a382898cc","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Kwiatkowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0592c7bc-aefa-4b7c-abe7-bc0a249b9564"},{"objectId":"677cdb98fdbe831a382898cb","name":"Renata","lastName":"Świątkowska-Stodulska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0e66ce89-1b37-46f7-9b39-6d3943bb3e3a"},{"objectId":"677cdb98fdbe831a382898ca","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Leszczyńska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"30d0bcaa-13b6-479f-a48f-0b425efd2b98"},{"objectId":"677cdb98fdbe831a382898c9","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Wydra","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f72ee599-3a6a-4f5d-8194-b5fb938d7842"},{"objectId":"677cdb98fdbe831a382898c8","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Jassem-Bobowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"690cddd9-ad81-4902-9e10-c6815bb4a8df"},{"objectId":"677cdb98fdbe831a382898c7","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Adamski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"efcd37a0-4145-4bcb-8ed3-aadb1e0fd11d"},{"objectId":"677cdb98fdbe831a382898c6","name":"Bogusław","lastName":"Tymoniuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3bd5382b-f636-457f-b00d-c58606bd92f8"},{"objectId":"677cdb98fdbe831a382898c5","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Studziński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"066caf9f-04a9-43cc-9f1b-92d4093938b1"},{"objectId":"677cdb98fdbe831a382898c4","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Sakowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2d089a87-cdcd-40fc-8603-7d9264bb8379"},{"objectId":"677cdb98fdbe831a382898c3","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Piekarska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7751dbd4-01df-4d7c-a3e0-063baa70224a"},{"objectId":"677cdb98fdbe831a382898c2","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Zamkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6d05e76f-7633-4a05-bbb8-64073a9cf895"},{"objectId":"677cdb98fdbe831a382898c1","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Dębska-Zielkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0dcce566-9ca9-4d68-ac2b-2b432ab30ab1"},{"objectId":"677cdb98fdbe831a382898c0","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Tomaszewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1b01bc9c-3fa5-49ab-8ac9-8bcec72aebfc"},{"objectId":"677cdb98fdbe831a382898bf","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Stefańska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8203bd60-386c-4c10-9213-03650f6a5c22"},{"objectId":"5e70937b878c28a0473aac2e","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Marek-Trzonkowska","uuid":"19CC95D19DED0CC4BE24679097B3F2893B9276902E6909FA4BB3AC658126DCC48241C3AA1620B2104A75467FA783CA09A303B11E47B21CEB15A0AB90AA0B119D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"12779b02-754c-40cf-ab62-91f7c71278bd"}],"doi":"10.3389/fimmu.2022.868175"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["non-heteronormativity","Poland","women's football","safe space"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928b878c28a0473978b0"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Enclaved non-heteronormativity and pragmatic acceptance.

The study is based on 25 in-depth interviews with professional Polish female football players. The interviewed women experienced heteronormativity within Polish society, which precluded negotiating the status of homosexuality in the broader social context. The processes of de-normalisation of heteronormativity are also difficult in the field of football. Although many football coaches and club managers display ‘pragmatic acceptance’ of non-heterosexual female players, this attitude is not always accompanied by respect for different sexual orientations. The ways in which female football players deal with such circumstances resulted in creating a safe space of ‘enclaved non-heteronormativity’ within the team.

work experimentally validates a large-aperture optical vortex generator using a novel hybrid structure, combining transmission electrode and modal techniques, in what we term the trans-modal technique. The continuous transmission electrode is designed to generate a linear voltage distribution between the contact electrodes, while the electrode stubs distribute the voltage across the active area. A high-resistivity layer of the conducting polymer PEDOT fills the gap between the electrodes, resulting in a completely continuous voltage distribution. A 1-cm aperture device is experimentally demonstrated, but the structure is completely scalable. Theoretical results validate the design, and experimental results demonstrate precise control over the topological charge for both positive and negative values of orbital angular momentum. Remarkably, the conversion efficiency for the first topological charges is almost 100%. The reduction in efficiency of the higher-order modes has been explained theoretically, and it is not caused by design but by the PEDOT characteristics. The fabrication process is straightforward, as the high-resistivity layer may also be inhomogeneous. This work contributes significantly to the field by introducing a novel method for optical vortex generation. The simplicity of the fabrication process, high conversion efficiency, and ability to control the topological charge make this technique a promising avenue for future research and applications."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233331","journalIssue":{"objectId":"677a75a6fdbe83484a6adbc7","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"181, Part

the present study, the potential of hydrophilic fumed silica Asil300 functionalized with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane for the adsorption of copper ions from aqueous solution was investigated. The modification of the silica surface with two amounts of APTES (0.3 and 0.6 mmol/g), resulting in materials named NH2-Asil300 (0.3) and NH2-Asil300 (0.6), respectively was carried out. Asil300, as an example of a fumed oxide (amorphous form) and in the form of aggregates or agglomerates forming a developed surface, is a promising material for the preparation of porous adsorbents. Both the equilibrium and kinetics adsorption of Cu(II) ions were investigated. The pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, as well as Boyd's and Bangham's models were used to describe the adsorption kinetics. The results displayed that the adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second order model and most likely controlled by film diffusion. The isotherms of equilibrium adsorption of Cu(II) were analyzed using the Freundlich, Langmuir and Temkin isotherms. The best fit was obtained for the Freundlich isotherm. The adsorption capacities for Cu(II) were found to be 36.90 mg/g, 56.82 mg/g and 70.42 mg/g for Asil300, NH2-Asil300 (0.3) and NH2-Asil300 (0.6), respectively. This study shows that the NH2 functionalization of nanoporous silica improves its adsorption capacity and makes it possible to obtain an effective adsorbent for the removal of copper ions from the water environment."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233334","journalIssue":{"objectId":"677c4fedfdbe833cb9da1c89","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"321","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"ade8a0be-123d-4167-9ab0-64f632bef344"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"321","pagesFromTo":"100965","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www-1sciencedirect-1com-13mpkazck090b.han.wat.edu.pl/science/article/pii/S1944398624204756","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093ea878c28a0473b3453","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Zienkiewicz-Strzałka","uuid":"BAD7C94BE8346F1128491D961657B49CEC0247CB901A33EF0C572B1EDD5C417AA77ECBB2E5001C305EDA9223834F999C3F511B13DFEB8AD29131943D93D9C1D5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0775-5417","documentHash":"9c86631e-2687-4353-92d1-408b4675d4c5"},{"objectId":"5e7092f8878c28a0473a02ec","name":"Anna","lastName":"Deryło-Marczewska","uuid":"31DD4B3962D924B13870C1856501C9F7087C15D43C70E3B1BA51DA25D46DF02DD44484255BAE0346CD01F503D4D3D126600BC9872600002B92BD3B370B30F34B","orcidId":"0000-0003-0208-1257","documentHash":"c35e33bb-fefb-4874-af00-4ed42430f564"},{"objectId":"5e7092a5878c28a047399cd3","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Świątkowski","uuid":"BD223DDA3A1B714BE623ADB8D6410DB594014C8C8760FA5B388D49AE22B2708EDFAEFCDFD9066C4668048C384D4556AAC49BC8115632D5E0411046142846E57E","orcidId":"0000-0002-6427-5439","documentHash":"f2202156-98e1-4a99-b656-9ffbb0d2aee3"},{"objectId":"5e7092a5878c28a047399caf","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kuśmierek","uuid":"4B95F3B551848300F13AEB18B6F7695E416D4E5B0F0110E9C863EE4560FE865B848EC9A81DA58FC5E4A693D1FF6FC5D090BCE559FFFA4C45ADF62A947A7100DC","orcidId":"0000-0002-7948-8437","documentHash":"a560a6e7-9b1b-4329-966b-fcbb34d02342"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.dwt.2024.100965"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Textus

detection in data is crucial across various fields, including finance and healthcare. The Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm is frequently employed to identify atypical data points. In this article, we continue our investigation into block size optimisation, presenting an innovative approach that accelerates the anomaly detection process while preserving high accuracy. Throughout this research, we introduce a score objective function used for optimising the anomaly detection process. The score comprises three key components: execution time, percentage coverage, and the sum of distances within the analysed data block. We intentionally minimise execution time and the sum of distances while maximising percentage coverage, leading to process efficiency and improved compactness of the data block. In our previous research, we proposed an innovative approach that utilises block size optimisation to accelerate the anomaly detection process while maintaining high accuracy. Additionally, we propose an algorithm for calculating the optimal block size, which adapts to the number of data points N, available RAM, and the parameters a, b, c, and k. The parameters a and b influence scaling the constant c, which determines the impact of N on the block size, while k specifies the optimal number of nearest neighbours, introducing flexibility into the anomaly detection process. Our goal is to optimise block size for efficient resource utilisation and effective data processing. Integrating these two aspects enables efficient anomaly detection in large datasets while effectively managing hardware resources. The results of our experiments conducted on various datasets unequivocally confirm the effectiveness of our approach, which not only enhances the performance of the LOF algorithm but also maintains high anomaly detection efficiency."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233351","journalIssue":{"objectId":"677a6386fdbe83484a6ab167","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"b4bd8721-373c-4118-b7b5-99f4f292744d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"112675","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1568494624014492?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677a6386fdbe83484a6ab169","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Nowak-Brzezińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8baf2c7c-c9f7-4e7b-bda2-a928c085dc46"},{"objectId":"60c323c59543c72336543e9a","name":"Czesław","lastName":"Horyń","uuid":"214E8BBE251DAB6FCFAFA2149D390B064EFD2DFF238BF80C9689B45DF0B8CC17B1955F0BF390A5EAB42D48B4C9AFFDB229D561CA62E78D4816C2C84EC6F56A65","orcidId":"0000-0003-0592-8011","documentHash":"88a93234-ca1f-4fa4-a23f-ce4914c03a64"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.asoc.2024.112675"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["mikrostruktura

We performed a systematic literature review, PodoNet, mitoNET, and CCGKDD registries queries and an online survey, collecting comprehensive clinical and genetic data of 251 patients spanning 173 published (47 updated) and 78 new cases. Kidney disease was first diagnosed at median age 1.0, 1.2 and 9.8 years in individuals with disease-causing variants in COQ2, COQ6 and COQ8B, respectively. Isolated kidney involvement at diagnosis occurred in 34% of COQ2, 10.8% of COQ6 and 70.7% of COQ8B variant individuals. Classic infantile multiorgan involvement comprised 22% of the COQ2 variant cohort while 47% of them developed neurological symptoms at median age 2.7 years. The association of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome and sensorineural hearing loss was confirmed as the distinctive phenotype of COQ6 variants, with hearing impairment manifesting at average age three years. None of the patients with COQ8B variants, but 50% of patients with COQ2 and COQ6 variants progressed to kidney failure by age five. At adult age, kidney survival was equally poor (20-25%) across all disorders. A number of sequence variants, including putative local founder mutations, had divergent clinical presentations, in terms of onset age, kidney and non-kidney manifestations and kidney survival.

infamous “master manipulators” - intracellular bacteria of the genus Wolbachia - infect a broad range of phylogenetically diverse invertebrate hosts in terrestrial ecosystems. Wolbachia has an important impact on the ecology and evolution of their host with documented effects including induced parthenogenesis, male killing, feminization, and cytoplasmic incompatibility. Nonetheless, data on Wolbachia infections in non-terrestrial invertebrates are scarce. Sampling bias and methodological limitations are some of the reasons limiting the detection of these bacteria in aquatic organisms. In this study, we present a new metagenetic method for detecting the co-occurrence of different Wolbachia strains in freshwater invertebrates host species, i.e., freshwater Arthropoda (Crustacea), Mollusca (Bivalvia), and water bears (Tardigrada) by applying NGS primers designed by us and a Python script that allows the identification of Wolbachia target sequences from the microbiome communities. We also compare the results obtained using the commonly applied NGS primers and the Sanger sequencing approach. Finally, we describe three supergroups of Wolbachia: (i) a new supergroup V identified in Crustacea and Bivalvia hosts; (ii) supergroup A identified in Crustacea, Bivalvia, and Eutardigrada hosts, and (iii) supergroup E infection in the Crustacea host microbiome community."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233373","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"1-25","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d301efdbe831a382e1d92","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Bartoszek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cb27e9b3-39f5-4a99-bb28-dc32622cc935"},{"objectId":"677d301efdbe831a382e1d91","name":"Jan P.","lastName":"Jastrzębski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bbc90562-7e98-4bc2-8a0b-4bcdf818a956"},{"objectId":"677d301efdbe831a382e1d90","name":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Zając","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b678388f-3084-4c13-8ea1-63c954762efc"},{"objectId":"677d301efdbe831a382e1d8f","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Zając","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4267b474-466b-4f44-b890-cc6a922eda89"},{"objectId":"677d301efdbe831a382e1d8e","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Kaczmarek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fe436375-68e9-44f7-a921-f4b3d2212e7a"},{"objectId":"677d301efdbe831a382e1d8d","name":"Dunja","lastName":"Lukić","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0ec05c02-96d4-4151-8d17-9560da0069ac"},{"objectId":"677d301efdbe831a382e1d8c","name":"Luc","lastName":"Brendonck","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0641fec7-338c-4acd-baf0-e5344ab100e4"},{"objectId":"677d301efdbe831a382e1d8b","name":"Tom","lastName":"Pinceel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d17b23b0-194c-4a3a-867d-b47bbc190a06"},{"objectId":"677d301efdbe831a382e1d8a","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Gołdyn","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fa7884ed-7aad-4e19-910c-b61033d04310"},{"objectId":"677d301efdbe831a382e1d89","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Konecka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"140a10bc-5daa-4550-97ea-bede06614139"},{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b8725","name":"Monika","lastName":"Mioduchowska","uuid":"63EC8AA96D14A4C713B31761C0F3B148176B1472182F4ECF51841EE52D69C594240C902144DE94A5796E56E4E2423B0097BE41F6C029AF8F00814EE213682585","orcidId":"0000-0003-1707-5028","documentHash":"1cffbee1-d14d-41d0-99d2-8f686b2e759e"},{"objectId":"5e709249878c28a0473931d3","name":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Namiotko","uuid":"9AE224399A0843A5696A90B747C6A27DBBDE4E803CCD1B8D0BE192696E4EB0325C3A3934EE29A542387E6DAC781DA80D0E05DBD77AE1B4D376EA63A49A4197A4","orcidId":"0000-0002-0269-2923","documentHash":"3e7ca8f8-9430-4c47-8d02-7cc312d42367"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms24119400"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094e2878c28a0473c5f56","5e70945b878c28a0473bb3d1","677d30d9fdbe831a382e356d","5e70945c878c28a0473bb4a6","602e4b699543c7410626f05f","677d30d9fdbe831a382e356c","5e7093b5878c28a0473af840","677d30d9fdbe831a382e356b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"In vitro reconstitution reveals a key role of human mitochondrial EXOG in RNA primer processing","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479083","mniswId":"15242","title":"Nucleic Acids Research","doi":null,"issn":"0305-1048","eissn":"1362-4962","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"724567b3-4881-4976-8403-23b81227ac34"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2022-07-12","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6308c31c409707498f0e8841","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70945b878c28a0473bb3d1","5e70945c878c28a0473bb4a6","602e4b699543c7410626f05f","5e7093b5878c28a0473af840","5e7094e2878c28a0473c5f56","677d30d9fdbe831a382e356a","677d30d9fdbe831a382e356b","677d30d9fdbe831a382e356c","677d30d9fdbe831a382e356d","677d30d9fdbe831a382e356e","677d30d9fdbe831a382e356f","677d30d9fdbe831a382e3570"]},"issue":"14","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The removal of RNA primers is essential for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication. Several nucleases have been implicated in RNA primer removal in human mitochondria, however, no conclusive mechanism has been elucidated. Here, we reconstituted minimal in vitro system capable of processing RNA primers into ligatable DNA ends. We show that human 5′-3′ exonuclease, EXOG, plays a fundamental role in removal of the RNA primer. EXOG cleaves short and long RNA-containing flaps but also in cooperation with RNase H1, processes non-flap RNA-containing intermediates. Our data indicate that the enzymatic activity of both enzymes is necessary to process non-flap RNA-containing intermediates and that regardless of the pathway, EXOG-mediated RNA cleavage is necessary prior to ligation by DNA Ligase III. We also show that upregulation of EXOG levels in mitochondria increases ligation efficiency of RNA-containing substrates and discover physical interactions, both in vitro and in cellulo, between RNase H1 and EXOG, Pol γA, Pol γB and Lig III but not FEN1, which we demonstrate to be absent from mitochondria of human lung epithelial cells. Together, using human mtDNA replication enzymes, we reconstitute for the first time RNA primer removal reaction and propose a novel model for RNA primer processing in human mitochondria."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060233379","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"50","pagesFromTo":"7991-8007","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac581","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d30d9fdbe831a382e3570","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Szczęsny","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"26a9462f-cd1f-464f-9dc2-6a30c277c488"},{"objectId":"677d30d9fdbe831a382e356f","name":"Roman J.","lastName":"Szczęsny","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5f44bf1d-5d7f-489e-b06a-e5bca5d5307c"},{"objectId":"677d30d9fdbe831a382e356e","name":"Ryan J.","lastName":"McAuley","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1341a54b-f507-4f71-9954-3f53b703346d"},{"objectId":"677d30d9fdbe831a382e356d","name":"Marta","lastName":"Grzelewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2db22f04-7289-43ad-b3ec-e079d429023f"},{"objectId":"677d30d9fdbe831a382e356c","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Purzycki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"55060127-c0ae-4854-a70c-dc4ed3324b00"},{"objectId":"677d30d9fdbe831a382e356b","name":"Adela","lastName":"Bledea","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3903c82d-d10c-4ed5-9df3-b70c4a0358cf"},{"objectId":"677d30d9fdbe831a382e356a","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Czerwińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0b23df3a-7a97-4685-8b0d-a64254b999c5"},{"objectId":"602e4b699543c7410626f05f","name":"Gabriela","lastName":"Brzuska","uuid":"3306CC44BFAFE6DF3416EFD5E355B7F78B9F838CAA0FCB08FB3AF3DAFD4E83F3B80F1235DCC762B31BD3E74BC04FE347D4C792A0122F0940A376A4E055712106","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"61f4fc7d-5275-4453-9608-cd2d810b7bf8"},{"objectId":"5e7094e2878c28a0473c5f56","name":"Michał","lastName":"Szymański","uuid":"2C38217DA014C473D7B50C7F0FA966A64A7F99DB07036B6199E0BC6D275B26BF140A4D43F6BF59EBC741E20F50379B2E3D4EA43534D14C2953A91F09D326A8C3","orcidId":"0000-0001-9452-8508","documentHash":"bcb442eb-a15c-4cf6-a0f9-4fbc44f03928"},{"objectId":"5e70945c878c28a0473bb4a6","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Dubiel","uuid":"7501A7A62EA68D8598C536AD493368234A1F05FDC76C878AB0AD36EC9844357FBA8B351766B908122FC839E79628C7C96BDF80B08C8AB06F58F196C35A5611C4","orcidId":"0000-0002-2743-5122","documentHash":"24c873ff-bce6-41b0-9561-bfe9c9b4f721"},{"objectId":"5e70945b878c28a0473bb3d1","name":"Anna","lastName":"Karłowicz","uuid":"061E71D3C592D08C8E9E3BBE7085783846FF0EA4BF075EE2EFAD6162A09CE060F3C967F8FA0465013648E0843ECF9B07C8341007D19BE6E570A94463A25F7F13","orcidId":"0000-0002-6940-8210","documentHash":"8f9eb20a-43e2-4eb7-8538-ffe41f5e994c"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af840","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Król","uuid":"A004B8DA084FE8E112F6ACB8B656E9975C97E75874039C7D6C2756F0C9729F0560746C647F3B606B51889312574C8E09BAD0E6E76484E8D5B200B7E22BF46876","orcidId":"0000-0001-8573-4254","documentHash":"1fa12710-0782-4b5c-a93c-f19a2e657a9d"}],"doi":"10.1093/nar/gkac581"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA2MDIzMzM3OQ=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
