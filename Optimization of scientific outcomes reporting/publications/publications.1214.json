Although AECs offer stable levels of airborne allergens, the validation of symptoms and other endpoints induced by allergen challenge is key for their recommendation as a plausible tool for the assessment of patients, especially in clinical research. This study aimed to demonstrate the reproducibility of defined clinical endpoints after AEC house dust mite (HDM) challenge under optimal conditions in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR).\r\n\r\nMethod: HDM was distributed at different concentrations. The assessment was subjective by the patients: total nasal symptom score (TNSS), visual analog scale (VAS), and objective by the investigator: acoustic rhinometry, peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF), and nasal secretion weight. Safety was assessed clinically and by peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1 ).\r\n\r\nResults: Constant environment: temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide (CO2 ) concentration were maintained during all challenges. The concentration of HDM on average remained stable within the targeted values: 1000, 3000, 5000, 7000 particles (p)/m3 . Most symptoms were observed at concentrations 3000 p/m3 or higher. The symptoms severity and other endpoints results were reproducible. 5000 p/m3 , and challenge duration of 120 min were found optimal. The procedure was safe with no lung function abnormalities due to challenge.\r\n\r\nConclusion: HDM challenge in ALL-MED AEC offers a safe and reliable method for inducing symptoms in AR patients for the use in controlled clinical studies including allergen immunotherapy.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455756","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"78","pagesFromTo":"168-177","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/all.15485","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ecc92667523406a2b8ea645","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Winiarska","uuid":"759DD7869C5AE84AB80B79956E94326036B388AFBD54ACA2EFD0A58F38EE39606267149990DC5BA6FBE0438D3339608F36443FD63AE9CBF98C6C379FC5B2A930","orcidId":"0000-0002-6158-835X","documentHash":"e786d433-219e-4a5a-9d96-d76cff2d9e84"},{"objectId":"5e70944b878c28a0473b9e8c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kosowska","uuid":"0AE74DB3B840C030A5E3BE6BF9EA80332976BF81BF3434B333C94E4CC0FC82DAA52C8ECF86FFCA13E3155ECCA93DE71C6BA45E56F0BC16DDE666F3F7FA4C8768","orcidId":"0000-0001-8991-0198","documentHash":"d4be0edd-103b-4c2f-8bad-fb1df41cbe11"},{"objectId":"5e7093f4878c28a0473b3e9e","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Zemelka-Wiącek","uuid":"D589DBBEB8EA5F8357E4120873367161389F2FA0797A4011A82FEFA2E7557BE9BF55D6DB316370C4DB080FC7367A9ACFF0CD159A870C49D6F72252007E2C8BBA","orcidId":"0000-0001-7201-8638","documentHash":"eace1d56-6b02-4feb-b131-45969fe8439c"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a12d5","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Sobańska","uuid":"CD3E622DDB34C88226EDF3D6B6576D23FD899053F65D15D0579E22F5E62CB25E6DC67845DB2068397BAC35BD066C7EDE135B63DA6FCE804844CF37AE7823C927","orcidId":"0000-0002-6065-6779","documentHash":"11031b7d-006f-43af-97af-2d54a456cae1"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a128f","name":"Marek","lastName":"Jutel","uuid":"A78748B9708FABEC4F609A25EA33E7A6FC529862CB0F56DFFB4850E30D545C8D8C437618E5BB1B295640D5DE0811C600463703ADACDAB92A595C1DF30A2F11B5","orcidId":"0000-0003-1555-9379","documentHash":"f4fbdcc1-b6e7-48dc-a4e0-8a41369de034"}],"doi":"10.1111/all.15485"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["tetracycline hydrochloride","hydrogel","alcoholamine","stability","skin sebum","carbomer","TRIS"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

The aim of the following work was to propose a hydrogel formulation that would ensure the stability of the antibiotic contained in it. Additionally, an important property of the prepared formulations was the activity of the alcoholamines contained in them against the components of the model sebum. This feature may help effectively cleanse the hair follicles in the accumulated sebum layer. A series of formulations with varying proportions of anionic polymer and alcoholamine and containing different polymers have been developed. The stability of tetracycline hydrochloride contained in the hydrogels was evaluated for 28 days by HPLC analysis. Formulations containing a large excess of TRIS alcoholamine led to the rapid degradation of TC from an initial concentration of about 10 &amp;micro;g/mL to about 1 &amp;micro;g/mL after 28 days. At the same time, these formulations showed the highest activity against artificial sebum components.

The FTIR method has already been used in research. However, there is a lack of research on constructed wetland (CW) infill materials used to treat landfill leachate (LL). Therefore, the aim of this study was to verify the changes occurring in selected substrates (zeolite, expanded clay and bark) constituting vertical flow CW infill (VFCW) supplied with municipal LL. The principal component analysis carried out mainly showed differences in the results between the variants of the experiment with an infill of expanded clay and the others (for the values obtained at wave numbers in the range 1600-400 cm−1, in which most changes occurred). All peaks of the FTIR spectra of the pine bark filling the CW differ in location and intensity between the samples. In most cases, the stripes were elongated at exposure to 25% and 100% LL (compared to tap water). In all CW variants infill made of zeolite, peaks occurred at wave numbers within 1049-1012 cm−1, which were most likely caused by the presence of inorganic substances corresponding to clay minerals, and to silica. The FTIR spectra for zeolites, do not show large differences between the different infill samples used for LL treatment (100% LL and 25% LL). In all CW variants with expanded clay infill, peaks in the 1250-900 cm−1 wave number region, possibly indicating the presence of polysaccharides and phosphodiesters. FTIR spectroscopy has proven to be a very useful tool for rapid grade assessment determination of changes occurring on selected substrates and the identification of contaminants that remained after treatment in VFCWs fed with LL."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455759","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"411","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623014944?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c96","name":"ALEKSANDRA","lastName":"WDOWCZYK","uuid":"7141CE62A64D7EA188F0A8D3B075CCE58ED9F3548F345916C2AE8AC10A88AC50B1CFBC2EAE4B60D8D8C2225CF6DCB1A16DF7F489B3D891A96498BB4C6CF37C34","orcidId":"0000-0002-6389-7682","documentHash":"8cd2447c-0b45-4716-bfb0-9452617acbe8"},{"objectId":"5e709325878c28a0473a3aea","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Wiercik","uuid":"F6E12D7580A4B89F101C19B56E859E1A58DC02C6D95402CA5A16D88EC4E1B91C56188926C078D3996326E5E176E99CF96A0262474982E6D60D495D6F04054BB6","orcidId":"0000-0001-6093-0611","documentHash":"92eceb0f-b1cd-4af0-b48c-ff981c09636d"},{"objectId":"5e709203878c28a04738e9c4","name":"Agata","lastName":"Szymańska-Pulikowska","uuid":"FA589861490B0AD981C41CCFD3C087FBA3CDA414D51C7DB9E464C862DB0973F5AC9283079026FE3F473042FD1C754309E492E8FDBFE114ACE02A86B0E3FE8B16","orcidId":"0000-0001-5431-6228","documentHash":"995f9d68-f6f8-418a-b68f-0333285c82c4"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.137336"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["respiratory viruses","respiratory infection","cardiovascular disease","myocarditis","COVID-19","heart failure"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Despite their significant effectiveness, they are not free from side effects, such as allergic and dermatological reactions. These reactions can vary in severity and outcome, including potential death. Examples, among others, are type I-IV hypersensitivity reactions of various origins and skin reactions including rashes, itching and redness, but also severe cutaneous syndromes. Due to the therapy used, these may include Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis.

Two successful equivalent qPCR assays for the detection of the GADPH and ACTB genes were obtained. The course of standard curves is logarithmic, with a very high correlation coefficient R2 within the range of 0.9955–0.9956. The reaction yield was between 85.5 and 109.7%, and the detection limit (LOD) with 95% positive probability was estimated at 0.0057 ng/µL for GAPDH and 0.0036 ng/µL for ACTB.

At the same time, the relationships they build within TMTs shape their decisions, experiences and reactions at work. The paper refers to defence mechanisms as relatively persistent means of individual response to unwanted emotions and affects. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the paper is to examine the defence mechanisms of TMT members as antecedents of perceived trustworthiness of other team members and positive relationships in the team. METHODS: The empirical study was conducted in a sample of 123 members of top management teams representing furniture industry companies in Poland. RESULTS: The results show that defence mechanisms determine TMT members’ perception of trustworthiness of other team-members and that perceived trustworthiness mediates the relation between the defence mechanisms of TMT members and their evaluation of relationships within a team. CONCLUSIONS: The study explains links between individual characteristics of TMT members and processes within the teams. It contributes to upper echelon theory and literature on trust and positive relationships at work. It also contributes to the line of research introducing unconscious processes and emotions to management studies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455771","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"41","pagesFromTo":"567-581","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://content.iospress.com/articles/human-systems-management/hsm211562","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e9935c40970762631d5bda","name":"Adela","lastName":"Barabasz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"706407d2-9e42-41ad-8f24-88d8bfb81764"},{"objectId":"64488ca940e3ff4630d1e2f9","name":"Yusheng","lastName":"Fu","uuid":"77266534F742A2A56A88C84CFF2AA8CB244507BFED22C8D9E695D50B959E55847012055D2323BFB2CCC52677B25B6D2912D9B3280584EFDA5F7DAEC5B4AF3202","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7100b467-e4df-497d-812d-b2e518735cc0"},{"objectId":"5e7092bc878c28a04739bcad","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Escher","uuid":"3A18C792A00BA3E21413D44B29E5C95D9833734481B4BC25BC18F3C24BAF68BCBA35E922B85A6D2EABF9D636CC9C745EA103EBBBAB1E30F576A3D98B418D21D1","orcidId":"0000-0002-2053-0549","documentHash":"ae2edae3-06b5-4e18-8389-8fc1aabe4697"},{"objectId":"5e709203878c28a04738e989","name":"Aldona","lastName":"Glińska-Neweś","uuid":"F217355008770E7F102B140F6212FFACD426AF8D5319B949CBD259049AB6D44A58F014CF1F6CBE90F7AEF3CFC033603659B31CDF8B6E10795A9A64260B565D5E","orcidId":"0000-0002-5415-1563","documentHash":"4f5dbfda-2c41-41d9-ac01-3213b7a18936"}],"doi":"10.3233/hsm-211562"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-231-5010-7","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[],"type":"BOOK","title":"Międzykulturowość w sporcie : ujęcie praktyczne","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":166,"publicationPlace":"Toruń","translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9892340970762631d53b8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709389878c28a0473ac3cc"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059455773","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb8fa","mniswId":"60100","name":"Uniwersytet Mikołaja Kopernika w Toruniu","documentHash":"4013d6fe-c00f-48d0-afcc-434feb04ef71"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://omega.umk.pl/info/book/UMK4442a23d1ab745bd892385c58ea22937/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709389878c28a0473ac3cc","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Gulak-Lipka","uuid":"4C54DE040BDFEC227A839E4BCCCDEDDDD9A5AB8938F7910BAE8F668A017114BD2D816D5B44DCB864D8A3C70B5439BFED0BF8D94DE15D84AC94FCDE0A0AE42FF8","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fef384be-a57a-46c9-9ce2-e8befddfb50a"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["risk factors","medical staff","ergonomics","working condition","safety"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Medical staff working in the healthcare sector experience stress, job burnout and bullying on a daily basis. Monitoring occupational risks in the above areas provides an opportunity to take appropriate preventive measures.\r\nMethods: The prospective online survey included 143 health care workers from various professional groups. Eighteen participants did not complete the survey, and the results of 125 participants were eventually included in the analysis. The study used health and safety questionnaires in the healthcare sector, which are not widely used as screening tools in Poland.\r\n\r\nResults: The following statistical methods were performed in the study: the Mann-Whitney test, Kruskal-Wallis test, Dunn's test. In addition, multivariate analysis was performed. The results obtained in the study indicate that the questionnaires used in the study can be widely used by employers or occupational medicine as screening tools.\r\nConclusions: Our findings show that level of education attainment in healthcare is correlated with higher chance of experiencing stress and burnout. Among the surveyed professions, nurses reported a higher amount of stress and burnout. Paramedics reported the highest chance of being bullied at work. This can be explained by their nature of work which requires directly interacting with patients and their families. In addition, it should be noted that the tools used can be successfully applied in workplaces as elements of workplace ergonomics assessment in the context of cognitive ergonomics."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455776","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"art.1169604 [10 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1169604","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e5634097076263e8842d","name":"Hugh Pierre","lastName":"Salehi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0ead47a1-f28f-47b7-8f93-74303040887f"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af2c6","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Rypicz","uuid":"9059E5FC85E248F7072526F903584F7902904B829D077CD312BA7419D299FC6462E0C64702CE8F0E22E19F11D64423649BDC8E328CA9F69218B9BA344C8D199A","orcidId":"0000-0001-5847-6579","documentHash":"8ef63c28-b5ad-4cc5-97dd-7f5b978a8ee3"},{"objectId":"5e709306878c28a0473a14ba","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Gawłowski","uuid":"5F76391C5B661F34005389FCC3431B6F56F1385D8F87C68B6D73FE9023BFE4F8952D5255E0F7FA31E48E9F080DAED53024E972ACEE459B0A4CCF32D9552326FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-4821-7770","documentHash":"c7b7bdf8-32e3-44bb-a698-8e2583452825"},{"objectId":"5e709305878c28a0473a1429","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Witczak","uuid":"8E7FB84F6437418DD9E152ACAE8304382B847ACBF81501F259EAF7B7EDC5FE0E73B0D2529A39EB4236231C82363AA26504617C1E37D31AA3EE4F09DBAE20148B","orcidId":"0000-0003-0839-1029","documentHash":"6f4d865e-dde5-4d68-b656-9678a5dcee02"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a12f8","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kołcz","uuid":"BF7D3E3EE75ADE2956CF2474B507CEAC8CD5A7AD0D1CCD4984CCA4919834EF01E2F5168223BCFCB7A73E74DB2EBEB2DFBF816132E67D8EBD8530B46EADE9F4D7","orcidId":"0000-0002-6646-3652","documentHash":"9ba88912-1229-4807-bc98-173049dab762"}],"doi":"10.3389/fpubh.2023.1169604"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"In Vitro Generated Equine Hepatic-Like Progenitor Cells as a Novel Potent Cell Pool for Equine Metabolic Syndrome (EMS) Treatment","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547982f","mniswId":"18933","title":"Stem Cell Reviews and Reports","doi":null,"issn":"1550-8943","eissn":"1558-6804","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"febaa1c2-c983-408a-b4a9-d77566ce5bb7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-20","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eefe794097076263b99d93","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65eefe794097076263b99d94","65eefe794097076263b99d95","5e70944a878c28a0473b9c1f","602f9be49543c7410626f682","65eefe794097076263b99d96","61e785b87523406748fb8694"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) is recognized as one of the leading cause of health threatening in veterinary medicine worldwide. Recently, PTP1B inhibition has been proposed as an interesting strategy for liver insulin resistance reversion in both equines and humans, however as being a multifactorial disease, proper management of EMS horses further necessities additional interventional approaches aiming at repairing and restoring liver functions. In this study, we hypothesized that in vitro induction of Eq_ASCs hepatogenic differentiation will generate a specialized liver progenitor-like cell population exhibiting similar phenotypic characteristics and regenerative potential as native hepatic progenitor cells. Our obtained data demonstrated that Eq_ASCs-derived liver progenitor cells (Eq_HPCs) displayed typical flattened polygonal morphology with packed fragmented mitochondrial net, lowered mesenchymal CD105 and CD90 surface markers expression, and significant high expression levels of specific hepatic lineage genes including PECAM-1, ALB, AFP and HNF4A. therewith, generated Eq_HPCs exhibited potentiated stemness and pluripotency markers expression (NANOG, SOX-2 and OCT-4). Hence, in vitro generation of hepatic progenitor-like cells retaining high differentiation capacity represents a promising new approach for the establishment of cell-based targeted therapies for the restoration of proper liver functions in EMS affected horses."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455778","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"1124-1134","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12015-023-10507-3","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eefe794097076263b99d96","name":" Larry","lastName":"Galuppo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aebcbeee-8509-40f6-92cf-77be9a582107"},{"objectId":"65eefe794097076263b99d95","name":"Nabila","lastName":"Bourebaba","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c8c4ac1a-3d40-411c-aa89-694cec78afd5"},{"objectId":"65eefe794097076263b99d94","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Marycz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6d75f901-ffe4-4874-b828-2724ea77075a"},{"objectId":"61e785b87523406748fb8694","name":"LYNDA","lastName":"BOUREBABA","uuid":"E9E482563FE63E31FD25D3D5B3F1FE97F8C784FB74495DAFBEE514285948D7708ABC57D70A7A7210E8AB66B1FA91DAC4CF304A8A8A5BB6233A578F342B73A0C1","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"963e7a14-47c1-4f88-ba64-cc93c7c9718d"},{"objectId":"602f9be49543c7410626f682","name":"Malwina","lastName":"Mularczyk","uuid":"5144D17724771F33080F54F9A1B0C2802518F9139120BCFB6EC3D0136EFC666C6554E5114824F93A877C3185E285A8F9A8C9F725023DDF84525E6113F5C3990E","orcidId":"0000-0001-8189-9545","documentHash":"a4fa34dd-fb26-4f62-8062-9fff72784ecc"},{"objectId":"5e70944a878c28a0473b9c1f","name":"Anna","lastName":"Serwotka-Suszczak","uuid":"3F32F72CF3AEC0297EE325A12FCD83D83F06FEAFAA81F6DE3973FF16E88DD20D1ACB4AD7D1D63CC722A1BC92F30DF5427FFD97D1D9E3A69464E7CA9D76030ECC","orcidId":"0000-0002-4553-0908","documentHash":"a1749336-dc96-4d9a-a499-0adb765be110"}],"doi":"10.1007/s12015-023-10507-3"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["institutions","governance indicators","economic freedom","inequalities","Indonesia"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Impact of institutional determinants on income inequalities in Indonesia during the Era Reformasi","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c6fc","mniswId":"10230","title":"Journal of Asian Economics","doi":null,"issn":"1049-0078","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"0245e647-13f8-49a3-9580-09cf768b3685"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e978dd40970762631b3316","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70942a878c28a0473b779d","5e709349878c28a0473a66e3","65e978dd40970762631b3317"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article examines the links between a selected group of institutional factors and income inequalities.\r\nThe Indonesian transformation process, referred to as the Era Reformasi, which started\r\nin 1999, was a substantial institutional change in the social, political, and economic sphere that\r\ncould have impacted income inequalities.

Renal dysfunction can be caused by direct effects of HIV on the kidneys but also of applied combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Therefore there is a need of renal function diagnosis to monitor the development of kidney disturbances. In this study the urinary levels of selected low molecular weight proteins (LMWP) in HIV-infected patients were measured and related to current CD4+ T lymphocyte (LT CD4+) count, the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) value and the applied cART.\r\nMaterial and methods:\r\nThe levels of 5 LMWP – kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), glutathione S-transferase α (GST-α) and π (GST-π) isoenzymes and neopterin (NPT) – in urine were measured in HIV-infected patients and healthy controls by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\r\nResults:\r\nTaking into account the current LT CD4+ count, KIM-1, NGAL and GST-α showed statistically significant differences between groups with the CD4+ count < 500 and ≥ 500 cells (< 0.001). Depending on the eGFR, apart from KIM-1 and NGAL, NPT showed statistically significant differences in the investigated groups with normal and lower eGFR values (< 0.001). In terms of applied cART, the best parameters in the assessment of kidney damage were NGAL, GST-π and NPT (< 0.001).\r\nConclusions:\r\nThis research shows that the analyzed LMWP parameters are useful in the assessment of kidney damage in HIV patients during cART, especially NPT, NGAL and GST-π.

There is no doubt that\r\nthe advance of technology and the increased use of big data and cloud computing have set up an opportunity for insurance business, but they also expanded insurance companies’ vulnerabilities towards\r\ncyber risk. As insurers collect a large amount of confidential data, including protected personal sensitive\r\ninformation, they are a natural target for cyber-attacks. On the one hand, the aim of the article is to indicate how the risks associated with digitalisation affect the day-to-day operations in selected business\r\nareas of an insurance company, and which methods may be used to manage them, on the other. After\r\na general review of cyber risk based on recent branch reports and survey results, the authors identified\r\nits global economic impact with particular regard to financial institutions, and also insurers’ exposure\r\nand perception of cyber risk and cybersecurity spending. Moreover, administrative decisions issued\r\nby the President of the Personal Data Protection Office in Poland, selected jurisdictions and loss scenarios\r\nfor insurance companies were examined with a deeper dive into underwriting, selling, administration\r\nand claims handling processes. The results of the literature study show that cyber risk is recognized\r\nto be one of the most significant non-financial risks (in terms of the source, not result of the risk) for\r\ninsurers and that many proactive security measures can be implemented. However, due to the high\r\nvulnerability to leaks of confidential personal and financial data or unauthorized system access, which\r\nmay cause not only financial loss, but also business interruptions and reputational damage, in the authors’ opinion, loss prevention and reduction are insufficient. Thus, both insurance and non-insurance\r\nmethods of external financing cyber risk results were indicated. On this basis, the cyber insurance is considered by the authors to be the best tool providing both prevention and financial compensation\r\nin case of cyber incidents, also in insurance companies.

For this purpose, powdered polylactide in the amount of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 phr was introduced into the epoxy resin, and the composites were fabricated by a simple method, which is similar to that used on an industrial scale in the fabrication of these products. The first analysis concerned the study of the effect of PLA addition to epoxy resin-based composites on their mechanical properties. One-directional tensile tests of samples were performed for three directions (0, 90, and 45 degrees referring to the plate edges). Another aspect of this research was the assessment of the resistance of these composites to long-term exposure to solar radiation and elevated temperature. Based on the obtained results, it was observed that the samples containing 20 or 40 phr of polylactide were characterized by the lowest resistance to the solar aging process. It was therefore concluded that the optimal amount of polylactide in the epoxy resin composite should not be greater than 10 phr to maintain its mechanical behavior and high aging resistance. In the available literature, there are many examples in which scientists have proposed the use of various biofillers (e.g., lignin, starch, rice husk, coconut shell powder) in epoxy composites; however, the impact of polylactide on the general characteristics of the epoxy resin has not been described so far. Therefore, this work perfectly fills the gaps in the literature and may contribute to a more widespread use of additives of natural origin, which may constitute an excellent alternative to commonly used non-renewable compounds."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455788","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65dee1ca409707626326b928","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"9e60292a-d020-40e9-96f6-c3ba6f9f440c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"1069-1081","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"60c33e239543c72336544233","name":"Angelika","lastName":"Plota-Pietrzak","uuid":"5C2127C713C972F14FA7CBB721E7B4841ADF8EB596D12EAFDEF4FF415E01D613444351FF92B165AD37E68DD6619C73C6ABDA258AC354FC0A79EA9468B42090B4","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"56e1df5f-fdd3-4a9a-aa2e-f2d6003e77a4"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b095e","name":"Anna","lastName":"Masek","uuid":"97EBDB2651B7108FE9C7DB785242DD02536E05A0BB61877F552043246CF837E488DCCC55B4008D115DD6DB5E0B1234806597C18017545CDE5349E66EED5AF38E","orcidId":"0000-0003-3785-1995","documentHash":"72a220f9-4a09-49c2-9868-60224e0e6230"},{"objectId":"5e709333878c28a0473a4ce6","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Czechowski","uuid":"5C6E12910B37A552B0CE3839C01963ABBCF2E809D6BC9A0442A6E69676AE8162AFA9156EDC2FA929CE82E4E36A36F96B0D625180E90925EDE908AC4C05A78166","orcidId":"0000-0002-4718-6215","documentHash":"77bfe706-8204-4b83-9ea4-8e4d746b3c4e"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17051069"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cephalometric analyses","diagnosis","orthodontics"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability and repeatability of new cephalometric points introduced in Tau angle analysis, in contrast to the gold standard, which is the analysis of the ANB angle. For this purpose, an attempt was made to assess the repeatability and reliability of the introduction of anthropometric points by evaluating both inter- and intraobserver parameters, as well as the agreement among the orthodontists participating in the study. Methods: Repeatability and reliability assessments for all six anthropometric points (N, A, B, T, M, G) used in the analysis of the ANB and Tau angles were conducted individually by 29 orthodontists. This assessment was performed in triplicate on the day of the study, on the day following the first study, and on the seventh day after the second study. Measurement errors for the ANB and Tau angles were evaluated using the Dahlberg formula and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Results: The orthodontists in the study measured sagittal discrepancy significantly more accurately using the ANB angle compared to the Tau angle (p < 0.001). The Dahlberg error for measuring the Tau angle was three times greater than that for the ANB angle (p < 0.001). Additionally, the ICC for the Tau angle was more than 3.5 times smaller than that for the ANB angle, while the R&R error for Tau measurement was more than three times greater than that for the ANB angle (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The results of ANB angle measurements exhibit fewer errors in comparison to Tau angle measurements."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455792","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"art.6333 [16 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/19/6333","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e1774097076263e8403c","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Babczyńska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d835ae56-f8a9-4286-aa5c-2985e34d072e"},{"objectId":"6630e1774097076263e8403b","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kuc","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"43762382-916f-45bf-9518-48bdfb483c77"},{"objectId":"6630e1774097076263e8403a","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Kotuła","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5e1ecf2a-e02a-4fd4-9c57-ddf21edd2a53"},{"objectId":"5ebee630752340254fc44d64","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Matys","uuid":"5B34AEED92A89E7A414856E7BB9B0CCC3E91507A8590E98FA0DE398347D6E1F5B9EFB01F021E436F2E8F9614F5BF6CF9C03D801CE73FDDDA55B4BAD80C752529","orcidId":"0000-0002-3801-0218","documentHash":"45321515-4b5a-4677-aebe-f9f457c78cc5"},{"objectId":"5e709368878c28a0473a8eea","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Szeląg","uuid":"164DAE29F1AD10EEAB7DDC46DD2CBC3465E3C8F2531FA1E83EC7C7383AADF42ABBBDC7167DB6E0D813F615BB918C5A842761DB8CE6B58A97961F8352C108A12C","orcidId":"0000-0002-9302-2115","documentHash":"6d2fc20c-fd7e-420a-81e2-11686fe9c295"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1aca","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Lis","uuid":"0EEB3ADA4A34617DC7AC046E766D5528A35627504D2D69886E190705B0B6FB8674B787D6A5CDF527FCB4CCADF6E0D45B5EFDDA0E520AAD99F429E5F77937E305","orcidId":"0000-0001-9192-1064","documentHash":"3135845e-8abb-418a-a2bd-d3167c472c97"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a13cd","name":"Beata","lastName":"Kawala","uuid":"75251B467E745F56FF7D43A8DB9C676C9FB60ABE11279222DA70824F283E866522C9EF636CD8693E212E01FD516CA731C7EC655C4F2100CE6C6EF2593CD05589","orcidId":"0000-0002-3284-7893","documentHash":"b855f028-e4bf-44eb-a687-dad25a5003e6"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a137e","name":"Michał","lastName":"Sarul","uuid":"2C9F89EE02D03659DCB60828CB4CE6E91DE09D067E660F5F3BE5F127B5A9B4FB2CD8690E5F59F23C40A285F02115F5619687BDE5B1D7E605D0607563828A6B7B","orcidId":"0000-0002-2518-0007","documentHash":"78de0520-1a29-4f77-a85a-ce151f56b9e6"}],"doi":"10.3390/jcm12196333"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["adhesive remnant index","antibacterial effect","corrosion resistance","demineralization","shear bond strength","white spots"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

The literature on the use of graphene oxide in orthodontic treatment was reviewed. Methods: This systematic review followed the PRISMA protocol and was conducted by searching the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane. The following search criteria were used to review the data on the topic under study: (Graphene oxide) AND (orthodontic) ALL FIELDS. For the Scopus database, results were narrowed to titles, authors, and keywords. A basic search structure was adopted for each database. Initially, a total of 74 articles were found in the considered databases. Twelve articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Results: Nine studies demonstrated the antibacterial properties of graphene oxide, which can reduce the demineralization of enamel during orthodontic treatment. Seven studies showed that it is biocompatible with oral tissues. Three studies presented that graphene oxide can reduce friction in the arch-bracket system. Two studies showed that it can improve the mechanical properties of orthodontic adhesives by reducing ARI (Adhesive Remnant Index). Three studies demonstrated that the use of graphene oxide in the appropriate concentration can also increase the SBS (shear bond strength) parameter. One research study showed that it can increase corrosion resistance. One research study suggested that it can be used to accelerate orthodontic tooth movement. Conclusion: The studies included in the systematic review showed that graphene oxide has numerous applications in orthodontic treatment due to its properties."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455794","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"art.500 [17 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4983/14/10/500","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e5614097076263e88400","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Rygas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"775bd593-3ff0-4b61-b884-9abab74d67b6"},{"objectId":"5ebee630752340254fc44d64","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Matys","uuid":"5B34AEED92A89E7A414856E7BB9B0CCC3E91507A8590E98FA0DE398347D6E1F5B9EFB01F021E436F2E8F9614F5BF6CF9C03D801CE73FDDDA55B4BAD80C752529","orcidId":"0000-0002-3801-0218","documentHash":"45321515-4b5a-4677-aebe-f9f457c78cc5"},{"objectId":"5e709499878c28a0473c031c","name":"Maria","lastName":"Szymonowicz","uuid":"61CB22547B81C00035964291F8924116AD04111809395DECF08AA073BDA38A838BEF3F6F387786F1DD97972741CD1AA64B86986133CC7DB610A1380419D31570","orcidId":"0000-0003-4251-6841","documentHash":"73e44239-9878-4852-91d9-b1e946388ba9"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afa8e","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Wawrzyńska","uuid":"990AE0B5FE544CBCD354B55347163FD50B4D79D79CFA03C9FCF3F45B9CAEB837E67D7673F0B5169EDB666B7BFD7C6B9690B98D8D709F864D9CF702D5F01C74DC","orcidId":"0000-0001-6855-5510","documentHash":"5fee8373-6a3f-4c71-aee4-aa41167accef"},{"objectId":"5e709306878c28a0473a157c","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Dobrzyński","uuid":"C4166DF7182AE948EA74535E5076AFD8EC921553CBAD35CBF800673AD6F1EF80CC2505AAE925A72AC0F94B95FC9E69ABB22707DCEEE3AD9E8E58530BE3406AB6","orcidId":"0000-0003-2368-1534","documentHash":"3bea6165-e210-47fa-bad7-48325290bf42"}],"doi":"10.3390/jfb14100500"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Oznacza to, że GCs zdobywane przez członków organizacji przyczyniają się do rozwoju orientacji przedsiębiorstwa na RI, a także, że orientacja firmy na RI ma wpływ na wzrost GC wśród menedżerów i pracowników firmy. Przeprowadzony przegląd literatury pozwolił na zaproponowanie pięciu propozycji dotyczących badania relacji między GCs a RI.\r\nOgraniczenia/implikacje badawcze: autorka artykułu zdaje sobie sprawę z ograniczeń prowadzonych badań. Po pierwsze, pojęcia GC i RI są bardzo szerokie, zdefiniowane i wyjaśnione w literaturze na wiele różnych sposobów. To sprawia, że trudno je opisać i ocenić w sposób jednoznaczny. Ze względu na ilość publikacji niezbędnych do studiowania w zakresie koncepcji zielonych kompetencji i odpowiedzialnych innowacji, przeprowadzone badania należy traktować jako wstępny etap dalszych analiz. Co więcej, ponieważ badanie jest ograniczone przez reinterpretację istniejących badań, potrzebne są dalsze badania empiryczne w celu przetestowania pięciu propozycji. Wreszcie, ze względu na bardzo dynamiczny rozwój pola badawczego, statyczna, jednorazowa analiza wydaje się niewystarczająca. W związku z powyższym, rekomenduje się powtórzenie badania w przyszłości, aby obserwować zmieniające się trendy i przesunięcia w polu badawczym w czasie.\r\nOryginalność/wartość: na podstawie propozycji dotyczących relacji między koncepcjami GCs i RI można zbudować kilka modeli do analizy wpływu GCs członków organizacji na orientację przedsiębiorstwa na RI, a także wpływu orientacji firmy na RI na poziom GCs zdobywanych przez menedżerów i pracowników. Przyszłe kierunki badań odnoszą się głównie do operacjonalizacji wymiarów RI oraz orientacji firmy na RI."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose: The purpose of the article is to investigate the relation between two novel management concepts:\r\nGreen Competences (GCs) and Responsible Innovation (RI).\r\nDesign/methodology/approach: The research is based on an integrative literature review.\r\nFindings: The research based on extensive literature studies confirms that the relationship between\r\nmanagers’ and employees’ GCs and a firm’s RI orientation is dynamic and reciprocal. This means\r\nthat GCs acquired by organization members contribute to the development of a firm’s RI orientation\r\nand also that a company’s RI orientation has an impact on the increase of GCs among managers and\r\nemployees in a firm. The conducted literature review enabled formulating five propositions regarding the\r\nrelationship between GCs and RI.\r\nResearch limitations/implications: The author of the article is aware of the limitations of the conducted\r\nresearch. First, the concepts of GCs as well as RI are very broad, defined and explained in the literature\r\nin numerous different ways. This makes them difficult to describe and assess with certainty. Due to\r\nthe number of publications necessary to study in regard to the concepts of green competences and\r\nresponsible innovations, the conducted studies should be treated as an initial stage for further analyses.\r\nMoreover, as the study is restricted by the re-interpretation of existing research, further empirical research\r\nis needed to test the five propositions. Finally, due to a very dynamic development of the research field,\r\na static, one-time analysis seems to be insufficient. Therefore, the replication of the study in the future\r\nis recommended to observe changing trends and shifts in the research field over time.\r\nOriginality/value: Based on the propositions regarding the relations between the GC and RI concepts,\r\nseveral models can be built to analyze the impact of organization members’ GCs on a company’s\r\norientation towards RI as well as the impact of a firm’s RI orientation on the level of GCs acquired\r\nby managers and employees. Future research pathways refer mainly to the operationalization of the RI\r\ndimensions as well as a firm’s RI orientation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455801","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"20","pagesFromTo":"156-175","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pz.wz.uw.edu.pl/resources/html/article/details?id=231745","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092bf878c28a04739bea0","name":"Agata","lastName":"Sudolska","uuid":"96AE5C8604EB7A0E7DD688EC9AA01D01F6E0FF0FEFDEB2C7A40345029428879BC49F012BABE218B6911EF1ABECA291921D78206E45889BB7F64105F2839CCFB4","orcidId":"0000-0002-0358-6516","documentHash":"e9da12d7-b55c-4031-ab8d-5b6980c38991"}],"doi":"10.7172/1644-9584.96.8"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Hidradenitis suppurativa","Tunnel","Fistula","Immunology","Inflammation","Genetics"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Dermal tunnels, sinus tracts, or fistulas are unique features of HS. One may hypothesize that HS tunnels remain active and may contribute to inflammation and disease severity. Summary: Increased inflammatory infiltrate with an increased number and densities of immune cells was reported in HS tunnels. Moreover, significantly higher levels of IL-36, Il-17A, IL-17C, IL-17F, and CXCL8 mRNA compared to non-tunnel HS skin were found. Furthermore, in the lumen, a proliferative gelatinous mass consisting of inflammatory cells with similar cytokine levels as inflammatory HS lesions was found. It was also proven that HS sinus tracts are often colonized by Porphyromonas spp. and Prevotella spp. with a tendency to biofilm creation. The genetic profile of HS tunnels varies from non-tunnel HS skin, with upregulation of pro-inflammatory and downregulation of anti-inflammatory genes. Lastly, treatment with newly developed drugs targeting different subunits of IL-17 seems promising in decreasing dermal tunnel drainage and in the resolution of sinus tracts. Moreover, a higher percentage of patients treated with these drugs achieved HiSCR75 and HiSCR90.

The processes that have taken place during the COVID-19 pandemic may be a catalyst for positive economic changes in the long run – assuming that adaptive innovations are accompanied by properly operating efficiency-based market and institutional selection. The concept of “inverse creative destruction” may open a promising direction for research on the behavior of economic systems under abnormal conditions.

The results of the statistical analysis showed that there is a positive relationship between investment outlays, and the share of legally protected areas and that the level of investment outlays incurred for nature protection is not proportional to the share of legally protected areas."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455809","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"87","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.ekonomiaisrodowisko.pl/journal/article/view/672","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e9697f40970762631a1890","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Minta","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"893470e7-b8cf-4845-b1e0-9c37c351c454"},{"objectId":"65e9697f40970762631a188f","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Adamska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"501efd5f-6935-42e2-8946-a62300c21ebb"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e19e","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Szuk","uuid":"F6112E7CBD8C1BE62338F9FE6D8ECA4D1909C89C25056AE9F8B5BF20BCBDB028AEAAB033BF9A4DD79256CA6F2C2271533F9EC84E4853D52B3C4AA20D90BF48E4","orcidId":"0000-0001-7653-578X","documentHash":"5056cbfa-bc50-4fec-be9d-c49815060dbd"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e198","name":"Irena","lastName":"Kropsz-Wydra","uuid":"121C931D15B3559E0E9A93D16BB1C2A2882210840669044677400689C2E9DBC4F2D8D971C7D013028385876F5DF623F8306F81A004385E38146575027D107F2B","orcidId":"0000-0002-1835-3256","documentHash":"2eab113d-c7ea-45ae-a2ae-50a064a25a0d"}],"doi":"10.34659/eis.2023.87.4.672"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hidradenitis suppurativa","periodontitis","subgingival microbiome","oral microbiota","periodontal health"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

The nine crucial perio-pathogenic species and total bacteria were analyzed using RT-PCR based tests in samples collected from 30 patients with periodontitis, 30 patients with HS and 30 controls. Patients with HS were excluded if they had periodontitis and patients with periodontitis were excluded if they had HS. The mean total bacteria count was significantly higher in HS and periodontitis samples than in control samples (p &lt; 0.05). The majority of perio-pathogens tested were more frequently detected in HS and periodontitis groups than among controls. Treponema denticola was the most common pathogen in individuals with HS (70%) and periodontitis (86.7%), while among controls Capnocytophyga gingivalis was the most frequently detected isolate (33.2%).

myelopathy is referred to in many ways in the English literature, for example,\nas cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM), spondylotic radiculomyelopathy (SRM) or degenerative cervical\nmyelopathy

In addition, more frequent occurrences are noted in older adults and to a greater\nextent in men. The causes of the effects of cervical myelopathy may be the appearance of lesions\non the spinal cord, ischemia due to compression of the vertebral artery and repeated micro-injuries\nduring maximal movements—hyperflexion or hyperextension. It is well known that lesions on the\nspinal cord may occur in a quarter of the population, and this problem is clearly noted in people\nover 60 years old. The symptoms of SCM develop insidiously, and their severity and side (unilateral\nor bilateral) are associated with the location and extent of spinal cord compression. Neurological\nexamination most often diagnoses problems in the upper limbs (most often paresis with developing\nhand muscle atrophy), pyramidal paralysis in one or both lower limbs and disorders in the urinary\nsystem. To make a diagnosis of CSM, it is necessary to perform MRI and neurophysiological tests\n(such as EMG or sensory and/or motor-evoked potentials). The use of appropriately selected scales\nand specific tests in diagnostics is also crucial.

The grown-in defects produced by the displacement of nitrogen atoms were experimentally observed as deep traps revealed by the Laplace transform photoinduced transient spectroscopy in the compensated p-type crystals with the Mg concentrations of 6 × 1018 and 2 × 1019 cm−3 and resistivities of ~1011 Ωcm and ~106 Ωcm, respectively. In both kinds of materials, three closely located traps with activation energies of 430, 450, and 460 meV were revealed. The traps, whose concentrations in the stronger-doped material were found to be significantly higher, are assigned to the (3+/+) and (2+/+) transition levels of nitrogen vacancies as well as to the (2+/+) level of nitrogen split interstitials, respectively. In the material with the lower Mg concentration, a middle-gap trap with the activation energy of 1870 meV was found to be predominant. The results are confirmed and quantitatively described by temperature-dependent Hall effect measurements. The mechanism of nitrogen atom displacement due to the local strain field arising in SI AT GaN:Mg is proposed and the effect of the Mg concentration on the charge compensation is discussed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455817","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65dee1ca409707626326b928","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"9e60292a-d020-40e9-96f6-c3ba6f9f440c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"1160","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/5/1160/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094f3878c28a0473c7d36","name":"Robert","lastName":"Kucharski","uuid":"ADB87B8498FA3C505966A5D7998DF778A358332580E9817C318DAC5E2F974ECA3ACC6604485F8EF31C321D951BE335CC1588AC8A7180484C862B7665E203C416","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"10af0eaf-1986-4b6e-bc7b-e62c6d4aae7e"},{"objectId":"5e7094f3878c28a0473c7d30","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Zając","uuid":"C3F25170B02BAF0DF5316CD7CA51E52ADE8FCDAB3666841078DA63CB5E6BE421810D58FCF219BBDA20E2D4046FA93084D46522500E5EE8D5487558C48E852A6F","orcidId":"0000-0002-7782-5364","documentHash":"15af673d-11bd-4365-a4be-5e50c3e022eb"},{"objectId":"5e7094ad878c28a0473c1749","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Jakieła","uuid":"4312580C0D99AA655A5E9F1A5754C38568BB830071E6F06886D0EB8128F44D4E22C6B41915112E9E7AEB07093BE121A5C05C37E62784AABEFF81CF59FEE06EDF","orcidId":"0000-0002-4984-1519","documentHash":"46b78764-90d7-4283-890d-e2e53be77f69"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473beaac","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Litwin-Staszewska","uuid":"EC6B9E365584FD7D7D254A55267EE58D6C9067D714A03DBDE036B10573136FF5AACCE74C9C19B95612A3E49992BDFA0C37E83A3B65F7263C647F9420F2413786","orcidId":"0000-0002-0401-2805","documentHash":"c29ea40d-f38e-4276-818d-d4a3d6a92084"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473bea44","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Piotrzkowski","uuid":"3F64C5A69C3B5D95814205329B368316AC3B296B18EBA4D25CAD1FBCCD092138D9F57443AF802AEB2ABE8BDCCFB898645C2FCA9C59647B9E7E6DDA362888B1DE","orcidId":"0000-0001-5430-7778","documentHash":"abd090f2-e3b9-48fa-b3a1-eec597ce6afd"},{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b3fb3","name":"PAWEŁ","lastName":"KAMIŃSKI","uuid":"370FB9AEFB8280EE5DD2F77B11862DDD48D1E4204AD9DACDF28CD7D1C8B6C1A6090C7E5C164B9ED4B265203B2C603BB47E9BD533C730DDDB90BE8A2A27E3987A","orcidId":"0000-0002-6962-6947","documentHash":"4212ab4a-27d9-406c-96a0-ba8f9d0440b6"},{"objectId":"5e7093f1878c28a0473b3cbf","name":"ROMAN","lastName":"KOZŁOWSKI","uuid":"E589E8DFEA8BC75AD3DD37DFE91170C292446231C3C07FDBAFF49684E4D2694CBD3AC1B82048F7A1A877E0D943FB7813B09B1B4CADBD929A96C0655D00E91F2C","orcidId":"0000-0002-1005-2571","documentHash":"1224396b-d898-4a31-9e70-d3909b2043e8"},{"objectId":"5e709390878c28a0473ace98","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Grabiańska","uuid":"FE9FD7558F701E1F0771D5682792B6CFE7B935F067CE414A4BB984A1709418A88E39F8293A4DD8A90C1567D900F73A7543F2D8407E246AA9F9515D7272467E79","orcidId":"0000-0001-9131-2891","documentHash":"01bf359a-6fa9-45e0-8b0c-756b96d9f775"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17051160"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","uid":"bX41kHc85ivocrWE0ISfROw","uuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","parentUuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","rootUuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","name":"Politechnika Wrocławska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebede1d752340254fc428fc"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Brief narrative review on commercial dental sealants -

We aimed to investigate the impact of clinical characteristics and CMR findings on cardiac outcome in patients with FD.\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nIn this study 55 patients with genetically confirmed FD and available CMR imaging were included. The primary endpoint was defined as a composite of cardiac events including cardiac death, new occurrence of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, ventricular tachycardia and bradycardia requiring device insertion.\r\nResults\r\n\r\nDuring a median follow-up of 4.9 years (IQR 3.7–5.9), 9 patients (16.3%) reached the primary cardiac end point. The global amount of LGE was associated with an increased risk for primary endpoint in the univariate analysis (HR 1.4 per 10% increase in LGE, p = 0.002). However maximal wall thickness (MWT) was the sole independent predictor of the primary endpoint in a stepwise logistic regression model (HR 9.8 per mm increase in MWT, p < 0.0001). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significant difference in event free survival rate between patients with and without LVH (Long-rank p = 0.006) and in patients with and without LGE (Long-rank p < 0.001).

Therefore, decision-makers (architects, interior architects, designers, and users) took them for granted. However, COVID-19 forced revisiting this approach towards RIs and they faced a gap in the literature helping them to design these interiors, especially workspaces, in order to improve their users’ experience. In connection with previous studies, which explored creativity in workspaces, this study aims to compile colour-related literature work on workspaces in RIs (WRI) which will require further attention from interior architects to reconsider the discipline under new normal conditions. Providing a framework for WRIs in terms of function and activity might lead to the semantics of RIs in future studies. This study’s findings contribute to the interpretation and understanding of new normal workspace interiors after the COVID-19 pandemic so it will be beneficial for decision-makers in addition to researchers who aim to investigate this topic in future studies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455837","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/13/8217/pdf?version=1657092209","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e96cdc40970762631a1dec","name":"Begüm","lastName":"Ulusoy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e0e9f4bd-e431-48d9-98ea-e4623130c662"},{"objectId":"620b1e387523402df0840e31","name":"Aslanoglu","lastName":"Rengin","uuid":"7B85320E9179CD5A6B93FF875DD9BF9674C8CFBCA3709F5F3CF0B6BD86CD31220CD9E7B3C93CFEE6D05C085C25DBE3BB35BFD561B2A149606CB1958A769C4871","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c05a18f3-c55c-4c9f-8325-f7fe99c651b0"}],"doi":"10.3390/su14138217"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["priority setting","helathcare","rationing","economy","health economic"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

It is a concept which refers to the allocation of scarce healthcare resources and involves the use of different approaches to the delivery of health services and patient care. Regardless of the approach used, healthcare rationing fundamentally involves withholding potentially beneficial programs and/or treatments from certain people. As the demands placed on health services continue to rise and with that significant increases to the cost, healthcare rationing has become increasingly popular and is deemed necessary for the delivery of affordable, patient-care services. However, public discourse on this issue has largely been centered on ethical considerations with less focus on economic rationality. Establishing the economic rationality of healthcare rationing is essential in healthcare decision-making and consideration of its adoption by healthcare authorities and organizations. This scoping review of seven articles demonstrates that the economic rationality of healthcare rationing is the scarcity of healthcare resources amidst increased demand and costs. Therefore, supply, demand, and benefits are at the core of healthcare rationing practices and influence decisions on its suitability. Given the increased costs of care and resource scarcity, healthcare rationing is a suitable practice towards ensuring healthcare resources are allocated to people in a rational, equitable, and cost-effective manner. The rising costs and demands for care place significant pressure on healthcare authorities to identify suitable strategies for the allocation of healthcare resources. Healthcare rationing as a priority-setting strategy would support healthcare authorities identify mechanisms to allocate scarce resources in a cost-effective manner. When used in the context of a priority-setting approach, healthcare rationing helps healthcare organizations and practitioners to ensure that patient populations achieve maximum benefits at reasonable costs. It represents a fair allocation of healthcare resources to all populations, especially in low-income settings."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455839","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"art.1160691 [5 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1160691","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6672c1e94097074fa1617bbf","name":"Catherine","lastName":"Ross","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a472a282-64d9-4297-a69b-1b0d0cdfbbe2"},{"objectId":"6672c1e94097074fa1617bbe","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Berezowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"55e38265-5ff7-462c-afea-feef8702b6e4"},{"objectId":"5e7094c7878c28a0473c383d","name":"Michał","lastName":"Czapla","uuid":"F241A3A93C9297B0CC7621A3FB52E7F10530B0515BFD46FE96AD938D40C1748DCED47E8AE10D5CF004F6434A5B908E4A45CFB50223EFFE0F306589A45A1A64F8","orcidId":"0000-0002-4245-5420","documentHash":"73c1748c-d090-491c-9f8a-2c21149fb49e"},{"objectId":"5e7093d1878c28a0473b1410","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Manulik","uuid":"A7272DDDAB1AD68A1F24C61750FDFFC9E34C46E03C82242B31D7AC64308D0077BF537D5D88A1ADA90ABDF558797E2D2BB9BBA7EC72D30F78C02069CC526AE2B8","orcidId":"0000-0003-4292-161X","documentHash":"5a183045-5a32-4028-b0b7-e8cefc1cac48"}],"doi":"10.3389/fpubh.2023.1160691"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["617e0db87523400564d62f35","5e709268878c28a047395296"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Cloud optimization for disinformation detection and news veracity","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eec54a4097076263b82475","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c287715741935","mniswId":"1078","startDate":null,"endDate":null,"fullName":"International Conference on Information Systems","shortName":"ICIS","city":null,"country":null,"website":null,"isEdition":false,"documentHash":"9ce5646b-fda6-4351-bacb-e1e28a9e9d35"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["617e0db87523400564d62f35","5e709268878c28a047395296"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059455842","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"65eec54a4097076263b82476","mniswId":null,"startDate":"2023-12-10","endDate":"2023-12-13","fullName":"International Conference on Information Systems [ICIS]","shortName":"ICIS","city":"Hyderabad","country":"IN","website":null,"isEdition":true,"documentHash":"352d97c5-b62d-4482-9a2b-8f2f881ec4f6"},"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://aisel.aisnet.org/wisp2023/2/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"617e0db87523400564d62f35","name":"Lumbardha","lastName":"Hasimi","uuid":"D14E9D0AA840F7572095BFE3957AAF67755AC85314435028EE861B5D2B50CDE014C12F94A8E7601472AFE02C2770622DF44A38594A50FD987B2B98D0DFF854BC","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"922c9555-0d30-4a86-a7f5-c42e128495e9"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395296","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Poniszewska-Marańda","uuid":"3050F0C055B99629490CB9850E4F58BB551F498E8A82784B79DF436E8C24EF91901AB387C29E6523AF902D14A8A928C118DBB3FE2193E6026FDF295ABE3A4FA0","orcidId":"0000-0001-7596-0813","documentHash":"bd3d68f0-b2f8-4f98-9e08-91627b42623a"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Adalimumab","biologics","failure","fis-tulas","hidradenitis suppurativa","imaging","tun-nel","ultrasonography"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

The integrated approach to understanding the effects of exposures on the immune system includes the ongoing collection of large-scale and complex data. This requires sophisticated methods to take full advantage of what this data can offer. Here we discuss the progress and further promise of applying artificial intelligence and machine-learning approaches to help unlock the power of complex environmental data sets toward providing causality models of exposure and intervention. We discuss a range of relevant machine-learning paradigms and models including the way such models are trained and validated together with examples of machine learning applied to allergic disease in the context of specific environmental exposures as well as attempts to tie these environmental data streams to the full representative exposome. We also discuss the promise of artificial intelligence in personalized medicine and the methodological approaches to healthcare with the final AI to improve public health.

The study evaluates how texts and photographs have been structured in newspapers by examining news stories about Adampol / Polonezköy from the Milliyet newspaper and the haberler.com and adampolpolonezkoy websites. "}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455855","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ispan.waw.pl/journals/index.php/cs-ec/article/view/cs.2701","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"645b01a940e3ff38f8b4e264","name":"Gizem","lastName":"Karaköse","uuid":"8AA2D2181B794292121FDE49E2FD2B56268AF79AC7E781317FD7D8739C56BA2818D50EDA68DD9990C7741BAB5821B91F51D9002CAE426177DFB2B9CEC65C6B57","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5e1c96fb-35c6-4697-ad2c-c9112e35d42c"}],"doi":"10.11649/cs.2701"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Glass structure","Diffraction","Densification","Reverse Monte Carlo"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0c","uid":"bnXIe5Gp0q3Tkxqm6btR47Q","uuid":"3059e2c4-d76b-416b-8360-76fc2ced654d","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0c","parentUuid":"3059e2c4-d76b-416b-8360-76fc2ced654d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0c","rootUuid":"3059e2c4-d76b-416b-8360-76fc2ced654d","name":"Instytut Wysokich Ciśnień Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940f878c28a0473b5989"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Explaining an anomalous pressure dependence of shear modulus in germanate glasses based on Reverse Monte Carlo modelling","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478853","mniswId":"11763","title":"Journal of Materials Science and Technology","doi":null,"issn":"1005-0302","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"171b4bee-8c37-4b24-b459-d6d53de7407f"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-03-02","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9dbec409707132d3898fb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65e9dbec409707132d3898fd","65e9dbec409707132d3898fe","65e9dbec409707132d3898ff","65e9dbec409707132d389900","65e9dbec409707132d389901","65e9dbec409707132d389902","65e9dbec409707132d389903","65e9dbec409707132d389904","5e70940f878c28a0473b5989","65e9dbec409707132d389905"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Unlike traditional silicate glasses, germanate glasses often feature non-monotonic variations in material properties (e.g., elastic moduli and glass transition temperature) with varying chemical composition, temperature, and pressure. However, the underlying atomic-scale structural origins remain poorly understood. This is because, in most oxide glasses, the structural changes are quantified through solid-state NMR spectroscopy, but unfortunately the only NMR active germanium isotope (73Ge) has very unfavorable NMR properties. Here, we circumvent this problem by using high-energy X-ray and neutron total scattering coupled with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations as input for Reverse Monte Carlo modeling. In detail, we study the structure and properties of two sodium germanate glasses (10Na2O-90GeO2 and 20Na2O-80GeO2) subjected to permanent densification through hot compression up to 2 GPa at the glass transition temperature. While density as well as Young's and bulk modulus increase with pressure as expected, shear modulus first increases and then decreases slightly at higher pressures. The refined atomistic structure models suggest that the glasses feature a distribution of 4, 5, and 6 coordinated Ge with a majority of 4 and 5 coordinated species. Only minor changes in the Ge–O coordination occur upon hot compression, but a notable transformation of edge- to corner-sharing Ge-polyhedra is found. This anomalous polyhedral packing causes a lower number of angular constraints upon higher pressure treatment, explaining the non-monotonic trend of shear modulus with pressure. We also find that the rings become smaller and less circular upon compression, contributing to the volumetric compaction. These findings may aid the future design of germanate glasses with tailored properties and the general understanding of structure-property relations in oxide glasses."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455859","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65e9dbec409707132d3898fc","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"192","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"e8032545-6987-48cc-abce-d728d3000d4c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"192","pagesFromTo":"54-64","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1005030224001543?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e9dbec409707132d389905","name":"Morten M.","lastName":"Smedskjaer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1f545cf4-5620-42d6-8732-8ef0b6672d41"},{"objectId":"65e9dbec409707132d389904","name":"Lars R.","lastName":"Jensen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8f1e3b47-2b59-4999-9a5f-eb1cdd577f05"},{"objectId":"65e9dbec409707132d389903","name":"Jörg","lastName":"Neuefeind","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a9fd1014-ba69-4d7d-8aab-19c0140403c7"},{"objectId":"65e9dbec409707132d389902","name":"Kirsten M.Ø.","lastName":"Jensen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dc34428b-ae7a-496f-bd53-bc7356cbfd24"},{"objectId":"65e9dbec409707132d389901","name":"Mikkel","lastName":"Juelsholt","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f8320bf2-526a-4e7a-ba4f-b7a9623e40e5"},{"objectId":"65e9dbec409707132d389900","name":"Ying","lastName":"Shi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3a23106a-af5b-4d29-b1f2-cca66988ff00"},{"objectId":"65e9dbec409707132d3898ff","name":"Matthieu","lastName":"Micoulaut","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bc068a8f-4894-41dd-bde4-cbb7044885cf"},{"objectId":"65e9dbec409707132d3898fe","name":"Xuan","lastName":"Ge","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b93ab60a-6c85-415d-9883-6fc9433a027a"},{"objectId":"65e9dbec409707132d3898fd","name":"Søren S.","lastName":"Sørensen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dcd808fd-4e3a-4fea-9033-4bb3da292acb"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5989","name":"Michał","lastName":"Boćkowski","uuid":"18E0485511ABDB0D41DB7F6F59E9E4626BB139E8F890BB7F1D72DE93FF779111D716976B750D1B02005018F23E408247F07044DC9DD6FE84870F35A167D66175","orcidId":"0000-0003-1616-685X","documentHash":"6f2bcbbc-7ec5-4a12-aa2e-323154ef506b"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jmst.2023.12.051"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Agresja rosyjska na Ukrainę (2022)","Bezpieczeństwo publiczne","Policja","Ukraina"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65e98ba2409707132d2fbc33","doi":null,"title":"Bezpieczeństwo wewnętrzne i zewnętrzne Polski w perspektywie konfliktów w państwach sąsiednich","year":2023,"volume":null,"isbn":"9788363518875","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://katalogi.bn.org.pl/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma991053076748905066&context=L&vid=48OMNIS_NLOP:48OMNIS_NLOP&lang=pl&search_scope=NLOP_IZ_NZ&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=LibraryCatalog&query=any,contains,Bezpiecze%C5%84stwo%20wewn%C4%99trzne%20i%20zewn%C4%99trzne%20Polski%20w%20perspektywie%20konflikt%C3%B3w%20w%20pa%C5%84stwach%20s%C4%85siednich&offset=0","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"1bbe71cf-3333-4284-8a74-78e2411a8cdf","publisher":{"objectId":"610809959543c70b144e700d","mniswId":"83100","name":"Pewne Wydawnictwo","documentHash":"44c8120c-e030-4947-b2f1-546b1f443845"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","uid":"bABmAiyO82JgMB2LqzOepAg","uuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","parentUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","rootUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","name":"Akademia Sztuki Wojennej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094b9878c28a0473c27d9"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Zapewnienie bezpieczeństwa publicznego w warunkach konfliktu zbrojnego : próba analizy doświadczeń ukraińskich","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e98dc6409707132d2fea79","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094b9878c28a0473c27d9"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059455861","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"33 -

Hypericin was applied at concentrations ranging from 0.1-40 μM to HaCaT, SCC-25, and MUG-Mel2 cells. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were exposed to orange light at 3.6 J/cm2 or 7.2 J/cm2. Phototoxicity was assessed using MTT and SRB tests. Cellular uptake was measured by flow cytometry. Apoptosis-positive cells were estimated through TUNEL for apoptotic bodies' visualization. Hypericin exhibited a higher phototoxic reaction in cancer cells compared to normal keratinocytes after irradiation. Cancer cells demonstrated increased and selective uptake of hypericin. Apoptosis was observed in SCC-25 and MUG-Mel2 cells following PDT. Our findings suggest that hypericin-based PDT is a promising and less invasive approach for treating skin cancer. The higher phototoxic reaction, selective uptake by cancer cells, and observed proapoptotic properties support the promising role of hypericin-based PDT in skin cancer treatment."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455864","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"art.16897 [14 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/23/16897","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f8511c9085dcb410a25ed02","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Nowak-Perlak","uuid":"987BFA55F8FF736C8AD63CD5BEF4702E495F8EEE17970A0F6246C7CB8F1F6842F9B324AA4A98157190D75E5195652AA93A80EDC04E538FCFEA664116F8143994","orcidId":"0000-0001-8741-377X","documentHash":"ad9d108a-e45f-4d5f-bb6d-c00d45154a4c"},{"objectId":"5e70944b878c28a0473b9ebd","name":"Marta","lastName":"Woźniak","uuid":"75A288209A6BED9E2A98BD743952868811AF4C8084743031821E18FF64CEDC423752EE451A708E6F572A4C8422567702710DFA810A81A25FED87957397BF1E07","orcidId":"0000-0001-7978-6330","documentHash":"dfd11fd0-f223-4340-9fd6-503f122961b1"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms242316897"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["frazeologia","gwara polska","Wierszyna","Syberia"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["phraseology","local dialect of Polish","Vershina village","Siberia"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Frazeologia polskiej gwary mieszkańców wsi Wierszyna na Syberii na początku XXI wieku","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b59a","mniswId":"19045","title":"Studia z Filologii Polskiej i Słowiańskiej","doi":null,"issn":"2392-2435","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"213fd09d-109e-447d-81af-8c6afdebed61"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-12","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9a94f40970762631fbb97","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709344878c28a0473a611b"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Pierwsi polscy dobrowolni osadnicy pojawili się na obszarze dzisiejszej\r\nWierszyny na początku XX wieku.

This can have a significant impact on a person’s psychological well-being, which can lead to a decreased quality of life. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of using stem cells in androgenic alopecia. The search was conducted in MEDLINE via PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. The review was performed on data pertaining to the efficacy of using different types of stem cells in androgenic alopecia: quantitative results of stem cell usage were compared to the control treatment or, different types of treatment for female and male androgenetic alopecia. Of the outcomes, the density of hair was analyzed. Fourteen articles were selected for this review. During and after treatment with stem cells, no major side effects were reported by patients with alopecia. The use of stem cells in androgenic alopecia seems to be a promising alternative to the standard treatment or it could play the role of complementary therapy to improve the effect of primary treatment. However, these results should be interpreted with caution until they can be reproduced in larger and more representative samples."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455868","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"art.951 [12 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/12/6/951","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e1824097076263e84154","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Piętowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"94abbc8e-63e2-4a72-b9ed-a06bad98f973"},{"objectId":"6630e1824097076263e84153","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Krefft-Trzciniecka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4d69a680-c3ab-4de9-aeb7-8c51e5bfb6ee"},{"objectId":"5e709305878c28a0473a141c","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Nowicka","uuid":"E343CD16A53C31EA212834EE3E378BC7F825140B884BB10FFF5E559E915AF83E57B6C3DC9BE41D1675976AE5BCA045C09841F216BE9B794C1DDE7459C64E7BFF","orcidId":"0000-0002-1717-4280","documentHash":"c514b7d5-6e2b-414a-b849-5520baf13f0e"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1375","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Szepietowski","uuid":"BFD55FB7279B9CE2DAE7D9EFAF01C474DAEE7B50FDB68898A3D2A2D0C28321A5F4FE19CB55BA9C55BF78966C75801D554A4A7A4917DC51DB31C2E704BDF467AB","orcidId":"0000-0003-0766-6342","documentHash":"230cd8c8-61bf-41ea-9ec1-60bff6453cd6"}],"doi":"10.3390/cells12060951"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hidradenitis suppurativa","acne inversa","satisfaction with life","coping","coping mechanisms"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

The objective of this study is to thoroughly analyze satisfaction with life (SWL) and coping strategies of HS patients in relation to the clinical and psychosocial factors. Methods: 114 HS patients (53.1% females; mean age 36.6 ± 13.1 years) were enrolled. Severity of the disease was measured using Hurley staging and International HS Score System (IHS4). Instruments utilized: Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS); Coping-Orientation to Problems-Experienced Inventory (Brief COPE); HS Quality of Life Scale (HiSQoL); Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9); Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7); General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). Results: SWL was low in 31.6% of HS patients. No relation was found between SWL and Hurley staging and IHS4. SWL correlated with GHQ-28 (r = −0.579 p &lt; 0.001), PHQ-9 (r = −0.603 p &lt; 0.001), GAD-7 (r = −0.579 p &lt; 0.001), and HiSQoL (r = −0.449 p &lt; 0.001). Problem-focused coping strategies were most commonly used, followed by emotion-focused coping and avoiding coping strategies. Significant differences were found between the following coping strategies and SWL: self-distraction (p = 0.013), behavioral-disengagement (p = 0.001), denial (p = 0.003), venting (p = 0.019), and self-blame (p = 0.001). Conclusions: HS patients present low SWL which correlates with psychosocial burden. Reducing anxiety–depression comorbidity and encouraging optimal coping strategies may be of great importance in holistic approach to HS patients."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455872","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"art.2755 [13 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/8/2755","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"634a1b297523402e34127197","name":"Julia","lastName":"Rymaszewska","uuid":"FA0349AF2695A03F729D9260F385461B47EF17283793716F8963889F4BB9DA793CA77342A265C5ACA3E93AA7C1D758E5A5F4084687F2B7A08A9A740B26854D47","orcidId":"0000-0002-6863-3977","documentHash":"582fe86a-5954-46da-940a-386430287bda"},{"objectId":"5ebed479752340254fc3fe74","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Krajewski","uuid":"953EA17B3EEB96D211EDAD12A32003E63501AE6C8C8A145A9D2AAAA036ED034093277AE7E6C67B7F2F758CBBE21B482F948146F58906D5B6DB12DB142786C0E3","orcidId":"0000-0003-4722-8531","documentHash":"40b209b2-c09b-4418-af1e-9f9342da2c19"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1375","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Szepietowski","uuid":"BFD55FB7279B9CE2DAE7D9EFAF01C474DAEE7B50FDB68898A3D2A2D0C28321A5F4FE19CB55BA9C55BF78966C75801D554A4A7A4917DC51DB31C2E704BDF467AB","orcidId":"0000-0003-0766-6342","documentHash":"230cd8c8-61bf-41ea-9ec1-60bff6453cd6"},{"objectId":"5e709235878c28a047391b7b","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Maj","uuid":"CC4A4C815AC2B2DCEEA3FE3D92A430CBB85836A3F0871D4DFDB7076D8315CADBAE3BD6A8D4AB9A8958F4D7C38191B5A098ACEE0B80FC712B44F2583AEBE8B649","orcidId":"0000-0001-8300-8208","documentHash":"b0e18080-2cde-465a-a7c3-aa0f39422e1c"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e2ee","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Matusiak","uuid":"85FA73E2536180BFB173C3B85994BC01CDE06A1A5CBC9BB48D93E17F5647C043B8E25796E6684841FC6CF41073B1B4003BCF44AC00B7C9BF7BE081FA30B5DAA8","orcidId":"0000-0003-2067-4929","documentHash":"29f687b4-e28f-4241-a46f-01a9f3449417"}],"doi":"10.3390/jcm12082755"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":"9781003308096","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df20","uid":"bMvn9i-Wb4qNqQKvtk7hgiw","uuid":"c6e84f2a-bbff-4e0b-8fd5-dc507baff821","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Psychologii","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709358878c28a0473a7b1e"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Safety, Danger, and Protection in the Family and Community: A Systemic and Attachment-Informed Approach","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":254,"publicationPlace":"London","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eecfe040970749973c3126","editors":[{"objectId":"65eecfe040970749973c3127","name":"Vetere","lastName":"Arlene","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7394ed50-2431-4749-a66f-3b4af07fad80"},{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7b1e","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Chrząstowski","uuid":"6AFB6932873D6A91CF876EFB079C8C8D433574FCA37306427D34061E43E86D6732425FEBBDFFB524780F0783E66A5EA535F1E81CF6BA9A523B15F0BFFD436C67","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"77f1c39d-d5ee-4207-8954-bbc499e7ce50"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["5e709358878c28a0473a7b1e","65eecfe040970749973c3127"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This book provides an analysis of the meaning of safety and security across the contexts of community and public life, throughout the life span, and within a therapeutic framework, examining threats and the strategies for coping with them.\n\nThe book starts in Part I with a discussion of general safety and security concepts in the socio-cultural context.

Small guest molecules in the presence of micelles undergo constant exchange between a micellar aggregate and the surrounding solution, posing a considerable challenge for their molecular level characterisation. In this work we reveal the interaction maps between small guest molecules and surfactants forming micelles via novel applications of NMR techniques supported with state-of-the-art analytical methods used in colloidal science. Model micelles composed of structurally distinct surfactants (block non-ionic polymer Pluronic® F-127, non-ionic surfactant Tween 20 or Tween 80, and ionic surfactant sodium lauryl sulphate, SLS) were selected and loaded with model small molecules of biological relevance (i.e. the drugs fluconazole, FLU or indomethacin, IMC) known to have different partition coefficients. Molecular level organization of FLU or IMC within hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains of micellar aggregates was established using the combination of NMR methods (1D 1H NMR, 1D 19F NMR, 2D 1H–1H NOESY and 2D 1H-19F HOESY, and the multifrequency-STD NMR) and corroborated with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This is the first application of multifrequency-STD NMR to colloidal systems, enabling us to elucidate intricately detailed patterns of drug/micelle interactions in a single NMR experiment within minutes. Importantly, our results indicate that flexible surfactants, such as block copolymers and polysorbates, form micellar aggregates with a surface composed of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains and do not follow the classical core–shell model of the micelle. We propose that the magnitude of changes in 1H chemical shifts corroborated with interaction maps obtained from DEEP-STD NMR and 2D NMR experiments can be used as an indicator of the strength of the guest-surfactant interactions. This NMR toolbox can be adopted for the analysis of broad range of colloidal host–guest systems from soft materials to biological systems."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455875","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"638","pagesFromTo":"135-148","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021979723000693","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e5064097076263e87abd","name":"Jesús","lastName":"Angulo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9cf65832-0ae3-4165-90ee-02f5f5d1c9e7"},{"objectId":"6630e5064097076263e87abc","name":"Yaroslav Z.","lastName":"Khimyak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4e012a44-bbe5-4cae-9c67-6b41ba72fb1b"},{"objectId":"6630e5064097076263e87abb","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Nestorowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f7ab67fc-eaf6-4a33-b941-02ddd9d0fba0"},{"objectId":"6630e5064097076263e87aba","name":"Ignacio","lastName":"Delso","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"da08d5df-5893-47a5-a975-e7af8b288f52"},{"objectId":"6630e5064097076263e87ab9","name":"Serena","lastName":"Monaco","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"327ef91a-d8c4-44f4-9855-64c56a829f71"},{"objectId":"5f9d4ef7085dcb3b6122beaa","name":"Marta","lastName":"Kozakiewicz-Latała","uuid":"5782D9FC11745085AFD0CCE9B98112C21176B69FBC440D90E155EE9D101C35D3C8EA9F87B1A965262DBADAC3343AFB9B778C89D5DAB0A0F277CD54F8F1083441","orcidId":"0000-0001-8822-126X","documentHash":"d7ee9f43-6f75-4c9b-8ac4-ba0d656b7bf2"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473a9f6f","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Malec","uuid":"13C7328DBF4F3B9C975E596B8D1117A5F53963E61FA7AA873ED630947969491CFBEFD5C7C15642864E1C3D307453B446F12CE08915F740648012AFBE3ACA2933","orcidId":"0000-0002-9017-7453","documentHash":"9dd6d4a9-2afb-443b-b457-802d81b3cb88"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1344","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Karolewicz","uuid":"F4090C94D75F17146095ED3AC0DA0F7974D53077F06C325B2C3325A096F82991EC3541E4E0940FC76007DE12745CD4DC80788B3BDD21683026415623FEEFA547","orcidId":"0000-0003-0970-6344","documentHash":"49c8216d-d001-4c30-a2ae-f031d8509254"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a12ec","name":"Karol","lastName":"Nartowski","uuid":"3DD64FE68EEFAFB0B345308B66A1BC6682CA615A25500205ACCA1D8FB5D01F912F5F40D47F3DF6DC0A5124F70060152DD5F0DC249AC9BC84263AFA05261D41B4","orcidId":"0000-0003-1915-5195","documentHash":"7a398774-5e3d-4e01-9308-a473d81b84d1"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jcis.2023.01.063"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of HR recovery in functional improvement among adults with severe aortic stenosis undergoing percutaneous aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Methods: We performed a 6 min walk test (6MWT) in 93 individuals before TAVI and 3 months after the procedure. The change in walking distance was calculated. During the pre-TAVI 6MWT, we analyzed the differences between baseline HR, HR at the end of the test, and HR at the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd minute of recovery. Results: After 3 months, 6MWT distances improved by 39 ± 63 m and reached a total of 322 ± 117 m. Multiple linear regression proved the differences between HR after 2 min of recovery and baseline HR in pre-TAVI after a 6MWT was the only significant predictor of waking distance improvement during follow-up. Conclusions: Our study suggests that analysis of HR recovery after a 6MWT may be a helpful and easy parameter to assess improvements in exercise capacity after TAVI. This simple method can help to identify patients in whom no significant benefit in functional improvement can be expected despite successful valve implantation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455877","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"20","pagesFromTo":"art.4270 [9 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/5/4270","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630ea904097076263e8a743","name":"Damian Janusz","lastName":"Kulig","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f8367df4-d640-4fd1-8940-0d666b0e9dfb"},{"objectId":"6630ea904097076263e8a742","name":"Grzegorz Piotr","lastName":"Golański","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"023bb4f0-15ba-4c4b-8f6e-3556f85243fd"},{"objectId":"6630ea904097076263e8a741","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Grześkowiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"76c75176-d76a-44d8-92d6-b8a1c5638fb2"},{"objectId":"6630ea904097076263e8a740","name":"Katarzyna Maria","lastName":"Aleksandrowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ad266e10-965a-4e28-b3c4-f8cfceba88cb"},{"objectId":"5e70944b878c28a0473b9ecf","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kosowski","uuid":"73192AA1FB6B1A21B778A8BFB99C6F178094AA29A9115BD837E9B289291BE53421E14959CC26D5BAB39ABE7DFEA3F8A5BC3BF01227779A39EAB332410E842B1F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8911-5303","documentHash":"870ff85d-4459-4505-8d10-f509bd0228e1"},{"objectId":"5e709431878c28a0473b7f4d","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Witkowski","uuid":"0AE2D78D3C19D83B9C988DA98A5895FE14D0B4114724F73DB97F53AD881E5BFE997DE92A2D2A5EF20DD45F71D5797AD4FB642B2EC7E4DB12799F16A061CF7AA9","orcidId":"0000-0002-9383-4578","documentHash":"3aa7dc66-01db-4b69-a4df-8a672417d59b"},{"objectId":"5e709418878c28a0473b613f","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Rachwalik","uuid":"85F0CB1253FFBDE04ECBC54DA2944B249EFB4B6E1FD8B21CBD25184BB41E712FFB616D94630DFBD32585A05AA304773BF0631EC189D5A4BA4573DA6FFD10251D","orcidId":"0000-0001-9714-4059","documentHash":"18f28efa-0b0a-423e-a5d3-92f09fa8d20f"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afabc","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kübler","uuid":"66D6EE48C408B31FC25462925EA3F1F692858532A0A266548C1151C4EE3D930F3E74DCF000AB92B70E7C47857BFFD032E4125BD76957764ADFE7AA39BA45210D","orcidId":"0000-0003-2645-0475","documentHash":"bf5e0c80-8308-40a2-b11c-0d37b55ff2a7"},{"objectId":"5e70931b878c28a0473a2fb6","name":"Roman","lastName":"Przybylski","uuid":"E6ABC06AF3155B98DB8E243CDAAF84E692AA6E161B0AF2D630F0D57BEF0D3AC083CDF162D63C85BCCE8C3DE524B8F121A41EBDC4E61BCED1240060B931008450","orcidId":"0000-0003-2399-5111","documentHash":"17b7cc61-caab-43fb-b9e9-82688afd6698"},{"objectId":"5e70930d878c28a0473a1ed8","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Aleksandrowicz","uuid":"574F5BD08FAF1CE2A2FED907AD29104A3C762988705E4D45C0DB8CBC52D1C52D1C83C2F97ACC6E06E4C1B08F174986038D0B4B676E3E96E9F5896725AADF4151","orcidId":"0000-0002-9051-9871","documentHash":"65c9301d-c078-4e2d-8cd3-d8ed3bde9e72"},{"objectId":"5e709306878c28a0473a14b3","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Protasiewicz","uuid":"94D46C57C88ABFA069D527917F37AC8ED50C568FB1D9C90537528A3663229026371A493888DE124360BA3A517DB76AB9BD6A9F08F803B518A56FC7D4F7E65495","orcidId":"0000-0003-0253-0585","documentHash":"2f9a1c60-41ab-4536-8c67-1ecc377b77e0"},{"objectId":"5e709305878c28a0473a145b","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Reczuch","uuid":"1D5754AA35BE618F1D66CFB0CC4454EB5B8679160F28BA33A98F5D83EF82D47032963AFCC8C5D2058B08323E0AACFE538A280A08F7C2E2257F7D5C3511B6CA54","orcidId":"0000-0002-1699-739X","documentHash":"1565e1dc-063a-4ded-a942-34126cfa9ba5"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph20054270"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

The prevalence of PSO among children varies depending on the age and ranges from 0.12% at one year to 2% at 18 years. Due to systemic inflammation, PSO is associated with obesity, hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease, and cardiovascular incidences.Secukinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody selectively targeting IL-17A. The drug has been approved for children aged 6-18 with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Nevertheless, only a few reports thoroughly describe its efficacy and safety in the pediatric population.\r\n\r\nAreas covered: This review aims to describe the efficacy and safety of secukinumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque PSO in pediatric patients aged six years and older.\r\n\r\nExpert opinion: Although there are only two clinical trials assessing the efficacy and safety of secukinumab in the pediatric population with plaque PSO, this therapy seems to be a significant advancement in managing those patients. Both dose regimens (depending on the weight, low-dose, 75/75/150 mg, and high-dose 75/150/300 mg) of secukinumab were more effective in achieving significant clinical improvement (PASI 75/90 and IGA response) than placebo or active-comparator. Both regimens showed good safety and tolerability profiles, with mostly mild AEs and no SAEs observed.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455882","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"711-716","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1744666X.2023.2214365","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebed479752340254fc3fe74","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Krajewski","uuid":"953EA17B3EEB96D211EDAD12A32003E63501AE6C8C8A145A9D2AAAA036ED034093277AE7E6C67B7F2F758CBBE21B482F948146F58906D5B6DB12DB142786C0E3","orcidId":"0000-0003-4722-8531","documentHash":"40b209b2-c09b-4418-af1e-9f9342da2c19"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1375","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Szepietowski","uuid":"BFD55FB7279B9CE2DAE7D9EFAF01C474DAEE7B50FDB68898A3D2A2D0C28321A5F4FE19CB55BA9C55BF78966C75801D554A4A7A4917DC51DB31C2E704BDF467AB","orcidId":"0000-0003-0766-6342","documentHash":"230cd8c8-61bf-41ea-9ec1-60bff6453cd6"}],"doi":"10.1080/1744666x.2023.2214365"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Our results demonstrated that Sm4 treatment induced cytotoxic effects on all three cell lines, with a greater effect observed in NSCLC adenocarcinoma cells. Sm4 treatment led to S-phase cell accumulation and upregulation of p21, a key regulator of the S-to-G2/M phase transition. While no significant changes in SOX7 or SOX17 protein expression were observed, Sm4 treatment resulted in a significant upregulation of SOX17 gene expression. Furthermore, our findings suggest a complex interplay between SOX18 and p21 in the context of lung cancer, with a positive correlation observed between SOX18 expression and p21 nuclear presence in clinical tissue samples obtained from lung cancer patients. These results suggest that Sm4 has the potential to disrupt the cell cycle and target cancer cell growth by modulating SOX18 activity and p21 expression.

Internationalisation and interdisciplinarity are fundamental determinants of modern research and education. The foremost factor of functioning in the international world of science is the mobility of students and scientists. Considering this context, the objective of this study was to analyse the staff mobility for teaching under the Erasmus+ programme at the Wrocław University of Environmental and Life Sciences (UPWr). The research took into account the mobility of staff for teaching (STA) within the period of the academic years from 2009/2010 to 2020/2021. The methodological approach applied in this study is based on the concept of mobility network analysis and mobility flows. The geo-visualization was prepared with the use of a spider diagram. Using this approach, the connections between spatial locations and domains of scientific activity were analysed. The results show that the mobility flow at UPWr rose significantly after the authorities of the university decided to increase the funding for STA, and eventually was slowed down by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the findings in the geographical aspect show that there were two main regions of destination, which were the Iberian Peninsula and the closest neighbouring countries, where the predominant institutions could be observed. The most mobile group of teachers were the ones representing environment sciences. The STA flow is not reflected in the students’ mobility flow. COVID-19 has enhanced the virtual component of learning, resulting in the strengthening of the blended mobility model."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455887","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/9/4949/pdf?version=1650511871","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e969ec40970762631a1b31","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kafarski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b2b33c0d-9d4f-4245-b0c1-4d8ff9a3af85"},{"objectId":"5e709276878c28a04739610d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Kazak","uuid":"8BF592A9A46196A6F935B2BB31A500677E92CBD86B861922FB7AA22FB29395D1B64F43036B95965A8EC6195E7801C90063119847146D4F8539B9BD9881551DE0","orcidId":"0000-0002-1864-9954","documentHash":"9f3029ac-7cd5-4671-b3f2-c824c0d58001"}],"doi":"10.3390/su14094949"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cholinesterase","cyclooxygenase","malvidin","molecular docking"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

The biological activity of malvidin and its glycosides is not entirely clear and has been relatively less frequently studied compared to other anthocyanins. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the relationship between the structural derivatives of malvidin and their anti-cholinergic and anti-inflammatory activity. The study selected malvidin (Mv) and its two sugar derivatives: malvidin 3-O-glucoside (Mv 3-glc) and malvidin 3,5-O-diglucoside (Mv 3,5-diglc). The anti-inflammatory activity was assessed by inhibiting the enzymes, specifically COX-1 and COX-2. Additionally, the inhibitory effects on cholinesterase activity, particularly acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), were evaluated. Molecular modeling was also employed to examine and visualize the interactions between enzymes and anthocyanins. The results revealed that the highest inhibitory capacity at concentration 100 µM was demonstrated by Mv 3-glc in relation to AChE (26.3 ± 3.1%) and BChE (22.1 ± 3.0%), highlighting the crucial role of the glycoside substituent at the C3 position of the C ring in determining the inhibitory efficiency of these enzymes. In addition, the glycosylation of malvidin significantly reduced the anti-inflammatory activity of these derivatives compared to the aglycone form. The IC50 parameter demonstrates the following relationship for the COX-1 enzyme: Mv (12.45 ± 0.70 µM) < Mv 3-glc (74.78 ± 0.06 µM) < Mv 3,5-diglc (90.36 ± 1.92 µM). Similarly, for the COX-2 enzyme, we have: Mv (2.76 ± 0.16 µM) < Mv 3-glc (39.92 ± 3.02 µM) < Mv 3.5-diglc (66.45 ± 1.93 µM). All tested forms of malvidin exhibited higher activity towards COX-2 compared to COX-1, indicating their selectivity as inhibitors of COX-2. Theoretical calculations were capable of qualitatively replicating most of the noted patterns in the experimental data, explaining the impact of deprotonation and glycosylation on inhibitory activity. It can be suggested that anthocyanins, such as malvidins, could be valuable in the development of treatments for inflammatory conditions and Alzheimer's disease and deserve further study."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455889","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"28","pagesFromTo":"art.7872 [14 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/28/23/7872","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e2504097076263e85b86","name":"Janina","lastName":"Gabrielska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f8a65455-c97d-4aa6-9e36-1dcc4bbe59aa"},{"objectId":"6630e2504097076263e85b85","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Strugała-Danak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1f735ed7-7f6c-4d0c-864e-83569cce8f77"},{"objectId":"5ecc7f9a7523406a2b8ea5d7","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Spiegel","uuid":"A79283F0CFA353B74476711464BCE5C4082B4C8D9754A6CE2535F2DA02ED3E5B4D5708B18B478F3EFA55B371B0751FC3C52614AE20866E5C12BC30D0DD199123","orcidId":"0000-0002-8012-1026","documentHash":"d4fec065-1acc-487e-9e0e-acb42a21f388"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules28237872"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Climate change","Environmental sustainability","Older people","Fuel poverty","Netherlands","Energy transition","Protein transition","Diet","Attitudes","Income","Ecological social work"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Views of older people on environmental sustainability: The development of the SustainABLE-16 Questionnaire","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477484","mniswId":"2890","title":"Building and Environment","doi":null,"issn":"0360-1323","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"8126e8d9-bf21-45e6-8757-87a5da95f1dc"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-17","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9754c40970762631a8a67","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65e9754c40970762631a8a68","5e709276878c28a04739610d","65e9754c40970762631a8a69","65275a2940e3ff22d34ab9c7"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"There are over 1400 age-friendly cities and communities worldwide, and the efforts to create a better quality of life for older people progressively intersect with sustainability goals.

application of biochar as an additive to enhance the anaerobic digestion (AD) of biomass has been extensively studied from various perspectives. This study reported, for the first time, the influence of biochar incubation in the inoculum on the anaerobic fermentation of glucose in a batch-type reactor over 20 days. Three groups of inoculum with the same characteristics were pre-mixed once with biochar for different durations: 21 days (D21), 10 days (D10), and 0 days (D0). The BC was mixed in the inoculum at a concentration of 8.0 g/L. The proportion of the inoculum and substrate was adjusted to an inoculum-to-substrate ratio of 2.0 based on the volatile solids. The results of the experiment revealed that D21 had the highest cumulative methane yield, of 348.98 mL, compared to 322.66, 290.05, and 25.15 mL obtained from D10, D0, and the control, respectively. Three models—modified Gompertz, first-order, and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)—were used to interpret the biomethane production. All models showed promising fitting of the cumulative biomethane production, as indicated by high \uD835\uDC452\r\n and low RMSE values. Among these models, the ARIMA model exhibited the closest fit to the actual data. The biomethane production rate, derived from the modified Gompertz Model, increased as the incubation period increased, with D21 yielding the highest rate of 31.13 mL/gVS. This study suggests that the application of biochar in the anaerobic fermentation of glucose, particularly considering the short incubation period, holds significant potential for improving the overall performance of anaerobic digestion."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455894","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/20/6655","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"659b6c3a40e3ff6b129b19cd","name":"Marvin","lastName":"Valentin","uuid":"7F9901216F89852C71EEBD8779741E7D0619C56E222E060D5468245BB3A831C90A4B8067727ECACCFC8767BF076AAA595FE2AA374DF32068A6C0EC0FBD5A7BC5","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"39342fe1-5e01-4189-b283-890d83193c58"},{"objectId":"602f82529543c7410626f568","name":"Kacper","lastName":"Świechowski","uuid":"64EBA239DCD91D7B54AE56AFCC23B7C385F99CEF4C25698D882319431CBB62BFAEAFF20DB7FAF96933E33337F8712E43402AEDBC08B7E3AD11D3467198688D6D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2ca20def-2e22-46de-b548-e21ebf48e068"},{"objectId":"5e70921c878c28a0473900b8","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Białowiec","uuid":"BDF818D6D6BB69D5CB05F525C0A728054D812F8C0CBC79878F9420A7D0179A7016B66891425C5163C20A634E1DFADC9AE9B75400AF4ECBB91B18B2827927D69A","orcidId":"0000-0002-5871-2129","documentHash":"81d1531c-2c4b-477c-b00c-645c599311ea"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma16206655"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["coworking","sharing economy","city","rural areas","cooperation","freelancers","entrepreneurship","business model","local economy","community"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Coworking - a new entrepreneurship model in the sharing economy","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bfd9","mniswId":"5530","title":"Economy of Region","doi":null,"issn":"2072-6414","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"fb60e54a-f188-468a-a6d5-924c754d7e46"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2022-03-31","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e978b240970762631b2011","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65e978b240970762631b2012","5e7092c1878c28a04739c25d"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The starting point for the considerations contained in the article is ‘the sharing economy’ as a new business\r\nmodel. It modifies the way resources are used. Nowadays, possession of resources loses its significance at\r\nthe expense of their temporary accessibility. In this context, resources can be numerous: time, skills, cars, bicycles,\r\nliving and office space, just to name a few. In the last case, sharing is referred to as ‘coworking’. It is identified\r\nwith the new work culture, which enables freelancers and other people working remotely to concentrate in\r\na shared office space. The research hypothesis concerns differences in the functioning of coworking spaces depending\r\non the location. These spaces can be found not only in large cities but more often in small towns and\r\nrural areas. Their offer and way of functioning significantly differ. The purpose of the article is to present the essence\r\nof coworking and the differences arising from the functioning of coworking spaces in large cities as well as\r\nin small towns and rural areas. The article uses employs such research methods as literature studies and case\r\nstudies from the USA, Italy, Ireland, Serbia and Poland. Literature studies were used to present the idea of coworking,\r\nits benefits and users. It was also indicated that coworking spaces bring added value in the form of such\r\nvalues as, among others, community, openness, and cooperation. Analysis of case studies has shown that examples\r\nof coworking derived from small towns and rural areas, unlike the ones in agglomerations, arise as a result\r\nof grass-roots initiatives, they are not of a commercial nature, and their survival is very precarious. Even though\r\ntheir offer is much more modest than that of network ones from large cities, they use their potential. It can be\r\npresumed that the level of relations between coworking participants (mutual assistance, cooperation, trust) is\r\ninversely proportional to the size of the city/rural area. This is a contribution to further in-depth research on\r\nthe features of coworking spaces."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455896","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"280-295","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.economyofregions.org/ojs/index.php/er/article/view/21","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e978b240970762631b2012","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Konecka-Szydłowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"146182cd-b026-4685-9895-0b157f348711"},{"objectId":"5e7092c1878c28a04739c25d","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Czupich","uuid":"8907A9238A9B6816B923BFAE3B8105C5AF9D0C79A681935BAB6351D905E23F2A5C35453D979BA49ED8674B5BFC33BFE82EE103FEA5329EC8248AD9E08EEB1052","orcidId":"0000-0001-8009-9992","documentHash":"888c1c38-ad7e-4825-ac4e-ac80134da48e"}],"doi":"10.17059/ekon.reg.2022-1-20"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["energy sector","transformation","energy policy","electricity generation","renewable sources"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","uid":"bQp8ITDzg_V-1GFpvOVvvtg","uuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","parentUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","rootUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","name":"Politechnika Opolska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709235878c28a047391b43"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"An Analysis of Risks and Challenges to the Polish Power Industry in the Year 2024","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1073","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-02-22","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2024,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9b82c409707132d33df07","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709235878c28a047391b43","665ed7654097074fa1b16db3","665ed7654097074fa1b16db4"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The green transition is a challenge for the Polish economy and energy sector. In this paper, the expert method of analysis was applied and findings revealed that the challenges and prerequisites for an effective transformation of the power sector mainly include technical, technological and organizational issues of energy production and use. The provision of electricity at competitive prices and with a low carbon footprint, for individual consumers and industry, is a prerequisite for maintaining the well-being of the population and ensuring the competitiveness of domestically produced goods. The ambitious climate policy goals of the European Union require immediate action and call for radical changes in the Polish energy sector; in the coming years, it must drastically reduce the amount of energy produced from fossil fuels and replace it with so-called green energy from renewable sources. The main purpose of this article was to highlight the need to modify Poland’s energy policy until 2040 in order to make it more consistent with the ambitious climate goals of the European Union. This article also shows that Poland’s energy transition must include a shift from fossil fuels to renewables, while ensuring that energy security is stabilized by the current energy and generation resources. To this end, we discuss the issues of creating reserves in the national energy system for the entire period of Poland’s energy transition."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455897","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/5/1044","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"665ed7654097074fa1b16db4","name":"Adam","lastName":"Smoliński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f22b1254-fc20-472b-a427-fbf9a0f33135"},{"objectId":"665ed7654097074fa1b16db3","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Tokarski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ecfff43b-e64a-46ca-8f78-0e5dde62c9fd"},{"objectId":"5e709235878c28a047391b43","name":"MAŁGORZATA","lastName":"MAGDZIARCZYK","uuid":"6F551A80BCCB3A9D47E01FB1A15B02F92FC66CBE8ED78294801E76C0C33AC2142FCB13812A90AE34ECF4FC6FE5DF4502B643BE1982F7F40CBE36514EEF764525","orcidId":"0000-0003-1503-8469","documentHash":"b200504a-299d-4971-9957-f37ad6d7e9a5"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17051044"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CYP2D6","CYP1A2","polymorphisms","duloxetine","tolerability","efficacy","major depression","anxiety symptoms","prediction"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

This study aimed to investigate the influence of the CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 gene polymorphisms on the efficacy of duloxetine in reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms. A sample of 100 outpatients with major depression, who initiated monotherapy with duloxetine, were followed up. Polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 genes were assessed. The severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms was recorded using standardized scales. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were analyzed. Statistical analyses, including linear regression, were conducted to examine the relationships between genetic polymorphisms, clinical variables, and treatment outcomes. Patients with higher values of the duloxetine metabolic index (DMI) for CYP2D6, indicating a faster metabolism, achieved a greater reduction in anxiety symptoms. The occurrence of ADRs was associated with a lower reduction in anxiety symptoms. However, no significant associations were found between studied gene polymorphisms and reduction in depressive symptoms. No significant effects of the DMI for CYP1A2 were found. Patients with a slower metabolism may experience less benefit from duloxetine therapy in terms of anxiety symptom reduction. Personalizing treatment based on the CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 gene polymorphisms can enhance the effectiveness of antidepressant therapy and improve patient outcomes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455899","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"art.13459 [10 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/17/13459","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e1a94097076263e84595","name":"Marta","lastName":"Machowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3f9c477b-0dbc-4e99-ab13-a38f4c9a872d"},{"objectId":"5e709418878c28a0473b613b","name":"Błażej","lastName":"Misiak","uuid":"E9F21E3954A28FFAE505F6F2E8077BC7A73A99EB3D875718DDA3FF4973E870FD38DA96A7CA0EE56C37CA3B3CEB0D0C08A187410FB1B6FF42EC20B39AF54C554D","orcidId":"0000-0002-5392-6398","documentHash":"51e89ce1-52c3-4e16-9f0a-b244a7b117cf"},{"objectId":"5e70930d878c28a0473a1efd","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Hadryś","uuid":"16911FED6C8D8D81B55D92A60F17FC5F73776CD5619A82873EF01550B1553C7BED00E8E1564F3B3ACCBB24C62C7ACFD7F9D12BB863874396BEB72E340AB0B098","orcidId":"0000-0003-4120-7748","documentHash":"4d79d70e-22e4-4783-9440-1010853d365d"},{"objectId":"5e70930b878c28a0473a1c2d","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Pawłowski","uuid":"8145B2C917A5911244ED5FC0639716A83BA49A348721BC5CA06E39C5A2F370A1839F038E3383F8E9E831456163F9999A6A60807D47CF7D017BDF2A52DFC25358","orcidId":"0000-0002-3997-609X","documentHash":"5e3f9906-405b-4ffb-aa42-ef2744e3f4bc"},{"objectId":"5e709305878c28a0473a146a","name":"Anna","lastName":"Wiela-Hojeńska","uuid":"76AC5952FD095236A7217C6F303F605373E437BF4C55DE7F11FAA182F4DBE0E03CEB6F143767B91458BD26CBD8FF5304D5E3117E4CAFE73352A5F4DF5ADDF2B4","orcidId":"0000-0003-3813-2300","documentHash":"8a0f6c8a-496e-40d2-bd56-df93cc687ede"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a11e3","name":"Julian","lastName":"Maciaszek","uuid":"E2BF095E5369125C1A368624E12BA9AA26A3EFF5D204576D5B92EBBE8E7E70F66EE4226E3CC5B4B3B1CD73AB7457434A9F234F838154AB7B6E801567102BC6C4","orcidId":"0000-0002-4084-8220","documentHash":"3ce836ae-5ad7-4a78-a335-801b495464e0"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms241713459"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["struktura tematyczno-rematyczna","językoznawstwo polskie","historia językoznawstwa"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["thematic-rhematic structure","Polish linguistics","history of linguistics"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Przegląd polskich badań nad strukturą tematyczno-rematyczną wypowiedzi (1977-1997)","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a11c","mniswId":"485283","title":"Linguistica Copernicana","doi":null,"issn":"2080-1068","eissn":"2391-7768","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"47e01a64-4bcf-491b-abaa-76b19485339e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9a94840970762631fbb54","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c3878c28a04739c386"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Artykuł jest syntetycznym przeglądem polskiego piśmiennictwa językoznawczego z lat 1977-1997 pod kątem publikacji poświęconych strukturze tematyczno-rematycznej wypowiedzi.

For this purpose, a dedicated ontology was developed. The research demonstrates that the proposed method achieves good results with high precision, recall, and F1 scores for all entity types, with particularly remarkable results for biologically active area predictions.

COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the essential role of urban and rural green spaces for societies coping with global public health crisis. During this particular time, a significant body of research was devoted to human–nature relationships, as well as the use and importance of green spaces, both from the management and visitors’ perspectives, along with the vital role of nature in human health and wellbeing. Furthermore, the pandemic experience induced new paradigms in spatial and urban planning, along with the management of forest and protected areas seeing the crucial role of green spaces in shaping long-term socio-environmental resilience and sustainability. Thus, after the official end of the pandemic, our study aimed to provide a systematic review of the international research related to green spaces within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on those published between 2020 and 2023. The literature search within SCOPUS and Web of Science databases was conducted on 16 May 2023. A dataset of 161 articles was analyzed using a two-stage analysis. In the first stage, screening based on the title, abstract, and keywords was carried out. In the second stage, a detailed full text analysis was carried out, resulting in a final dataset of 66 articles related to the scope of this review. This article gives an in-depth methodological and conceptual overview, also referring to the applied research and management context related to green spaces in urban and rural environments. It concludes with lessons learned and poses open questions for future research related to green space planning and management. The literature review shows that institutions managing green spaces in cities and forests are facing new challenges. These include pursuing sustainable management policies in cities, ensuring equitable access to urban green space and community participation in the decision-making process, adapting suburban forest management to social expectations, and the recreational development of forest areas taking into account social needs and ecosystem sustainability."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455908","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65bbcb684097074fb4f25530","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"f2bcc5b2-9763-471c-83aa-a3383386bf54"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"354","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/15/2/354/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eafdf2409707216edd3625","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Taczanowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"857548a4-c03d-49b0-9360-b7455990c76b"},{"objectId":"65eafdf2409707216edd3624","name":"Fruzsina","lastName":"Stefan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"accd59a3-2c7c-4519-8189-5263d156cc7d"},{"objectId":"5e709307878c28a0473a1720","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Ciesielski","uuid":"9DB1BC9993C633D40247C959E2BB727A7C7CC3237236028BBABD139BBAD45E852389AF37F64EF454B32D7E4BEC35FDF718F6743BFE398FA6B0BCDD97DB293942","orcidId":"0000-0002-1215-140X","documentHash":"78cff409-e940-44ea-8029-58791028cf1c"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d3e6","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Gołos","uuid":"E36AF06ACD0B3DD9DDA62C8EFD52E23F7F0EEA0D7F93EFF73002A1546F3B3286F465D10B84991FC7682DC2C7DD4997E0DDE06910C52F6FF31409D619CE6CCBD8","orcidId":"0000-0001-5303-136X","documentHash":"43e5115e-cd30-4cf7-8a40-89169a042e4d"}],"doi":"10.3390/f15020354"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Greenery in cityscape· Urban trees· Historical towns· Eastern-Central European cities"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Distribution of trees in medieval areas of East-Central European cities ‒ regularities and peculiarities","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a31","mniswId":"19988","title":"URBAN ECOSYSTEMS","doi":null,"issn":"1083-8155","eissn":"1573-1642","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"966386cc-1661-4f1e-aa88-b317e51576f4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eadc70409707216eda49db","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65eadc70409707216eda49dd","5e709277878c28a0473963c0","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c5f","65eadc70409707216eda49e0","65eadc70409707216eda49e1"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Trees in the densely built-up historical cores of cities increase the aesthetic values of the cityscape as well as lower the effect of the urban heat island.

The oldest parts of these cities share similar origins, the same continental biogeographical region, and comparable climatic conditions. This study considered indicators of occurrence, density, species composition, and spatial distribution of trees. The study identified different types of management concerning trees. In Poznań, trees are actively introduced in public spaces. In Lublin, there is the largest share of trees in the backyards and self-seeding is common. In Lviv, there are new plantings in private and public spaces.

The primary outcome was the incontinence procedure performances. Optum's de-identified Clinformatics® Data Mart Database was queried to define the cohort of interest. The average costs of the different incontinence procedures were obtained and compared. Also, demographic, and clinical predictors of incontinence surgery were evaluated by multivariable regression analysis.\r\n\r\nResults: Of the 21,589 men with localized PCa treated with RP, 740 (3.43%) underwent at least one incontinence procedure during a median of 5 years of follow-up. In total, there were 844 unique incontinence procedures. Male slings were the most common procedure (47.5%), had an intermediate cost compared to the other treatment options, and was the first-choice treatment for the majority of patients (50%). The use of an artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) was the second most common (35.3%), but also was the most expensive treatment and was first-choice-treatment for 32.3% of patients. On multivariable analysis, metabolic syndrome related disorders, adjuvant/salvage radiation therapy as well as a history of neurological comorbidities were independently associated with an increased likelihood of incontinence surgery.\r\n\r\nConclusions: The receipt of male slings increased and then subsequently decreased, while AUS utilization was stable, and the use of urethral bulking agents was uncommon. From a cost standpoint, AUS was the most expensive option. Finally, patient's comorbidity history and RP related factors were found to influence the choice for primary or subsequent PPI interventions.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455913","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"26","pagesFromTo":"367-373","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41391-022-00558-x","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e4874097076263e86e6d","name":"Benjamin

3D MHD simulations of shattered-pellet injection (SPI) in JET show prototypical SPI-driven disruptions using the M3D-C1 and NIMROD extended-MHD codes. Initially, radiation-driven thermal quenches are accelerated by MHD activity as the pellet crosses rational surfaces, leading to a radiation spike, global stochasticization of the magnetic field, and a complete thermal quench. Eventually, current quenches, preceded by a current spike are seen as the Ohmic heating becomes equal to the radiative cooling. The results are qualitatively similar for both a single monolithic pellet, pencil-beam model, and a realistic shatter to represent the SPI plume. A scan in viscosity from 500 to 2000 m2 s−1 for MHD simulations finds that reducing viscosity increases MHD activity and decreases thermal quench time slightly. A realistic cloud of fragments modeling shows that mixed-D–Ne pellet travels deeper into the plasma core before the thermal quench. At the slow pellet speeds, the pellet is found to be moving slowly enough inward that even the 5% neon in the mixed pellet is enough to effectively radiate the thermal energy available. Radiation toroidal peaking is predicted to be at levels consistent with experimental observations and reduced as the pellet travels deeper into the plasma. These simulations lay the ground work for more-sophisticated validative and predictive modeling of SPI in JET using both M3D-C1 and NIMROD."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455915","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eb07a8409707216eddaf16","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"63","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"d026af48-e5ab-4135-ab6f-f410b349547a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"63","pagesFromTo":"66029","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/accbd3","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eb0aed409707216ede0518","name":"G.","lastName":"Szepesi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cd0b556d-4575-44cb-ada9-a5b67cc6896f"},{"objectId":"65eb0aed409707216ede0517","name":"N.","lastName":"Hawkes","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fa38828f-edb8-4f87-bf23-e851f8376ef0"},{"objectId":"65eb0aed409707216ede0516","name":"U.","lastName":"Sheikh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0500567f-0cb0-461a-b2fb-0ed346077ca8"},{"objectId":"65eb0aed409707216ede0515","name":"B.","lastName":"Stein-Lubrano","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7471d9d6-50f3-4506-b1aa-9f3a70576761"},{"objectId":"65eb0aed409707216ede0514","name":"R.M.","lastName":"Sweeney","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9f347571-cd05-4723-acac-2627b07678bd"},{"objectId":"65eb0aed409707216ede0513","name":"L.L.","lastName":"Lao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9a8cdc1a-bf85-4d14-a650-c0f1db86aa69"},{"objectId":"65eb0aed409707216ede0512","name":"N.","lastName":"Eidietis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"40eebaaf-a1b7-4b37-895a-91b8f973d6b0"},{"objectId":"65eb0aed409707216ede0511","name":"C.","lastName":"Akçay","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"05ee33e4-88b1-45e1-94ab-06ad14867f63"},{"objectId":"65eb0aed409707216ede0510","name":"C.C.","lastName":"Kim","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"46374bf5-208a-4baa-9b59-a36091fbb3e7"},{"objectId":"65eb0aed409707216ede050f","name":"B.C.","lastName":"Lyons","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"25c9e7ee-560f-4a51-9551-927e06226bd1"},{"objectId":"65eb0aed409707216ede050e","name":"J.","lastName":"McClenaghan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"27f434c2-c499-4d77-80f4-db8cf30a704a"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397202","name":"BOHDAN","lastName":"BIEG","uuid":"824102936597EAEAFDC0CA005121E68A31F5CD249313BB3DE7A696711B7AF50AA39660B4406408C7C6F1876B2B4C60A29C04488145A12D92F4454003EDE7904F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3649-6349","documentHash":"4211ff14-2499-4712-b9b5-bf009f77c090"}],"doi":"10.1088/1741-4326/accbd3"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["rosacea","cosmetics","cosmetology","professional treatment","patient education"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Its symptoms include telangiectasia, persistent erythema, burning/stinging sensation, dry skin sensation, and pruritus. It is characterized by a chronic course with frequent exacerbation. It often coexists with anxiety and depression, reducing the quality of life of affected patients. The etiopathogenesis of rosacea is complex and not fully elucidated; hence, there is no causative effective treatment. In this review, we highlight the role of a cosmetologist in the treatment of rosacea and the maintenance of remission. As part of medical treatment, patients are advised to introduce lifestyle changes and use proper skin care; a cosmetologist can help educate patients affected with rosacea, create effective home care programs for skin care, and support them with treatments in beauty salons. Proper skin care is essential, including the use of dermocosmetics, cleansing of the skin, and frequent visits to beauty salons for tailored apparatus procedures. A cosmetologist is more accessible to patients and can help implement healthy daily habits, including skin care and eating habits, as well as support and mediate good communication between the patient and the patient’s treating physician, thereby improving compliance and ensuring long-term satisfactory outcomes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455917","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"art.115 [10 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/1/115","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e1de4097076263e84da9","name":"Renata","lastName":"Szyguła","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"37b13d7f-dbbc-4120-a031-cb0ef5d02421"},{"objectId":"6630e1de4097076263e84da8","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Dzieńdziora-Urbińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"27d19a11-16d4-4ee4-857b-c88866824cc7"},{"objectId":"6630e1de4097076263e84da7","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Chilicka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8d238965-4d37-4b34-b78f-db4fcd409a77"},{"objectId":"5e709305878c28a0473a141c","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Nowicka","uuid":"E343CD16A53C31EA212834EE3E378BC7F825140B884BB10FFF5E559E915AF83E57B6C3DC9BE41D1675976AE5BCA045C09841F216BE9B794C1DDE7459C64E7BFF","orcidId":"0000-0002-1717-4280","documentHash":"c514b7d5-6e2b-414a-b849-5520baf13f0e"}],"doi":"10.3390/jcm12010115"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["immersive video","multicamera system","extrinsic parameters","multicamera system calibration"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70934f878c28a0473a6f95","634626a97523402e34117690","5e709392878c28a0473ad198","634626a97523402e341175f5","5e7093c1878c28a0473b0345"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"ECPC – versatile multicamera system calibration framework for immersive video applications","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547ea5b","mniswId":"26500","title":"SoftwareX","doi":null,"issn":"2352-7110","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"6635b150-8d6b-4d5b-a00b-9c8a5408a696"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65ead79d409707216ed9b8fe","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["634626a97523402e341175f5","5e70934f878c28a0473a6f95","5e709392878c28a0473ad198","5e7093c1878c28a0473b0345","634626a97523402e34117690","65ead79d409707216ed9b900","65ead79d409707216ed9b901"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Accurate extrinsic parameters calibration is crucial particularly in immersive video, where camera calibration plays a significant role, as its quality is essential for accurate reconstruction and efficient compression of three-dimensional scenes.

The proposed Extrinsic Camera Parameters Calibration (ECPC) software addresses these limitations by proposing an extrinsic parameters estimation method and a framework for testing its accuracy.

The present study evaluated the association between vitamin D concentration and hospitalization and mortality risk in patients with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).\r\nThis study used the COronavirus in LOwer Silesia (COLOS) dataset collected between February 2020 and June 2021. The medical records of 474 patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and whose vitamin D concentration was measured, were analyzed.\r\nWe determined a significant difference in vitamin D concentration between discharged patients and those who died during hospitalization (p = 0.0096). We also found an effect of vitamin D concentration on the risk of death in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19. As vitamin D concentration increased, the odds ratio (OR) for death slightly decreased (OR = 0.978; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.540-0.669). The vitamin D concentration cutoff point was 15.40 ng/ml. In addition, patients with COVID-19 and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations < 30 ng/ml had a lower survival rate than those with serum 25(OH)D ≥ 30 ng/ml (log-rank test p = 0.0018). Moreover, a Cox regression model showed that patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and higher vitamin D concentrations had a 2.8% reduced risk of mortality (hazard ratio HR = 0.972; CI = 0.95-0,99; p = 0.0097).\r\nThe results indicate an association between 25(OH)D levels in patients with COVID-19 and the final course of hospitalization and risk of

phenomena in watercourses and channels pose a threat to flow continuity and hydrotechnical devices. The organoleptic method, relying on human observation, has limitations such as a narrow range, subjective assessment, and high effort, leading to its decline in use. This article presents a number of modern techniques, i.e., the interpretation of RGB images, using unmanned aerial vehicles. Drone imagery offers a bird’s-eye view of areas that would otherwise be difficult to survey. It can improve the detection of frazil ice jams and, thus,\r\ncontribute to the monitoring and spread of frazil ice. The authors performed research in the area of the Wrocław\r\nWater Junction on the Odra River in the area of the inlet near the fish pass at the Opatowice Weir during the flow\r\nof frazil ice on the water surface. To observe the phenomenon, a UAV with an RGB camera was used to record video in an orthogonal perspective in order to reduce geometric distortions of the optical system. The center of the frame was used for the analysis.

The aim of the study was to assess the importance of the measurements of thickness and volume of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) in coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) as a predictive factor of increased stiffness and impaired elasticity of aorta. Methods and materials. The study involved a group of 97 patients (63.48 ± 8.50 years). In accordance with the medians of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) parameters, aortic elasticity and stiffness parameters, patients were divided into subgroups: EAT thickness median 9.40 mm, EAT volume median 61.95 mL, EAT thickness index 5.08 mm/m2 and EAT volume index 34.33 mL/m2. Results. The mean coronary artery calcium score was 162.24 (±317.69). The mean aortic stiffness index was 4.18 (±0.81). The assessed mean aortic elasticity parameters were 3.29% (±2.37) and 0.12 cm2/dyn (±0.09) for strain and distensibility, respectively. A positive linear correlation was observed between EAT parameters and aortic stiffness (0.21), volume (0.51), thickness index (0.24), volume index (0.55) and, for aorta elasticity, a negative linear correlation between the following EAT parameters was observed: thickness (−0.32 and −0.30), volume (−0.49 and −0.48), thickness index (−0.34 and −0.31), volume index (−0.51 and −0.49) and aortic elasticity parameters (aorta strain and aorta distensibility, respectively). Conclusion. The study showed that CCTA illustrates a relationship between the parameters of EAT and an increased stiffness of the aorta, while the most predictive factor of stiffness was the volume index."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455927","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"art.1617 [16 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/11/6/1617","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6672c35c4097074fa1617be0","name":"Małgorzata ","lastName":"Poręba","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"277c4561-87e6-435a-b487-a680110bffba"},{"objectId":"6672c35c4097074fa1617bdf","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Hajdusianek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7592d45a-8af7-4141-aa64-ca3fc2b87ebe"},{"objectId":"5fc53288085dcb1e6ae0ba65","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Żórawik","uuid":"8DA7A90C9C994CF6F410D4B85030D2D4A71847F6A319400E18D8B8B1B7020825A3A484A1FD1A0ADABBEEF42D971A865A1FAB90A9FA84E702FFCD6F871859465A","orcidId":"0000-0002-3378-8987","documentHash":"52645416-a990-45aa-a8c7-69fd60840579"},{"objectId":"5ebee1ac752340254fc43930","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Macek","uuid":"314A9FB02751BBAB0CD42F5395B6404634D0F2E932F9FA9D4574488205F14DFBE8417AA1A0604495577C39BAC01739F132C0C703B851AFE85F60C23BC5571E07","orcidId":"0000-0003-3787-0344","documentHash":"bb21ee56-0a74-481f-b4ce-29b55c0f4159"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b46e7","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Gać","uuid":"7C623C664249C7F2E9429F39BE3807EF40E01176F160F5888C8CC8BEFB4ACD2FB6DFA650BDA38D0E909F5324A3A07444DF6FDA59AF72D13ABA218D98D48509A7","orcidId":"0000-0001-8366-0239","documentHash":"200bcb0c-102d-40bd-a86a-2a309102a1ac"},{"objectId":"5e70930d878c28a0473a1eee","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Poręba","uuid":"FBC0CF8DA48A626576FB4D809D93B3C1E9248B5AB24EF083B41459AD2904FFB64C3CB1937F9511356EF75FB721FCC4473E355D644AFB0EAD5DE1C8F51293A416","orcidId":"0000-0002-7217-7070","documentHash":"04697c74-eed8-42f7-95e1-badd682f02f6"}],"doi":"10.3390/biomedicines11061617"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["miRNA","vitreous","PDR","exosomes"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

We have demonstrated a significant dysregulation in 26 miRNAs. The most remarkable findings include a profound attenuation of the miR-125 family, as well as enhanced miR-21-5p expression in the diabetic samples. We also showed the downregulation of miR-204-5p and the upregulation of let-7g in PDR compared to the controls.

recent years, significant progress has been made in transdermal drug delivery systems, but there is still a search for enhancers that can improve the absorption of active substances through the stratum corneum. Although permeation enhancers have been described in the scientific literature, the use of naturally occurring substances in this role is still of particular interest, because they can offer a high level of safety of use, with a low risk of skin irritation, and high efficiency. In addition, these ingredients are biodegradable, easily available, and widely accepted by consumers due to the growing trust in natural compounds. This article provides information on the role of naturally derived compounds in transdermal drug delivery systems that help them penetrate the skin. The work focuses on the components found in the stratum corneum such as sterols, ceramides, oleic acid, and urea. Penetration enhancers found in nature, mainly in plants, such as terpenes, polysaccharides, and fatty acids have also been described. The mechanism of action of permeation enhancers in the stratum corneum is discussed, and information on the methods of assessing their penetration efficiency is provided.

In connection with it, there have been many changes in our daily lives related to lifestyle, physical activity, or the mental sphere. The aim of the following paper is to determine the correlation between the COVID-19 pandemic and alcohol drinking, smoking, physical exercise, and lifestyle among nursing students in Poland.\r\n\r\nMethods: The study was conducted among nursing students at Wroclaw Medical University before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey consisted of completing the same anonymous online questionnaires five times by the same research group. The majority of respondents were women in the age between 18 and 30 years old and the significance level of data analysis was set at p < 0.05.\r\n\r\nResults and discussion: In October 2020, we recorded a large number of respondents experiencing anxiety/fear or being more stressed. Between the measurements, the highest average level of alcohol addiction (p < 0.001) was in October 2021 (8.71). Moreover, the percentage of respondents who felt as before increased (p = 0.021). As the pandemic continued, there was a systematic decline in the physical activity level (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic had a serious impact on the daily lives of the students."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455937","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"art.1249509 [13 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1249509","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e4d94097076263e8771e","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Adamczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5213e218-0767-4ede-8b64-a296fd89d667"},{"objectId":"6630e4d94097076263e8771d","name":"Zofia","lastName":"Kuźnik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"62376225-91ac-4db5-be33-102aca303f68"},{"objectId":"6630e4d94097076263e8771c","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Krysiński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"07f5f53e-4285-462e-84c5-b42d67fc7509"},{"objectId":"6630e4d94097076263e8771b","name":"Michał","lastName":"Wysocki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"061dae81-2637-4cfb-9466-4e059955c0b0"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a12eb","name":"Aureliusz","lastName":"Kosendiak","uuid":"F4276692E357AF65B6AB175E7BEF615C4BD13AE9528E2033CB112A79510D71088EC19BE5CF7808F2DE78A3C7C3C8AF85DAA9B38FBA6413FF1338FE15242AF9A8","orcidId":"0000-0003-2075-5438","documentHash":"e187b212-846d-4619-8e66-4df7f17f914c"}],"doi":"10.3389/fpubh.2023.1249509"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Hydrothermal carbonization","Torrefaction","Pyrolysis","Thermochemical","valorization","Feedstock","Sewage sludge"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Dioxins and furans in biochars, hydrochars and torreficates produced by thermochemical conversion of biomass: a review","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477af4","mniswId":"5801","title":"Environmental Chemistry Letters","doi":null,"issn":"1610-3653","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"83a597bb-27fa-46d7-ac77-d6f13b9811fd"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-21","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eef8364097076263b980ef","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["634a1b297523402e34127284","5e7091fc878c28a04738e2c9","65eef8364097076263b980f0"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Converting raw biomass into valuable products protects the environment, improves economics, and helps tackle climate change by cutting resource demand and waste production. Thermochemical treatment is a common method for producing biochars, hydrochars and torreficates from biomass and organic wastes, which can also generate dioxins and furans and consequently limit the use of thermochemically converted chars. Here we review the presence of dioxins and furans in chars produced by hydrothermal carbonization, torrefaction, and pyrolysis processes under the influence of temperature, residence time, heating rate, pressure, and feedstock type. Dioxins and furans were mostly below 20 ng total toxic equivalence per kilogram (TEQ kg−1), with the highest level of 113 ng TEQ kg−1 found in over 100 samples of different char types. The most toxic products were hydrochars produced from sewage sludge. Processing temperature and feedstock type were key factors resulting in high dioxin levels in chars, and care should be taken when producing chars at temperatures up to 300 °C or using feedstocks previously contaminated with dioxins or preservatives."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455939","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"21","pagesFromTo":"2225–2249","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10311-023-01600-7","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eef8364097076263b980f0","name":"Karel","lastName":"Soukup","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1b991b83-66d6-4fd9-9861-64c01d7e0194"},{"objectId":"634a1b297523402e34127284","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Sobol","uuid":"1B126E6CEBBF4A38097C6728597F44F1983BEDC25D352257D130192BE9285D17D9CAE30078C34867F2C3232301D23766727D3ED24DD9F30DF93BD68A4EECAFCC","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a00fc696-6f23-4b8d-bf86-89c5a1d3220a"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e2c9","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Dyjakon","uuid":"F74BAF8F6279A46A527E44C36DCBC5DB8339885230FBAC88875230CADF86137D39B3E09B2164BA20982EF696F9BB3739975CA2C017923A431DEF31419FB263BD","orcidId":"0000-0003-3618-2099","documentHash":"4fbd2733-ee85-4519-9736-048644e8527d"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10311-023-01600-7"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63eb61984097076b4a88ec55","doi":null,"title":"Status ustrojowy prokuratury oraz status prawny prokuratora we współczesnych państwach w kontekście zapobiegania przestępczości, jej przyczynom i uwarunkowaniom na tle prawnoporównaczym, t.

Although research on black carbon (BC) has not yet reached the official acceptable levels and guidelines, the World Health Organization clearly indicates the need to measure and control the level of this pollutant. In Poland, monitoring of the level of BC concentration is not included in the air quality monitoring network. To estimate the extent of this pollutant to which pedestrians and cyclists are exposed, mobile measurements were carried out on over 26 km of bicycle paths in Wrocław. The obtained results indicate the influence of urban greenery next to the bicycle path (especially if the cyclist is separated from the street lane by hedges or other tall plants) and the ‘breathability’ (i.e., associated with surrounding infrastructure) of the area on the obtained concentrations; the average concentration of BC in such places ranged from 1.3 to 2.2 μg/m3, whereas a cyclist riding directly on bike paths adjacent to the main roads in the city center is exposed to concentrations in the range of 2.3–14 μg/m3. The results of the measurements, also related to stationary measurements made at a selected point of one of the routes, clearly indicate the importance of the infrastructure surrounding the bicycle paths, their location, and the impact of urban traffic on the obtained BC concentrations. The results presented in our study are based only on short-term-field campaigns preliminary studies. To determine the quantitative impact of the characteristics of the bicycle route on the concentration of pollutants, and thus the exposure of users, the systematized research should cover a greater part of the city and be representative in terms of various hours of the day."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455944","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"337","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479723004826?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e9696240970762631a17fb","name":"Jelle","lastName":"Hofman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bcc01570-c90f-46bd-a11e-a86a6942382a"},{"objectId":"65e9696240970762631a17fa","name":"Jan","lastName":"Peters","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f139489a-a8a5-491c-88b7-55305c671992"},{"objectId":"65e9696240970762631a17f9","name":"Martine","lastName":"Van Poppel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4d8e8907-5177-43fd-8ee2-98325cfed87c"},{"objectId":"602f85bb9543c7410626f588","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Turek","uuid":"87F6E990E0889C3BE0E32B1A914E6622759BED60659195EC5FA0164B613E60888134A09C5952CB7E7C3D13A82B9529DE2B72B4EFEE121A48FEC9F3619A6A37FB","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d08b2f1f-541c-41f0-9e4f-7fef6b7122d6"},{"objectId":"5e709276878c28a04739610d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Kazak","uuid":"8BF592A9A46196A6F935B2BB31A500677E92CBD86B861922FB7AA22FB29395D1B64F43036B95965A8EC6195E7801C90063119847146D4F8539B9BD9881551DE0","orcidId":"0000-0002-1864-9954","documentHash":"9f3029ac-7cd5-4671-b3f2-c824c0d58001"},{"objectId":"5e70926c878c28a04739561b","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kamińska","uuid":"5A70E258F9F5FA2B07F93EA9475B02767969BC89ECF6A6D78157072CF98164274312F7EAEC7474D1A92BE64A78C556F34A874AB247652C65DF10C254537347FD","orcidId":"0000-0002-0157-516X","documentHash":"2af9ad30-5d34-4eca-b8c6-bc228fa35bd1"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.117694"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hypodermoclysis","primary health care","palliative care"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Subcutaneous drug supply in the practice of a primary care physician - a literature review","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479e24","mniswId":"6513","title":"Family Medicine and Primary Care Review","doi":null,"issn":"1734-3402","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ea93be0e-94a2-4830-be2f-05373744acf0"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_SA","releaseDate":"2023-12-27","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65df691d40970762632ad1e0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67505286fdbe835717934127","5e7092df878c28a04739e90c","67505286fdbe835717934128"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Subcutaneous administration of drugs can be an important element of a patient’s home therapy with proper treatment initiation and continuation rules. Caring for a dying patient requires an interdisciplinary approach and extensive cooperation between many specialists, including palliative care specialists and primary care physicians. The possibility of treating patients from special risk groups (patients requiring palliative care, elderly patients, debilitated patients) and a wide range of drugs which can be safely prescribed make this method appropriate for use in family practice. The most commonly used medications for symptom control in patients at home can be safely used through this method. There are limitations and even contraindications in the use of high-density and osmolarity drugs, as well as drugs used in chemotherapy. The use of drugs in subcutaneous supply may constitute a smooth transition from the currently used treatment (change of the form of drug administration) or allows for the introduction of new drugs for treatment. It should be noted that for some of the drugs, subcutaneous supply is a supply beyond registration. The most commonly used and recommended puncture at present is a synthetic intravenous puncture of the cannula type. In order to implement subcutaneous supply, it is necessary to know the rules of this form of treatment and their limitations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455945","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"25","pagesFromTo":"449-454","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/Subcutaneous-drug-supply-in-the-practice-r-nof-a-primary-care-physician-a-literature-review,95,51736,0,1.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67505286fdbe835717934128","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Mastalerz-Migas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1978c28e-604e-44d9-8be2-5d2207015409"},{"objectId":"67505286fdbe835717934127","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Biesiada","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a986dc68-e779-4891-b883-0225a52f114c"},{"objectId":"5e7092df878c28a04739e90c","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Ciałkowska-Rysz","uuid":"15D6089E6E1ED77554AF3E32C3B45A3034EDE2897232E49E75AAEF2CB6EA0A50B9C1E99E30BB122D623D3CE2DC23468627B9CF93501FA5AD3D9B32119C9601B1","orcidId":"0000-0002-6910-8429","documentHash":"b0438c8d-8645-47d8-a7cb-248a2e6edef1"}],"doi":"10.5114/fmpcr.2023.132619"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ANFIS","ANN","Aquaculture","Electrocoagulation","Flocculation","Genetic algorithm","RSM"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Modelling and optimisation of electrocoagulation/flocculation recovery of effluent from land-based aquaculture by artificial intelligence (AI) approaches","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b16","mniswId":"5845","title":"Environmental Science and Pollution Research","doi":null,"issn":"0944-1344","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"80fb5f49-d17d-4c94-ae09-f813bb7059c2"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eef8234097076263b98080","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65eef8234097076263b98081","65eef8234097076263b98082","65eef8234097076263b98083","65eef8234097076263b98084","65eef8234097076263b98085","65eef8234097076263b98086","5e70921c878c28a0473900b8"]},"issue":"27","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study examined the modelling and optimisation of the electrocoagulation-flocculation (ECF) recovery of aquaculture effluent (AQE) using aluminium electrodes. The response surface methodology (RSM), artificial neural network (ANN), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) were used for the modelling, while the optimisation tools were the numerical RSM and genetic algorithm (GA). Furthermore, the kinetics of the ECF process was studied to provide insight into the mechanism governing the ECF of AQE. The experimental design was performed using the central composite design (CCD) of the RSM. The ANFIS modelling was accomplished via the Grid Partition (GP) of the data set, while the ANN used the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based feed-forward system. Statistically, the prediction accuracy of the models followed the order: ANFIS (R2: 0.9990), ANN (R2: 0.9807), and RSM (R2: 0.9790). The process optimisation gave optimal turbidity (TD) removal efficiencies of 98.98, 97.81, and 96.01% for ANFIS-GA, ANN-GA, and RSM optimisation techniques, respectively. The ANFIS-GA gave the best optimization result at optimum conditions of pH 4, current intensity (3 A), electrolysis time (7.2 min), settling time (23 min), and temperature (43.8 °C). In the kinetics study, the experimental data was analysed using pseudo-first-order (0.8787), pseudo-second-order (0.9395), and Elovich (R2: 0.9979) kinetic models; the Elovich model gave the best correlation with the experimental data showing that the process is governed by electrostatic interaction mechanism. This study effectively demonstrated that ECF recovery of AQE can effectively be modelled using RSM, ANN, and ANFIS and be optimised using RSM, ANN-GA, and ANFIS-GA techniques, and the order of performance is ANFIS > ANN > RSM and ANFIS-GA > ANN-GA > RSM, respectively."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455947","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"30","pagesFromTo":"70897-70917","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-023-27387-2","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eef8234097076263b98086","name":"Joseph Tagbo","lastName":"Nwabanne","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a2849d2c-8b2d-41d5-b68f-ddb0447f64f0"},{"objectId":"65eef8234097076263b98085","name":"Okechukwu Dominic","lastName":"Onukwuli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f27cd1d6-f3b0-4c1d-86c9-b9e90af02561"},{"objectId":"65eef8234097076263b98084","name":"Shabnam","lastName":"Ahmadi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"251a5a9a-93eb-4617-953f-a140bdf6a7b6"},{"objectId":"65eef8234097076263b98083","name":"Paschal Enyinnaya","lastName":"Ohale","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"57aaef53-8985-4cec-b134-28e63624b649"},{"objectId":"65eef8234097076263b98082","name":"Christopher Chiedozie","lastName":"Obi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ca1264cc-f68a-4a0a-aebb-1a37e2322b04"},{"objectId":"65eef8234097076263b98081","name":"Chinenye Adaobi","lastName":"Igwegbe","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"38bc00a6-dc27-4b68-b881-ea3c815ff4cf"},{"objectId":"5e70921c878c28a0473900b8","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Białowiec","uuid":"BDF818D6D6BB69D5CB05F525C0A728054D812F8C0CBC79878F9420A7D0179A7016B66891425C5163C20A634E1DFADC9AE9B75400AF4ECBB91B18B2827927D69A","orcidId":"0000-0002-5871-2129","documentHash":"81d1531c-2c4b-477c-b00c-645c599311ea"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11356-023-27387-2"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["kidney graft","hypothermic machine perfusion","MitoQ","ischemia–reperfusion injury","oxidative stress"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

In particular, kidneys donated from patients after cardiac arrest (DCD) are classified as more vulnerable to ischemia–reperfusion injury (IRI). Hypothermic machine perfusion is proposed as a solution for better kidney storage before transplantation, and it is a good platform for additional graft treatment. Antioxidants have gained interest in regenerative medicine due to their ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), which play a key role in IRI. We evaluated the effect of Mitoquinone (MitoQ), a strong mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, administered directly to the perfusing buffer. Rat kidneys were isolated, randomly classified into one of the following groups, donation after brainstem death (DBD), DCD, and DCD with MitoQ, and perfused for 22 hours with a hypothermic machine perfusion system. Subsequently, we detected levels of kidney injury (KIM-1) and oxidative stress (ROS/RNS, cytochrome C oxidase, and mitochondrial integrity) markers. We compared the activation of the apoptosis pathway (caspase 3 and 9), the concentration of phosphorylated Akt (pAkt), and the pAkt/total Akt ratio. MitoQ reduces KIM-1 concentration, total ROS/RNS, and the level of caspases. We observed a decrease in pAkt and the pAkt/total Akt ratio after drug administration. The length of warm ischemia time negatively impacts the graft condition. However, MitoQ added to the perfusing system as an ‘on pump’ therapy mitigates injury to the kidney before transplantation by inhibiting apoptosis and reducing ROS/RNS levels. We propose MitoQ as a potential drug for DCD graft preconditioning."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455949","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"art.14772 [14 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/19/14772","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5fc4c148085dcb1e6ae0b8e3","name":"Anna","lastName":"Radajewska","uuid":"EF8151305BE9B1DB9E0A70A130716A1BBA616A67355057C7F3E19D2823631207D8D36905CB495A2CB945A83EE5288A22D3EB8B8A772F28096565B8CED8F29B1B","orcidId":"0000-0003-1639-3155","documentHash":"2073a152-dc24-45d0-89bf-5fb02f7524de"},{"objectId":"5f9da73e085dcb3b6122becb","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Szyller","uuid":"C4FCDDE24C88B8DFE69BFEFC48E222C4AB596D2596268D482FCEFF5578BEA2F0B681052360598E37BA8DB67FCC201C782CACC8FEBC585D07CCBF741B3F5DC56E","orcidId":"0000-0002-1320-4112","documentHash":"a61bd300-069c-4f13-b95e-68da3492e25b"},{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b79d1","name":"Anna","lastName":"Krzywonos-Zawadzka","uuid":"A21FD059C590D3281074C505FE01EE8F01240EE8B87C70617116615135538301A7F7F7195E841C4F238E0B5909E1A3FE9B13E76D89D925448D6697222FDC530E","orcidId":"0000-0003-3534-7306","documentHash":"841e4e8e-13c6-4b2e-8c4a-742e9c9455aa"},{"objectId":"5e709306878c28a0473a146e","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Sawicki","uuid":"7CA9F91D732742F470BC7F4926050EB4CFEE4FEC624E7DC84B7B67EB693C18C9D5ED1B2D5B5B0228B3B9D3AEDDCC902620FEBC8DC5C6C4B3E4EDABFC94066C92","orcidId":"0000-0003-1596-2133","documentHash":"fef40619-7fe4-467b-9118-2bae6bd270b9"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a137c","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Bil-Lula","uuid":"D66A1DB032713BFB138728227FA9E8FE4C5B2992F21133631980E51990ACC2AAAAC7BEF4006CB53C610BD6C8FF7D90ADF5BA936805820BCC3C4F06C6F38BF309","orcidId":"0000-0002-2769-0166","documentHash":"2d2a9fc6-e38e-4934-8c67-e06dbf177428"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a11a3","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Olejnik","uuid":"BCC47ECF3ACA97ED7B83171689560CCB7009E4C7DCD539AA1D5448E99CA47D10606E64E270A4E46D28995E615A9328CEBF8D05FE6BCAC4F3A306BB4B2AB3D4FF","orcidId":"0000-0001-5130-7609","documentHash":"68c0ad03-3028-43ca-abb8-962f9ef71bf7"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms241914772"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","uid":"bt6mbuLY9Vpc_KWGkV1Lk4w","uuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b6878c28a0473af960","65eeeef04097076263b961b3","65eeeef04097076263b961b2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Zmiana zagęszczenia populacji łosia na terenach leśnych Regionalnej Dyrekcji Lasów Państwowych w Lublinie w latach 2013-2021","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"64f04bfacf9a7471b0ea410c","mniswId":"201569","title":"Journal of Life and Medical Sciences","doi":null,"issn":"2353-1371","eissn":"2720-6823","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"MINISTRY","editor":null,"documentHash":"21c2187b-93ae-4a83-9161-57f364186a28"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2024-01-26","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eeeef04097076263b961b1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65eeeef04097076263b961b2","65eeeef04097076263b961b3","5e7093b6878c28a0473af960"]},"issue":"2 (36)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Łoś euroazjatycki (\r\nAlces alces L.) jest największym zwierzęciem roślinożernym w lasach.\r\nGatunek zasiedla głównie wschodnią i centralną część kraju.

The species\r\noccurs mainly the eastern and central parts of the country. In 2001, the Minister of the Envi-\r\nronment decided to impose a moratorium on this species throughout Poland, which resulted in\r\nan increase in the population of this species. The aim of the study was to analyze the size of\r\nthe moose population in the years 2013-2021 in the Regional Directorate of State Forests in\r\nLublinThe amount of damage caused by moose and the costs incurred by the RDLP Lublin for\r\nprotecting the forest against animals were also determined. The data was obtained from the State\r\nForests Information System (SILP).\r\nIn the analyzed years, the number of moose occuring the forest areas of the RDLP Lublin\r\nincreased from 2,414 to 6,119 art. A particularly high number of moose inhabits the northern\r\nand central parts of the directorate, where in 2021 the feeding ground capacity was exceeded 5-6\r\ntimes. In the years 2013-21, the damaged area caused by moses amounted to an average of 1,175\r\nha per year. The analysis showed a significant increase in the forest districts expenses to protect\r\nthe forest against animals. In 2013, the costs incurred by the Lublin RDLP forest districts to\r\nprotect the forest against animals amounted to 4 634 12,81 PLN, and by 2021 they increased to\r\n9,347,310.72. Spearman’s correlation coefficient, between the number of moose and the costs of\r\nforest protection, was 0.87 and was statistically significant. Whereas no significant relationship\r\nbetween the damage and the number of moose and the costs of forest protection was obtained.\r\nConcluding, the increasing number of moose does not significantly increase the area of dam-\r\nage in the forests, but it results in a significant increase in the costs incurred by forest districts\r\nfor protecting the forest against animals. The increasing number of moose not only affects on the\r\nforest management, by increasing the costs of forest protection, but also increases the number of\r\nroad and rail collisions. Restoring management of moose population by hunting clubs is one of\r\nthe options that can limit the increase in moose numbers."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455951","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"23-31","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.naukowcy.org.pl/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/3.-Zmiana-zageszczenia-populacji-losia.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eeeef04097076263b961b3","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a1e81eb7-8b35-4ec9-aac6-22ccf914adf0"},{"objectId":"65eeeef04097076263b961b2","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Ciećko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f1aa4295-5e60-4dab-af53-ac732e5a881a"},{"objectId":"5e7093b6878c28a0473af960","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Masternak","uuid":"5F927114FC9D25D036F1F6AFA3EAEA5D145A7974276E7D697C729263A1402D208F5A93FFCD13DED439C53A2828E9127B5994AC4F4F267D207CD2ED983925C18F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6883-7526","documentHash":"e2239d5c-e0f7-47f4-82a6-e7d9a3dc4c5e"}],"doi":"10.5281/zenodo.10607796"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sustainable development","urban environment","city ranking"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Environmental sustainability assessment of the European Union’s capital cities","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","doi":null,"issn":"1661-7827","eissn":"1660-4601","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e236e16e-7430-4ac3-800c-033637860e22"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-04","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e978e540970762631b3401","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c1878c28a04739c25d","5e7092bd878c28a04739bd5a","65e978e540970762631b3402"]},"issue":"7","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The growing flow of people into cities causes several challenges for their functioning.

Therefore, the state of the environment in cities should be monitored systematically. The research aim of this article is to evaluate the level of environmental sustainability in capitals of European Union countries. A synthetic indicator was made up of diagnostic variables, using quantitative and qualitative indicators relating to the quality of the environment. Based on the ranking, results reveal that Europe is spatially divided according to the level of environmental quality. The best results were achieved by capital cities of the northern European countries. The analysis presented here has some application potential. It can serve to identify challenges to improving the quality of the environment, and to raise public awareness of the importance of changing individual behaviour (e.g., use of public transport)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455952","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/7/4327","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e978e540970762631b3402","name":"Vojtěch","lastName":"Bartoš","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bc368a9e-7375-4937-b71c-e66b7c6c1e01"},{"objectId":"5e7092c1878c28a04739c25d","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Czupich","uuid":"8907A9238A9B6816B923BFAE3B8105C5AF9D0C79A681935BAB6351D905E23F2A5C35453D979BA49ED8674B5BFC33BFE82EE103FEA5329EC8248AD9E08EEB1052","orcidId":"0000-0001-8009-9992","documentHash":"888c1c38-ad7e-4825-ac4e-ac80134da48e"},{"objectId":"5e7092bd878c28a04739bd5a","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Łapińska","uuid":"6FBE208C362BB53C7672994ADB4F63F555A5008FAE4E4C336285F5D806E859F6FDDD07DBC1470C914A565747B68501D05E0E612A240469630EC9F1821AAE4A83","orcidId":"0000-0003-4134-4750","documentHash":"e01451bb-45ed-4d4b-9780-25c69941094f"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19074327"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Lymph nodes","Lymphadenectomy","Oncologic staging","Upper tract urothelial carcinoma","Urologic malignancies"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

While 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography (18FDG-PET/CT) shows promise for preoperative LNM detection, its specificity is low. Alternative methods such as choline PET/CT and sentinel lymph node detection are under consideration but require further investigation. Additionally, various preoperative factors associated with LNM hold potential for predicting nodal involvement, thereby improving nodal staging and oncologic outcomes of LND. Several surgical approaches, including segmental ureterectomy and robot-assisted nephroureterectomy, provide a possibility for LND, while minimizing morbidity. LND remains the primary nodal staging tool for UTUC, but its therapeutic benefit is still uncertain. Advances in imaging techniques and preoperative risk assessment show promise in improving LNM detection. Further research and multi-center studies are needed to comprehensively assess the advantages and limitations of LND in UTUC, as well as the long-term outcomes of alternative staging and treatment strategies.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455954","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"25","pagesFromTo":"1327-1344","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11912-023-01460-y","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e4894097076263e86e8d","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Brawańska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"83c6a4cb-1e95-4580-8cad-e756d9fe0d62"},{"objectId":"6630e4894097076263e86e8c","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Tomecka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2f1540c2-6c01-48bd-9667-ed80daa5a6d4"},{"objectId":"6630e4894097076263e86e8b","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Logoń","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"602c0578-f5b3-448d-90ad-ec3c80572162"},{"objectId":"6630e4894097076263e86e8a","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Karwacki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"39367012-9325-4bec-8331-9ace20ece86e"},{"objectId":"6630e4894097076263e86e89","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Dłubak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f678469a-185e-4911-9d23-2e92bd08dbb0"},{"objectId":"5e7093c1878c28a0473b02ba","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Małkiewicz","uuid":"F4F3E50567BC2918C95A8C6D9D2E0FB55A1C1642BE39F3B84F019A6AF650D97200382A3690626C7291B64FE946D54289F84673ECFDCACBC2E2EBA259C1F4A202","orcidId":"0000-0002-5933-3753","documentHash":"f3a194e9-5a15-4a20-80ed-07281ad5d4b4"},{"objectId":"5e709368878c28a0473a8eee","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Krajewski","uuid":"FE9C4D23724D3D055D045282F9AD75FAB018A19DA85AE822459B00807DB4C4694A93AFC06467CDCBCF4A964D57A95272B7F072D375AB7EFF177F7F6C2609DCD0","orcidId":"0000-0003-1727-2283","documentHash":"98c9e9c8-1a51-4d6a-b2af-f010aba6a0be"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1281","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Szydełko","uuid":"7DC38A63B4768AA5E153EF9E43D83AD135C49EC1F047EE18E5E98A81D52C20CE98D6BFDA8C262F9D622813C1C7EED898220A725F7398D2B73C322DF23A1ADC67","orcidId":"0000-0002-1360-0422","documentHash":"79ceced2-248c-4140-91ee-6f1c07dc3ed3"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11912-023-01460-y"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CEFR","transdisciplinary perspective","socio-cognitive approach"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Common European Framework of Reference : transcending perspectives","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b121","mniswId":"14508","title":"Moderna Sprak","doi":null,"issn":"0026-8577","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"20f873b0-86bb-4104-87a1-d6ba0351ffa5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9a92e40970762631fba6f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709245878c28a047392d5a","5e7092c3878c28a04739c37c","5e7092bc878c28a04739bd20"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Stressing a balanced and constrained interplay between the individual and the collective and tending towards transdisciplinarity as a consequence, a socio-cognitive perspective prevails in second language acquisition research (Larsen-Freeman 2018). Advancing several theories, including the task-based approach, the ecological approach as well as sociocultural and socio-constructivist theories, the latest version of the CEFR (Council of Europe 2020) has adopted a transdisciplinary perspective. However, the nature of the transdisciplinary approach declared by the Framework (Council of Europe 2020) remains an empirical question. Thus, the present paper explores the extent to which the CEFR (Council of Europe 2020) abides by the principles of a motivated socio-cognitive perspective. The structure of the paper is the following. First, it outlines a transdisciplinary approach to second language development basing on cognitive linguistics, intercultural pragmatics and elements of the teaching learning process. Then, this socio-cognitive approach is sought in the CEFR (Council of Europe 2020). The analysis of the document demonstrates that the social and the individual perspective are symmetrical but not fully integrated, i.e. there is no common denominator linking the two approaches."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455956","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"116","pagesFromTo":"1-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ojs.ub.gu.se/index.php/modernasprak/article/view/5121","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092c3878c28a04739c37c","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Piątkowska","uuid":"5E652343852D93A21C63A85B1713A8F4B20BB0BDEA163A339F34A04EB919D3FFAF97992C5CED363531C33F2F77BBD5B55E23B36AFF0748ECF107CC2A57B0D3BF","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"721d4ac3-23b0-4626-9a56-223dc5c5db79"},{"objectId":"5e7092bc878c28a04739bd20","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Kościałkowska-Okońska","uuid":"8B89B7B0F55E0041F6F8A4AC035A13679A7EE0F9CE411E0A88C3DDE9C0E23BFE6BE49538F8520B97439FFE803F056C7149AD91C8E371F4874A5D1536134CC383","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b236935b-d52e-43fc-8737-4cca5fae865a"},{"objectId":"5e709245878c28a047392d5a","name":"Ariadna","lastName":"Strugielska","uuid":"1A5DF0B81D97AF9B3D6A42BF0DCE6778E2B15A6B462CC071EE4B4EAA4FBDC0CA9A020FD812DD92ED083B895ACCCFAA6EF4595CD10734DEFD7518F327B05DA3BC","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e7e6fdcf-b8fc-4d75-bd46-c1ec636f824b"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["geoparks","remote sensing","geotourism","geosite documentation","Roztocze region","Polish–Ukrainian borderland","sustainable tourism","geoheritage"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918e878c28a04737e44c","uid":"bOsTJEvmlvq1TPV2NgBPXuw","uuid":"75fdfd10-8c3b-4407-8102-72c611142d0e","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Nauk o Ziemi i Gospodarki Przestrzennej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f8878c28a0473a0433","5e7092f8878c28a0473a0435","5e7092f8878c28a0473a0432"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"How to Create Geocultural Site's Content-Huta Różaniecka Case Study (SE Poland)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","doi":null,"issn":"2071-1050","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"76492123-acbe-4743-a4ae-6a63f3108e24"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9d04f409707132d37cd37","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f8878c28a0473a0435","5e7092f8878c28a0473a0432","5e7092f8878c28a0473a0433"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study concerns the design of a geocultural site in Huta Różaniecka. It is one of 166 sites prepared for the Kamienny Las na Roztoczu (Roztocze Stone Forest) Geopark project. The site is distinguished, on the one hand, by its interesting geology and geomorphology (exposures of Miocene sea shore with numerous fossils) and, on the other hand, by its quarries, stonemasonry traditions, and buildings (ruins of the Greek Catholic church). The aim of this paper is to present a model for building specialized documentation using a wide range of source materials, methods (field inventory, queries, interviews, high-precision Light Detection and Ranging-LiDAR measurements), tools (Leica ScanStation C10 laser scanner), and techniques (photography, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-UAV, Terrestrial Laser Scanning-TLS). The applied research procedure model led to the construction of specialized documentation relating to the spatial dimension, natural features, and cultural context of the site. Taking into account the collected data, it should be concluded that the projected geocultural site at Huta Różaniecka, irrespective of the creation of a geopark, has great potential to build a tourist product that is attractive to a wide range of visitors."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455957","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"1-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/5/2193","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092f8878c28a0473a0435","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Skowronek","uuid":"1CF33C262D491A9CC2B0E86D78FAF7B0854C0FE5FEB6145B17422BB73B60C790EA450B3F607367F90961D41CEABF36BFE69D2F489540F26EFB96B332D0626BA0","orcidId":"0000-0002-2809-9714","documentHash":"bcb667e9-0ed3-4164-93cc-f3db63b75403"},{"objectId":"5e7092f8878c28a0473a0433","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Kociuba","uuid":"4B765971BC887B7CD376797FD6A151F430093B285485FF09ADC716E5BAF267D475C084AFEC037A0A1DAF3210905178A6FDE501EBAA5F61057EC0837EEE1C00A0","orcidId":"0000-0002-6535-2387","documentHash":"efc07ec6-1593-4e77-bdda-085a6d042297"},{"objectId":"5e7092f8878c28a0473a0432","name":"Teresa","lastName":"Brzezińska-Wójcik","uuid":"DBFA3D676D6414BEC75EC346217D5E2B081EE62AFDE93783288E5FC8EDE3D91F98BF345EF1E7325E19563461E80AA1A9F879B2524AA6E5FA5F90E78433FE84C9","orcidId":"0000-0002-3279-8673","documentHash":"7bb1e747-3c4f-4c2f-9fa6-67ba0325786c"}],"doi":"10.3390/su16052193"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Ograniczona racjonalność","Sprzedaż oparta na wartości","Podejmowanie decyzji","Zarządzanie kryzysowe","Przegląd literatury","eksploracja tekstu AI"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Bounded Rationality","Value-Based Selling","Decision-Making","Crisis Management","Literature Review","AI Text-mining"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The CRisis-OPportunity (CROP) framework: Finding Metavalue in Organizational Suboptimal Decisions through an AI Text Mining Process","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"65e986eb40970762631d535a","mniswId":null,"title":"Filosofi(e)Semiotiche","doi":null,"issn":"2531-9434","eissn":null,"websiteLink":"https://www.ilsileno.it/filosofiesemiotiche/","metadataSource":"USER","editor":null,"documentHash":"b22c6160-6b34-4f94-bb24-b5743f4fcbdf"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-09-05","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e986eb40970762631d5359","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65e986eb40970762631d535c","65e986eb40970762631d535d","5e709250878c28a04739396a","65e986eb40970762631d535e"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This research paper explores the concept of bounded rationality, initially introduced by Herbert\r\nSimon in 1957, in the context of organizational decision-making in turbulent environments. It\r\nquestions whether organizations, similar to individuals, operate under bounded rationality when\r\nfacing challenging circumstances. Through an in-depth analysis, this research sheds light on the\r\napplicability of bounded rationality to organizations and examines how AI technologies can\r\nenhance decision-making capabilities and resilience in the face of uncertainty. By integrating\r\nBounded Rationality with Value-Based Selling, a novel communication framework called CRisisOPportunity (CROP) is introduced, leveraging AI text mining techniques to gather and analyze\r\nlarge amounts of data. The CROP framework demonstrates a strategic approach to assist\r\norganizations in finding a new organizational value (called metavalue) in comparison to\r\ninformation extracted from our systematic AI-based literature review. Research results from the\r\npaper’s systematic literature review are limited to the period from 2020 to 2022. The paper follows\r\na structured approach to explore the interconnectedness between Bounded Rationality and ValueBased Selling, and to introduce the CROP framework. It presents a roadmap for uncovering\r\norganizational metavalue through the application of the CROP framework. This research\r\ncontributes to the understanding of decision-making processes and offers insights for decisionmakers and practitioners seeking to navigate turbulent times successfully by harnessing the power\r\nof bounded rationality and AI-driven communication strategies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455963","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"49-88","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.ilsileno.it/filosofiesemiotiche/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/5-Stavros.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e986eb40970762631d535e","name":"Marina","lastName":"Kostic","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bb1dbe95-30ca-4c98-a813-70a10c7dc072"},{"objectId":"65e986eb40970762631d535d","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kwiatek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"174b44ce-4cc0-4a4c-b1ba-287f31442b9e"},{"objectId":"65e986eb40970762631d535c","name":"Stavros","lastName":"Papakonstantinidis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8077e57d-34bc-4124-927a-33d20190ebda"},{"objectId":"5e709250878c28a04739396a","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Zapłata","uuid":"31823E0A0FD287667190C50699377F2DB86DE04DBBC0AAFBA66D78B005EFE7DF7DEA636B8C6FC06F542F01CB7F996910AC5C62888D8FA6D5EBAB13C34D4EC4FB","orcidId":"0000-0001-6134-9765","documentHash":"d4c252b2-7442-42e6-8c9f-3822067c55eb"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df13","uid":"bKtjZT6qPD3d_ou1lCI-Heg","uuid":"64e6c5a1-1be6-4917-9d49-9dec59ed1713","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Nauk Politycznych i Studiów Międzynarodowych","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709355878c28a0473a77e7"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet Warszawski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709355878c28a0473a77e7"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"REACHING RETIREMENT AGE BY OLDER PERSONS.

Quenching and annealing processes were modeled as pre-heat treatment modes. The radial-shear rolling stage consisted of three passes with a compression of 3 mm per pass. The variable parameters were the roll rotation speed (40 rpm, 70 rpm and 100 rpm) and the workpiece heating temperature before rolling (20°C and 200°C). It was found that the most effective mode of pre-heat treatment for M1 copper alloy is quenching at 700°C. The most rational value of the workpiece heating temperature before rolling is 20°C, since in this case, at all selected speeds, the recrystallization process does not start, which contributes to intensive grinding of grain in the surface layers and on the periphery. An increase in the roll rotation speed causes additional deformation heating, which contributes to the recrystallization and suppression of intensive grain grinding. Therefore, when heating the M1 copper alloy to 200°C, it is not recommended to increase the rolling speed above the nominal."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059455966","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.58","pagesFromTo":"1163-1170","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journal.uctm.edu/node/j2023-6/JCTM_2023_58_21_23-58_pp1163-1170.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eef7a140970749973fb2f4","name":"Aibol","lastName":"ESBOLAT","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"23cda5d1-1eb2-4d94-bc2d-04ae56279dde"},{"objectId":"65eef7a140970749973fb2f3","name":"Andrey","lastName":"TOLKUSHKIN","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1d85416f-7405-437e-8c3f-ae422df9e054"},{"objectId":"65eef7a140970749973fb2f2","name":"Alexandr","lastName":"ARBUZ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e6e4ea36-bf63-4519-93cb-93aa47259e04"},{"objectId":"65eef7a140970749973fb2f1","name":"Sergey","lastName":"LEZHNEV","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f81b8b32-f54d-4f08-8748-39b3b2ca9514"},{"objectId":"65eef7a140970749973fb2f0","name":"Evgeniy","lastName":"PANIN","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5bd80f5f-5f3c-4092-9e69-3964bb2bf63f"},{"objectId":"65eef7a140970749973fb2ef","name":"Abdrakhman","lastName":"NAIZABEKOV","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"52dce23a-eee6-44b1-b923-cf58f83c6052"},{"objectId":"5e709202878c28a04738e85c","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Knapiński","uuid":"6C442538E78F71B44C4B0C1BF3B6ADCBBA7AC8D75A84A2AE673E5EB3BD213B69E3333CCCF630BE58333EAB18F33989F94449C7BE49C5F46A844EBE3C6563480D","orcidId":"0000-0001-8817-2250","documentHash":"fde7183c-ac99-4165-a947-d42beef32837"}],"doi":null}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA1OTQ1NTk2Ng=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
