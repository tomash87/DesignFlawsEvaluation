It has proven to be a successful and renowned strategy throughout the entire spectrum of the education industry. It has dissolved the distinction between physical and virtual distance and integrated more scientific methods for instructors to teach pupils. In order to select the most relevant studies in the digitalization field, bibliometric analysis was used, with the principal source of scientific articles selected being the academic platform Scopus. The content of 3836 research articles has been taken into consideration since 2019 and 2023. The search documents related to the “digitalization” issue are in title, abstract, and keywords. In order to highlight the structure of the scientific field, we used a content analysis, inspecting the most common words and the relationships between words. Additionally, a network of co-occurrences was taken into account. The analysis was performed using the WOSviever program. In the next part of the research, the term “digitalization” was examined in more detail. The Scopus search engine uses filters, including the terms “digitalization,” “higher,” and “education,” but is limited to key words. The content of 104 research articles has been taken into consideration since 2019 and 2023. The research results showed that the fields of technology, education, and management provide the theoretical basis for research on the digitalization of higher education. The findings also demonstrate the topic’s interdisciplinary character (as seen by publications published in several fields) and its strong relationship to concepts like online learning, digital transformation, and sustainable development. Based on the literature analysis, it can be concluded that University 4.0 will go to the smart fully digital University (University 5.0), will take care of aspects of sustainable development, and will develop teachers’ soft skills, especially emotional intelligence."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488511","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.32","pagesFromTo":"54-66","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://sciendo.com/pl/article/10.2478/mspe-2024-0006","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709203878c28a04738e8d4","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Rosak-Szyrocka","uuid":"F7250A69C5602EAC90010A2808F30CFEAA1F52ABA3A58FCE452C8D6DAADB0078754612B2A5D508E2B1B58638DE512779053F043311B1822FA96874EA79A0DC2E","orcidId":"0000-0002-5548-6787","documentHash":"380d7f43-207c-460b-87d6-eac455432dac"}],"doi":"10.2478/mspe-2024-0006"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65e85a9b4097076263146cb1","doi":null,"title":"Dioecesis nostrae patroni : wydawnictwo jubileuszowe z okazji trzydziestej rocznicy erygowania Diecezji Toruńskiej","year":2022,"volume":"5","isbn":"978-83-67153-11-9","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://wydawnictwo.tnoik.torun.pl/produkt/dioecesis-nostrae-patroni/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"9cf614c0-d814-498e-81d9-a54359bfaeaa","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8d0","mniswId":"55800","name":"Towarzystwo Naukowe Organizacji i Kierownictwa.

As a result, it is often used in advertising campaigns by  various  types  of  organizations.  The  effectiveness  of  these  campaigns  depends  on  many  factors,  including  advertising  creation. Video ads are dynamic and may contain music. Music in advertising can be aimed at audience attention, persuasion, user  interest  and  sales.  Music  influences  the  emotions  of  the  audience,  and  these  are  an  important  factor  in  making  a  purchase decision. It can also increase the rememberability of an ad. Its beat is important, as well as content matching. On the other hand, social media audiences may not play music in ads, which often happens when quickly browsing applicationssuch  as  Facebook,  especially  on  mobile  devices.  The  lack  of  background  music  in  the  video  can therefore  also  make  a  difference. The aim of the article is to determine the impact of music on the effectiveness of Facebook ads. As a research method the test of four advertising campaigns was used. The video ads differed only in the background music (the remaining settings and the creation of the ads   were identical): the first had no musical background, the second had rock music timed with the video beat, the third - the same rock music not timed with the video beat, and the fourth one had a calm music as background music, less suited to the content (the video required rather dynamic music). It has been hypothesized that music or the lack of it in the video ad, its type and timing (or not) with the beat of the ad’s video have an impact on the effectiveness of the Facebook ads. It affects, among others on the reach metric, impressions, post engagement, number of clicks on the ad, cost of clicks, click rate, video plays and video plays   costs"}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488516","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"65eac20b409707216ed7ec45","mniswId":null,"startDate":"2022-05-12","endDate":"2022-05-13","fullName":"9th European Conference on Social Media","shortName":"9th European Conference on Social Media","city":"Kraków","country":"PL","website":null,"isEdition":true,"documentHash":"d639a6f3-ed77-4dbb-8121-e44ef5455d7c"},"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"103-110","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://papers.academic-conferences.org/index.php/ecsm/issue/view/4/3","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093a8878c28a0473ae891","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Lupa-Wójcik","uuid":"199718085B5B9D3A62E37CACC908DD94538D9280474C347B0F7AD45239FB59F9109B578772B46C2C95EE073EA0B9009E9E3BFFE42629BCF2FE963EFAE1A9880F","orcidId":"0000-0003-1673-7077","documentHash":"aeb2f389-3c9d-481f-b914-22de1f0d412b"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["environmental taxes","agriculture","mitigation of pollution in agriculture"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The impact of environmental taxes on mitigation of pollution in agriculture : the theoretical approach","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547cc0c","mniswId":"13879","title":"Management Theory and Studies for Rural Business and Infrastructure Development","doi":null,"issn":"1822-6760","eissn":"1822-6760","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"803c1d82-1c61-4801-86af-81e07058a541"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2022-09-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e978b640970762631b2209","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65e978b640970762631b220a","5e7092c3878c28a04739c264","65e978b640970762631b220b"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The research problem is based on the increasing global environmental pollution, reduction of the natural potential of\r\ncountries, and the importance of exploration of effective measures for the solution of these issues. The research analyzes\r\nthe impact of environmental taxes as an environmental policy instrument helping reduce environmental pollution and\r\nincrease the natural potential of agriculture. Environmental taxes are one of the most important tools for the reduction of\r\nGHG emissions in the EU. The research aim is to theoretically substantiate the role and impact of environmental taxes\r\non the mitigation of pollution in agriculture. Research results present that environmental taxes have generic and specific\r\ngoals and are related to the conventional tax functions: fiscal, regulatory, and redistributory. The identified strengths,\r\nweaknesses, applicability, and limitations of the environmental taxes enabled the identification of the prospects of these\r\ntaxes in terms of pollution mitigation. The classification schemes of the environmental taxes were prepared with the\r\nenvironmental taxes grouped by various attributes. Moreover, the environmental tax objects were identified and\r\nsubstantiated, in particular, those in agriculture.

Automated assistants are used in the area of communication with consumers and the sale of financial products. The development of robo-advisory services may contribute to increasing the availability of financial services and the cost efficiency of banks’ operations. So far, however, robo-advisory has not been widely used in bank services, and the reasons for this can be seen in the lack of wide acceptance of robo-advisory by bank customers, among other things.\r\nPurpose of the article: The aim of this paper is to identify barriers to the acceptance of robo-advisory in the services of banks operating in Poland. Variables relating to the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of consumers were analysed. Knowledge in this area can provide banks with a practical guideline for activities aimed at increasing acceptance of artificial intelligence technology and wider use of robo-advisory in financial services.\r\nResearch methods: The paper uses the results of a survey conducted in October 2020 regarding the application of artificial intelligence technology in the banking sector in Poland. The survey included a representative sample of 911 Polish citizens aged 18–65. A multinomial logit model was employed to identify variables that represent significant barriers to robo-advisory acceptance in financial services.\r\nMain findings: The conducted research helped identify the barriers to acceptance of robo-advisory among consumers in Poland. A low propensity to use robo-advisory in bank services is characteristic of respondents from older age groups, as well as those who do not show a predilection for testing new technological solutions. Lack of experience in using investment advisory services and customer concerns about the misuse of personal data by banks are also significant barriers."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488519","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"56","pagesFromTo":"109-126","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.umcs.pl/h/article/view/13804","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092bd878c28a04739bdae","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Piotrowski","uuid":"A980A4694F2D3859C7F6394E3CDFE1A70C6A99F01C8A8CCA3199B62B0C45A7E0B834DA1E6B13934A96C43BEC918BC38B58CF9581FD64220D17888BBF7B659277","orcidId":"0000-0001-8482-8064","documentHash":"9b9af715-1f0b-4138-aaa7-8c0a1e480284"}],"doi":"10.17951/h.2022.56.3.109-126"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["bioekonomia","bioprodukty","środowisko","integrowane zarządzanie gospodarstwem rolnym","zrównoważone rolnictwo"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bioeconomy","bioproducts","environment","integrated farm management","sustainable agriculture"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65e599214097076263cf9173","doi":"10.18559/978-83-8211-209-2","title":"Sustainable food.

The study comprised three PM fractions of suspended particulate matter (PM1, PM2.5 and PM10) sampled during campaigns lasting from March 14 to April 24, 2016 and from June 28 to July 18, 2016, in the road tunnel and the tram tunnel, respectively. The collected samples had undergone comprehensive chemical, elemental and carbon isotope analyses. The results of these analyses gave the basis for better characterization of urban transport as a source of air pollution in the city. The concentrations of particulate matter varied, depending on the analysed PM fraction and the place of sampling. For the tram tunnel, the average concentrations were 53.2 µg·m−3 (PM1), 73.8 µg·m−3 (PM2.5), 96.5 µg·m−3 (PM10), to be compared with 44.2 µg·m−3, 137.7 µg·m−3, 221.5 µg·m−3, respectively, recorded in the road tunnel. The isotope-mass balance calculations carried out separately for the road and tram tunnel and for each PM fraction, revealed that 60 to 79% of carbon present in the samples collected in the road tunnel was associated with road transport, to be compared with 15–33% obtained in the tram tunnel. The second in importance were biogenic emissions (17–21% and 41–49% in the road and tram tunnel, respectively. Sixteen different polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been identified in the analysed samples. As expected, much higher concentrations of PAHs were detected in the road tunnel when compared to the tram tunnel. Based on the analysed PAHs concentrations, health risk assessment was determined using 3 different types of indicators: carcinogenic equivalent (CEQ), mutagenic equivalent (MEQ) and toxic equivalent (TEQ)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488522","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65e2ebee40970749755f77ad","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"31","number":"10","doi":null,"documentHash":"87c2e2be-01fb-4dbc-8caa-665048679e63"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"31","pagesFromTo":"14690-14703","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-024-32000-1","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"66e82eccfdbe8327373fdd1c","name":"Anne","lastName":"Kasper-Giebl","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cb84309e-ad99-4550-ae42-aee3627db39d"},{"objectId":"66e82eccfdbe8327373fdd1a","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Furman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d45fe918-c73a-40f2-8376-6a63d08e0b80"},{"objectId":"5e7093e5878c28a0473b2d2b","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Skiba","uuid":"9E86602F041F71F7430D2C39471B633DAE92AC929A12BB1E20F0AD076C0AEF6FC9089B40B24DD6B4A60E091A82193D527252A86FCF9545C392BE208B82F54DDB","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"607030ef-dac9-41e5-a311-60e05b966e74"},{"objectId":"5e709298878c28a047398ac5","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Szramowiat-Sala","uuid":"2B29084241D1C09E0D0ACF162FCCA3EB246EC6ACAEE61CF3656173F2129D5B26B739E68173629E3B40A8365C777B45E748A54781891BF0F0E68B3B2881C2B97A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"39846d68-d240-4b55-8d28-b17392349b6a"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397cf0","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Wideł","uuid":"2681086D0C0FD084BECA402359D8D807B182DAC806C016C6C1E32EF4B3C1EC117B8001C58CAB8971D881CFE4ED8B488A9B4A14E920E95C4436FC256E4E52E00F","orcidId":"0000-0002-6780-9408","documentHash":"a719e054-444f-40a7-88ec-a1ae81d974a5"},{"objectId":"5e70922c878c28a04739127f","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Styszko","uuid":"D3BC4ECC839F86F1EEA84C3359D9DF32E1F8BA4E881041A91089ECD67D3C1F2B0031D6073269E931D4A16F10541C11152E8EE32F5EE8C10C1C309A1458E160AB","orcidId":"0000-0003-0092-3772","documentHash":"f0871dbe-aedb-4f8e-9848-75b73254e388"},{"objectId":"5e709208878c28a04738eea6","name":"LUCYNA","lastName":"SAMEK","uuid":"602BF0E3410A174E081A9B17E5CFD204518A8B5C805A93E88FC9D9CEDF4E29A267D1AD4DB73AEFE8CA391680AF501F5D882637260C88FC91D5585A29B042468F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8636-2771","documentHash":"5296297d-e64d-421d-8ee5-f20efd1b4072"},{"objectId":"5e709208878c28a04738eea3","name":"KAZIMIERZ","lastName":"RÓŻAŃSKI","uuid":"E6B273FF934187F37D9293E07DE348D70C1667E9B6E5B16B620F3E66053EBC108B14ECD2F6093ADCB164215356D644E740435D681529DE54B5AD1FA1BBA87C8F","orcidId":"0000-0003-4704-0379","documentHash":"4eda8372-1a0b-44fd-a2f6-464a20e38fc7"},{"objectId":"5e709208878c28a04738ee72","name":"ZBIGNIEW","lastName":"GORCZYCA","uuid":"B6735C89C156C57E5FA2322BC49863FB280EA08718B60893209ED81B0FA3AC57C67C312B5F5F1279FB1A8A465EC180ED94AC2187922CD1EAC169DE1732ECF4EC","orcidId":"0000-0002-1643-4589","documentHash":"a6780136-2556-4a74-a2ad-200f1b5fdf4b"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11356-024-32000-1"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Internal Audit as an Element of the Internal Audit System and Its Disclosure in Non-Financial Reports","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d54878c28514547a747","mniswId":"200171","title":"Zeszyty Naukowe Politechniki Śląskiej.

The aim of this study was to analyse the risk of SA according to the level of physical activity\n(PA), and the occurrence of overweight and obesity in a population of 460 adolescents – students of secondary\nschools in Poland.\nMaterial and methods: The physical activity of adolescents was assessed using a short version of the International physical activity questionnaire. Smartphone addiction, as the independent variable, was measured by\nthe mobile phone addiction assessment questionnaire. Overweight and obesity were identified by body mass\nindex (BMI). Waist-to-hip ratio and body height were also measured.\nResults: 284 (61.7%) respondents were not addicted to the smartphone, 148 (32.2%) were at risk of addiction,\nand 28 (6.1%) were addicted. It was found that in all respondents (n = 460) SA was associated with PA – low\noverall PA was associated with a higher level of SA (rho = –0.279; p < 0.0001). Moreover, the index of overall\nSA increased with sitting time (β = 0.113) and decreased with the general PA growth (β = –0.190). It was also\nshown that the increase of SA in overweight/obese adolescents was influenced by the reduction of general PA\n(rho = –0.343; p < 0.05), intense PA (rho = –0.268; p < 0.05), and walking (rho = –0.280; p < 0.05). Smartphone addicts were also students with higher BMI (24.77 kg/m2\n; p < 0.0001) and higher BMI percentile (80.57;\np < 0.0001).\nConclusions: Smartphone addiction is significantly associated with the PA of adolescents, and it is more common among those with an insufficient level of PA. Increased BMI is also an indicator of SA. Interventions for\nreducing SA should take into account both the context of PA and anthropometric indicators of schoolchildren."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488529","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66f13a9cfdbe833567aa0515","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"99","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"8a250bac-1d3c-439e-b7df-40cd8ed6cee0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"99","pagesFromTo":"23-30","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/doi_ft/10.5114/polp.2024.135825","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093a1878c28a0473ae104","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Rękas","uuid":"6A9D3F246C5B9664CD75BA1EA1D46FC45D4C0B217F2A65844A800264502CA25EE1A395118606A6FAA0D1B8BC39CCDBA3FF64C9116390153E07D07378CDE91CF6","orcidId":"0000-0002-5763-9564","documentHash":"a49a1d33-ff87-4738-9f2e-7df835ce05c4"},{"objectId":"5e709381878c28a0473ab615","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Burzyńska","uuid":"0F5B9E999A69F03325BD368016A172A0E66BC4B0D3B6A8D6C2E5F5273E82F2CF67267FF93C03888EAB22221BCB18AE233F41DDD8E74E25F20ADE7E36032AA77D","orcidId":"0000-0001-8143-8204","documentHash":"009050b6-e93e-49ef-b55e-691a4683b953"}],"doi":"10.5114/polp.2024.135825"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CO<sub>2</sub> emissions","renewable energy use","spatio-temporal analysis","urbanization level"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The impact of renewable energy and urbanization on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in Europe : spatio-temporal approach","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c047","mniswId":"5804","title":"Environmental Development","doi":null,"issn":"2211-4645","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"7c4f514e-6649-43c5-92ed-ad956372a73f"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-18","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e978ac40970762631b1c7f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70938b878c28a0473ac594","5e709344878c28a0473a6169"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Renewable energy use and urbanization level do have an impact on the air quality that can be\r\nexpressed by the CO2 emissions. However, it is not evident whether they positively or negatively\r\ninfluence the environment. The logical thinking suggests that generating energy from renewable\r\nenergy sources shall benefit the air quality. However, none of the energy sources, even those\r\nrenewable ones, create zero environmental impact. The same applies to the urbanization level as\r\na theoretical factor that should cause more CO2 emissions. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to\r\nassess what is the impact of renewable energy use and urbanization level on the CO2 emissions in\r\nEurope from 1995 to 2018. Applying a spatio-temporal approach, the results of this paper indicate\r\nthat the levels of CO2 emissions and urbanization declined towards the East and rose towards the\r\nNorth, whereas the share of renewable energy use increased towards the North. The values of the\r\nshare of renewable energy use and urbanization increased over time, while the CO2 emissions\r\nlevel had a faster than linear decrease over the years. The analysis proved that an increase in the\r\nshare of renewable energy use leads to less CO2 emissions, while an increase in the urbanization\r\nlevel harms the air quality."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488532","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"44","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211464522000574","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70938b878c28a0473ac594","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Grodzicki","uuid":"1BECED14E74B670F5A5C52F278CFCD6BEA7DC8666125A356D9061FD59817A2CB93B98D60E471163F8E778EFD4FE54BCD46CD1D7FBF04A76F5D0575E7D20E949B","orcidId":"0000-0001-7819-2127","documentHash":"0707b160-3d76-4db2-89a6-55721ba6941f"},{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a6169","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Jankiewicz","uuid":"5E73328D823BE73AAD77A9FFFC867EAA7A4792B44F7A186667C4F5C358271B1F0A80291E48B1214EE34381D9C6DBD8B22D617ED2B629B8E4BD6642F30A46313D","orcidId":"0000-0002-4713-778X","documentHash":"c1e53190-f26f-401f-88c6-bea35fd32504"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.envdev.2022.100755"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decd","uid":"bDVT6eE951oVevqx9vwsANA","uuid":"52307719-d5a8-4e16-8c65-acc1f011e9bb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decd","parentUuid":"52307719-d5a8-4e16-8c65-acc1f011e9bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decd","rootUuid":"52307719-d5a8-4e16-8c65-acc1f011e9bb","name":"Główny Instytut Górnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709447878c28a0473b99ce"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Priorytety transformacji energetyki na początku 2024 r.","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e7117cf46e0fb0001bdedc3","mniswId":null,"title":"Nowa Energia","doi":null,"issn":"1899-0886","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"f72ea35d-a58a-4294-bfd2-84cd967362d9"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9b6c3409707132d33b13d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709447878c28a0473b99ce"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059488534","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"92","pagesFromTo":"58-65","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://magazyn.nowa-energia.com.pl/magazyny/nowa-energia-01-2024/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709447878c28a0473b99ce","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Tokarski","uuid":"143ECC196ECD7C4407C8120F059FAAEEE24F96EBA42B077EF59ACAAE60B815568ABEE5C2997BC77AF7337D6F475C6B926B85D51D668A72A5FC30215C196B59A0","orcidId":"0000-0002-4261-3652","documentHash":"980bb7f4-9b62-4131-9fa4-d3e57fd72efd"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["treatment, spine, back pain, risk factors"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737def0","uid":"brcyYgRgvEjIItaX3WfS4aA","uuid":"b7bb6dea-d926-4b36-9e6d-e0ad8061342e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def0","parentUuid":"b7bb6dea-d926-4b36-9e6d-e0ad8061342e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def0","rootUuid":"b7bb6dea-d926-4b36-9e6d-e0ad8061342e","name":"Narodowy Instytut Geriatrii, Reumatologii i Rehabilitacji im. prof. dr hab. med.

An important aspect is to determine the risk factors and their reduction,\nor at least modification, i.e. the first stage of the discussed treatment concept. Then, medical treatment\naimed at a specific pathology, including both conservative and surgical methods, allows the cause of\nthe pathology to be removed, i.e. the second stage of the discussed concept.

The yields of rapeseed seeds in the production technology using biofertilizers with limited mineral fertilization were not inferior to the yields obtained in the traditional technology, in which the doses of P and K fertilizers were 40% higher."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488543","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65702a8c40970749a88c1f8a","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"102","number":"11","doi":null,"documentHash":"1a1f7c6a-b150-4e25-945e-700146ccc635"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"102","pagesFromTo":"1177-1181","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"Efficiency of microbially enriched fertilizers in the cultivation of winter oilseed rape"}],"publicUri":"https://sigma-not.pl/publikacja-146062-2023-11.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093b6878c28a0473af93f","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Rusek","uuid":"675F9DDDBF709FECD35A6298B5FB97F9D99346BC08DB1FAC602AFE8AAD34A294893CC7865F14F0C6CFFE900DF50B903C8ED4EA008E8ECC333B8A201C74763844","orcidId":"0000-0003-2788-6676","documentHash":"44dbcb6f-fb4f-4ec2-8811-a918d30e23b1"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a047399672","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Rutkowska","uuid":"25A44582D67545155840122054F44EA4F9A50BC11594122743B507B141A43F13BD22F404AE1B4D5CC1E8564EAC7A5F6FA261B1700595CF8F65B90DB142C1024D","orcidId":"0000-0001-9799-0327","documentHash":"e674c798-b240-45dd-8c15-b830ae206019"}],"doi":"10.15199/62.2023.11.6"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["probationary guardianship, group therapy, resocialization in society"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091db878c28a04738d1f9","uid":"brHwI7j0dcHTQ6rSLioIgPg","uuid":"9fa570d5-11dc-4131-b96a-44ad1aa60c28","parentId":"5e7091db878c28a04738d1f9","parentUuid":"9fa570d5-11dc-4131-b96a-44ad1aa60c28","rootId":"5e7091db878c28a04738d1f9","rootUuid":"9fa570d5-11dc-4131-b96a-44ad1aa60c28","name":"Akademia Wymiaru Sprawiedliwości","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091f7878c28a04738dc60"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Probationary guardianship as a system of integrated personal, environmental, cultural and civilisational interactions with violators of the social order","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa81c9aff2974850cce2","mniswId":"201040","title":"Law Education Security","doi":null,"issn":"2956-6630","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"MINISTRY","editor":null,"documentHash":"e6593a5c-bd82-4ae2-a570-8bf7dc2ffc40"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eecdac40970749973c25a4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7091f7878c28a04738dc60"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The distinction between subjective and objective good is linked to the category of human autonomy and dignity.

Methodology/approach: We use a case study to explore in depth the object of our study – the reporting of non-financial information. The analysis was conducted from multiple perspectives based on Hofstede’s cultural dimensions. Findings: The research suggests that the attitudes of stakeholders and companies towards the development of SDG reporting and the use of Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) are neutral. Poland’s performance on Hofstede’s dimensions is consistent with the frequency and type of GRI indicators companies use in their reports. Research limitations: A limitation of our research is that we only examine one area of non-financial reporting, and we only refer to companies in the WIG20. Additionally, we only study one year. Practical implications: This paper will be useful to academics and practitioners to enable an understanding of cultural dimensions in the context of sustainable development reporting. Originality/value: Our research explains the reluctance to report social areas. Our research analyzes the sustainable development reports of companies from the Warsaw Stock Exchange WIG Index. We determine which social indicators are reported by companies and which are not, and using Hofstede’s theory, we explain the reasons for the lack of disclosures."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488548","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"47","pagesFromTo":"203-220","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ztr.skwp.pl/resources/html/article/details?id=612461","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709240878c28a04739277a","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"7B4BF04083834D9CC4257417A46BC8431918D55E78CC34FF01EC33D5A5257DAAB23C3501E514EC1958D58C7818F16EF8956DE4E30E765C8B435FE5CEDD56BE7F","orcidId":"0000-0002-4254-0799","documentHash":"571722d0-2ce7-4ca0-9038-bd8a9846ff86"},{"objectId":"5e709240878c28a0473926de","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Czerny","uuid":"D1D6952E1AF3BE5FDC4D4C9152342BB73CD4EA88694A25F0A6F81F2982D08A57A5AA25F4CC9F3D292795471E038D6727A764B969CCDDBE584ED457D4D3AF75AA","orcidId":"0000-0002-5838-8322","documentHash":"40c4272f-8ea1-4871-8ac9-d5d54cdc9ec6"}],"doi":"10.5604/01.3001.0053.7702"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65ba0cfc4097075661bd33e4","doi":null,"title":"Encyklopedia

purpose of the article is to validate the 45-item scale called Counterproductive Work Behavior Checklist (CWB-C) proposed by Spector et al. (2006) and adapt it to Central European cultural conditions. The research objectives are met using a set of measuring methods, namely focus group interviews, observations and a survey among 1,351 professionally active people in Poland. Data factor analysis is applied to examine the survey. The proposed modified and validated scale to measure CWBs is adapted to Central European cultural conditions. It has 35 items; 30 items are taken from the original CWB-C scale. The elements on the scale can be divided according to the target of such behavior, i.e., directed at the organization or other people. The items can be also divided into subjective categories, namely abuse against others, sabotage, theft and withdrawal. In the case of the second categorization, the original category 'production deviance' proposed by Spector et al. (2006) is eliminated. The proposed scale is characterized by good measures of fit for the 4-factor model.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488561","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"74-94","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.proquest.com/docview/2687828064?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092c3878c28a04739c2af","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Szostek","uuid":"57E4D8271206386FC3844355ED08BFAEBABE805C5DB5DC556195801283991BCF335D91111BCA76D2E0FCBCB431BA88A862AB225B7968D56BD4C5397ABF7EC658","orcidId":"0000-0001-6743-854X","documentHash":"014210d4-7301-4938-957c-7d42f0fee1bd"}],"doi":"10.14254/2071-789x.2022/15-2/5"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"(286–289) Proposals on institutional votes, especially to reduce geographical imbalance","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454798d0","mniswId":"19259","title":"Taxon","doi":null,"issn":"0040-0262","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"2951f7be-5f4a-4918-92e3-15215bd43ae0"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e82daa409707626313b96f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65e82daa409707626313b970","65e82daa409707626313b971","65e82daa409707626313b972","65e82daa409707626313b973","65e82daa409707626313b974","65e82daa409707626313b975","5e709231878c28a0473916a6","65e82daa409707626313b976"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059488564","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"72","pagesFromTo":"701-703","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/tax.12959","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e82daa409707626313b976","name":"Teresa","lastName":"Iturriaga","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"427853a4-24fa-46bb-b119-27ce54de1051"},{"objectId":"65e82daa409707626313b975","name":" A.

Design/methodology/approach: The sample of 239 drivers was examined in March-August, 2021. Findings: The study revealed that most drivers were resilient to COVID-19-related stressors. Some stressors, such as age, seniority, recovering from COVID-19, and worsening family financial conditions, were found to have more impact on some respondents than others. Age and seniority were related to anxiety about increased occupational activities. Those whose economic conditions worsened were afraid of job loss. People who recovered from COVID-19 felt overworked more often than others and tended to be scared of safety on the road and being alone in the truck. They more often required psychological support. Research limitations/implications: The study is based on a sample of drivers observed conveniently in 2021. Monitoring them in two or three waves is recommended to compare the impact of other processes that could affect responses. Practical implications: The outcomes are valuable in practice twofold. Firstly, the knowledge is acquired directly from the drivers who proved to be pretty resilient to COVID-related issues; however, some were more sensitive than others. That means the drivers as an occupational group cannot be considered uniform. Some needed psychological support, and such cases should be identified at the enterprise level. Secondly, the results show that COVID-related stressors with other accompanying issues increase the impact on drivers’ health. Originality/value: The empirical results revealed the most significant stressors. They were justified by using several stress definitions and psychological theories, particularly the Conservation of Resources Theory. They can be considered in the drivers' management process."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488567","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"685-702","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://managementpapers.polsl.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/160-Zalewski-Osi%C5%84ska-Chylewska-Barakat.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b86d3","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Zalewski","uuid":"D209FDF6D1FACFAB7FD0D0B18E802BFA93B007895B05945DC88BA830985E250B80BD741E2D6B79605E916F23812738CD515304C18AEBA5729670A76B0DD5FD86","orcidId":"0000-0002-4318-6752","documentHash":"a0098b44-036f-438d-8e32-7433b225b5de"},{"objectId":"5e7093cc878c28a0473b0f16","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Chylewska-Barakat","uuid":"7B4AB17F7593EC9A4A3441F62A6AC4475F48D7E1D31D48044BD538B3D3B322C0EECC321FB2DC4E613F16F20FD1596AFA0BC2B89CA5A87BB35F6A39E255A2F241","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1897f89b-c9ec-477d-9377-9bfb515c67c6"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396ae8","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Osińska","uuid":"81E0D26C409D3AFAA30F93F24099F9654E2CA5AACC704730473889A1F8F642A4E8BBBC9E476847E01BC71C3D41E9B8E2281FF3632311BEE635F75504F0C90C40","orcidId":"0000-0002-9796-2892","documentHash":"25d1b9ee-2a8e-420e-a9eb-6d3ef814b513"}],"doi":"10.29119/1641-3466.2022.160.44"},{"mainLanguageName":"niemiecki","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-3-89739-969-3","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Kommendenausbau im Hl.

Understanding the underlying thermal conversion process principles alongside the associated/exhibited operational challenges that are specific to biomass types is crucial for beginners in this research area. From an extensive literature search, the authors are convinced that a tutorial review that guides beginners particularly towards pyrolysis implementation, from different biomasses to the thermal conversion process and conditions, is scarce. An effective understanding of pre-to-main pyrolysis stages, alongside corresponding standard methodologies, would help beginners discuss anticipated results. To support the existing information, therefore, this review sought to seek how to navigate pyrolysis implementation, specifically considering factors and thermochemical operating methods for biomass conversion, drawing the ideas from: (a) the evolving nature of the thermal conversion process; (b) the potential inter-relatedness between individual components affecting pyrolysis-based research; (c) pre- to post-pyrolysis’ engagement strategies; (d) potential feedstock employed in the thermal conversion processes; (e) the major pre-treatment strategies applied to feedstocks; (f) system performance considerations between pyrolysis reactors; and (g) differentiating between the reactor and operation parameters involved in the thermal conversion processes. Moreover, pre-pyrolysis activity tackles biomass selection/analytical measurements, whereas the main pyrolysis activity tackles treatment methods, reactor types, operating processes, and the eventual product output. Other areas that need beginners’ attention include high-pressure process reactor design strategies and material types that have a greater potential for biomass."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488580","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"1-44","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/3/725","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eef7874097076263b97d03","name":"Chinenye Adaobi","lastName":"Igwegbe","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3be4698b-acf1-45b5-b849-30322220c699"},{"objectId":"6222d9387523402df08d2b48","name":"Waheed","lastName":"Rasaq","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c73188e-05a2-4368-9798-ab4f838fbe1f"},{"objectId":"602f92779543c7410626f621","name":"Charles","lastName":"Okpala","uuid":"2863F010492720DAE80B06A651BF1EB308ADC4A87AE370D1032F18031CE00790F5F8DB63E06FB8BB6BB8B8C5A821ACBEE4277752C98ECD5A9A495E7E43954235","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"46d1fcb9-8bb2-4be9-b74e-fab61e812c3b"},{"objectId":"5e70921c878c28a0473900b8","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Białowiec","uuid":"BDF818D6D6BB69D5CB05F525C0A728054D812F8C0CBC79878F9420A7D0179A7016B66891425C5163C20A634E1DFADC9AE9B75400AF4ECBB91B18B2827927D69A","orcidId":"0000-0002-5871-2129","documentHash":"81d1531c-2c4b-477c-b00c-645c599311ea"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17030725"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["bilans","historia rachunkowości","metoda kasowa","przepływy pieniężne","wilanowska nieruchomość ziemska","XIX wiek"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["balance sheet","accounting history","cash method","cash flow","Wilanów estate","19th century"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Realizacja metody kasowej w rachunkowości dóbr wilanowskich w latach 1892-1914","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d54878c28514547a753","mniswId":"200221","title":"Zeszyty Teoretyczne Rachunkowości","doi":null,"issn":"1641-4381","eissn":"2391-677X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b84ad150-ca9f-442d-a9ca-f7b73a1063ae"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-08-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e978bc40970762631b2474","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709344878c28a0473a61dd"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Cel: Celem artykułu jest prezentacja metody kasowej ujęcia przepływów pieniężnych w rachunkowości wilanowskiej nieruchomości ziemskiej na przełomie XIX i XX wieku.\r\nMetodyka/ podejście badawcze: Zastosowana metodologia badawcza obejmuje krytyczną analizę materiałów źródłowych i literatury przedmiotu, analizę opisową i porównawczą oraz metodę dedukcji.

As a powder bed fusion technique, SLM fabricates the product layer by layer. The state-of-the-art research on SLM, the metallic alloys utilized in the process, and the surface morphology of fabricated parts are discussed in this paper. The present report contributes to the literature by providing a comprehensive overview of the surface morphology of metallic alloys fabricated using the SLM additive manufacturing method. The article covers recent research on SLM, metallic alloys used in the process, and the surface morphology of fabricated parts. Insights into the challenges and opportunities of SLM for the fabrication of metallic parts with desired surface properties are provided. In the first part, parameters representing surface morphology are introduced and types of surface defects are viewed. Subsequently, influence of process variables during the production phase is discussed in-depth, overviewing several parameters such as laser, scanning, and geometric parameters. Surface morphology enhancement, namely in situ treatment, post-processing, and finishing-machining techniques, is viewed separately by classifying them into subtopics, in respect of their improvement effectiveness. Mechanical aspects of the microstructure and surface are evaluated in correlation with the surface morphology. The discussion of the findings considering the advantages and disadvantages of this technology is summarized finally. It is concluded that laser parameter effect’s significance depends on the work alloy. In the literature, process parameters are systematically studied, and better surface quality and favourable surface morphology of as build surfaces are possible. Moreover, it has been concluded that the surface morphology and quality of SLMed products can be improved with in situ techniques and post-treatments. Relieving residual stresses and decreasing porosity on the surface (various types of holes, pinholes, vacancies, etc.) during SLM operation are possible by base plate heating, powder preheating, and re-scanning. It is also noticed that the machinability studies of SLMed parts mainly focus on mechanical machining such as grinding and milling. Studies on the correlation between surface morphology of SLMed parts and mechanical properties are relatively scarce comparing to works on SLM production parameters. Finally, as an emerging technology for vast production of industrial items, it is concluded that surface morphology of SLMed products needs systematic correlation studies between process parameters and surface results."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488585","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65ead1bf409707216ed8e8bf","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"127","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"e7073606-4c5f-4247-a8fd-5e0fc14c1496"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"127","pagesFromTo":"1103-1142","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00170-023-11534-7","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65ead17e40970762632a7d37","name":"Jinyang","lastName":"Xu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6348bba6-21eb-4a6a-aa30-d98375887a4b"},{"objectId":"65ead17e40970762632a7d36","name":"Saad","lastName":"Waqar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8ae7afc0-472e-4d9c-8f9d-6362550c7bc8"},{"objectId":"65ead17e40970762632a7d35","name":"Abdullah","lastName":"Aslan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"510fb9a6-b3af-446d-9378-01678c8a4677"},{"objectId":"65ead17e40970762632a7d34","name":"Eyüb","lastName":"Canli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"882a9367-ae91-48cd-ab22-051fc4f88482"},{"objectId":"65ead17e40970762632a7d33","name":"Emin","lastName":"Salur","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"316d392a-5fe9-407d-8c37-5f650d8d4be6"},{"objectId":"65ead17e40970762632a7d32","name":"Mustafa","lastName":"Kuntoğlu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ffc06032-4c25-4762-b22f-7d4e4e504e7a"},{"objectId":"611b1f299543c757bc082899","name":"MUNISH","lastName":"GUPTA","uuid":"F5865D4EDDEC75980E79207C030BE585C437E16B74094A84FCA3195D425EAB1657A884C28B18CBD0B0FAAB6D8CBDEAFFE4740A0D2A99F3AAF389A97DA5A5D8B0","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3b10e4c8-a02e-4698-9a16-fb80cf6020a1"},{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae592","name":"GRZEGORZ","lastName":"KRÓLCZYK","uuid":"CBFCAB23248F107BE0869A0A1B95424418771F3BF1C3230726107C2E5AFCDAD7015626B297AF4BA3889E7234B4F73D33C256E065E8A33D085071A5B816F9E9BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2967-1719","documentHash":"983b593f-a262-4fbd-83c5-754137e069b1"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00170-023-11534-7"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["metatekst","komentarz metatekstowy","dewiacja semantyczna","dewiacja pragmatyczna"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["metatext","metatextual commentary","semantic deviation","pragmatic deviation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Sprzeczność i inne typy dewiacji językowych w polu komentarzy metatekstowych","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a11c","mniswId":"485283","title":"Linguistica Copernicana","doi":null,"issn":"2080-1068","eissn":"2391-7768","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"47e01a64-4bcf-491b-abaa-76b19485339e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_ND","releaseDate":"2023-02-18","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9a94340970762631fbb28","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c3878c28a04739c385"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Przedmiotem artykułu jest opis łączliwości komentarzy metatekstowych, celem jest wskazanie dewiacyjnych połączeń wyrażeń na tym poziomie meta-tekstu, będących konsekwencją ogólnych reguł realizacji wypowiedzenia, tj. aktualnie użytych zdań.

The covariant density functional approach to the equation of state and composition of dense nuclear matter in the mean-field Hartree and Hartree-Fock approximation is presented, with regimes covering cold beta-equilibrated matter, hot and dense matter with and without neutrinos relevant for the description of supernovas and binary neutron star mergers, as well as dilute expanding nuclear matter in collision experiments. We discuss the static properties of compact stars with hyperons and increment -resonances in light of constraints placed in recent years by the multimessenger astrophysics of compact stars on the compact stars' masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities. The effects of kaon condensation and strong magnetic fields on the composition of hypernuclear stars are also discussed. The properties of rapidly rotating compact hypernuclear stars are discussed and confronted with the observations of 2.5-2.8 solar mass compact objects in gravitational wave events. We further discuss the cooling of hypernuclear stars, the neutrino emission reactions, hyperonic pairing, and the mass hierarchy in the cooling curves that arises due to the onset of hyperons. The effects of hyperons and increment -resonances on the equation of state of hot nuclear matter in the dense regime, relevant for the transient astrophysical event and in the dilute regime relevant to the collider physics is discussed. The review closes with a discussion of universal relations among the integral parameters of hot and cold hypernuclear stars and their implications for the analysis of binary neutron star merger events.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Series measures are performed to implement an accurate forms of therapies for COVID – 19 patients and convalescents. The purpose of this article is to conduct a review of the latest surveys about effective treatment methods of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Brief description of the current state of knowledge In order to do this, 46 scientific records from 2019 - 2021 published in the PubMed scientific database were included. The most known, efficient methods of COVID-19 therapy included therapy of tocilizumab, remdesiwir and amantadine, which were used separately. Conclusion In our review promising therapies and medicaments, which can be used in COVID-19 practice were described. However, none of presented therapies has turned out in 100% efficient in the treatment of COVID-19. The profiled recommendation should be further combined to refine and formulate new effective treatments for SARS-CoV-2."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488599","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eab8f0409707216ed77a66","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"26","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"f7abeaf9-6fee-4f43-9ae6-24edfe9adc33"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"26","pagesFromTo":"21-33","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://apgrjournal.com/resources/html/article/details?id=619014","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eab8f0409707216ed77a68","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Sarzyńska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"351b189b-2dfc-475c-8264-da7d13971ef1"},{"objectId":"65eab8f0409707216ed77a67","name":"Julia","lastName":"Trojniak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2c63126c-a364-4479-9020-aa218b079d54"},{"objectId":"5e709460878c28a0473bbc60","name":"Marta","lastName":"Kopańska","uuid":"D2EBD7FD456CBCA22F7CF68BE54068AC8C694AC475F0F2A26ED8164722FB3A988FEAE7CF0DA60EB5DF871717525F80D367C65E5CA562849A715250C6F5A5E49F","orcidId":"0000-0003-3936-0698","documentHash":"1939a623-f2ff-453e-979b-49fc8dcde658"},{"objectId":"5e7093a1878c28a0473ae1d1","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Błajda","uuid":"B6780CD2B3ADD07F04697FC50ABD64296CFD5E8E62DF7993CDC6D4ED2B667FBE6D7F538218723805C52D02677CCC8C583A7C697E3E9A36E062EA76CD5EF2BB0D","orcidId":"0000-0002-6299-8692","documentHash":"78b5d36b-266b-4818-820b-fbd7013bebf1"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390cc9","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Ochojska","uuid":"8A802A97045A774C3C7563EF648852D360F0069293A807744CF8412AC42FCA246C61A662DAA05E410492F36FA2A8501460B5FF887D7FB140A3E868440D9F7D13","orcidId":"0000-0002-0535-1884","documentHash":"a5bf47a6-ac27-47cd-9475-33c2940d6801"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fertiliser contamination","Anion exchange resin","Reservoir","surface water quality"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Field installation of ion exchange technology for purification of retention reservoirs from nitrogen-based nutrient contamination","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547caf6","mniswId":"13187","title":"Journal of Water Process Engineering","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2214-7144","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"87fbff2e-7ab1-434e-8c3d-4455e1b0050c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eef7954097076263b97d43","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65eef7954097076263b97d44","5e709422878c28a0473b6cf3","65eef7954097076263b97d45","65eef7954097076263b97d46","65eef7954097076263b97d47","65eef7954097076263b97d48","65eef7954097076263b97d49","5e70924e878c28a0473935e0"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"N- and P-nutrient contamination is recognised as one of the key factors that reduces the quality of water. In this context, a new water purification installation was set up in the Turawa reservoir (district Opole, Poland). The process involves ion exchange columns operated in twin configuration: once one column filtrates water, the second one regenerates. The installation design is modular, and the devices are placed in a container station. This enables efficient water purification in various locations and further offers scalability. The research focused on the design and optimization of the installation, as well as environmental assessment of how the installation influenced the quality of water. This technology afforded a decrease in the concentrations of NO3− ions, suggesting an apparent selectivity. The removal of NO3− reached 97 % and was maintained for over 100 m3 of purified water. In turn, the removal of PO43− was not effective; however, the collected data allowed the installation design to be adjusted such that the cascade arrangement of ion exchange columns can be considered. The technology was assessed over all four seasons in the two-year test period (2020−2021). This revealed that environmental factors, such as season, air temperature, wind, and relative humidity, influence the operation of the installation. The installation functions optimally in spring with an average air temperature of 11–20 °C, high relative humidity of 90–100 %, and an average wind speed of 2 m/ s. The implementation of the technique could easily broaden the perspectives of Earth's water preservation and sustainability."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488601","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"59","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214714424001910","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eef7954097076263b97d49","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Pulikowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"94957af4-a120-4987-b400-836c5966c751"},{"objectId":"65eef7954097076263b97d48","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Jermakowicz-Bartkowiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d21b786c-4363-4bd5-9ff2-78704afb469a"},{"objectId":"65eef7954097076263b97d47","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Piszko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cce5a43b-df18-4882-b508-cc8ef4bd21c3"},{"objectId":"65eef7954097076263b97d46","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kabat","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1653a8e1-4a2e-4836-9a29-d08f9cce923b"},{"objectId":"65eef7954097076263b97d45","name":"Witold","lastName":"Skorulski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"35b9d4c8-9e73-481b-a4a4-1439937b9d50"},{"objectId":"65eef7954097076263b97d44","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Cyganowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"08158fc8-f7c8-473f-853b-cfefb8f2a6d9"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6cf3","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Gruss","uuid":"F49E7556C93664F3BB275D707D699E5AD5880D0BF090B5414085A44583BCB7758059A18C40E60E4761ADAB3011B892455A1F98757A6B5209D686CE3DD0DEB5DF","orcidId":"0000-0002-7548-9758","documentHash":"fde19c45-20c7-423b-a7ad-a48e82d69ec3"},{"objectId":"5e70924e878c28a0473935e0","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Wiatkowski","uuid":"3B2A563C5BB75017380E4AA991B146240D67646BD85053BFD519D5B3D6A139C55D82BF100C94F8D693BD6E609BE03902AE4EF60974C2D1DEA6271757B493EF67","orcidId":"0000-0002-5155-0593","documentHash":"68aae787-7828-4e50-b34e-fb0126814555"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jwpe.2024.104959"},{"mainLanguageName":"hiszpański","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["wolność seksualna","prawo do wolności seksualne","przemoc seksualna"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-84-1130-527-3","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Libertad sexual y violencia sexual","mainLanguage":"spa","journal":null,"pages":716,"publicationPlace":"Valencia","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eb103740970762632c2ec6","editors":[{"objectId":"65eb103740970762632c2ec8","name":"María","lastName":"José Bravo Bosch","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3ce6687b-4ff9-4336-add0-af376d356a7d"},{"objectId":"65eb103740970762632c2ec7","name":"Inés Celia","lastName":"Iglesias Canle","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"098237d1-d30e-440e-ba6f-14c801bb211b"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["65eb103740970762632c2ec7","65eb103740970762632c2ec8"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"spa","content":"Este trabajo aborda el estudio del derecho a la libertad sexual y su reflejo en el ámbito internacional.

The usage of metalworking fluids raises concerns about the operator's health and environmental impact. Therefore, minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) is preferred as one of the cooling/lubrication alternatives to achieve enhanced machining performance. The effectiveness of MQL application can be enhanced by using vegetable oil blended with nanoparticles. Considering these facts, the machinability of Inconel 625 is assessed using varying concentrations (0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2%) of graphite and molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) nanoparticles in sunflower oil. The tribological and thermophysical properties of prepared nanofluids in the form of friction coefficient, thermal conductivity, and dynamic viscosity are evaluated. The turning tests are conducted under dry, MQL, and nanofluid-MQL (nMQL) environments, and the findings are compared considering surface roughness, chip morphology, tool wear, cutting temperature, power consumption, and microhardness. The sunflower oil blended with MoS<sub>2</sub> resulted in 56%, 42%, and 22% improved surface quality compared to dry, MQL, and nMQL (Graphite) conditions. Also, the efficacy of nMQL with graphite and MoS<sub>2</sub> is seen in the form of slower tool wear progression. Also, MQL, nMQL with MoS<sub>2</sub>, and nMQL (Graphite) resulted in lower cutting temperatures by 18%, 35%, and 25%, respectively, compared to dry turning. The effective performance of nMQL is credited to the better penetration ability of the applied lubricant into machining interfaces. Furthermore, the MQL application with compressed air facilitated chip removal and heat dissipation during machining. Finally, the sustainability assessment through the Pugh matrix showcased the potential of nanofluid-MQL for machinability improvement of Inconel 625."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488614","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eaece6409707216edb8221","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"41","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"282fbc2a-ad5d-40ee-b617-268fd0e449a9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"41","pagesFromTo":"225-238","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755581722002231","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eaecb340970762632be31e","name":"Navneet","lastName":"Khanna","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0110aed3-e182-443e-9cca-7c119391df70"},{"objectId":"65eaecb340970762632be31d","name":"Anil Kumar","lastName":"Singla","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"856e4015-1c37-4602-918a-288bd7f9aaa4"},{"objectId":"65eaecb340970762632be31c","name":"Mohd","lastName":"Danish","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6307ec4a-ebdb-44a1-beef-993ef9e1ecbf"},{"objectId":"65eaecb340970762632be31b","name":"Kaushik M.","lastName":"Patel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b1150ae2-ced1-40b0-96c9-5545f335a44d"},{"objectId":"65eaecb340970762632be31a","name":"Mayur A.","lastName":"Makhesana","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5fa716a8-a944-42ca-83ba-8afa4319a336"},{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae592","name":"GRZEGORZ","lastName":"KRÓLCZYK","uuid":"CBFCAB23248F107BE0869A0A1B95424418771F3BF1C3230726107C2E5AFCDAD7015626B297AF4BA3889E7234B4F73D33C256E065E8A33D085071A5B816F9E9BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2967-1719","documentHash":"983b593f-a262-4fbd-83c5-754137e069b1"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.cirpj.2022.12.015"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["usługi kurierskie","logistyka","KEP","wskaźnik CSI"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["courier services","logistics","KEP","CSI index"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","uid":"bnV99khMVeG3t9dh4evZESg","uuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","parentUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","rootUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","name":"Politechnika Koszalińska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709247878c28a047392f13"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Ocena satysfakcji klienta w logistycznej obsłudze","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d54878c28514547a732","mniswId":"1002353","title":"Zeszyty Naukowe Wydziału Nauk Ekonomicznych / Politechnika Koszalińska","doi":null,"issn":"2300-1232","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"08d65b08-977b-4e1c-89f8-1fb59e9d4543"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eaae93409707216ed6fe85","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709247878c28a047392f13","65eaae93409707216ed6fe86"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Celem artykułu jest analiza i ocena satysfakcji klienta w logistycznej obsłudze przez przedsiębiorstwo działające na rynku kurierskich ekspresowych przesyłek na obszarze powiatu koszalińskiego.

However, owing to poor surface finish, accelerated tool wear, and high material removal cost, MMCs are categorized as difficult-to-cut composites. This article reviews sustainable machining under different lubrication and cooling approaches and the economics of the operation for MMCs. The study focuses on optimizing machinability factors, such as surface integrity, chip formation, tool wear, and sustainability analysis. To attain this goal, the review evaluates suitable cutting parameters for Aluminum, Titanium, Magnesium, and Copper-based metal matrix composites, which hitherto have not been explored or summarized comprehensively. This study provides strong guidance regarding selection of precise cutting parameters for MMCs. The findings of this review suggest that different cooling/lubrication technologies can optimize and improve the sustainability and machinability characteristics, extend tool life and surface quality, during the cutting operation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488617","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eadf47409707216eda834e","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"10","number":"6","doi":"","documentHash":"bbe472a3-15b8-4994-abb1-a762c1fceca0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"1637-1660","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40684-023-00521-8","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eadef540970762632b5ad2","name":"Muhammad Irfan","lastName":"Hussain","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fe5e8004-04b8-4eb9-893c-44b170ec1639"},{"objectId":"65eadef540970762632b5ad1","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Jamil","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"55e9a86b-8ddf-41b4-9b4e-54c65ee91dbd"},{"objectId":"65eadef540970762632b5ad0","name":"Ning","lastName":"He","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0276956e-dbe0-45e5-a30e-edcd24ebf953"},{"objectId":"65eadef540970762632b5acf","name":"Rashid Ali","lastName":"Laghari","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9a6d59e8-024f-4890-a750-c4e944e07c8a"},{"objectId":"611b1f299543c757bc082899","name":"MUNISH","lastName":"GUPTA","uuid":"F5865D4EDDEC75980E79207C030BE585C437E16B74094A84FCA3195D425EAB1657A884C28B18CBD0B0FAAB6D8CBDEAFFE4740A0D2A99F3AAF389A97DA5A5D8B0","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3b10e4c8-a02e-4698-9a16-fb80cf6020a1"},{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae592","name":"GRZEGORZ","lastName":"KRÓLCZYK","uuid":"CBFCAB23248F107BE0869A0A1B95424418771F3BF1C3230726107C2E5AFCDAD7015626B297AF4BA3889E7234B4F73D33C256E065E8A33D085071A5B816F9E9BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2967-1719","documentHash":"983b593f-a262-4fbd-83c5-754137e069b1"}],"doi":"10.1007/s40684-023-00521-8"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["social services","family assistant","family support"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","uid":"bHvub0W7DW61k4FKLYJQ3Zw","uuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","parentUuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","rootUuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Długosza w Częstochowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70923e878c28a0473925a8"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The support provided by Polish municipalities in the implementation of family assitance","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a342","mniswId":"200445","title":"Problemy Polityki Społecznej.

Accordingly, this seems to be the right time for an assessment of the level of organisation and funding of social services in terms of supporting families with a child by Polish municipalities. This article aims to depict the development process of family assitance in Polish municipalities. Empirical research focuses on the opinions of family assistants regarding the support provided by gmina authorities and the management of organisational units of social assistance where they are employed. The results of the research showed that family assitance in the form of a supportive and educational activity, with a high organisational level and good working conditions – as outlined by the original concept – is implemented only in some areas. The care and control approach to work, together with functional assistantship based on simple activities meeting the basic needs of families, are increasingly enforced on family assistants by the management. The aspirations of assistants – who form a professional community – to apply the therapeutic dimension of assistantship are being squandered. The Polish municipalities lack sufficient funds to employ adequate numbers of family assistants."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488619","journalIssue":{"objectId":"650837c84097077513a1d89c","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"60","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"30d553fb-258a-4f96-add9-0f8e5d1437a7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"60","pagesFromTo":"31-57","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.31971/pps/166481","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70923e878c28a0473925a8","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Krasiejko","uuid":"ED2789810AA66FFDDD5CB8DAC32115D9D5F0E084104692351D4B8A0F7894BB585DE69447B0597E4AB7EAD2CD156C8D8AA84C2486CA65519B7C4A5D13A89C2C79","orcidId":"0000-0003-2158-903X","documentHash":"7c82861e-acfa-48a8-a630-a5dfbdd4f99b"}],"doi":"10.31971/pps/166481"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["short-term ground displacements","GNSS observation residuals","earthquake vibrations","PPP","continuous wavelet transform"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Using GNSS Phase Observation Residuals and Wavelet Analysis to Detect Earthquakes","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d51878c285145479c60","mniswId":"1824","title":"Artificial Satellites","doi":null,"issn":"1509-3859","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"6f6fc286-7730-4829-ae9d-8ef780db424c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-01-19","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eaf1f540970762632c2c24","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65eaf1f540970762632c2c25","5e709422878c28a0473b6d76","65eaf1f540970762632c2c26"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs) are one of the techniques that can be used for the deformation monitoring caused by earthquakes. GNSSs enable the monitoring of specific areas affected by earthquakes in real-time and post-processing modes. This paper provides a novel method for the short-term displacement detection based on the phase residuals of GNSS observations. The study examines a natural earthquake from October 26, 2016, in Italy with Mw 6.1. In the proposed methodology, the residuals of the GNSS phase observations are derived using Precise Point Positioning. Then, residuals are transformed to the frequency domain using a wavelet transform, and the earthquake moment is identified using the anomalies detected in the scalogram, which do not appear in stable conditions. The described methodology allows for detecting the starting and ending moments of the earthquake. The methods described detected that the moment of the earthquake is visible in the residues 8 seconds after the seismic catalog time. The conducted experiments show that the use of signal analysis tools allows it to properly detect the ground vibrations in the residuals of GNSS phase observations and thus confirms the registration of ground vibrations in satellite observation data recorded by a GNSS receiver."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488621","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"58","pagesFromTo":"341-354","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://sciendo.com/pl/article/10.2478/arsa-2023-0014","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eaf1f540970762632c2c26","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Kudłacik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c161f864-3e99-491a-9f3d-b6ae96e6ebc0"},{"objectId":"65eaf1f540970762632c2c25","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Lackowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"433fa516-3f7a-4197-9a5c-024a99cdfad7"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6d76","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Kaźmierski","uuid":"5981482D3F990652B8C98CCB767F7CB00D1165F221C461FDB104FBEEEE02F523B3874786112BC409CBAC5C75B659F29B95675FF4431D6160E10A02F09320EAB0","orcidId":"0000-0002-7927-9416","documentHash":"0d50890e-0c0c-49e6-ac2f-ed2a712582ca"}],"doi":"10.2478/arsa-2023-0014"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"627a43be4097077f84eed89f","doi":null,"title":"Вялікае

is becoming a technology of the future and an attempt to meet the greatest communication problems of modern societies in terms of reducing noise, smog and the growing amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It is an alternative to other ecological power sources for motor vehicles and a necessity aimed at eliminating traditional combustion engines. Polish plans to dynamically implement a significant number of electric vehicles for general use are in line with global trends. The relationship between the number of vehicles and the capabilities of the infrastructure securing the charging of batteries of these vehicles becomes the basic determinant of the usefulness of this type of transport solutions. The core of the problem is illustrated by the presentation of potential needs in terms of accessibility, spatial distribution and a simulated number of charging points for electric cars in Poland. It is extremely important due to the existing limitations resulting from the technical parameters of charging devices, the time needed to replenish energy and vehicle congestion in urban agglomerations. The article consists of 5 parts. The main research problem is: How will the development of electromobility in Poland affect the management of the country’s energy infrastructure? Individual detailed problems concern the following issues: What is electromobility in Poland characterized by? What are the problems with recharging energy in electric vehicles? What conditions must be met for electric vehicles to be an important element of electricity storage? The result of the analysis, which was developed on the basis of statistical data research, applicable legal regulations, literature on the subject and the simulation carried out, allows to propose an algorithm for the management of infrastructure for charging electric vehicles, which will be a recommendation for business entities dealing with logistic security in the field of energy replenishment in batteries electric cars. The result of the article is the presentation of conclusions regarding the possibilities of the existing energy logistics infrastructure for charging electric vehicle batteries and the needs in this area resulting from the dynamic development of electromobility in Poland."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488628","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65e84d6f4097070499558f17","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"739e486a-44d7-43b1-9755-82d38e71855f"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"65f82bf94097076263600217","mniswId":null,"startDate":"2023-11-22","endDate":"2023-11-23","fullName":"42nd International Business Information Management Association Conference","shortName":"42nd IBIMA Conference","city":"Sewilla","country":"ES","website":"https://ibima.org/conference/42nd-ibima-conference/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"fb5b9579-5229-4e21-bdb5-f439aca9b145"},"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"Article ID 4220623","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ibimapublishing.com/p-articles/42ENV/2023/4220623/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094af878c28a0473c1a29","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"PAWLOS","uuid":"74EAE71BC03F304A41DEEDEF7395A6E44BBA17074D5FB7BFA8B168CEAA3945949AC37A519B6A4E81E5AB0A778FF0FAD1C28B9258C08CE857A2F2D3A1785CC59F","orcidId":"0000-0003-3267-5494","documentHash":"5f2f5b20-a55f-44e7-81eb-7ab6b0234e56"},{"objectId":"5e70940b878c28a0473b55a2","name":"Joanna","lastName":"KUBICKA","uuid":"725575D4AF77A3BAC49C926644F015D629E810337203C136F53E17814E8E102A0E6732D9816A95AE6F107A82A8F50894A5942C548011CEAE61FE38C3E311657B","orcidId":"0000-0002-1795-771X","documentHash":"0a1c2cd5-9e39-4138-ac26-c69f8f2b10ba"},{"objectId":"5e709376878c28a0473aa4da","name":"Magda","lastName":"LIGAJ","uuid":"9B2BDCCAC9A5D1005E2F835F583B10855EBA4C45B3712BC588357C6B811763168B307474C51D982228FFA5A0F58BCAC0F4545DBAEF151DF04315A78DB74476F8","orcidId":"0000-0002-0615-9739","documentHash":"f45c9381-b70a-4c4a-8c60-dbdf96b2c08c"},{"objectId":"5e709282878c28a047396fa8","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"SÓJKA","uuid":"712C2E2662B8DEF2C87E48E561D757DA8FE8959F6FA6DBED56F7D9CF131298B992EC32EA88A9E1C8C72E96A0951A9133B7CD76FBD40830AD7BC6E7CD498009CE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6953-2836","documentHash":"9b31b193-6070-4659-b3f7-d0cfd3b26f4a"},{"objectId":"5e709204878c28a04738eb69","name":"Teresa","lastName":"Kupczyk","uuid":"746CC0905412283CA936AA195315FF7D20AC2C08A9345CA509F96832F89B2DE63517C26C4F3B6711EFFA8630A9CDE9E671B0973C4D620D495A656DF93E079B62","orcidId":"0000-0003-0361-2128","documentHash":"b3782ffa-5dd7-442d-9554-0335d4f0944c"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["function words","semantic categories","lexicography"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Kategorie znaczeniowe haseł funkcyjnych w <I>Wielkim słowniku języka polskiego PAN</I>","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d54878c28514547aec8","mniswId":"23684","title":"Jezyk Polski","doi":null,"issn":"0021-6941","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f5410e39-ad13-4025-b63f-9f149a7e6e8e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2022-10-27","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9a94140970762631fbb12","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c3878c28a04739c385"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Function words have been a widely discussed topic in linguistics in Poland for many years.

In 2022, a second cross-sectional survey based on the Age Friendly Cities and Communities Questionnaire (AFCCQ) was conducted among 396 community-dwelling older citizens in the municipality. During times of the pandemic, scores for Social Participation went notably down, and scores for Respect and Social Inclusion increased. For the first time, based on survey data, four personas were found through cluster analysis. These personas ranged from the precariat and people with personal health issues with lower scores, to the silent majority without the limitations of health problems, and the upper echelon who score positively in all domains. Age-friendly policies in The Hague should focus particularly on the first two clusters through dedicated action plans, which would help steer efforts towards those most in need for support. This would help The Hague to become an age-friendly city for all, and not only for those living in good health and with sufficient financial means."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488633","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"340","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953623007190?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e9754740970762631a89bb","name":"Jeroen","lastName":"Dikken","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b7bb65c5-7abe-47bf-ad79-ae74b2eedb8e"},{"objectId":"65e9754740970762631a89ba","name":"Willeke H","lastName":"van Staalduinen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6a31903f-d826-4c6d-b572-cedc9580ef77"},{"objectId":"65275a2940e3ff22d34ab9c7","name":"JOOST","lastName":"HOOF","uuid":"857E2BB15B2A692D79E99BC2B06CB85CCCFED582F26F683B585E7DF6106505710F2594EBCCFBDB786B64099029C5DC49144243EBA4965707DF0A446C83659693","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"18236d3a-4785-455d-b289-e7751d5ed261"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.socscimed.2023.116362"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65ba0cfc4097075661bd33e4","doi":null,"title":"Encyklopedia Bezpieczeństwa Narodowego","year":2023,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-8017-473-3","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://ibo.wlo.wat.edu.pl/encyklopedia-bezpieczenstwa-narodowego/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"30e1f885-3374-4433-9b49-357634c97258","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb7cc","mniswId":"20700","name":"Dom Wydawniczy i Handlowy Elipsa","documentHash":"1742eaae-fab4-40e8-862c-b5e3287b8f51"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70921d878c28a0473901f5"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Państwa nieuznane (nieuznawane)","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9a406409707132d3247b4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70921d878c28a0473901f5"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059488635","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"437-439","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://katalog.nukat.edu.pl/lib/item?id=chamo:5715637&fromLocationLink=false&theme=nukat","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70921d878c28a0473901f5","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Modzelewski","uuid":"3CBFC2A51F0575664AC3E5C8E89F8AFAD4BECD01AA795DFA2212C238EB6C336C811B4A73AD611E44E2862716365A11F2A932C7181E5BA13BC80188CE39B54A58","orcidId":"0000-0003-1049-2873","documentHash":"864f2e78-d262-4c31-afaf-1dd8b18c3276"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["main gas pipeline steels;

A significant number of non-metallic inclusions forming chains stretched along the direction of pipe rolling were found in the microstructure of the LTO steel. The lowest values of elongation at break and impact toughness of the steel were determined for the lower part of the pipe close to its inner surface. FCG tests at a low stress ratio (R = 0.1) did not reveal a significant change in its growth rate in degraded 17H1S steel compared to steel in the AR state. During tests at a stress ratio R = 0.5, the effect of degradation was more pronounced. The Paris’ law region of the da/dN—∆K diagram for the LTO steel corresponding to the lower part of the pipe close to its inner surface was higher than those for the steel in the AR state and the LTO steel corresponding to the higher part of the pipe.

This study employed vector autoregression modelling, as well as the Granger causality concept, and focused on changes in price behavior from May 2004 to May 2021. The findings suggest fundamental differences in the short-term price behavior of two post-communist countries. Over the investigated period, Poland strengthened the position in the EU pigmeat market and could be classified as a price leading country for the certain markets. The case of Lithuania demonstrated that countries with lower productivity and the dominant share of pig population on small-scale farms as well as high price level became vulnerable and evolved towards a viable national pig farming structures. Hence, a movement of new Member States towards greater market integration must be linked to the spread of innovations in pig farming or exit of uncompetitive farms. In the case of Lithuania, a promising direction of policy implications is support for the establishment of modern and competitive medium-sized farms, as well as the spread of relevant knowledge and innovations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488643","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"370","pagesFromTo":"87-106","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.zer.waw.pl/pdf-145406-73454","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e86abe409707049959ab3a","name":"Nelė","lastName":"Jurkėnaitė","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"181ece5d-88cf-4d40-8ae5-693a79b7678d"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b598e","name":"Alina","lastName":"Syp","uuid":"3BA26CF43B10BB116104759D374D08C3F8867F366A4D1D61784CFDECDBD45D72660A3DC025D6CA60B881CE29E88F52F041C2A34C0CFDB51B5EF9629133116D97","orcidId":"0000-0002-0190-9350","documentHash":"98e0086f-a483-4e76-8ee4-6eddb7646be3"}],"doi":"10.30858/zer/145406"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65ba0cfc4097075661bd33e4","doi":null,"title":"Encyklopedia

aim of the conducted observations was to examine the effect of fertiliser produced based on plant digestate and resulting from the process of anaerobic fermentation of a substrate with sorghum (20%), beet (60%), rye (10%) and grass (10%) on the growth and yield of sorghum and corn. A strict, single-factor pot experiment was carried out in 2017–2018 in the Swojec Agricultural Experimental Unit at the University of Life Sciences in Wrocław. Fertilisation with digestate was the tested factor, with a focus on its influence on selected energy plants. Sucrosorgo sorghum and Atletico maize were analysed. During the research, the pots were placed in a vegetation hall. The research proved that the use of digestate-based fertiliser improves the productivity of both sorghum and maize, but only with an additional dose of basic macronutrients. The optimal variant is a fertiliser dose of 20 g enriched with 1.0 NPK. Increasing the dose to 30 g and 1.5 NPK generally did not result in a significant increase in plant height or in fresh and dry weights."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488648","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"33","pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.pjoes.com/The-Reaction-of-Maize-and-Sorghum-nto-Fertilization-with-Granulated-Fertilizer-nObtained,172049,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eef7a34097076263b97d9a","name":"Józef","lastName":"Szlachta","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"efaa4e6c-9374-4bcb-8c57-da99d886389c"},{"objectId":"65eef7a34097076263b97d99","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Kordas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"52b9ab2d-bbc7-46ea-ac6b-51611a736ac0"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c6e","name":"AGNIESZKA","lastName":"LEJMAN","uuid":"50343282ECAC867B34426ACD2D393258C8984AED8EB2104F5A9CF8915A1521068B93B4193FD0551D40D103A9DC5E93B47D246229C0156195EE8F263670D31207","orcidId":"0000-0002-3885-3725","documentHash":"a47f49ff-aa75-44c9-8487-19bbd7a8d15e"},{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395e87","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kuc","uuid":"04376663C26D4491CC6A2124AD450D5645314A4903C4225B8DDBFB301EC9022660CCBC7272372C6EE90968AF7244369BC4BE674447B388121F291FD08701BDA7","orcidId":"0000-0002-0258-9977","documentHash":"5abc5fa5-9ab5-4727-9067-6f104d5a2955"},{"objectId":"5e7091f4878c28a04738db2d","name":"HUBERT","lastName":"PRASK","uuid":"AF3CAFEE97204A2CC42F2E42E154974DD90D0F3423CA0CB0C1C8380D63C23277303080CC974F734FF4B0AFA355D8EA6C9284512E1200D2302F21C453684E421A","orcidId":"0000-0002-6651-0172","documentHash":"c9c49542-4f1b-4d27-a852-135e757b934d"},{"objectId":"5e7091f4878c28a04738db16","name":"MAŁGORZATA","lastName":"FUGOL","uuid":"1FD2AB17B2AF364114E50DCE4D4264B51C3177F3C4BF8619131FD43EEB2288C28F1DEFA83EC7616A05C85513157FABBE306235F464C7B7F9B76D020B52A22B22","orcidId":"0000-0002-1080-8711","documentHash":"37120d10-356f-4058-93ca-bf573fc5cd55"}],"doi":"10.15244/pjoes/172049"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["kynurenic acid","erythritol","mannitol","citric acid","honey","yeast"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Honey’s Yeast—New Source of Valuable Species for Industrial Applications","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","doi":null,"issn":"1422-0067","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"850accc5-0c0e-4f6c-9a84-eaa108a84f20"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-26","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e83290409707626314056f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65e832904097076263140570","65e832904097076263140571","5e709415878c28a0473b5fa4","65e832904097076263140572","5e709442878c28a0473b90c9"]},"issue":"9","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Honey is a rich source of compounds with biological activity; moreover, it is a valuable source of various microorganisms. The aim of this study was to isolate and identify yeast from a sample of lime honey from Poland as well as to assess its ability to biosynthesize value-added chemicals such as kynurenic acid, erythritol, mannitol, and citric acid on common carbon sources. Fifteen yeast strains belonging to the species Yarrowia lipolytica, Candida magnolia, and Starmerella magnoliae were isolated. In shake-flask screening, the best value-added compound producers were chosen. In the last step, scaling up of the culture in the bioreactor was performed. A newly isolated strain of Y. lipolytica No. 12 produced 3.9 mg/L of kynurenic acid growing on fructose. Strain Y. lipolytica No. 9 synthesized 32.6 g/L of erythritol on technical glycerol with a low concentration of byproducts. Strain Y. lipolytica No. 5 produced 15.1 g/L of mannitol on technical glycerol, and strain No. 3 produced a very high amount of citric acid (76.6 g/L) on technical glycerol. In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to report the use of yeast isolates from honey to produce valuable chemicals. This study proves that natural products such as lime honey can be an excellent source of wild-type yeasts with valuable production properties."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488649","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"1-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/9/7889","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e832904097076263140572","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Lazar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3674cb48-d854-4d77-8056-2e3705e94e5e"},{"objectId":"65e832904097076263140571","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Janiec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"960b116f-e577-4ab0-b9f5-d67c4e98414e"},{"objectId":"65e832904097076263140570","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Ziuzia","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cc8e2313-1c8e-42ae-b58a-307ae75e905d"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b90c9","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Rakicka-Pustułka","uuid":"188C35714DB6FAB796F53FB2AFB38A45ADA5D9AAD4D26B62D394E125168064CD0355F56EC476C2785BDB6FAAED9D54659B7FA5B51D744337BB860F80E7DD2507","orcidId":"0000-0003-4457-2468","documentHash":"75da520d-4da8-43dc-a903-45b516536e0c"},{"objectId":"5e709415878c28a0473b5fa4","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Wróbel-Kwiatkowska","uuid":"BC7DEAA945DD4AB38E75057FFC725B7CC1890D3209FFCE3A6CBEBCD894EB07E286B4CF83FFA4BBF97D7A555EF09A16CC21BC23268FFC01F358F3D27235D2FB91","orcidId":"0000-0002-9511-1381","documentHash":"43dca44d-845b-442a-96d3-1fea1089b60f"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms24097889"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Average energy burden","Machine learning","Sustainable cities","Convolutional neural network","Computer vision"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcda","uid":"bHeYtjjfY4ce3IZzTvh2chw","uuid":"4ab10dcb-1c97-4a34-94a6-70107b058fd0","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcda","parentUuid":"4ab10dcb-1c97-4a34-94a6-70107b058fd0","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcda","rootUuid":"4ab10dcb-1c97-4a34-94a6-70107b058fd0","name":"Akademia Śląska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63ca0ab97523407151513a35"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Examining the role of passive design indicators in energy burden reduction: Insights from a machine learning and deep learning approach","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477484","mniswId":"2890","title":"BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT","doi":null,"issn":"0360-1323","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"27b2c61b-a819-4d1e-bfd6-5fdc1943cf81"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65ea0007409707132d3b7186","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65ea0007409707132d3b7188","63ca0ab97523407151513a35","65ea0007409707132d3b7189","65ea0007409707132d3b718a","65ea0007409707132d3b718b","65ea0007409707132d3b718c","65ea0007409707132d3b718d","65ea0007409707132d3b718e","65ea0007409707132d3b718f"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Passive design characteristics (PDC) play a pivotal role in reducing the energy burden on households without imposing additional financial constraints on project stakeholders. However, the scarcity of PDC data has posed a challenge in previous studies when assessing their energy-saving impact. To tackle this issue, this research introduces an innovative approach that combines deep learning-powered computer vision with machine learning techniques to examine the relationship between PDC and energy burden in residential buildings. In this study, we employ a convolutional neural network computer vision model to identify and measure key indicators, including window-to-wall ratio (WWR), external shading, and operable window types, using Google Street View images within the Chicago metropolitan area as our case study. Subsequently, we utilize the derived passive design features in conjunction with demographic characteristics to train and compare various machine learning methods. These methods encompass Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Support Vector Regression, culminating in the development of a comprehensive model for energy burden prediction. Our framework achieves a 74.2 % accuracy in forecasting the average energy burden. These results yield invaluable insights for policymakers and urban planners, paving the way toward the realization of smart and sustainable cities."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488653","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65ea0007409707132d3b7187","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"250","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"c4dda829-8233-4465-a258-4080ad77fc39"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"250","pagesFromTo":"111126","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0360132323011538?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65ea0007409707132d3b718f","name":"Matthew","lastName":"Sisk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d33ba6af-55ca-4cf7-9673-1fa4b7567902"},{"objectId":"65ea0007409707132d3b718e","name":"Tolga","lastName":"Tasdizen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f52ad5d5-548f-4ac9-ac86-a3ce470c5dd6"},{"objectId":"65ea0007409707132d3b718d","name":"Mitra","lastName":"Alirezaei","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d5ad4f65-6fb5-4f01-99be-3ef556014239"},{"objectId":"65ea0007409707132d3b718c","name":"Xiaohe","lastName":"Yue","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c61930e5-786d-4a96-91f7-9b82fef1962a"},{"objectId":"65ea0007409707132d3b718b","name":"Quynh Camthi","lastName":"Nguyen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3b91097e-ea7a-44b2-857c-11c672967a56"},{"objectId":"65ea0007409707132d3b718a","name":"Chaoli","lastName":"Wang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3d3d909d-1463-4222-96ad-b635f76c2592"},{"objectId":"65ea0007409707132d3b7189","name":"Siyuan","lastName":"Yao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5f30c322-5a4e-4f44-a9f1-db93840c2ca4"},{"objectId":"65ea0007409707132d3b7188","name":"Siavash","lastName":"Ghorbany","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"53fbae0c-2207-442d-9e20-16079f58fbd6"},{"objectId":"63ca0ab97523407151513a35","name":"Ming","lastName":"Hu","uuid":"89D38FDF89416B157F16BDDF76E2C1E8881AE89400A7F876FF79B0B96E4443FB6286486AC4B1FD21303A6AA22FCA226391F0ECCA94E94F436754FCD142780EE2","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a22f6697-f643-4e52-9179-c1b1e8324391"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.111126"},{"mainLanguageName":null,"keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Rola układu żylnego mózgu w schorzeniach neurologicznych.","mainLanguage":null,"journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e95e35409707132d2b5ad4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65e95e35409707132d2b5ad5","65e95e35409707132d2b5ad6"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059488656","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e95e35409707132d2b5ad6","name":"Derkowski","lastName":"Wojciech","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e0a58818-13f8-4ec3-8d0f-f4bbad50978e"},{"objectId":"65e95e35409707132d2b5ad5","name":"Kędzia","lastName":"Alicja","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7ad719d3-dbbc-4f63-be7c-603d38788c43"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63188a62409707796837f530","doi":null,"title":"Zwycięski pokój czy rozejm na pokolenie?

Although two types of clause-fusion mechanisms have operated during the grammaticalization of the wziąć SVCs, their contribution to this process has been dissimilar. The evolution from the syndetic CC with the coordinator i to the wziąć SVC via a pseudo-coordinated (PC) stage (i.e., the wziąć-i PC) has constituted a faster and stronger drift, while the more direct evolution originating in the asyndetic CC with wziąć has been slower and less pervasive."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488664","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"65","pagesFromTo":"11-36","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://spilplus.journals.ac.za/pub/article/view/967","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e9a8ff40970762631fb896","name":"Alexander","lastName":"Andrason","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9cbc4ae8-0546-4811-b2ce-96e0268b7e01"},{"objectId":"5e7092bd878c28a04739bd83","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Moroz","uuid":"27818647F8BD3D6EAE1ABE0AF260014765611A18FF9852481BF383FDF98982105CF90BCCCB2E437E6567A67120BC1FB2D822BDA7DE8331866A1EE617FE5FEECD","orcidId":"0000-0002-0414-4832","documentHash":"815959ee-5d58-4736-9c96-6b7fffa9a7bc"},{"objectId":"5e7092bc878c28a04739bcbd","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Gębka-Wolak","uuid":"8B3254F50C3E0193CE55436506E1ED3FFDBBE87B385E544C4C4175EB7F55514FF83B5592630BAF209DCAA65E9F664D662B201CBFEA38F8F373022BD644C4577F","orcidId":"0000-0003-4587-496X","documentHash":"9a1ebafd-aa44-4dfd-b964-fc6fa8d5a889"}],"doi":"10.5842/65-1-967"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cultural life","social life","Radziwiłłs","prince Antoni Radziwiłł","Sude-tes","Książ","Szczawno","Cieplice","Lądek"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63a192d54097073ee830c290","doi":null,"title":"Uzdrowiska arystokratyczne","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-62563-80-7","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://katalogi.bn.org.pl/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma991053064660205066&context=L&vid=48OMNIS_NLOP:48OMNIS_NLOP&lang=pl&search_scope=NLOP_IZ_NZ&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=LibraryCatalog&query=any,contains,uzdrowiska%20arystokratyczne&offset=0","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"0ea6c1ce-5dcd-4294-bdc8-90aa5d8f084c","publisher":{"objectId":"5d75ea31878c284eaa45cdd9","mniswId":"44800","name":"Oficyna Wydawnicza Arboretum s.c.

Prince Radziwill, governor of the Grand Duchy of Poznań, is known above all as a composer of ﬁrst Faust music and a talented cellist, as well as and musi-cal patron, embracing many artists of his time and maintaining contacts with famous musicians, as Chopin and Beethoven. Trough his marriage with the Prussian princess Luisa Hohenzollern he initiated the so-called „Berlin branch” of his family, and during his political and social activity established numerous contacts, especially with the Prussian and Silesian elites, who willingly visited the Sudetian resorts or residenced permanently there.Te source basis for the topic consists of the unpublished correspondence of the Radziwiłłs family, stored in the collection of the Archiwum Główne Akt Dawnych in Warsaw in the collection 354 „Archiwum Warszawskie Radziwiłłów” (section XIII: „Secret family archive”, letters written from Lądek-Zdrój, Szczawno-Zdrój and Cieplice-Zdrój in the years 1813–1830).

The study deals with workability class assessment of seven different sewer system localities. The significance of this research lies in the mutual comparison of workability class assessment of these seven localities in terms of two different workability standards. Each of the standards represents an independent model of assessment and classification of workability. The first standard (CSN 73 1001) classifies soils and rocks into seven workability classes, while the second (EN ISO 14688) comprises only three workability classes. Each of the approaches has its advantages and disadvantages. In comparison to the first one, the second standard permits faster and easier classification of rocks, but may be less fair to investors or developers when considering the real engineering-geological conditions and costs of implementation. Rocks were newly classified into three (easy, medium and difficult) categories of earthwork realization difficulty. In the study, 33 layers were classified in the category of easy realization of earthworks, 8 layers in the category of a medium degree of earthwork realization difficulty, and two layers in the category of a difficult realization of earthworks."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488670","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-40461-6","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6728acc9fdbe8307b08cce83","name":"David","lastName":"Sysala","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"57b41394-e5e1-4b0c-970d-4ff61c71b62c"},{"objectId":"6728acc9fdbe8307b08cce82","name":"Simona","lastName":"Matušková","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ac957a06-e7a7-4f25-9115-d7d5a189aae5"},{"objectId":"6728acc9fdbe8307b08cce81","name":"Kateřina","lastName":"Růžičková","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1162a82a-b5ae-4d1c-9666-b65ad4f02b71"},{"objectId":"6728acc9fdbe8307b08cce80","name":"Jan","lastName":"Kubáč","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6b9034d6-dedd-46b0-8645-7c8fc478a244"},{"objectId":"6728acc9fdbe8307b08cce7f","name":"Marian","lastName":"Marschalko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ca736551-18e0-42d4-91f2-0caf7774904d"},{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395d3f","name":"Zofia","lastName":"Zięba","uuid":"64D0A3C69EE4F7DA0DD35D7BD8DC9437E9D46A84AB521BB9DA2DAA8CA3A917B7F982BC2DEB5738422084B80B11810CDB88460B9F5A1DA0960AD6D6C409DD2B6D","orcidId":"0000-0002-0106-3527","documentHash":"2132c0d0-846b-47a4-bd7d-bd54f95f36cf"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e1be","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Dąbrowska","uuid":"912B21E3B1C219D461FCBFBC60EC1CA04F36B6A270BC3813CF61690095E2A7A63843A49EB9CC233801D657FB07CBD080E2B2E5678F3BDBA3E191C8B4182B72C3","orcidId":"0000-0002-6017-6919","documentHash":"c0645dc1-e1b1-40f9-8bf5-929fc0eeb278"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-40461-6"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65a11e0b4097076c1450dc19","doi":null,"title":"Logistyka w ratownictwie 2023","year":2023,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-67033-95-4","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://inw-spatium.pl/2023/12/21/logistyka-w-ratownictwie-2023/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"6d431efe-7c58-41de-ac68-187220151c8d","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb838","mniswId":"33600","name":"Instytut Naukowo-Wydawniczy Spatium","documentHash":"8f469cfa-5520-46e1-a446-7a0c10498b68"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","uid":"bt6mbuLY9Vpc_KWGkV1Lk4w","uuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092db878c28a04739e279"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Osoby z niepełnosprawnością w procesie podróży lotniczej","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e982a240970762631d5308","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092db878c28a04739e279"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059488674","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"103-116","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://inw-spatium.pl/2023/12/21/logistyka-w-ratownictwie-2023/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092db878c28a04739e279","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Hawlena","uuid":"E7A02B44AE31B9F4731B85E1D6C0D9D635FE9D5F8EBD674FA68027B9507DCD85527B94BD6FB6C093DCFA867F6A22B70B3F2EF77B269B8A5D5583C3180896DC80","orcidId":"0000-0003-2547-7641","documentHash":"ddacb331-7b37-4bf0-809c-5b1aa26ded9b"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["dynamiczne zdolności","wdrażanie technologii","uwarunkowania"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dynamic capabilities","technology adoption","determinants"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"64f5966340970739aa7cd104","doi":null,"title":"Edukacja dla demokracji.

For the first time, the IGS reprocessing products included not just GPS and GLONASS, but also the Galileo constellation. In this study, we describe the methodology and results of the orbit combination provided by the IGS Analysis Center Coordinator (IGS ACC) at Geoscience Australia. The quality of the combined orbit products was cross-checked with the individual IGS Repro3 Analysis Center (AC) contributions. The internal consistency of the individual Analysis Center (AC) solutions with the combined orbits was assessed based on the root mean square of the 3D orbit differences. In 2020, the mean consistency of the combination is at the level of 9, 23, and 15 mm for GPS, GLONASS, and Galileo, respectively. The external validation of the orbits was performed using Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR). We proposed a novel approach to handling detector-specific biases in the results of SLR validation, which reduced the standard deviation of SLR residuals by up to 13% for Galileo FOC satellites. This method is based on bias aligning the offsets to single-photon SLR stations that were treated as a reference. The proposed approach increased the internal consistency of the SLR dataset, facilitating the detection of orbit modeling issues. The standard deviation of SLR residuals of the best individual solution versus the combined solution equals 13/13, 15/17, 17/17, 18/19 mm for Galileo-FOC, -IOV, GLONASS-K1B, -M, respectively. Therefore, the combined solution can be considered equal in quality compared to the best individual AC solutions. Searching for patterns in SLR residuals for different satellite-Sun-Earth geometries revealed that some orbit modeling issues are not fully diminished for individual ACs. Eventually, our findings suggest that the delivered combined orbit product may be considered the best solution overall, as it benefits from the best individual solutions for each satellite type."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488686","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"97","pagesFromTo":"1-29","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00190-023-01777-3","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eaf33640970762632c2ced","name":"Salim","lastName":"Masoumi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dc80d7e2-f734-4d8a-93ac-144eab238e68"},{"objectId":"65a89b3b40e3ff6b129e0c79","name":"Filip","lastName":"Gałdyn","uuid":"9D49D628A0618A231D984697A4598F4E8EBE9EB592A764A8619F24493487D7B817B766E5D62DA751EB573E5C2CBB1FA206BF2525FBD4E112893E6D947D6A7EB5","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b6b9c637-a0c7-4d3f-8ce4-1013af277f34"},{"objectId":"602f925a9543c7410626f61e","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Zajdel","uuid":"5E7BB79C3A34BEF743303834A2DBB23BF5EFF85CEB7F1AFDE8C949BF43ECB7477C36C3D2ECD294A54E31DAE35D3937A3551D6FDD070CF1252A87DB6EB38D4ACF","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"de7129cf-4f7b-4a9c-8998-38645d850a36"},{"objectId":"602f502d9543c7410626f327","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Strugarek","uuid":"4DB11E16279FA436512269EA82BD850FD82E8E5DA213D26E08A13A4A8F28292CCBBBA33FD1016B997D07A1CE4B21A9954156A239C8CA2B00FDB5254BAF9AE15E","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3e59abf1-b904-4d93-af2f-528c98d6c757"},{"objectId":"5f0e6d807523405869ccc283","name":"GRZEGORZ","lastName":"BURY","uuid":"F0D07A78A7870BF886CEC14863E2610B2CEE2198FCCD232ED3F7C5B9E24998E66AB5A4E22B9A3280CEAB8A387A5974EE9F58475239EE664E33C5B6E3EF6DD3A8","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"acc86b11-d230-41d0-87d6-6fe47544a29a"},{"objectId":"5e709437878c28a0473b83c7","name":"KRZYSZTOF","lastName":"SOŚNICA","uuid":"22D515E8674D468ED4D4CF62223E7EECD8B8352CEB0CD1836B9DDC1CE8294387C0820DC8358CDFCBC932A875FC2E9DCD5A7090797CD99D2610AC43E60CE18002","orcidId":"0000-0001-6181-1307","documentHash":"083640a6-2e12-412c-8dfb-f1627940b3cb"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00190-023-01777-3"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["ubezpieczenia","szkoły","przedszkola","ubezpieczenia NNW","oświata"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["insurance","schools","preschools (kindergartens)","accident insurance","education"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Ubezpieczenia szkolne w Polsce : problematyka dystrybucji","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a31d","mniswId":"200049","title":"Prawo Asekuracyjne","doi":null,"issn":"1233-5681","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"2cb58e60-4e71-40ff-9889-a6ac66d1d095"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2022-12-15","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e978fb40970762631b3655","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c3878c28a04739c264","5e7093e7878c28a0473b3039"]},"issue":"4 (113)","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059488688","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"3-23","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093e7878c28a0473b3039","name":"Michał","lastName":"Ziemiak","uuid":"ACC6DBB1F88F455F36A168AA4E8F9B0C4E6DAE2A739A6934D8974CB01E849B5C2E5805DFA3037450C5F33A755701B19DD4EC1C9D95E6518476D7ECB397EBB4CC","orcidId":"0000-0001-8543-9458","documentHash":"a98f0da6-a40b-41a0-8595-b13bb8584bca"},{"objectId":"5e7092c3878c28a04739c264","name":"Damian","lastName":"Walczak","uuid":"44B66A10FCE8078A30676D99E7F541F1C4D45B228D5B41DB1C230CAA9A1321D26903D6CCF191BE726D5A2805AED1EEACA2DF41670A6DE7B98948DAE8BCBE444B","orcidId":"0000-0002-2986-9928","documentHash":"c996c02e-4275-4d41-adae-e596147e2d2a"}],"doi":"10.5604/01.3001.0016.2758"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65eeb8014097076263b57a97","doi":null,"title":"Biomateriały nadzieją przyszłości.

The aim of the article is to present disruptions in the COVID-19 pandemic occurring in the supply chain of companies from the automotive industry. The specific objectives are the identification and characterization of companies operating in automotive supply chains, defining changes in the automotive industry during the pandemic, and showing the types of disruptions in supply chains and ways to counteract these unfavorable situations. Design/Methodology/Approach: Companies from the automotive industry operating in Poland were selected for the research purposefully. Using the random selection method, 500 companies from the automotive industry were selected for the study, which constituted a large research sample. The data sources were surveys conducted in June 2023 among 500 enterprises in the form of a direct telephone interview. Findings: The main disruptions and problems in the supply chain were longer order execution times, increased costs of transport, storage, and labor, as well as limited timeliness of deliveries. However, as a rule, disruptions lasted up to 1 year. One in ten enterprises declared that the disturbances are still ongoing. Half of the enterprises did not experience support from their partners in the supply chain. Despite this, 60% of enterprises did not seek or use alternative suppliers or buyers. The same share of enterprises made operational decisions during the pandemic, while ¼ made strategic decisions. The pandemic also did not affect radical changes in supply chains, such as resigning from Asian suppliers in favor of European ones. Practical implications: The results will fill in the gap concerning supply chain disruptions in the automotive industry. Originality/Value: The new information about impact impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on disruptions in supply chains."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488693","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"XXVII","pagesFromTo":"238-252","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ersj.eu/journal/3359","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"66802d42fdbe83464a0df21f","name":"Bogdan","lastName":"Klepacki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a6157da2-7140-4adb-9a8e-1ee13bd79e14"},{"objectId":"66802d42fdbe83464a0df21e","name":"Luiza","lastName":"Ochnio","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3ad8d118-fa20-48a2-9a75-baf2017dac0c"},{"objectId":"66802d42fdbe83464a0df21d","name":"Andras","lastName":"Szeberenyi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d7450271-0d5f-4037-8187-5031c314f328"},{"objectId":"66802d42fdbe83464a0df21c","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Bełdycka-Bórawska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"25748ac1-075d-45f0-a68a-a7c9e503ea5e"},{"objectId":"66802d42fdbe83464a0df21b","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bórawski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0db90b29-aaee-4aad-a8fa-57df48d11a6b"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a04739219e","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Rokicki","uuid":"09D3E059980AC0BA78EE02AA296975295D2C638DF63B9D7D08700323C4FEE3780B322FB502208BA55AE7B9236416EF2434F8C4D328F11E7C930FE643DA329CBD","orcidId":"0000-0003-3356-2643","documentHash":"d06af30f-77ee-4fb7-8d55-4042a566a456"}],"doi":"10.35808/ersj/3359"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65c74d1e40970762632b5772","doi":null,"title":"Framing

Despite an extensive body of knowledge on the matter, the theory is fragmented, and a classification is lacking. Therefore, this study investigated how older people experience the sense of safety and security in an age-friendly city. A total of four focus group sessions were organised in The Hague comprising 38 older people. Based on the outcomes of the sessions, the sense of safety and security was classified into two main domains: a sense of safety and security impacted by intentional acts and negligence (for instance, burglary and violence), and a sense of safety and security impacted by non-intentional acts (for instance, incidents, making mistakes online). Both domains manifest into three separate contexts, namely the home environment, the outdoor environment and traffic and the digital environment.

rapidly expanding field of Scan-to-BIM applications highlights the importance of model uncertainty assessment in describing the quality of modeling results. Although there have been recent research advancements in point cloud-based building modeling, there has been limited investigation into accurately analyzing error propagation. This paper estimates the geometry uncertainty in 3D modeling based on a strict application of geodetic stochastic modeling. Statistical uncertainty is incorporated into the building reconstruction process and procedures that enable self-verification within this process are developed. The method can be successfully used to evaluate the dimensional uncertainty of generated BIMs, which is especially important in the field of civil\r\nengineering with high accuracy requirements concerning metric quality control. Follow-up research will also\r\nconsider systematic errors and apply the methods to other 3D point cloud acquisition techniques."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488716","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"154","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926580523002625","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eaf19840970762632c2a14","name":"Hans-Gerd","lastName":"Maas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"964ec849-083a-4966-b29d-4b3e19b8f8ed"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d60","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Jarząbek-Rychard","uuid":"9BA67D6E5F5BC16199DC2A1A7FDA78B2BF8E72495EEBF9C59D1088CC83470321610C72E2D6565685E2E4B53DC558BE2113A04A983EE4A099C9ABC8C57FA6EB99","orcidId":"0000-0002-3377-3574","documentHash":"9b862e42-877e-4044-866a-8eac1a988e56"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.autcon.2023.105002"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6267aa3b40970720eb516b41","doi":"10.12797/9788381386388","title":"Matka Katarzyna z Kłobucka (1552-1620) współzałożycielka zgromadzenia sióstr augustianek w Polsce, red.
