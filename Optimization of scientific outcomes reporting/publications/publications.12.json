In vitro bioassays\nconfirmed all of the abovementioned properties. ZCR6 was able to produce indole acetic acid\n(IAA), siderophores, and ammonia, solubilized Ca3(PO4)2, and showed surface active properties\nand activity of cellulase and very high activity of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase\n(297 nmol α-ketobutyrate mg−1 h−1). The strain degraded petroleum hydrocarbons (76.52% of the\ninitial hydrocarbon content was degraded) and was resistant to Cd, Zn, and Cu (minimal inhibitory\nconcentrations reached 5, 15, and 10 mM metal, respectively). The genome of the ZCR6 strain\nconsisted of 5,507,067 bp, and a total of 5055 genes were annotated, of which 4943 were protein-\ncoding sequences. Annotation revealed the presence of genes associated with nitrogen fixation,\nphosphate solubilization, sulfur metabolism, siderophore biosynthesis and uptake, synthesis of IAA,\nethylene modulation, heavy metal resistance, exopolysaccharide biosynthesis, and organic compound\ndegradation.

Therefore, the question arises as to how to effectively and safely protect plants by using chemicals, the number of which is decreasing each year. The aim of this study was to evaluate the fungistatic effect of 2 acetylthiophenethiosemicarbazone (2actpTS) and Cis-jasmonethiosemicarbazone (JTS) against Fusarium culmorum (Fc) on winter wheat seedlings. The influence of thiosemicarbazones (TSs) on the health status and phytotoxicity of seedlings and soil biological activity was investigated. Before TSs application (watering or spraying), soil was infected with F. culmorum (strain No. 37). The substance type and method of its application significantly influenced only the fresh weight of the seedlings. The varying phytotoxicity of the molecules depended primarily on their application method to the plants. The highest seedling phytotoxicity was recorded when compounds were applied during watering and the lowest when they were sprayed. The results showed that the application of substances 2actpTS and JTS, both in the form of watering and spraying, had a positive effect on plant health status, as expressed by the disease index (DI) value. The presence of the infectious agent and the type of chemical compound increased soil enzyme activity. The highest total number of bacteria was found in the soil that was infected with Fc and in soil samples where JTS was applied by watering and spraying. The highest utilization of amines, amides and amino acids by microorganisms was found in the samples where JTS was applied. The obtained results will be used to create intermediate products for the protection of cereals against Fusarium diseases, not only at the stage of germination and tillage of plants, but also at subsequent developmental stages."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057789341","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61d431cf2467f0627d077fec","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"f75e7399-5df9-48a8-bced-9ecdfd23d8d2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"116","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/1/116","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61d431cf2467f0627d077fe5","name":"Francesca","lastName":"Degola","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3937-251X","documentHash":"321307cd-472d-4bea-a990-265f897ab239"},{"objectId":"61d431cf2467f0627d077fe4","name":"Giorgio","lastName":"Pelosi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c6ee1fd9-0d93-4d7d-99fa-c96d0bc8acdf"},{"objectId":"61d431cf2467f0627d077fe1","name":"Franco","lastName":"Bisceglie","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-9165-0356","documentHash":"5c025e4b-6f88-4a0b-bf8e-6b28044751ea"},{"objectId":"61d431cf2467f0627d077fe0","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Mielniczuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e457502a-b66a-41f9-93ce-3e9e985975f7"},{"objectId":"61d431cf2467f0627d077fdc","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Jamiołkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9709877d-219d-44aa-8a0e-95355ead5df2"},{"objectId":"5e7094f9878c28a0473c824f","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Grzęda","uuid":"1810C0F547C6F6EA7FD01468A6E754423E536B6D91C0181BB190F691B28510EF7AA575938077E445F3763AF4A7BDB2A0B3D5565A1178B1783AD9DCD7EE2BAEF9","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"958eead6-66af-4f79-adf5-15e8655118f8"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a04739964b","name":"Anna","lastName":"Gałązka","uuid":"BBBEBA72FA1C7DBE279BDCFF9C4A9FDB57AD4B7C282D80236A9A5AB66A2A8999CBE1503DAB7B8CFB064E90654A217E95D9B8DF3D2611999E3A0DED218AE2A2C0","orcidId":"0000-0001-5504-5706","documentHash":"932a9b6a-69cb-4e58-8369-93147d324a4e"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a0473909e9","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Skwaryło-Bednarz","uuid":"8D0CF29E672ADC955734C671CD135B719448D2A7A8A7F2170CDD4F1FD26C7386BA0674C28924AF57FDF0E3182F58928F6BAE4C790C1176C4B349FDCDBB8E01B1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8608-9138","documentHash":"5a570333-f59f-49a3-8520-e27c196182fc"}],"doi":"10.3390/agronomy12010116"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709193878c28a04737f076","uid":"bCqlW6h6zLWtH9yEf7K0C7w","uuid":"f52e973e-8178-4182-9255-a2732fc2c77e","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Centrum Archeologii Śródziemnomorskiej UW im. prof.

goal of the research was to determine of average asbestos dust values in different types of buildings and possible deviations from these values, when taking measurements in different rooms of the same building. Variability of fibres concentration was analyzed over short periods of time in different places of tested building. The study included various types of buildings containing asbestos, typical for Central and Eastern European countries with different construction. An analysis was made of the reasons for the diversity of dust concentrations ranging from < 300 to 16,000 fibres/m3 in connection with the building structure, asbestos location, degree of damage and intensity of building exploitation. Properly operated residential buildings containing asbestos inside outer sandwich walls features low concentration of dust < 300–400 f/m3. Novelty: Buildings not yet described by the literature were examined, as well as so-called emergency situations not related to the correct proceedings. This knowledge is necessary for the selection of technology in dismantling works and whether it is appropriate to remove asbestos from a given structure."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057794629","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s43452-021-00323-2.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d350","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Obmiński","uuid":"8B71F70581314A77B941A5F6B2191124CFDC2B082B603B32AB079587550CF66945391437F15B377BB666375078E218436FA98EB5BECF655025FB0261778F662D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7190-1549","documentHash":"99703ba7-72c7-4b9b-85bc-d011b7145173"}],"doi":"10.1007/s43452-021-00323-2"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Graphene/iron oxide hybrids","Iron oxide nanoparticles","Maghemite","Magnetite","Graphene materials"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737e9dc","uid":"bhuAmiQSz4rgvQiZB33W38w","uuid":"fee3c56b-eccc-4eb9-bca2-5913db555e88","parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9dc","parentUuid":"fee3c56b-eccc-4eb9-bca2-5913db555e88","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9dc","rootUuid":"fee3c56b-eccc-4eb9-bca2-5913db555e88","name":"Centrum Materiałów Polimerowych i Węglowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ed878c28a0473c7157","5e7093b3878c28a0473af63c","5e70937d878c28a0473aaec2","5e709479878c28a0473bdf37","5f111e897523405869ccc2b8","5e709447878c28a0473b97bc"]},{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1c3","uid":"bq_xQN8TIwb_G48D9ae-rfg","uuid":"44cbe16c-3cde-4b4b-9c64-ad6da30ce36d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Instytut Fizyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ba878c28a0473c2b8d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Effect of graphene material structure and iron oxides deposition method on morphology and properties of graphene/iron oxide hybrids","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477156","mniswId":"1525","title":"Applied Surface Science","doi":"","issn":"0169-4332","eissn":"1873-5584","websiteLink":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/applied-surface-science","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"803a82fb-a3ac-4527-b90f-633878a81469"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61d445542467f0627d10806e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094ed878c28a0473c7157","5e70937d878c28a0473aaec2","5f111e897523405869ccc2b8","5e709447878c28a0473b97bc","5e7094ba878c28a0473c2b8d","61d445542467f0627d108075","5e709479878c28a0473bdf37","61d445542467f0627d108077","5e7093b3878c28a0473af63c"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this work, various facile approaches were applied to prepare hybrids of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) and graphene oxide (GO) with iron oxides (IO) nanoparticles (NPs). The IO NPs were synthesized and deposited on the graphene surfaces via: (1) co-precipitation using Fe (II) and Fe (III) salts, (2) homogeneous precipitation of Fe2O3 from FeCl3 solution, (3) the attaching of Fe2O3 NPs functionalized with 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane to graphene surfaces of GO and GNPs. The effects of the graphene material and preparation procedure on the structural characteristics of the hybrids were studied. Their morphology was studied by scanning electron microscopy and transmission microscopy. Lattice parameters and crystallite sizes of the synthesized hybrid materials were assessed by X-ray diffraction. Raman spectroscopy was used to determine the change of order degree of graphene structures as a results of IO NPs deposition and interactions IO NPs with graphene sheets. Binding energy for IO NPs and graphene structures were determined by photoelectron X-ray spectroscopy. Thermogravimetric analysis was applied to find differences in the thermal stability of hybrids. The hybrids are proposed as nanofillers to polymer composites, however they have large potential applications as supercapacitors, advanced anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, magnetically targeted drug delivery, and magnetic resonance

paper presents the methodology of assessing the degree of differentiation of machined technical surfaces based on the empirical probability distribution of the roughness parameters. The methodology allowed to determine the differentiation level of the analysed surfaces morphology based on the influence of the machining process features on the variability of roughness parameters. The minimum sample size necessary to obtain a statistically significant differentiation level in roughness parameters of the compared surfaces was also determined. The conducted analyses made it possible to determine the information content (indicating the ability to differentiate the features of the analysed surfaces) of the roughness parameters. The robustness of the methodology has been demonstrated. The described methodology was used to evaluate the information content on the example of the grinding process of 100Cr6 bearing steel and Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057794909","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61f82f952467f01b5a1f4e6a","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"190","number":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.measurement.2022.110749","documentHash":"ee8bf24c-9337-456d-980a-a807719ef829"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"190","pagesFromTo":"110659","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263224121015256?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61d439782467f0627d0c3232","name":"Thomas G.","lastName":"Mathia","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aa1551f5-5241-415d-8d3c-99bf9d8dc1ad"},{"objectId":"60c2fd8d9543c723365436d7","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Banaszek","uuid":"3C96E9F23B70495A0ACBBEE85DAC34B240E87734AAAFAAA496030B36343663BA3A3A8D7171EE7FC2F37826A8481CD820A2CD349E61E8BCF19EE1F1F127186F18","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"330272b1-ebbb-451a-900d-20aeade0b5c1"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a9aa","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Lipiński","uuid":"7164E8CDD5C99019706852FB4E8A87AD44D06F8B93865CC63B25B3D5E9916AAC99F2DE8BE5C6BFD920B20ECFCFFB2A21EA81D7ADC34A263E41DC118F64711755","orcidId":"0000-0002-5181-0404","documentHash":"21e8c638-1e56-466a-81a0-c997fddf4bea"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.measurement.2021.110659"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Antimicrobial and antiviral activity","Silver-containing nanocomposite","StructureMorphology","Thermophysical properties"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737e9dc","uid":"bhuAmiQSz4rgvQiZB33W38w","uuid":"fee3c56b-eccc-4eb9-bca2-5913db555e88","parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9dc","parentUuid":"fee3c56b-eccc-4eb9-bca2-5913db555e88","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9dc","rootUuid":"fee3c56b-eccc-4eb9-bca2-5913db555e88","name":"Centrum Materiałów Polimerowych i Węglowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709434878c28a0473b8179","5e70923e878c28a0473925a0"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Nanocomposites based on polylactide and silver nanoparticles and their antimicrobial and antiviral applications","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454794d1","mniswId":"17047","title":"Reactive and Functional Polymers","doi":null,"issn":"1381-5148","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"b36197cd-903a-4f98-a392-93cac722b370"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61d453162467f0627d177f70","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61d453162467f0627d177f73","61d453162467f0627d177f7d","61d453162467f0627d177f7f","61d453162467f0627d177f84","61d453162467f0627d177f86","61d453162467f0627d177f89","61d453162467f0627d177f8d","61d453162467f0627d177f91","61d453162467f0627d177f95","5e709434878c28a0473b8179","5e70923e878c28a0473925a0"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Novel antimicrobial and antiviral silver-containing nanocomposites (PLA-Ag-PEI) based on polylactide (PLA) have been created by the thermochemical reduction of Ag+ ions in the polymer films.

conceptual approach to geointerpretation and geoeducation emphasizes the holistic understanding of the environment and attends to linkages between various abiotic, biotic, and cultural components. In this paper, we highlight multiple relationships between Cenozoic volcanism and host sedimentary rocks, mainly sandstones of Cretaceous age, which can be explored in the context of geotourism and geoeducation in several Central European geoparks (Bohemian Paradise UNESCO Global Geopark, Land of Extinct Volcanoes Aspiring Geopark, Ralsko National Geopark) and their surroundings. These include the effects of magmatism on sandstones, with further consequences for landform development at different spatial scales, the origin of mineral resources, underpinning of biological diversity, and specific land use contrasts. Existing interpretation provisions are reviewed, and a three-tiered framework to show these different linkages is proposed. It is argued that different, but complementary themes can be addressed at the landscape, landform, and individual outcrop (geosite) level."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057797721","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12371-021-00637-w","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70933a878c28a0473a53d3","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Pijet-Migoń","uuid":"16E21149E43C63D2DC6889E7112BAB57C2B27058290A2927464348DEC87B72A810D9A4DD9DBA8B89684FEFFDE39605BA12D1921067D8A7405806011182AC25E6","orcidId":"0000-0002-3048-8903","documentHash":"db4711a8-790e-4be5-90fa-750fc5e62efd"},{"objectId":"5e709235878c28a047391b69","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Migoń","uuid":"19CD465E8E710E2D4AAD76FEDC70B99FA1DAB3DD3AC10C3A1DFEE7B624EE23474C0A7D3A83AEDF5FF382B1A43D7D376F3DCA1ADCDD9E99997FF68F0BD9904A3B","orcidId":"0000-0001-5232-7476","documentHash":"801b977f-33aa-4c6d-8508-e7c3d54fc143"}],"doi":"10.1007/s12371-021-00637-w"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Infertility","Microbiome","IVF"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","uid":"bfUR7pyerT3GiQw3TRkatRw","uuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","parentUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","rootUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","name":"Centrum Medyczne Kształcenia Podyplomowego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c5878c28a0473c3610","5e709324878c28a0473a3814","5ebeca4f752340226956f76f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The role of genital tract microbiome in fertility: a systematic review.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","doi":null,"issn":"1422-0067","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"850accc5-0c0e-4f6c-9a84-eaa108a84f20"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-24","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61ce423a2467f054880c14f3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61ce426d2467f054880c1cbc","61ce426d2467f054880c1cbb","5e7094c5878c28a0473c3610","5ebeca4f752340226956f76f","61ce426d2467f054880c1cbe","61ce426d2467f054880c1cbf","61ce426d2467f054880c1cc0","61ce426d2467f054880c1cc1","5e709324878c28a0473a3814","61ce426d2467f054880c1cc3","61ce426d2467f054880c1cc4","61ce426d2467f054880c1cc5"]},"issue":"(1)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The human microbiome plays a crucial role in determining the health status of every human being, and the microbiome of the genital tract can affect the fertility potential before and during assisted reproductive treatments (ARTs).

Regardless of the anatomical site under investigation, the Lactobacillus-dominated flora seems to play a pivotal role in determining fertility, and in particular Lactobacillus crispatus showed a central role. Nonetheless, the presence of pathogens in the genital tract, such as Chlamydia trachomatis, Gardnerella vaginalis, Ureaplasma species, and Gram-negative stains microorganism, affected fertility also in case of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis (BV). We failed to identify descriptive or comparative studies regarding tubal microbiome. The microbiome of the genital tract plays a pivotal role in fertility, also in case of ARTs.

Brazing is a particularly attractive joining technique because of its simplicity and versatility, but its use to join the UHTCs demands knowledge of the complex interplay among high-temperature wettability, interfacial reactions, and chemical and thermoelastic compatibilities. This paper summarizes the research and development activities carried out over the last two decades to characterize the wettability and interfacial phenomena in brazing of refractory diboride ceramics. The contact angle data of various metal alloys on diboride-based ceramics have been collected and critically evaluated in conjunction with an analysis of the chemistry and structure of the interface to understand the underlying mechanisms and phenomena that govern interface formation. It explores how solid–liquid interactions impact and are impacted by physical, chemical, and mechanical properties of joined materials. It also describes how this knowledge has been successfully utilized to create liquid-phase bonded diboride-based joints. The paper concludes with a summary of the current state of the art and highlights integration challenges and future research and technology development needs in the area."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057803477","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6038dcc32467f07b15acb86a","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"3c9b5872-e68a-416a-819d-8b8024bc3837"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"1029-1049","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ijac.13972","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61d2f6c22467f0718b1af001","name":"Mrityunjay","lastName":"Singh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d9ac502c-cf04-442e-ba47-fcc3a5977373"},{"objectId":"61d2f6c22467f0718b1aefff","name":"Rajiv","lastName":"Asthana","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0004-2716","documentHash":"3a0ef9f4-18e4-4292-affb-919622351d84"},{"objectId":"5e7093f9878c28a0473b441a","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Sobczak","uuid":"B2C509E08519A735EE7356B06D9CE3E5B9A659DDB1AFEF889FFF08559E53371C17BC4F5C67813F5289D69B4E883C3BE372F2CDCA5BEB0FC5C8DD501FBAD3FA63","orcidId":"0000-0002-5588-1648","documentHash":"d0c64707-85f4-4dfc-94f7-e0b8ba3d2b88"}],"doi":"10.1111/ijac.13972"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Vegetation changes as indicators of landfill leachate seepage locations: Case study","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779f4","mniswId":"5320","title":"Ecological Engineering","doi":null,"issn":"0925-8574","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"6769071b-7c72-41bb-b2fa-a350c44cea5c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61d2d3892467f0718b04b054","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709249878c28a047393118","655fcb0e40970749a853c044","655fcb0e40970749a853c045","655fcb0e40970749a853c046","655fcb0e40970749a853c047","655fcb0e40970749a853c048","5e7094ec878c28a0473c6e23"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Landfills remain widely used for waste disposal, despite their negative impact on human health and environment. Adverse impact is mainly due to gas and leachate emissions. Leachates are liquids that are characterized by high variability in composition, high ammonia and chloride content, and presence of toxic and non-biodegradable compounds. In recent years there has been growing interest in issues related with the reactions of living organisms to pollution - biomonitoring. However, bioindicative methods are not fully used in landfill studies and are still rarely applied. The aim of this work is finding the relationship between the composition and leachate seepage points and determining the possibilities of their practical utilization for the assessment of the applied mineral sealing of landfill surfaces. Additionally, detailed analysis of leachate composition was made. The hypothesis is that some species indicating natural salinity will also indicate landfill sites with the occurrence of leachate seepage, which increase salinity. Physico-chemical analysis of the leachate were carried out. Moreover, vegetation assessment was conducted by phytocoenological relevés. The landfill has different habitats in places where leachate seepage is observed. The results indicate that the presence of leachates alters the plant species composition. The composition shows increasing representation of species tolerant to salinization and a decreasing share of glycophytes in leachate seepage points. Based on the relation of glycophytes to plant species tolerant to salinization, a work procedure and index of leachate vegetation were created, which provide a fast identification of leachate seepage points. The presented results confirm the diagnostic potential of plants for the assessment and location of leachate seepage points. The results may be applied in the reclamation works on landfills."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057803538","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"174","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0925857421003037","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"655fcb0e40970749a853c048","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Pasternak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4967cbaf-b30e-4a3b-9095-6edf47702ffe"},{"objectId":"655fcb0e40970749a853c047","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kiersnowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5937cdbc-e00e-4297-9fe2-570d8da8b718"},{"objectId":"655fcb0e40970749a853c046","name":"Martin","lastName":"Černý","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f844f290-b66e-49ab-90c4-640852930638"},{"objectId":"655fcb0e40970749a853c045","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Wowkonowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9c3cbe43-44f2-4d7e-a946-2e123a0700b3"},{"objectId":"655fcb0e40970749a853c044","name":"Jan","lastName":"Winkler","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0753c7b3-e795-44e9-a1e8-0627284c6157"},{"objectId":"5e7094ec878c28a0473c6e23","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Vaverková","uuid":"9028CE9763691333FE5F605D7CDA599B61D20F840EDCAA74D137FE0E16ACE46A5E2CEE6AD0CF71ABCEF36CBDB0FCB3975D34DF09A0C0DAED1F89E2B1FEA695EE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2384-6207","documentHash":"aaa15b4d-13d9-48ee-8419-3b7e6abc2885"},{"objectId":"5e709249878c28a047393118","name":"Eugeniusz","lastName":"Koda","uuid":"B275B708B0D7FF11FA1D007D7BDCE46A31C2203D87510BC036A941547FF87CAE59783236632BBCE1696F7212CF961EA964C2A3B07BF3FDA78D3D18869DB273A0","orcidId":"0000-0002-3895-960X","documentHash":"1b5d6b37-3cce-4f1f-9b5a-166aa879faab"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ecoleng.2021.106448"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["blockchain","continuous delivery","1+5 architectural views model","model-driven development"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","uid":"bGA_QwQGoDNg-6MMEBxlWNQ","uuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","parentUuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","rootUuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","name":"Akademia Marynarki Wojennej im.

In a blockchain network, nodes communicate and store data in a distributed manner. Each node executes the same business application but operates in a distinct execution environment. The literature lacks research focusing on continuous practices for blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Specifically, it lacks such works with support for both design and deployment. The author has proposed a solution that takes into account the continuous delivery of a business application to diverse deployment environments in the DLT network. As a result, two continuous delivery pipelines have been implemented using the Jenkins automation server. The first pipeline prepares a business application whereas the second one generates complete node deployment packages. As a result, the framework ensures the deployment package in the actual version of the business application with the node-specific up-to-date version of deployment configuration files. The Smart Contract Design Pattern has been used when building a business application. The modeling aspect of blockchain network installation has required using Unified Modeling Language (UML) and the UML Profile for Distributed Ledger Deployment. The refined model-to-code transformation generates deployment configurations for nodes. Both the business application and deployment configurations are stored in the GitHub repositories. For the sake of verification, tests have been conducted for the electricity consumption and supply management system designed for prosumers of renewable energy."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057803596","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/1/128/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092a8878c28a04739a134","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Górski","uuid":"0FD3A2AD8270D54317EE6A317F1451BD6925E303FA44B56FC1148C9C0BB0939BD61D755FDD0F2A7D8E84FA47AF53766E9A779A9534D0552C75CB994F7FF8D857","orcidId":"0000-0002-8393-1585","documentHash":"4b99d67f-552e-4f68-87cd-961f4cb3f774"}],"doi":"10.3390/s22010128"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Simulations

Hematological parameters were proved to be highly sensitive to various environmental factors including nutrition, water quality, stress or pathogens. Peripheral blood tests involve measurement of various red and white blood cells indices and are often supplemented by biochemical analyses. The use of hematological techniques is arduous and requires experience but high amount of information and relatively low cost are considerable advantages. Manual hematological methods that are most often used in fish hematology do not require highly specialized laboratory equipment, however automatic analysers adapted for use with fish blood are also in use. The results of hematological analysis may be affected by various preanalytical and analytical factors. The aim of this work was to review the procedures used in fish hematology by various authors. We develop recommendations that can provide practical guidance for fish biologists to help to obtain reliable and reproducible results."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057803839","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61d2e5982467f0718b0ef09f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"547","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"7f667fa8-7b72-4216-9d72-b9c682aadceb"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"547","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848621011613","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"643bed314097076e1ee6ee3d","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Bojarski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b2313c5e-75f6-4492-800c-4b39e314c275"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b668","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Kondera","uuid":"7DC6EC263D9FC8EAF926E8377D03402982931C0B280E8FDF929B27DA6B9C657512B960F95C2754A2051F887059EA27CAB46E339FF5A335B68DCDB58754758C96","orcidId":"0000-0003-0386-5600","documentHash":"a1577267-94e1-49d9-ab17-2341da682f2b"},{"objectId":"5e709294878c28a0473984e3","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Witeska","uuid":"F5F9879949E9C34378E519054948FF6DFDF89102EB1D4B2B54019289D61A7EF6EDBF822204D272CE63D6C01B03DC090AFFCD2A6DDD3A6D2DBA9CD1AA9897FFC2","orcidId":"0000-0002-3631-4701","documentHash":"3d629e7e-9ba7-4e04-87fb-9737837bec39"},{"objectId":"5e709294878c28a0473984b2","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Ługowska","uuid":"51F88576E223A19BD68A63001531C297FC89D4A4F0B5A30072E2EBF16DE0659685E29CDC5EE5738620B4A3DD42123297C800CF86DC902DE585AC1917CF40F73F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0039-149X","documentHash":"a3f7cdec-2271-4f5d-a3f5-ff30032054c6"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.737498"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"61d2a81f2467f0718bea65c9","doi":null,"title":"Badania kryminologiczne a praktyka.

However, definitions of species’ habitat association and specialization are often static, categorical classifications that coarsely define species as either habitat specialists or generalists and can fail to account for potential temporal or spatial differences in association or specialization. In contrast, quantitative metrics can provide a more nuanced assessment, defining species’ habitat associations and specialization along a continuous scale and accommodate for temporal or spatial variation, but these approaches are less widely used. Here we explore relative habitat use (RHU) as a metric for quantifying species’ association with and degree of specialization for different habitat types. RHU determines the extent of a species’ association with a given habitat by comparing its abundance in that habitat relative to its mean abundance across all other habitats. Using monitoring data for breeding birds across Europe from 1998 to 2017; we calculate RHU scores for 246 species for five habitat types and compared them to the literature-based classifications of their association with and specialization for each of these habitats. We also explored the temporal variation in species’ RHU scores for each habitat and assessed how this varied according to association and degree of specialization. In general, species’ RHU and literature-derived classifications were well aligned, as RHU scores for a given habitat increased in line with reported association and specialization. In addition, temporal variation in RHU scores were influenced by association and degree of specialization, with lower scores for those associated with, and those more specialized to, a given habitat. As a continuous metric, RHU allows a detailed assessment of species’ association with and degree of specialization for different habitats that can be tailored to specific temporal and/or spatial requirements. It has the potential to be a valuable tool for identifying indicator species and in supporting the design, implementation and monitoring of conservation management actions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057803911","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61cee8a22467f001be828907","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"135","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"20fca118-31c0-4409-9973-bcde13dc2afc"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"135","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1470160X21011869?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61cee8a22467f001be828904","name":"Simon

Białowieża Forest is an important biodiversity hotspot on a European scale, and therefore its preservation should have a high priority. However, forest management conducted over a large area of the forest, intensive logging, and elimination of dead trees pose serious threats to many species in the forest. The main aim of this study was to determine the species composition of spider assemblages inhabiting tree branches of the Białowieża Forest and to compare their species richness and the abundance of individuals (adults and juveniles) between managed and primeval stands. Between April and November 2000, we sampled three forest types (oak–lime–hornbeam forest, ash–alder riparian forest, and alder carr) in protected primeval stands within the Białowieża National Park and in managed stands. We collected 1761 specimens from 14 families and identified 41 species. Tree branches were inhabited mainly by juveniles. Species richness was smaller in managed stands compared to primeval stands. The highest number of species was found in primeval alder carr. Our study shows a negative effect of forest management on spider assemblages in terms of species richness. We emphasize the important role of alder carr forests as potential biodiversity hotspots."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057803979","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e94d152467f0651ffcc5b7","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"3032a89e-f0b3-42dc-a3f2-26f45689c3dc"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/13/1/5","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be87c","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Stański","uuid":"6E9502DBE062C102DFD4707FD43D68FD94515E3865A280D6BD0A0468CDF327E06A66E3730351415AC671416394152AFE4CD688573826292C895D0665F4D98B0F","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1131777e-5845-4c7e-8d2c-40409dfdf9e7"},{"objectId":"5e70939e878c28a0473adc25","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Bartos","uuid":"4BB403DB8362B1C44AD76E9F482D2D81EF1884E8FC7E30BDB7892B1F547EFC73E832FE5ABDA6272E98937AFAA31DF2F5B563449B3CE054C06A1BA14DF6808C98","orcidId":"0000-0002-0667-2348","documentHash":"c389d785-1351-41f9-afdb-1f8f074c1d65"},{"objectId":"5e709294878c28a04739850f","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Stańska","uuid":"D0DC6AE7886C4EC65A75FC0EEA95CE308E6458B606E4A984CB4FA81225258BEC4245369F18C79CFEE78FFD0F9B98DEBFBA3FA3F1D8082CFD4D966F437CD41D29","orcidId":"0000-0003-0163-1376","documentHash":"8d9c32ed-f803-422a-b881-c10b68bae492"}],"doi":"10.3390/f13010005"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["physiological parameters recorder","psychophysiology","light flicker","Flicker Fusion Threshold","driver testing","truck driving simulator"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","uid":"bsc1htnZhmNwKuaKdFUiLPQ","uuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","parentUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df02","rootUuid":"36fb82c5-7401-46ee-ae15-b98b37d77b7b","name":"Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f97","5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f98","5e709433878c28a0473b808f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Psychophysiological and environmental parameters recorder for a truck simulator","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"61b9abddad204581b62eba5c","mniswId":"201376","title":"The Polish Journal of Aviation Medicine, Bioengineering and Psychology","doi":null,"issn":"2451-3512","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WCN","editor":null,"documentHash":"85575dc9-b308-4a22-9d81-821e52cc880e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"SEPTEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":12},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61cf58292467f001be8c5098","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709433878c28a0473b808f","5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f98","5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f97"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Abstract: This paper describes the recorder integrated with a truck simulator which is a set of measuring devices used for measuring and recording environmental parameters in the simulator's cabin and psychophysiological parameters of a driver, centrally managed by the simulator's information system.

Thus, we hypothesized that bryophytes can change bark acidity, dependently of the inclination of the branches, as inclination affect the water regime and\r\nparticle deposition. We measured the pH under bryophyte cushions and compared it to nearby naked bark. Additionally, we compared results with experimental bark covering with neutral cover. We found that the pH of naked bark declines with decreasing inclination of trunks. Although bryophyte\r\ncover did not generally change the pH of the bark, there was a significant interaction with inclination: with higher inclination, bryophytes decrease the pH reaction of bark, while with lower inclination they increase it. One possible explanation may lie in changes to alkaline particle deposition, or conversely in the acidification of the bark by leaching. In addition, an experiment with a neutral cover showed that naked bark covering would substantially increase pH. As, on average, bryophytes do not change the pH of bark, there can be mutual interference between the alkalizing\r\neffect of the bark cover itself and the acidifying biological effect of bryophytes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057810420","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/11/1/63","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"649bfe1a4097071386c3c411","name":"Petr","lastName":"Pyszko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2c71c97a-f4ca-4e89-b6e9-fb52dc740ef4"},{"objectId":"649bfe1a4097071386c3c410","name":"Markéta","lastName":"Kovářová","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1b3ea18d-c178-4926-a205-86e57c65a057"},{"objectId":"61a449387523402fabe0efae","name":"Vitezslav","lastName":"Plasek","uuid":"ECFCC47F0BC929405A1D928A7BC60C02E858F1AF3234A5E73C724F92C63111EC544715AC353B5324D7863EBD1DE275F9A8C206D092395381CB6939924FC1AB81","orcidId":"0000-0002-4664-2135","documentHash":"a0b1b8f9-f21d-4f18-829a-28221e63d6e0"}],"doi":"10.3390/plants11010063"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["apple","free fall test","bruise volume","numerical model","nonlinear estimation","drop test"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6708f6a4fdbe831eab397c92","5e7091fc878c28a04738e2bf","5e7091fc878c28a04738e2b8","602f98819543c7410626f65f","602f75b79543c7410626f4e1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Simple Method for Apples’ Bruise Area Prediction","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1944","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-25","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61d36e932467f008db0131a3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602f98819543c7410626f65f","602f75b79543c7410626f4e1","5e7091fc878c28a04738e2b8","5e7091fc878c28a04738e2bf","6708f6a4fdbe831eab397c92"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"From the producers’ point of view, there is no universal and quick method to predict bruise area when dropping an apple from a certain height onto a certain type of substrate. In this study the authors presented a very simple method to estimate bruise volume based on drop height and substrate material. Three varieties of apples were selected for the study: Idared, Golden Delicious, and Jonagold. Their weight, turgor, moisture, and sugar content were measured to determine morphological differences. In the next step, fruit bruise volumes were determined after a free fall test from a height of 10 to 150 mm in 10 mm increments. Based on the results of the research, linear regression models were performed to predict bruise volume on the basis of the drop height and type of substrate on which the fruit was dropped. Wood and concrete represented the stiffest substrates and it was expected that wood would respond more subtly during the free fall test. Meanwhile, wood appeared to react almost identically to concrete. Corrugated cardboard minimized bruising at the lowest discharge heights, but as the drop height increased, the cardboard degraded and the apple bruising level reached the results as for wood and concrete. Contrary to cardboard, the foam protected apples from bruising up to a drop height of 50 mm and absorbed kinetic energy up to the highest drop heights. Idared proved to be the most resistant to damage, while Golden Delicious was medium and Jonagold was least resistant to damage.

Therefore, this study analyzes the interaction of the three trends with SDG7 under energy efficiency vision 2050, measuring the energy efficiency of OECD from 2005 to 2017 to enable this inclusion. In this context, four new trends expected to shape future energy demand are identified through extensive consultation with experts from South Asian countries by developing future power demand for the year of 2050. Consequently, the results show a crucial impact of such trends on a future power demand that exceeds the economic potential of techno. Hence, the best-case scenario, “New Trends Efficient,” reduces final energy demand by 78% compared to the South Asian “Baseline” scenario in 2050, whereas the “Worst Case” scenario increases final energy demand by 35%. Therefore, Austria and Korea have the highest energy efficiency score of 0.76 and 0.75, whereas Canada and Chile have the lowest energy efficiency score of 0.41 and 0.42.

It affects 20% of the adult population and is the third most common cause of chronic cough in adults. This study describes the results of LNF for the relief of GERD-related cough. Materials and Methods: The prospectively collected data on 135 laparoscopic LNF in our department from 2014 to 2018 were reviewed. During consultations, patients were asked about the frequency of symptoms using the GERD Impact Scale (GERD-IS), their satisfaction and recommendation to others, and their general condition after the procedure. Results: We analyzed 23 of 111 patients (20.7%) reporting chronic cough. The mean age was 47 years (range 27–76 years, ±13.9 years) and the mean follow-up time was 48.3 months (range 22.6–76.3 ± 18.05 months). Most patients reported relief from cough after the surgery (78.3%, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Five patients (22%) reported the recurrence of symptoms after a mean of 10.8 months (6–18 months). Seventeen patients (74%) would undergo the surgery again and 18 patients (78%) would recommend the surgery to their relatives. There was a statistically significant improvement in all symptoms from the GERD-IS (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Conclusions: LNF may play an important role in the management of GERD patients with extraesophageal symptoms. After LNF, most of the operated patients reported complete resolution of chronic cough and would recommend the procedure to their relatives."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057826825","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"58","pagesFromTo":"1-7","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1648-9144/58/1/47","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661f97044097076263686c3a","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Osowiecka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f88d6505-b25d-4389-b367-43f2c9ac9d53"},{"objectId":"661f97044097076263686c39","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Saluk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4c59c684-98e2-48ed-8fea-295c88a945e6"},{"objectId":"661f97044097076263686c38","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Lech","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9bb57543-8afe-420a-8b9a-733d6f13d1a7"},{"objectId":"661f97044097076263686c37","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Kacperczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"372c63bf-7b6f-467d-b615-22a6fb9403e3"},{"objectId":"661f97044097076263686c36","name":"Anna","lastName":"Masiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"78d72151-f87a-41f6-99b4-bce23ce4ffab"},{"objectId":"661f97044097076263686c35","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Dowgiałło-Gornowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a2f39453-3b5e-431d-9666-ed46c42f6aa2"},{"objectId":"5e7093ed878c28a0473b36a2","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Michalik","uuid":"2FD6E54A38417BD56E1EC03FB7875EBA6D3E8B0B1BA1473127C3E6B92F106CE378858F1207C712B6BDB4CB7C81D1E75C2D67D4C475C702C8D4F376E1C4126E01","orcidId":"0000-0001-7284-3304","documentHash":"2bdb9ce0-60e3-4cf2-b413-57ba4af0e470"}],"doi":"10.3390/medicina58010047"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-981-16-7364-1","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Sustainability and Innovation in Manufacturing Enterprises.

Fighting in\nkickboxing under K1 rules takes place with a high presence of anaerobic metabolism. Kickboxing\nathletes must have a good tolerance for metabolic acidosis and the ability to conduct an effective\nduel despite ABB disorders. Properly developed post-workout regeneration also plays an extremely\nimportant role.\nAbstract: Background: Acid–base balance (ABB) is a major component of homeostasis, which is\ndetermined by the efficient functioning of many organs, including the lungs, kidneys, and liver, and\nthe proper water and electrolyte exchange between these components. The efforts made during\ncompetitions by combat sports athletes such as kickboxers require a very good anaerobic capacity,\nwhich, as research has shown, can be improved by administering sodium bicarbonate. Combat sports\nare also characterized by an open task structure, which means that cognitive and executive functions\nmust be maintained at an appropriate level during a fight. The aim of our study was to analyze the\nchanges in ABB in capillary blood, measuring levels of H+, pCO2, pO2, HCO3\n\uDBC0\uDC00, BE and total molar\nCO2 concentration (TCO2), which were recorded 3 and 20 min after a three-round kickboxing bout,\nand the level of technical and tactical skills presented during the fight. Methods: The study involved\n14 kickboxers with the highest skill level (champion level). Statistical comparison of mentioned\nvariables recorded prior to and after a bout was done with the use of Friedman’s ANOVA. Results:\n3 min after a bout, H+ and pO2 were higher by 41% and 11.9%, respectively, while pCO2, HCO3\n\uDBC0\uDC00,\nBE and TO2 were lower by 14.5%, 39.4%, 45.4% and 34.4%, respectively. Furthermore, 20 min after\nthe bout all variables tended to normalization and they did not differ significantly compared to the\nbaseline values. Scores in activeness of the attack significantly correlated (r = 0.64) with pre–post\nchanges in TCO2. Conclusions: The disturbances in ABB and changes in blood oxygen and carbon\ndioxide saturation observed immediately after a bout indicate that anaerobic metabolism plays a\nlarge part in kickboxing fights. Anaerobic training should be included in strength and conditioning\nprograms for kickboxers to prepare the athletes for the physiological requirements of sports combat."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057829522","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61d5932d2467f04573f4c8b7","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"11","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"25dc342f-86c3-4071-a47b-b80359c1ef5c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/11/1/65","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61d5932d2467f04573f4c8af","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Czarny","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6814ef3e-d1c2-4e65-9083-02afc928d978"},{"objectId":"6034ddf49543c7410626fb51","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Mardyła","uuid":"045903364144F3A4782468B1EDCE1DDB2FD4783E630FC501AE1DB9B50DFC4E59DAA6C79E4A63944D9729213CBBDE40CB8E25CC5E04D0EBB8065B999016D7FF67","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6929f48e-fedb-4d15-b807-e6f95756e0d6"},{"objectId":"602f38b29543c7410626f214","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Rydzik","uuid":"7BC83EC239014B976A213F19148CF6C5F85A2B1C40FA62D319D85D46088D1BD14009AF92F8705865303A93F80F9D369252B2FC56337AE25CC0FC5026D5E60874","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f4ca4844-2678-4673-b7b6-88faffce0f21"},{"objectId":"5e709447878c28a0473b9796","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Obmiński","uuid":"069777A5D335D17B200D969B274FB0D8A15AFAD2BF9338D11C75619E33591EFAF899F813463D849AED07A39E3E65A55D6877C3FB9E67C9123B39E272377EBDA2","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e401102a-8c76-47d6-8c2f-62384c794899"},{"objectId":"5e70925b878c28a0473944ed","name":"TADEUSZ","lastName":"AMBROŻY","uuid":"B4D2982C5A50E6C95A7D48137E743EA9E41C3361F3700C705F2A5B5C0301AFC0040F75003E0EC8CB8DC072B632C844CD81D06BBA332C53666E658B5AE9046341","orcidId":"0000-0001-7361-9478","documentHash":"05ff181a-e409-44f0-bd9e-0210d7d6fef7"},{"objectId":"5e70923e878c28a0473924b9","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"MACIEJCZYK","uuid":"E0A224080BCD7374AFB4F40DD8BF9AD7C9DC00CD3E19C1265BF98D64BCB4FD7A191CF96A4DD7A69EE6F156B6910BBB8AEAF01078C880E9C103DA0327E011F6F9","orcidId":"0000-0002-9505-4081","documentHash":"bbf43f67-2f2c-42e7-8b1c-b0e1d582a980"},{"objectId":"5e709210878c28a04738f661","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Jaszczur-Nowicki","uuid":"A26E8F20AB7C592427EE23627B901A33084D342C85AA2AB87FCC46645C15DEE3A3B48D59D82E5B07EA2486689759F2A705704A162A98A52F0094C394ADC45EF9","orcidId":"0000-0001-5256-1406","documentHash":"566ce0e4-927d-4eae-b64e-53d3876fc86a"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e620","name":"MAGDALENA","lastName":"WIĘCEK","uuid":"44B3E979DD5089EBED9AE03419692895A253454600B04780B9D7F190B2FF4B8305C1D72519C19C57C3395626076937E5AD4DB86CA39802ADD6E352C6E0AB1712","orcidId":"0000-0002-5390-3049","documentHash":"26b3746d-f258-4357-8891-46ea477f0e32"}],"doi":"10.3390/biology11010065"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet

(AST) and fucoxanthin (FUC) are natural xanthophylls, having multidirectional activity, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer. Both compounds also show antimicrobial activity, which is presented in this review article. There are few papers that have presented the antimicrobial activity of AST. Obtained antimicrobial concentrations of AST\n(200–4000 µg/mL) are much higher than recommended by the European Food Safety Authority for consumption (2 mg daily). Therefore, we suggest that AST is unlikely to be of use in the clinical treatment of infections. Our knowledge about the antimicrobial activity of FUC is better and this compound acts against many bacteria already in low concentrations 10–250 µg/mL. Toxicological studies on animals present the safety of FUC application in doses 200 mg/kg body weight and\nhigher. Taking available research into consideration, a clinical application of FUC as the antimicrobial substance is real and can be successful. However, this aspect requires further investigation. In this review, we also present potential mechanisms of antibacterial activity of carotenoids, to which AST and FUC belong."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057835335","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61db36402467f0605936bf17","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"20","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"3b76f0bd-c0bc-4872-aa6f-bf789b683f48"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"20","pagesFromTo":"art. 36  (s. 1-10)","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61d3c8ee2467f008db374549","name":"Mark","lastName":"Stasiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1b8da8bf-67f8-4e37-8499-9b02305e0229"},{"objectId":"61d3c8ee2467f008db374547","name":"Rahat","lastName":"Alam","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2177d9ea-0877-46c7-a1c9-8edcd464b0d0"},{"objectId":"5e70949e878c28a0473c07be","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Łochyńska","uuid":"C6A61CCD57768B70D8A8C5320E6803C317E30C8A8A611D5B6D56DED2EFB66B52C552113A99CBA71813B371684178E00D234E9FFB6482A4CB41A373B94B6B4A94","orcidId":"0000-0001-8796-204X","documentHash":"8c9d19b2-6039-44c4-ae42-00c9cb4b5923"},{"objectId":"5e709365878c28a0473a8ad7","name":"TOMASZ","lastName":"KARPIŃSKI","uuid":"4DE7C8EE6F0DBBC7DDFFD9A602E75ED021B0519EA5D21F0F9070CABFB76A349D04291BA6DA3D35D2018376629F620F2FF3656F03333E58D48C48A52D3BD5E4C6","orcidId":"0000-0001-6599-9204","documentHash":"9b0c7d07-5c96-4e80-861c-06e850b493b9"},{"objectId":"5e709364878c28a0473a89a0","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Ożarowski","uuid":"755B79A5756818FEF8A35CCB3D6AD8336CDE938CB446FC1F5DD434FB92C25D40284B60AD44609F328CC6D7BDD144DAE47E7E25A40FC62D05C58F77B6A5EBB8B5","orcidId":"0000-0003-2305-3116","documentHash":"94f76ef0-b5fd-4898-96e0-5bda90c20108"}],"doi":"10.3390/md20010036"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cannabis sativa L.; industrial hemp; micropropagation; in vitro cultures; apical dominance; auxin polar transport inhibitors; NPA; TIBA"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a04738567d","uid":"buXMLEs4lpbxvwxbqswKB9Q","uuid":"fd60174d-73fa-4546-8dce-9f89a7663753","parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a04738567d","parentUuid":"fd60174d-73fa-4546-8dce-9f89a7663753","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a04738567d","rootUuid":"fd60174d-73fa-4546-8dce-9f89a7663753","name":"Instytut Włókien Naturalnych i Roślin Zielarskich - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a3878c28a0473c0cb8","5e70949e878c28a0473c07b3"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Effect of TIBA and NPA on Shoot Regeneration of Cannabis sativa L.

Therefore, development of new varieties with specific chemical profiles is necessary. In vitro culture methods could be complementary to conventional breeding and a useful tool for large-scale propagation. Strong apical dominance is considered as one of the factors contributing to the recalcitrance of industrial hemp in shoot proliferation. In this study, we tested the polar transport inhibitors N-1-naphtylphtalamic acid (NPA) and 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) to enhance shoot regeneration as the result of suppression of apical dominance and to develop in vitro protocols for Diana, Finola and Fedora 17 cultivars. Shoot tips derived from epicotyls were cultivated on Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) supplemented with meta-topolin (mT) and NPA, and also thidiazuron (TDZ) with a combination of TIBA and NPA. The results showed that the combination of TDZ with NPA (1–5 mg L−1) and TDZ with TIBA (0.5–2.5 mg L−1) increased the response of explants and the multiplication rate, but the effect was genotype-dependent and malformations were observed. To optimize the developed protocol, a two-step procedure with shortened time of exposure to inhibitors and reduced concentrations of them was applied. Shoots were rooted on media containing indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and then successfully acclimatized. The obtained results will be useful in micropropagation of recalcitrant industrial hemp varieties."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057835337","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61c421832467f0264d189e80","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"f1afdd90-928f-4bf9-95eb-20b7eaeb9f2a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"art.

its broad range and high abundance, nest sites of the European robin Erithacus rubecula, a small forest passerine, are rarely characterised, and most studies refer to human-transformed habitats. In this paper, we describe the species’ nest sites in the natural conditions of a primeval forest. We also investigate robin preferences to address nest site selection which can only be assessed if the availability of potential nest sites is known. We studied robins’ nest sites in Białowieża National Park, eastern Poland, on three study plots (~30 ha each) in 2016–2019. Among all nests found (n = 165), the majority (118, ~72%) were found in tree holes, followed by ground nests (25, ~15%) and root-soil plates (22, ~13%). When the availability of cavities and root-soil plates is accounted for, it appears that robins preferred tree holes over plates. Robins appeared to be weakly selective in respect to tree species, preferring hornbeam Carpinus betulus, small-leaved lime Tilia cordata and Norway spruce Picea abies over other trees. Since both cavities and root-soil plates are superabundant in the Białowieża Forest, but scarce or absent in the heavily transformed robin breeding habitats of Western Europe (parks, orchards, hedgerows or managed forests), ground-nesting may predominate there simply due to these choice limits. In summary, our results provide a basis for understanding how original nest-site choices that evolved in natural, unmodified habitats can change when a species adapts to human-transformed habitats."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057835502","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"89","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24750263.2021.2006326","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67309b1efdbe83034936aadd","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Neubauer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"934440c1-6f9d-429e-b253-907bed2a8d92"},{"objectId":"67309b1efdbe83034936aadc","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kamionka-Kanclerska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"37f5eb55-b7a7-4ca7-9615-913e11124262"},{"objectId":"67309b1efdbe83034936aadb","name":"Oliwia","lastName":"Karpińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a90fc76e-1d76-42ae-9fe7-a0cc2d2afae9"},{"objectId":"5e7091f3878c28a04738da0d","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Rowiński","uuid":"97C95C6ECCC55B83F54D18A50D6F7979BAF04892809EF74ED7E0A896304ADB3AF1A4F596D4C60EAFECF8080F8A830414A33F0286E165D9888B08EB0F7982DBC7","orcidId":"0000-0002-1723-9128","documentHash":"068d70c3-b4ba-4e6a-87a2-a240a25b6c52"}],"doi":"10.1080/24750263.2021.2006326"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c5878c28a0473c360b","602e5b759543c7410626f188","602df7f59543c7410626e942"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Pathway-Dependent Grain Coarsening of Block Copolymer Patterns under Controlled Solvent Evaporation","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476dca","mniswId":"135","title":"ACS Macro Letters","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2161-1653","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"68ca75d8-cf1a-4bc6-847c-e7b95359a27a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61d5d9252467f04573054e19","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602df7f59543c7410626e942","602e5b759543c7410626f188","61d5d9252467f04573054e1c","5e7094c5878c28a0473c360b"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Solvent evaporation annealing (SEA) is a straightforward, single-step casting and annealing method of block copolymers (BCP) processing yielding large-grained morphologies in a very short time. Here, we present a quantitative analysis of BCP grain-coarsening in thin films under controlled evaporation of the solvent. Our study is aimed at understanding time and BCP concentration influence on the rate of the lateral growth of BCP grains. By systematically investigating the coarsening kinetics at various BCP concentrations, we observed a steeply decreasing exponential dependence of the kinetics power-law time exponent on polymer concentration. We used this dependence to formulate a mathematical model of BCP ordering under nonstationary conditions and a 2D, time- and concentration-dependent coarsening rate diagram, which can be used as an aid in engineering the BCP processing pathway in SEA and also in other directed self-assembly methods that utilize BCP–solvent interactions such as solvent vapor annealing."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057835632","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61d5d9252467f04573054e20","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"11","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"590cafc6-614e-4ca1-b1a1-8d3d7240ea0f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"121-126","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsmacrolett.1c00677","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61d5d9252467f04573054e1c","name":"Robert","lastName":"Style","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-5305-7658","documentHash":"4e5f7691-7e53-4a90-b206-b7b8141b18cc"},{"objectId":"602e5b759543c7410626f188","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Puła","uuid":"8CA04B10C5F2492DA0D50B92F246A75D1159FA1E6B57BA28E3A59E0A6274093F98227AEB1A3C434209D24BB293FB6884165C1F50E7F6A625AC2837DF9347DDD5","orcidId":"0000-0001-6172-4537","documentHash":"b0c402bb-576a-4dc5-9e84-8a255c7c5378"},{"objectId":"602df7f59543c7410626e942","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Leniart","uuid":"F244DD6E31C1B272E49ED45C0FAD6E8B2EDE6D76C79F98C5684DFD5D17D3431315C5AEC95F9487FC9C211A20BC98ADE2C674322972D50005F82C46F7DA8B5B07","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9e5217cd-b0a7-4b54-a4af-32273e3fe2ec"},{"objectId":"5e7094c5878c28a0473c360b","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Majewski","uuid":"7D257E01B68A220BF02CD714B24995B97E1D519D049A59D09942AFC073A802819E91C0E06699B73653618AE9D45A4814282779CF1BF7FA067BA6D426F9845C7C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"47f678fc-a11e-4885-8738-8f0d08043d29"}],"doi":"10.1021/acsmacrolett.1c00677"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19; bear market; drawdown; recovery; capital markets; individual investor"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","uid":"bLoLgWizTVEIn0ZQBwSDx-Q","uuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","parentUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","rootUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","name":"Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092da878c28a04739e1ed"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Stock Indices Breakdown during the Pandemic as the Most Dynamic Bear Market in History: Consequences for Individual Investors","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d248","mniswId":"17941","title":"Risks","doi":null,"issn":"2227-9091","eissn":"2227-9091","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"cd24296f-d3db-479a-a478-0927c4f65a4a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61d3f0fa2467f0627ded20de","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092da878c28a04739e1ed"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The breakdown of stock indices is an obvious part of the financial market cycle. A common question about a bear market is the time and the depth of the downtrend, as well as the speed of the following recovery. As the COVID-19 pandemic spread globally, it induced huge price drops in a very short period, and an uptrend with new historical highs afterwards. The results of this research show that the pandemic breakdown was the fastest bear market in history; however, it does not confirm that future downtrends will be at the same or even greater speed. The consequences for individual investors have forced them to prepare for possible similar market behavior in the future, and to adjust their trading techniques and strategies to these conditions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057835705","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61dbe0752467f07650a5ff9d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"10","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"84905dd1-fb6e-4fef-a134-9f645050f7a9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"1","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9091/10/1/1/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092da878c28a04739e1ed","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Dąbrowski","uuid":"FC841A1F53C11A085E5E2FA62CA85FA23B87A5596A9F9CAB056B84E0D42CEB2C4FC01CE16EE35C11B2D3CE50CFCF270840A884C376DE837DFB846954D34A4D0D","orcidId":"0000-0002-9151-6138","documentHash":"558d51bc-f27f-4dc2-ac47-ac376e9c40a9"}],"doi":"10.3390/risks10010001"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["anhydrite","weathering","hydration","gypsum","gypsification","volume increase","crystallization pressure","petrograph","Windsor Group","Dingwall","Nova Scotia"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df17","uid":"bxvEdTB_rZDwTwDCxKD8MAA","uuid":"baafdd5c-15d8-49db-ac14-1067a5fabd1b","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Geologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602fa3139543c7410626f6d3","5e709355878c28a0473a77a4","61d714922467f0730e388053"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Petrographic Record and Conditions of Expansive Hydration of Anhydrite in the Recent Weathering Zone at the Abandoned Dingwall Gypsum Quarry, Nova Scotia, Canada","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478ea0","mniswId":"14412","title":"Minerals","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2075-163X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"01cecf99-6f51-42cf-a957-eb39b4affb73"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-31","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61d714922467f0730e388050","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602fa3139543c7410626f6d3","5e709355878c28a0473a77a4","61d714922467f0730e388053","61d714922467f0730e388054"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the Dingwall gypsum quarry in Nova Scotia, Canada, operating in 1933–1955, the bedrock anhydrite deposits of the Carboniferous Windsor Group have been uncovered from beneath the secondary gypsum beds of the extracted raw material. The anhydrite has been subjected to weathering undergoing hydration (gypsification), transforming into secondary gypsum due to contact with water of meteoric derivation. The ongoing gypsification is associated with a volume increase and deformation of the quarry bottom. The surface layer of the rocks is locally split from the substrate and raised, forming spectacular hydration relief. It shows numerous domes, ridges and tepee structures with empty internal chambers, some of which represent unique hydration caves (swelling caves, Quellungshöhlen). The petrographic structure of the weathering zone has been revealed by macro- and microscopic observations. It was recognized that gypsification commonly starts from a developing network of tiny fractures penetrating massive anhydrite. The gypsification advances from the fractures towards the interior of the anhydrite rocks, which are subdivided into blocks or nodules similar to corestones. Characteristic zones can be recognized at the contact of the anhydrite and the secondary gypsum: (1) massive and/or microporous anhydrite, (2) anhydrite penetrated by tiny gypsum veinlets separating the disturbed crystals and their fragments (commonly along cleavage planes), (3) gypsum with scattered anhydrite relics, and (4) secondary gypsum. The secondary gypsum crystals grow both by replacement and displacement, and also as cement. Displacive growth, evidenced by abundant deformation of the fragmented anhydrite crystals, is the direct cause of the volume increase. Crystallization pressure exerted by gypsum growth is thought to be the main factor generating volume increase and, consequently, also the formation of new fractures allowing water access to “fresh” massive anhydrite and thus accelerating its further hydration. The expansive hydration is taking place within temperature range from 0 to ~30 \u000EC in which the solubility of gypsum is lower than that of anhydrite. In such conditions, dissolving anhydrite yields a solution supersaturated with gypsum and the dissolution of anhydrite is simultaneous with in situ replacive gypsum crystallization. Accompanying displacive growth leads to volume increase in the poorly confined environment of the weathering zone that is susceptible to upward expansion."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057835739","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-38","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/12/1/58","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61d714922467f0730e388054","name":"Firouz","lastName":"Vladi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9dc3c470-9fd7-4281-b716-84f2a84c71de"},{"objectId":"61d714922467f0730e388053","name":"Damian","lastName":"Ługowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0f87992a-4a7f-4d07-894d-0c3a29fcad75"},{"objectId":"602fa3139543c7410626f6d3","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Jarzyna","uuid":"90843B64BD35ADD973145CEE3C037DB2184082DC3E03BD0FA70197F18C11ED22A8A2139D0F803ACD5FD977D805A032E69D1966565F1EA63CE0C1E49687EFDBAF","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"945b2738-27e5-4535-81a5-129264ba9707"},{"objectId":"5e709355878c28a0473a77a4","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Bąbel","uuid":"12476F0390320C34CDEDB1CD7C36DDB48375DEF05ED1D709A42DC4027B650D7F2C998E274997D459F2505103DD28F0331D59D39879F18B3AE9258D1C653FB36D","orcidId":"0000-0002-2908-8494","documentHash":"31ee95ce-60cc-406c-aa82-e2bc15e03f3d"}],"doi":"10.3390/min12010058"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-3-030-80805-1","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"The Palgrave Handbook of Populism","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":700,"publicationPlace":"Cham","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61d035a62467f07cfb8f5761","editors":[{"objectId":"649bfca24097071386c3c07b","name":"Michael","lastName":"Oswald","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b53dedf3-bedc-4849-9780-314029884887"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["649bfca24097071386c3c07b"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747057837983","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb885","mniswId":"46100","name":"Palgrave Macmillan","documentHash":"bbef3f09-e653-452e-b7e6-8ca04f79b40e"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-80803-7#toc","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-80803-7"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-90-04-47071-2","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Slavery in the Black Sea Region, c. 900-1900.

The main research question (what tendencies can be identified in scientific research on business and climate change over the years) allowed to formulate three specific research questions. The Analyses of dynamics over time, research centers and content were carried out using bibliometric methods. The dataset was obtained from Scopus and consisted of 1546 records related to scientific publications from 1989 to 2018. A clear upward trend emerged over time in business and climate change research. University of Waterloo, Griffith University, and ETH Zurich were identified as the most important research centers for thought development. Furthermore, climate change, greenhouse gases, and global warming emerged as the three very well explored thematic areas in the business context. Additionally, three research gaps were identified, i.e., adaptive management, tourism management, and waste management. The results of the analyses can be useful to researchers when planning, designing, and conducting own research. Political decision-makers who seek support and advice could also take advantage of the findings, as they may assist in the development of new political instruments. Last but not least, the presented research outcomes may serve the business community by providing solutions, and references to appropriate experts and analysts."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057838672","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62722f514097077af52560fe","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"42","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"b381b3d1-832f-4965-af14-a2cb07a72ecd"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"42","pagesFromTo":"art. 100696","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211464521001068","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7dd0","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Żemigała","uuid":"F4DA8842F5AE731E10BF22CAFE034DB4739798C06A8D87016499200C504C1336A27C5B2768FB446AE8A8CF4D218FF194E884B62316255AEA2B82B93B6F7EE00A","orcidId":"0000-0001-7932-4275","documentHash":"3ab02513-9625-44bc-88ff-002ea985990b"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.envdev.2021.100696"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["korozja chlorowa","kocioł domowy","spalanie biomasy","biomasa rolnicza","analiza numeryczna"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["chlorine corrosion","domestic boiler","biomass combustion","agricultural biomass","numerical analysis"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Chlorine corrosion in a low-power boiler fired with agricultural biomass","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1073","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-05","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61d743242467f0730e3f431b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709221878c28a04739053b","65b20efb409707197792e601","65b20efb409707197792e602"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>The selection of appropriate heat-resistant materials which are at the same time resistant to atmospheres rich in chlorine and its compounds is one of the most important current construction problems in steel boiler elements when using biomass fuels of agricultural origin. In the research presented here, an area was identified in the furnace of a 10 kW boiler where there was a potential risk of chlorine corrosion. This zone was determined based on numerical analysis of the combustion process; it is the zone with the highest temperatures and where the gas atmosphere conducive to the formation of chlorine corrosion centers. Subsequently, tests were carried out in the process environment of the combustion chamber of a 10 kW boiler (the fuel was barley straw) by placing samples of eight construction materials in a numerically-designated zone. These included samples of steel (coal boiler St41K, heat-resistant H25T and H24JS, and heat-resistant valve 50H21G9N4) as well as intermetallic materials based on phases (FeAl, Fe3Al, NiAl, and Ni3Al). The samples remained in the atmosphere of the boiler furnace for 1152 h at a temperature of 750–900 °C. After this time, the surfaces of the samples were subjected to SEM microscopy and scanning analysis. The results showed that the St41K boiler steel was not suitable for operation under the assumed conditions, and that a thick layer of complex corrosion products was visible on its surface. The least amount of corrosion damage was observed for the samples of 50H21G9N4 steel and intermetallic materials.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747057840894","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/1/382","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65b20efb409707197792e602","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Poskrobko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"31de99b2-d685-43db-87cf-b039843fd668"},{"objectId":"65b20efb409707197792e601","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Motyl","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bd32539a-b72d-40dc-943b-5e7e2ad262b6"},{"objectId":"5e709221878c28a04739053b","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Król","uuid":"BB64E0377314650CA1772C92864CE207D44F3A47EE511E3387974D738F23882B995D937A8BD436AF3359F1C7F86E49D278319F2EE70D31410A7C2B4DDB425A9A","orcidId":"0000-0001-6952-4425","documentHash":"a13addef-c22d-42bf-9708-e19f4ab8a159"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15010382"},{"mainLanguageName":"hiszpański","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5f5acc83752340073806a9a1","uid":"btIi-FbLk2lMTscFNtvO3Fg","uuid":"fade7b33-3e9b-4ce9-9433-cb6358ea4cde","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Historii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709358878c28a0473a7bb1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Algunas propuestas para comprender el aspecto político del pontificado de san Juan Pablo II","mainLanguage":"spa","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b9cd","mniswId":"1390","title":"Anuario de Historia de la Iglesia","doi":null,"issn":"1133-0104","eissn":"2174-0887","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"8e06848f-f5ac-488b-8f68-910cf87fd466"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61d723882467f0730e3a8740","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709358878c28a0473a7bb1"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747057841422","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61d723882467f0730e3a8744","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"31","doi":null,"documentHash":"dccd41cb-3b21-4ab8-896f-977331efe5d3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"31","pagesFromTo":"1-26","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://revistas.unav.edu/index.php/anuario-de-historia-iglesia/issue/view/1445","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7bb1","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Skibiński","uuid":"1B948720C173A6A7CC4CC4B2752407A331EC93EFD5C7B7972C99A34695199AA1A179A94E9E9A98CBFEC764BEABC8114E0904123D1E128AD97C50575F0340407B","orcidId":"0000-0003-1590-0645","documentHash":"e481ffb1-d0d6-4adf-a664-4f39b1559b1d"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mycotoxin","walnuts","alfatoxin B1 (AFB1)","ochratoxin A (OTA)","zearalenone (ZON)"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de69","uid":"b8lEq4e8f8p1V09_nBsO4Ew","uuid":"7b1ecf5e-1c1d-40d0-91a9-cbde801c4409","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de69","parentUuid":"7b1ecf5e-1c1d-40d0-91a9-cbde801c4409","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de69","rootUuid":"7b1ecf5e-1c1d-40d0-91a9-cbde801c4409","name":"Akademia Bialska im.

The aim of the study was to determine the concentration of selected mycotoxins: total aflatoxins, aflatoxin B1, ochratoxin A, fumonisin, T-2/HT-2 toxins, and zearalenone in walnuts collected in private household gardens in Lublin Province. Walnut (in shells) were collected in June/July 2020. The material, i.e. 38 walnut samples from autumn harvest in 2019, was donated for the analyses voluntarily. Quantitative tests ELISA were used to detect the presence of mycotoxins in the edible part of the nuts. Over 86% of the walnut samples were found to exceed the maximum residue levels for the total aflatoxin concentration (4 μg/kg) for tree nuts intended for human consumption or used as an ingredient in food products. The concentration of aflatoxin B1 exceeded the allowable level of 2 μg/kg in over 65% of the samples. In addition to aflatoxins, two other mycotoxins (ochratoxin A and T-2/HT-2) were detected in over 28% of the samples, three compounds (ochratoxin A, fumonisin, and T-2/HT-2) - in 15.8% of the samples, and ochratoxin A, T-2/HT-2, and zearalenone were contained in 10.5% of the samples. Aflatoxin is the most common fungal contaminant of walnuts however other mycotoxins, may be identified in this product as well. Potentially they all exert an unfavorable impact on consumer health."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057843265","journalIssue":{"objectId":"619e56192467f05776acb4ba","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":"31","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"b4da76aa-6750-44a7-8cc0-08446acb1ba0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"31","pagesFromTo":"493-498","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.pjoes.com/Mycotoxin-Contaminants-of-Walnuts-n-Preliminary-Studies,138990,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61d4468d2467f0627d110269","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Nitychoruk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f94c207f-c909-482b-ab71-e79ac2d7f06b"},{"objectId":"61d4468d2467f0627d110268","name":"Marta","lastName":"Zarębska","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4912-7101","documentHash":"e2be1d67-1779-4c96-8780-c403a9ea0711"},{"objectId":"5e709270878c28a047395b2f","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Tokarska-Rodak","uuid":"450B0C3783490DEFBF75EBCB36ABD7CCB80BB6A00D93294E8E3AC4F79BBFDBD65301975EB673CFE990476CC31DB8224D729C6AFE1459A84FCBFADC89D9C2BDEF","orcidId":"0000-0003-2297-970X","documentHash":"093cc8c6-0026-4ca5-b25d-d91ea67732b0"}],"doi":"10.15244/pjoes/138990"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Peroxiredoxin","Gene expression","Glioma","Glioblastoma","Patient survival"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","parentUuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","rootUuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Growing evidence suggests that production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is linked to glioma pathogenesis, although it is still unclear whether it is a cause or an effect of this process. Peroxiredoxins (PRDXs), a family of six antioxidant proteins, may promote or inhibit carcinogenesis, depending on the tumor type and stage. The current knowledge on their expression, regulation and functions in glioma is scarce. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of PRDXs expression in distinct glioma subtypes and non-tumor brain tissues was conducted using gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), REpository for Molecular BRAin NeoplasiaDaTa (REMBRANDT), The Chinese Glioma Atlas (CGGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. The association between gene expression and patient survival was investigated. DNA methylation, mutations, copy number alterations of deregulated PRDXs as well as the correlation between gene expression and tumor-infiltrating immune cells were assessed. The analysis revealed overexpression of PRDX1, PRDX4, and PRDX6 in most histological glioma types compared to the non-tumor tissues, while PRDX2, PRDX3 and PRDX5 expression remained unaltered. The expression of PRDX4 and PRDX6 was higher in mesenchymal than proneural and classical glioma subtypes. Moreover, lower expression of PRDX1, PRDX4 and PRDX6 was observed in tumors with a glioma CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP) compared to non-G-CIMP tumors, as well as in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant and 1p/19q co-deleted gliomas compared to the wild-type counterparts. High expression of PRDX1, PRDX4 or PRDX6 correlated with poor survival of glioma patients. PRDX1 and PRDX6 displayed a positive correlation with different immune cell population in low grade gliomas and, to a lesser extent, in glioblastoma. PRDX1 expression exhibited negative correlation with DNA methylation. These results indicate that high expression of PRDX1, PRDX4 and PRDX6 is associated with poor outcome in gliomas."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057843473","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61d434ab2467f0627d08facc","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"153","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"6528c3cf-bc45-45ef-b2f1-d597a74c9e17"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"153","pagesFromTo":"105256","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0197018621003028?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709287878c28a0473974f6","name":"Monika","lastName":"Szeliga","uuid":"96621CAC652503F695F93DB6964305C388BA752B44E23AF89F335FABFE6FD7937774AF396C8B53BB3B7A5EDEB3DD56F7838C780B8D48BF428E400212CC4985E7","orcidId":"0000-0003-2973-4692","documentHash":"da696075-b4e8-47dc-bd75-18702753d243"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.neuint.2021.105256"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Packaging methods","Meat quality","Shelf-life"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a04738564a","uid":"beGpESG6icEeopJ3VnMkvIw","uuid":"0e8f33a2-7d2c-4765-a697-b104163eb1ac","parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a04738564a","parentUuid":"0e8f33a2-7d2c-4765-a697-b104163eb1ac","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a04738564a","rootUuid":"0e8f33a2-7d2c-4765-a697-b104163eb1ac","name":"Instytut Biotechnologii Przemysłu Rolno-Spożywczego im. prof.

Here, we describe the impact of pH on the kinetics of reaction of four catecholamines (L-DOPA, dopamine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline) with model 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (dpph•) in methanol/water. The increase in pH from 5.5 to 7.4 is followed by a 2 order of magnitude increase in the rate constant, e.g., for dopamine (DA) kpH5.5 = 1,200 M-1 s-1 versus kpH7.4 = 170,000 M-1 s-1, and such rate acceleration is attributed to a fast electron transfer from the DA anion to dpph•. We also proved that at pH 7.0 DA breaks the peroxidation chain of methyl linoleate in liposomes assembled from neutral and negatively charged phospholipids. In contrast to no inhibitory effect during peroxidation in non-ionic emulsions, in bilayers one molecule of DA traps approximately four peroxyl radicals, with a rate constant kinh >103 M-1 s-1. Our results from a homogeneous system and bilayers prove that catecholamines act as effective, radical trapping antioxidants with activity depending on the ionization status of the catechol moiety, as well as microenvironment: organization of the lipid system (emulsions vs bilayers) and interactions of catecholamines with the biomembrane."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057843649","journalIssue":{"objectId":"620113a22467f06fa4350bcc","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"87","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"ca3475bd-f786-4b54-a050-96736cbe8435"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"87","pagesFromTo":"1791-1804","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.joc.1c02308","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61d43e3f2467f0627d0dd2bf","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Przybylski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9aa59690-a07b-4793-aec7-50ded09ecf82"},{"objectId":"61d43e3f2467f0627d0dd2be","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kluzek","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2447-699X","documentHash":"45e6c16a-b369-42d9-9398-4a9f5b18b069"},{"objectId":"5e709473878c28a0473bd578","name":"KATARZYNA","lastName":"JODKO-PIÓRECKA","uuid":"A5BBDC6B8AB71DB859A217DFE854FDEE2852BE39E8486EE399035E2DF68788267C5E0F73419AF56BA8D9D04FE569F325DF804A170967644F958404FDFB956905","orcidId":"0000-0002-9336-3315","documentHash":"2463e00e-c42f-4fb5-9978-1b376534b5a2"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c57","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Sikora-Dobrowolska","uuid":"748EA275A0F6818696314E92B1B3857065B51CB6186CC43493DAD75E5207151C5C8610CB513CEB2933FDE14624823740A6470C78000BDAB781A62AF6BCDCA6B1","orcidId":"0000-0001-5902-9682","documentHash":"d57c1bdf-c2d8-4f8f-a7d0-930bbf18a0a8"},{"objectId":"5e7093d5878c28a0473b1887","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Litwinienko","uuid":"819B329ED973079ED499F8FF1E9E2D5BDB1BE98D943950D832BC8DB9A372486820F824A05FA6FD4D86BD907E039E0924C7919D9FD3A9107EEFC5B0E34976AD12","orcidId":"0000-0002-5523-0888","documentHash":"668e1aa8-de8a-410d-8f82-ce44d631de75"}],"doi":"10.1021/acs.joc.1c02308"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Li-ion","Silicon","Electrode","Cycle

Fullerenols (water-soluble derivatives of fullerenes), such as C60(OH)36, are biocompatible molecules with a high ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), but the mechanism of their antioxidant action and cooperation with endogenous redox machinery remains unrecognized. Fullerenols rapidly distribute through blood cells; therefore, we investigated the effect of C60(OH)36 on the antioxidant defense system in erythrocytes during their prolonged incubation. Methods: Human erythrocytes were treated with fullerenol at concentrations of 50–150 µg/mL, incubated for 3 and 48 h at 37 °C, and then hemolyzed. The level of oxidative stress was determined by examining the level of thiol groups, the activity of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione transferase), and by measuring erythrocyte microviscosity. Results: The level of thiol groups in stored erythrocytes decreased; however, in the presence of higher concentrations of C60(OH)36 (100 and 150 µg/mL), the level of -SH groups increased compared to the control. Extending the incubation to 48 h caused a decrease in antioxidant enzyme activity, but the addition of fullerenol, especially at higher concentrations (100–150 µg/mL), increased its activity. We observed that C60(OH)36 had no effect on the microviscosity of the interior of the erythrocytes. Conclusions: In conclusion, our results indicated that water-soluble C60(OH)36 has antioxidant potential and efficiently supports the enzymatic antioxidant system within the cell. These effects are probably related to the direct interaction of C60(OH)36 with the enzyme that causes its structural changes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057843882","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/1/119","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"656db3dc40970749a862f3f4","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Litwinienko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6bbceef3-c826-4168-8988-8c825f4978fa"},{"objectId":"656db3dc40970749a862f3f3","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Piotrowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4c642338-e3e9-4761-ac43-bca344d92096"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bde16","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Kaźmierska-Grębowska","uuid":"98D3284855EF122ABC91B7F6266C17A823C3547DCA7C84505039642C7DCD9ECF78D52D9762F6C8A972B6397677F87E5230D11C58B27D3BE3B93C4AC9E69BD051","orcidId":"0000-0002-3784-6718","documentHash":"8dc2ceb9-325d-4709-8e30-a5c249d776ed"},{"objectId":"5e70943b878c28a0473b88b4","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Grębowski","uuid":"81D14CC60079004391BE54D9D2E1C757FF1F1C3D50DCD1857A294A21F34CF7805297F1BB8F220BDDB68626D7F64EFB1B7EA33FDC8274EB1E434892E13FEB477D","orcidId":"0000-0001-5407-9533","documentHash":"c34cf3d9-672e-46e9-a5e7-9f713bbdd0f0"},{"objectId":"5e709352878c28a0473a72f5","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Cichoń","uuid":"12E2117DF5F5EA23871C46A0003ABE7B94C424DC6C9C3D5E565FF3655EDB0FBA94FA245B22CD139E3F6449389E554C0F6C1AD9182053ECD0C89DD28AF81090FF","orcidId":"0000-0002-0139-2451","documentHash":"94741706-aa25-409c-b0ae-f9edc9d3825a"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms23010119"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737def4","uid":"bPoyZM9sTF7DfGYlClitONQ","uuid":"a06695e5-49d1-49c4-96b5-ac55298f9288","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def4","parentUuid":"a06695e5-49d1-49c4-96b5-ac55298f9288","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def4","rootUuid":"a06695e5-49d1-49c4-96b5-ac55298f9288","name":"Instytut Techniki Budowlanej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d4878c28a0473b16d7"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Experimental and Numerical Verification of the Railway Track Substructure with Innovative Thermal Insulation Materials","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":"10.3390/ma","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"8475d9fb-a844-4cfe-87c7-25090cd02fd3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-26","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61d44b042467f0627d12c9c4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61d44b042467f0627d12c9c6","61d44b042467f0627d12c9c7","61d44b042467f0627d12c9c8","5e7093d4878c28a0473b16d7","61d44b042467f0627d12c9ca"]},"issue":"1 (160)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article aims to present the modified structural composition of the sub-ballast layers of the railway substructure, in which a part of the natural materials for the establishment of sub-ballast or protective layers of crushed aggregate is replaced by thermal insulation and reinforcing material (layer of composite foamed concrete and extruded polystyrene board).

The group of 1.869.246 newborns was screened in the Institute of Mother and Child in Warsaw within a period of 01.01.1999 - 31.05.2019. Screening protocols evolved over time from IRT/IRT to IRT/DNA/EGA.\nResults: The authors identified 11 patients with false-negative NBS, in whom CF was diagnosed based on clinical symptoms or the examination of siblings with positive CF NBS. In the study group, the diagnosis was made significantly later in comparison to positive CF NBS patients ranging from 2 months to 15 years of age. CF NBS strategy does not significantly affect the sensitivity of the screening.\nConclusion: In the presence of clinical symptoms, additional diagnostics must be implemented, in spite of the negative screening results. At first, the sweat test should be conducted, followed by a DNA analysis of the most common mutations in the given population. The diagnostic process requires searching for CFTR mutations not typically associated with a high chloride concentration in sweat. Repetition of sweat chloride concentration enables the diagnosis in children whose initial chloride values in sweat are borderline, and no CF-causing mutations are detected. In strong clinical indications, the extension of DNA analysis (EGA) is recommended in order to identify rare CF variants.

The electrochemical properties of the obtained electrode materials were determined as well, using both dc and ac methods. It was found that cobalt ferrite coatings show excellent electrocatalytic properties towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with overpotential measured at a current density of 10 mAcm−2 from 287 to 295 mV and a Tafel slope of 35–45 mVdec−1. It was shown that the increase in the apparent activity of the CoFe2O4 coatings with an organic binder results mainly from a large electrochemically active area. Incorporation of the nickel binder between the CoFe2O4 particles causes an increase in both the conductivity and the electrochemically active area. The Tafel slopes indicate that the same rate-determining step controls the OER for all obtained coatings. Furthermore, it was shown that the CoFe2O4 electrodes exhibit no significant activity decrease after 28 h of oxygen evolution. The proposed coating preparation procedures open a new path to develop high-performance OER electrocatalysts."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057851850","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61fa64c32467f013ba9235c8","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"b96e444f-ad60-4846-a8e0-632b6fd0bc78"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/catal12010021","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092ec878c28a04739f45f","name":"Julian","lastName":"Kubisztal","uuid":"FBD7823B11606ECB3FAEB404FC8C5211245BE7ED1C4D5FC58CCD8C0AD40C2A4492054E849ABECE544110C8D37D5BC1F3CDE65F454DE3463A0BFB03F83E3F9BC1","orcidId":"0000-0002-4855-9538","documentHash":"757d0259-87c4-4930-9391-4e5f88a697cf"},{"objectId":"5e7092ea878c28a04739f261","name":"Marian","lastName":"Kubisztal","uuid":"B58D5D6EBCA5E2CB1ADB692FC9FE95B4E45DF9CBCF2E217345C5F78019F997123B61809A65492F3FF6C99785305ADEF4B8BE081B9A473EDE788D4706EAC44207","orcidId":"0000-0002-4626-498X","documentHash":"00afee03-5ab6-4664-80d4-c4ebe50a2203"}],"doi":"10.3390/catal12010021"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df5d","uid":"bjvL21XFeS5rP8CLc0tzEEQ","uuid":"666d5aad-df9f-46e4-9191-c1ae6eef25b2","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de19","parentUuid":"5011bcd5-dfb1-41ed-84b0-5bd51ce0832c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de19","rootUuid":"5011bcd5-dfb1-41ed-84b0-5bd51ce0832c","name":"Wydział Filologiczny","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ec878c28a0473c6f4d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Ex Malo Bonum: Ambiguity in Stories of Organized Crime","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547793d","mniswId":"5007","title":"Deviant Behavior","doi":null,"issn":"0163-9625","eissn":"1521-0456","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b7db5755-7e4a-4589-81f6-1b29085a1a2f"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_ND","releaseDate":"2021-12-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61d181ca2467f07372259b63","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094ec878c28a0473c6f4d","667023694097074fa151b828"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Research on crime tends to emphasize clear-cut stories, either in support of or rejecting crime. Stories, however, are often ambiguous, mainly when they concern complex and multi-faceted phenomena. Based on qualitative interviews with Italian students, we explore how organized crime is viewed and evaluated by non-offenders. We found six widespread stories that highlight the moral ambiguity of organized crime, including such ambiguities as: people are good and evil; family relations take priority; crime involves ample opportunities and big money; organized crime is complex and involves “smart” organizations and that there are gray zones between business and crime and the endemicity of organized crime. Finally, we show the bounds of this moral ambiguity by pointing out what participants could not accept from organized crime organizations. The study was done within a framework of narrative criminology. We put a particular emphasis on how crime is socially constructed by those not involved, how worldviews of criminal organizations are embedded in more widespread values and the importance of ambiguity in storytelling"}],"lastRefresh":"1747057851871","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"44","pagesFromTo":"143-157","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01639625.2021.2019567","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"667023694097074fa151b828","name":"Sveinung","lastName":"Sandberg","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"be28432e-5764-48ee-aeb4-302ea4a63e13"},{"objectId":"5e7094ec878c28a0473c6f4d","name":"Fabio","lastName":"Poppi","uuid":"8CB85AC7D71D8536979601845C0B311077B79F7502FAC5336E1AEDABF38E9A21F51AC398AF26E6BFD945DF7E0579789ABD3702AEFD5528D4209F040F0BF39ADD","orcidId":"0000-0002-0731-3099","documentHash":"f797ce25-1269-4a11-958e-b140377cb165"}],"doi":"10.1080/01639625.2021.2019567"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Deflections and elastic deformations","Crankshafts","Geometrical deviations","Support conditions","Harmonic analysis"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","uid":"bsTIibl14j-FXDX1as_pUTA","uuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","parentUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","rootUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","name":"Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ad878c28a0473aeea8"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a047397282","5e709284878c28a047397223"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Determining geometrical deviations of crankshafts with limited detection possibilities due to support conditions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478dd6","mniswId":"14078","title":"Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation","doi":null,"issn":"0263-2241","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"066c10ef-6b87-4756-9477-5fcd8dff8d12"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61d0c9a52467f07cfb976ef1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397223","5e7093ad878c28a0473aeea8","5e709285878c28a047397282"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article is a continuation of previous research in which we analysed the effect of deflections and elastic deformations caused by unsupervised support conditions on the measurements of geometrical deviations of large crankshafts. Supporting the shaft using a set of rigid supports at the same height limited the ability to detect deviations in the pin axis position and pin profile. Formula for supporting crankshaft measurements was proposed using the results and metrology fundamentals, which allowed the accurate assessment of the geometric state under such conditions. The results provide solutions for measuring large crankshafts while eliminating the imperfections of current shaft measurement techniques. In result a high correlation (correlation coefficent at level 0.9935) with datum-based method was obtained. Therefore it was stated than proposed formula largely eliminates the disadvantages of shaft measurements using V-blocks with rigid supports."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057851920","journalIssue":{"objectId":"630767414097076f71ec15a8","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"189","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"d5e361b8-e9c0-4d1f-bb89-5b78644f8e1a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-10, [nr art.] 110430","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S026322412101318X?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093ad878c28a0473aeea8","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Dunaj","uuid":"D0210FC6C94E70BFE61D56981B7CD8D951CAF2B7611B39AAB460FBD020355B674A8BEAE81C56D24311221B4573F0D3F51B67468911A3856A1F50FF3ABCEA00C6","orcidId":"0000-0001-6866-2586","documentHash":"b0ea5d24-2463-43ba-8159-e9252e2fe11a"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a047397282","name":"KRZYSZTOF","lastName":"NOZDRZYKOWSKI","uuid":"A1EBCDD60DF80F7E4BF42F0D714D512D1D7495092AF8B8B466F74A745FA3B90AA864E275266B949A28C1ADB21BC37C0068DC564F19612486BF6EAF57B7C35735","orcidId":"0000-0003-2785-0868","documentHash":"63530bfa-f94e-4127-8fe5-1f36fef2b046"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397223","name":"ZENON","lastName":"GRZĄDZIEL","uuid":"76414D0FF37E0D426374AB68D055AA9A91C83BAABA49808ACE5964542F2BC4EF692447122729D9D6604BBE9DBEF9BFABF9D3749AF168882D55F8DEDECDAC2B87","orcidId":"0000-0001-9348-1111","documentHash":"aa298fdd-deae-4b0c-9cf2-083df0a91fd3"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.measurement.2021.110430"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6473","5e7092cf878c28a04739d208","5e709347878c28a0473a64bc","5e709346878c28a0473a62e7","5e709344878c28a0473a61ea","5e709472878c28a0473bd38e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The relation between phytochemical composition and sensory traits of selected Brassica vegetables","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d21","mniswId":"13782","title":"LWT Food Science and Technology","doi":null,"issn":"0023-6438","eissn":null,"websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/lwt-food-science-and-technology/","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"5be47d69-654c-44f4-86d7-97089df7c5db"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-19","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61d80f9f2467f030c19eda3e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092cf878c28a04739d208","61d80f9f2467f030c19eda41","5e709347878c28a0473a6473","5e709344878c28a0473a61ea","5e709472878c28a0473bd38e","5e709347878c28a0473a64bc","5e709346878c28a0473a62e7"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Main groups of sensory active compounds - glucosinolates, isothiocyanates, phenolics and sugars in 3 cultivars of broccoli, 5 of Brussels sprout, 3 of cauliflower, and 4 of kohlrabi, both raw and cooked, were analyzed and correlated with selected sensory traits. The differences in the concentration of these components were significant between different vegetables and also noticeable between cultivars of one vegetable. The bitterness of Brussels sprouts and broccoli was correlated with glucosinolates, though Brussel sprouts contained definitely higher concentration (>1 g/kg fw) of these substances than their concentration in broccoli (<0.3 g/kg fw), or other vegetables. A positive correlation between sugar concentration and general desirability was observed in Brussels sprouts (0.91 — raw), kohlrabi (0.53 — raw; 0.80 — cooked), and raw cauliflower (0.85). According to sensory analysis, the high correlation between sweetness level and general desirability was observed, however, sweetness intensity was not correlated with total sugars concentration.

This principle has been constructed, developed and linked to the guarantees of individual freedom. Its sixteenth and seventeenth century precursors and creators – John Locke and Charles Louis Montesquieu presented its essence and meaning as follows: „When in one and the same person or in one and the same body the legislative power is united with the executive, there is no freedom, because it is feared that the same monarch or the same senate may not constitute tyrannical laws to be tyrannically exercised. There is also no freedom if the judicial power is not separated from the legislative and executive powers. If it were combined with the legislature, the power over the life and freedom of citizens would be arbitrary, because the judge would be the legislator. If it were combined with the executive, the judge could have the power of an oppressor”. According to Montesquieu, laws should be adjusted to the degree of freedom that the system and society of a given state can accept, tolerate, contest or strongly oppose. For several years in Poland, it can be clearly observed that the foundation formulated by a philosopher of politics and a lawyer, having a solid base in the system of checking and balances of state authorities in the contemporary Polish State, which was considered and considered a bit earlier in Europe and in the world for a democratic state ruled by law, implementing the principles of social justice, it begins to falter. Departure from the principle of the separation of powers, limiting it or „giving it façade character, that is, reducing it to the level of a certain ideal that is not implemented in practice, leads to a situation already known to us from history, that is to the concept of a unified state power”. It is also known that the concepts currently implemented – as I write about in this monograph – cannot be accepted by lawyers specializing in EU law. They are not only inconsistent with the provisions of European Union law. They also have unfavorable repercussions for the relatively „new” member state, which the Republic of Poland is considered to be in the European space. The monograph was written for students of law, administration, public policy and political science. It is also addressed to mature lawyers, especially those who contest ideas submitted and, unfortunately, partially implemented. It is based on previous scientific achievements published in the central monthly magazines of legal journals. It presents the views, opinions and standpoints of the most outstanding European lawyers on the most important matters for the EU and the Republic of Poland, which are the rule of law, the independence of courts and the independence of judges. It is obvious that the above-mentioned problems cannot be fully presented in a book dealing with the most important legal problems for all Polish citizens. The book presents selected, most interesting legal issues that have never been encountered by people interested in the law and judicial authorities in the Republic of Poland, previously perceived as a member state of the European Union, and not only a partner of the common market. The author presents the views of the highest judicial authority of the EU – the Court of Justice and some EU institutions: the EU Commission and the CJEU Advocates General on matters in which they are involved in relations with the Republic of Poland. The book focuses on some, in my opinion, fundamental issues selected for the fundamental values that EU citizens respect and enjoy on an equal footing.

It is challenging to apply powdered chicken eggshell in cement industry and replace natural limestone. The impact of organic component of eggshell on modified cement was not studied yet. In the current report experimental studies were performed on the impact of the added powdered chicken eggshell instead of limestone on cement properties. 10, 20, and 30% of powdered eggshell (by weight) was added to Portland cement (CEM I 42.5 R) and the phase composition of limestone and eggshell was determined using an XRD technique and IR/Raman spectroscopy. Among the physical parameters analyzed were setting time, water demand of cement with mineral and bioinorganic admixtures and strength of mortar. The delayed hydration of cement paste and slightly lower strength parameters of mortar were observed in the presence of eggshell admixtures. This effect was explained by the presence of shell membrane in the admixture, composed from organic substances, including proteins. The results of our research can be useful in the field of materials science for creating ecologically improved building materials."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057879132","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"319","pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2021.126006","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"663ca8784097076263b1cdf4","name":"Roman","lastName":"Wrzalik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8c71b5f4-92d1-47ee-9e76-220a0b8eb169"},{"objectId":"663ca8784097076263b1cdf3","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Oleksowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c5e323b-e412-49c2-96bc-e8505849e0ee"},{"objectId":"663ca8784097076263b1cdf2","name":"Natalina","lastName":"Makieieva","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"67acde64-9951-4d06-8f8f-81632ef83fb3"},{"objectId":"663ca8784097076263b1cdf1","name":"Krystian","lastName":"Jurowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"873cd8b9-6401-47c8-83b5-56d1defa5f5c"},{"objectId":"663ca8784097076263b1cdf0","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kałamarz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"601f7d5a-910d-48d1-8de2-36fb95f1cd8b"},{"objectId":"663ca8784097076263b1cdef","name":"Stefania","lastName":"Grzeszczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f82785e9-9ff5-48a5-adf9-bd47e5175ede"},{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a0473975ab","name":"Adam","lastName":"Sudoł","uuid":"F9AD33C60D5C8A0D586131ECAD47B6D6F88E9F6DD5C62B6883E65BAE15CE17F9B5004AFE0041DC9EEFF37AFC9735ACF8F6CED9B08F7B691389A23299AE6DBD92","orcidId":"0000-0001-7015-0096","documentHash":"0bbf02e3-f1c4-44dc-8d4c-59b9e054522e"},{"objectId":"5e709287878c28a0473974c4","name":"Teobald","lastName":"Kupka","uuid":"6CC5CE3F33FB2ED55CF5D364A6BDF13C39BAC0FDF9EE9689B595891036BF1B424B75C4C84FCA740CC9287F73E453C243EA1A30CB0854D77F03159EDDD461AFFE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6252-3822","documentHash":"40e52f80-2dbb-4b0c-a4e1-d5fb073a967c"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2021.126006"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["English as a lingua franca","Central and Eastern Europe","Academic faculty","Language barrier","Scholarly communication","Higher education"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","uid":"bLDwoyIU1jG5BHqZ9HzVPQg","uuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","parentUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","rootUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","name":"Wyższa Szkoła Informatyki i Zarządzania z siedzibą w Rzeszowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709291878c28a04739801b","5e70929a878c28a047398dc6","5e709291878c28a04739801d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"English as a lingua franca?

Similar to multinational corporations, academic environments are believed to be one of the best examples of a social space where English is a lingua franca. In this paper, we question this claim. Focusing on the case of foreign-born scholars who hold academic positions in Poland, a country where the number of international faculty members and researchers is low, we conducted 100 biographically oriented in-depth interviews about their work at Polish universities and their language issues. This sociological qualitative approach enabled us to identify both the domains where English fluency is an asset and the “black holes” (bureaucratic issues, teaching, research collaboration) where English language communication is either impossible or impeded. The study also identifies the facilitators (cultural intermediaries) and strategies (e.g., intercomprehension and niche lingua francas) used to overcome language barriers."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057879315","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62d50bbf4097074b28a6b31b","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"66","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"a4b1b273-911c-4a63-a958-3dcb22e565c4"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"66","pagesFromTo":"3-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esp.2021.11.002","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398dc6","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Łuczaj","uuid":"752A8636C1B802B60B97E008BBD46A79E6671BF83A47D1AEA80F25DE09ACD96F475A2D4188C0F8F7FECEC29F3E41325A5DC3F8E3F04ADDAB966A2FB7B0E16954","orcidId":"0000-0002-1603-3259","documentHash":"1e707e0d-330c-4fc3-9a76-af30c564b91f"},{"objectId":"5e709291878c28a04739801d","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Leonowicz-Bukała","uuid":"DCC73A43959C1608275D00B5EEEE0258A1708E6FA14CAFA8EC112F5405540FFE994A2A9A3DB91A38948B42FF6313DB04C5F10F8FF9E0B9B48E0B60FCF3B6CD1B","orcidId":"0000-0003-3164-1209","documentHash":"033236bd-00e0-4380-b989-fda714e8e982"},{"objectId":"5e709291878c28a04739801b","name":"Olga","lastName":"Kurek-Ochmańska","uuid":"EB07FD12E565FD795428EE1F423140A83291B30D91A72B6EA5A8E4FEC83298F805AF0D4248C8FCF8B80D1BC3DFA24BC9E0F2372624FFFBB21EF101D0C48DEFBA","orcidId":"0000-0002-6627-785X","documentHash":"500191d1-fe74-44cb-8b41-91ddd9cf842d"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.esp.2021.11.002"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Innovation","Well-being","Ergonomics","Sustainability","Emergent technologies","Industrial logistics"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"61d53ed82467f016024a37f4","doi":null,"title":"Sustainability and Innovation in Manufacturing Enterprises.

Thus, the study aimed to discuss the potential of the slow city model and the actual role of Cittaslow local governments in deploying renewable energy, based on the case study of the Polish Cittaslow Network. To achieve this aim, we carried out qualitative and quantitative data analyses, based on literature review and data for all 35 Polish Cittaslow municipalities, retrieved from: (i) development strategies (ii) a survey (iii) the Local Data Bank of Statistics Poland, (iv) the Quality of Life Synthetic Index (QLI). To process the data, we applied descriptive statistics, the Shapiro-Wilk test, the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, and the Spearman’s rank test. Findings showed that the support for renewable energy deployment was not at a high level and did not correlate with the goals set in the Cittaslow development strategies. This was the result of a cumulation of pressing social and economic problems, which the local authorities in Poland are legally obliged to solve, while the implementation of renewable energy is not obligatory. The QLI for these municipalities was low and renewable energy was not a significant element in improving the quality of life of citizens.

The modelling was performed using a ubiquitous joint constitutive law with strain softening. The applied procedure is capable of reproducing the macroscopic stress and strain evolution in the sample during triaxial deformation until a failure process occurs. In addition, we calculated focal mechanisms of acoustic emission (AE) events and resolved local stress field orientations. This detailed stress information was compared with that from numerical modelling. The comparison was made based on the 3D rotation angle between the cardinal axes of the two stress tensors. To infer the differences in rotation, we applied ANOVA. We identified the two time levels as the plastic deformation phase and the after-failure phase. Additionally, we introduced the bin factor, which describes the location of the rotation scores in the rock sample. The p values of the test statistics F for the bin and phase effects are statistically significant. However, the interaction between them is insignificant. We can, therefore, conclude that there was a significant difference in the time between the rotation means in the particular bins, and we ran post hoc tests to obtain more information where the differences between the groups lie. The largest rotation of the stress field provided by the focal mechanisms of AE events from the numerically calculated stress field is observed in the edge bins, which do not frame the damage zone of the sample."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057879890","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c909954097074220c4cb56","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"40","doi":"","documentHash":"d694f9a7-3977-4a6c-9147-0a6af3cd9967"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"40","pagesFromTo":"2455–2474","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10706-021-02038-w.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61d2cb292467f0718bff89d3","name":"Musa Adebayo","lastName":"Idris","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7dc4d6af-a8e6-4f38-bc63-d4b2ce3db28a"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af539","name":"Beata","lastName":"Orlecka-Sikora","uuid":"05C232E225B92508A67E3CB3A26629C7F5FE6D6F78D547920033B0BA5768AD1CC1912FC2223767E5354F2AA14EE0974881A8A37C7952BC36AE274CCC6F9A4A00","orcidId":"0000-0002-0182-1455","documentHash":"dd7b93a1-d01a-4e00-bcec-bab626486cc5"},{"objectId":"5e709297878c28a047398a15","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Cielesta","uuid":"3160F677F9A5E748E3D799461E237F4F819A972838A37C5C70610BAB74D00BE52D730653FD02BADD3075DB4B52D0D6B79718D8F6FEE6C39D9E9ED33F02CA6809","orcidId":"0000-0002-2819-6127","documentHash":"7c9d1d49-6a9b-4284-905c-c5cf76f452d3"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10706-021-02038-w"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cutting","strength","resistance","shape","knife","edge","sharpness","rheology","viscoelasticity"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","uid":"bnV99khMVeG3t9dh4evZESg","uuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","parentUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","rootUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","name":"Politechnika Koszalińska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ae878c28a04739a986","5e7093e2878c28a0473b28f0","5e7092ae878c28a04739a9ac"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defc","uid":"b6NUXJH6kJYzzJvxqM0-8WA","uuid":"91d4e88b-bf82-4151-99d4-8e91de5ac284","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defc","parentUuid":"91d4e88b-bf82-4151-99d4-8e91de5ac284","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defc","rootUuid":"91d4e88b-bf82-4151-99d4-8e91de5ac284","name":"Morski Instytut Rybacki - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091ff878c28a04738e556"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Increasing the Efficiency of Food Material Cutting during Inclined and Shear Movements of Knife","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":"10.3390/ma","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"8475d9fb-a844-4cfe-87c7-25090cd02fd3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-31","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61d2d9722467f0718b08a6e5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61d2d9722467f0718b08a6e7","5e7091ff878c28a04738e556","5e7093e2878c28a0473b28f0","5e7092ae878c28a04739a986","61d2d9722467f0718b08a6eb","5e7092ae878c28a04739a9ac"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Mathematical models for predicting the resistance forces that are developed during the inclined and sliding cutting of food materials have been developed. The dependence of the actual cutting angle on the angle of inclination and sliding speed of the cutting edge at various sharpening angles have been investigated. For the inclined cutting mode, the dependence of the useful resistance force on the cutting speed has been determined at various angles of inclination of the cutting edge and designed sharpening angles. For the sliding cutting mode, the dependence of the useful resistance force on the feeding speed has been demonstrated at various sliding speed values and designed knife sharpening angles. The dependence of the transformed dimensionless sharpness of the knife on the angle of inclination of the cutting edge and the sliding speed has been established for different constructional sharpness values of the knife. The results of the study indicate that the useful resistance force is significantly reduced during the inclined and sliding cutting processes when compared with the normal cutting process, and a change in the pattern of fiber destruction, which significantly increases the cutting efficiency of cutting tools, is obtained."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057882157","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61d2de162467f0718b0abf0f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"72d88700-5df7-429f-bf3c-1b2ab783a992"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/1/289","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61d2d9722467f0718b08a6eb","name":"Natalia V.","lastName":"Samojlova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e25e929f-c9e2-40f3-943f-3519684860a7"},{"objectId":"61d2d9722467f0718b08a6e7","name":"Oleg V.","lastName":"Ageev","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"06437036-667b-445e-9ffb-cb7d533faf18"},{"objectId":"5e7093e2878c28a0473b28f0","name":"Monika","lastName":"Sterczyńska","uuid":"20AF558B0C0D1B752A154DA13F052DAF9C700F8813628638EEBEE7CF8EABE5A66A2B7D08064A76D635699B2F754B9D6BBAEBD24E04A8421903D67C2C2ECDCAF0","orcidId":"0000-0002-8432-4752","documentHash":"2f92ad20-c2d5-4f86-bdb3-ec5bce348cdb"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a9ac","name":"Marek","lastName":"Jakubowski","uuid":"0ACD54641D90F7BC820236EB03B241EA587469F50C273DDBA696A9885B12D2ABD68DE5B957F84EE75DD630F4F3FA8F131788B2024578DE0C713811CD8BF0C6B3","orcidId":"0000-0002-1273-7224","documentHash":"78054a3a-7e53-4806-ba40-9e5394dd99a7"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a986","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Piepiórka-Stepuk","uuid":"BEED9E56720965451B1DBA17A91CF47A49C9D266E00B60C2E7C188C11FEA9C4B3556D4C2679B08EE6CA92DE484A520566B6FA339D9D267036AF35A9FD495EDF9","orcidId":"0000-0002-5615-3343","documentHash":"716102e1-cc41-40b9-a695-e6f4ae9d4a81"},{"objectId":"5e7091ff878c28a04738e556","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Dowgiałło","uuid":"313FCB957F577C728CCF3914BE26AA8927122D067E3E45BCAFB6B4C5A24ECCBE04C06B898767C01E5726DBB9316BE4911A93E54AC933CDF06C5E52393D4D949E","orcidId":"0000-0003-0537-0732","documentHash":"5aca31ba-b8f1-4a5f-9d88-3aa6be54a9b4"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15010289"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cosmic rays","cosmic ray ensembles","UHE photons","Monte Carlo"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df60","uid":"bWqupAF8mYMYUB7YG6k8zhg","uuid":"7b4e05f4-599b-4af8-b21f-7bebb6739b32","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de19","parentUuid":"5011bcd5-dfb1-41ed-84b0-5bd51ce0832c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de19","rootUuid":"5011bcd5-dfb1-41ed-84b0-5bd51ce0832c","name":"Wydział Fizyki i Informatyki Stosowanej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709368878c28a0473a8d83"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","uid":"bdkLR6wGCrp59lwUjwb_dMA","uuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","parentUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","rootUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","name":"Instytut Fizyki Jądrowej im.

As they reach the Earth, they have a non-zero probability of converting into an electron/positron pair in the geomagnetic field and of producing an electromagnetic shower above the atmosphere. In this work, we present a new method to search for cascading UHE photons with gamma-ray telescopes based on Monte-Carlo simulations and multivariate analyses. Considering the future CTA-North experiment in La Palma, Spain, we show that such a method provides an efficient cosmic-ray background rejection with little loss of cascading UHE photon events. We also estimate that if gamma-ray bursts photon emission extends to the EeV regime, the number of expected events in 30 hours of observation time can go up to

It is difficult to think of ways and opportunities to introduce practical classes in modern high-energy physics, astrophysics, or particle physics into school curricula and after-school activities. Small EAS array experiments are just such a proposal. As part of the CREDO-Maze project, we plan to equip local high schools with sets of four small detectors, with a simple system for triggering, recording, and online communication with the world. Networked experiments from several schools add significant new educational value to the process of developing good behavior appropriate to scientific communities. Cooperation and competition at the stage of own research and information exchange are essential new and valuable values in educating young generation.

this paper, we study a subclass of piecewise-deterministic Markov processes with a Polish state space, involving deterministic motion punctuated by random jumps that occur at exponentially distributed time intervals. Over each of these intervals, the process follows a flow, selected randomly among a finite set of all possible ones. Our main goal is to provide a set of verifiable conditions guaranteeing the exponential ergodicity for such processes (in terms of the bounded Lipschitz distance), which would refer only to properties of the flows and the transition law of the Markov chain given by the post-jump locations. Moreover, we establish a simple criterion on the exponential ergodicity for a particular instance of these processes, applicable to certain biological models, where the jumps result from the action of an iterated function system with place-dependent probabilities."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057890584","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61d6423b2467f0730e28ba65","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"215","number":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.na.2021.112678","documentHash":"d75c1db8-f328-4d73-896a-c5d4f89a55c0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"215","pagesFromTo":"112678","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0362546X21002650?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709418878c28a0473b6184","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Wojewódka-Ściążko","uuid":"D2B4B669AC5BDA289FF470C285838E955349CEC8C3F17E9C5880F4CC50B37B50E7028CB55562E1D9FC1F8F6F7F0141FF0E8634B83874A53CACA444F93913A124","orcidId":"0000-0002-8248-5018","documentHash":"fe573664-2fad-4fd8-bcff-b37d83b70568"},{"objectId":"5e7093ce878c28a0473b1208","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Czapla","uuid":"D167D24A18BF6AE46607BAE4C4611D428EFCFCC5DCBC3FAFAA277D7B4C64040933F5E8319009F86BEF51A2C55180582A01BE4241ACDD2B6D48C10A2CDE6A83DA","orcidId":"0000-0002-0562-773X","documentHash":"f28e9a92-f3f6-4dc0-ab7d-4490f8bf638a"},{"objectId":"5e7092e6878c28a04739ee4f","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Horbacz","uuid":"9F85FEC9F533D5CD725675DF383E89E4BF4C2E5BDBC3041B3A3DCCDC3A8B34BBB7F0172512AAF1D1B47D4716789887252044A2C54020B39E760B19EC3110168C","orcidId":"0000-0003-2900-0031","documentHash":"6db4168b-69d6-446c-9802-5a4aa066d961"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.na.2021.112678"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"61d35a522467f0718b32008e","doi":null,"title":"Transdisciplinary

the first preparation of triptycene, great progress has been made with respect to its synthesis and the understanding of its properties. Interest in triptycene-based systems is intense; in recent years, advances in the synthetic methodology and properties of new triptycenes have been reported by researchers from various fields of science. Here, an account of these new developments is given and placed in reference to earlier pivotal works that underpin the field. First, we discuss new approaches to the synthesis of new triptycenes. Progress in the regioselective synthesis of sterically demanding systems is discussed. The application of triptycenes in catalysis is also presented. Next, progress in the understanding of the relations between triptycene structures and their properties is discussed. The unique properties of triptycenes in the liquid and solid states are elaborated. Unique interactions, which involve triptycene molecular scaffolds, are presented.

The materials used in this study consisted of seedlings of three triticale lines differing in Al3+ tolerance, first subjected to aluminum ion stress and then recovered. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) was used for seedling root protein separation followed by differential spot analysis using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS/MS). The plants’ tolerance to the stress was evaluated based on biometric screening of seedling root regrowth upon regeneration.

purpose of this paper is an analysis of the presence of self-selection mechanisms on the market that could bring the market closer to the separating equilibrium state, in line with the Rothschild–Stiglitz equilibrium model and its subsequent modifications. An example is the Polish market of compulsory third-party liability insurance of vehicle owners. This paper describes this market in terms of both its structure and its financial results. The main focus is on describing the assumptions of the Rothschild–Stiglitz model for markets operating under the conditions of information asymmetry and based on the self-selection mechanism, allowing for an unequivocal determination of the insured’s profile without the need to actually observe the insured’s behaviour. Finally, we show that thanks to the self-selection induced by the possibility of driving behaviour monitoring, the industry can minimise the negative effect information asymmetry has on the motor insurance market. This can be achieved, for example, by observing the choices made by the insured after being offered a new voluntary contract with a premium based on telematics data. Our analysis was carried out with the use of three selected characteristics that can determine the insured’s risk profile, i.e., distance covered, self-assessment, and insurance premium paid; the significance of the latter—although it may be intuitive—is questionable at commonly accepted significance levels. Therefore, the main result is that although there is some evidence on the disputed matter, there can be no definitive conclusion—especially in terms of risk as measured by insurance premium."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057896285","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61dbe0752467f07650a5ff9d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"10","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"84905dd1-fb6e-4fef-a134-9f645050f7a9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9091/10/1/9","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094f5878c28a0473c7dcd","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Kuryłowicz","uuid":"9B5EDC50BBD581836C4CFCF9FAF0C561C6D9A9BF37935FD8E58B3535B67161613EAB9A7EF73746C8143603A706065D00E5E3F3C995BDE2F4C341591EBB4FFEFD","orcidId":"0000-0003-4247-4813","documentHash":"ce59a7eb-76c2-4fd7-bee7-6b018efa1e7c"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a0473950be","name":"Adam","lastName":"Śliwiński","uuid":"F16EA3C4604E1E2B4A44214B627E37361DB17D901B797E4F1B53285AE24CFFBDE57E5A0E2951D39C3C460A76BE21A1946D5788D904462538063DB6E0BAEC8AF0","orcidId":"0000-0002-7817-0101","documentHash":"8bd35e92-2e8a-4fb3-8f72-742ff96a1999"}],"doi":"10.3390/risks10010009"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Implementation of the PointPillars network for 3D object detection in reprogrammable heterogeneous devices using FINN","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478a6f","mniswId":"12632","title":"Journal of Signal Processing Systems","doi":null,"issn":"1939-8018","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"8634d37b-1baa-4500-8992-c36f1c13e18e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61db33d42467f060593631b7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c33e839543c7233654423f","60c2fd3d9543c723365434f3","5e70922b878c28a047391130"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747057896350","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11265-021-01733-4","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"60c33e839543c7233654423f","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Stanisz","uuid":"0A00221631E9FE0A7446173DD81CA47ED5318FB20B0657CE124E9B898602971F0B14343B7A71A8F35CEBD28EF5C2340E94F1FA48196E742C2290438959C98CEB","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"691aa017-f0f1-4b0a-ac98-5f01a97f383d"},{"objectId":"60c2fd3d9543c723365434f3","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Lis","uuid":"8CD34984C2373BB299CA5EE0C1E1FF1970880322BDD5F60A85DAF08BD055817E6D7EC52CAF077523C76A84A78DF6896E2AA207C183913804915CA24BE41BF448","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"32e5cc30-bb45-4516-885b-d2f9cd2c7ca5"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047391130","name":"Marek","lastName":"Gorgoń","uuid":"8F152AB2F9D36C1FDE0CDA28900FB44D58FBDFCE6AC07DD8C2B29A5EFDB0A3FF9D03C1DB107D48DCC0A6B06A719756B2E120544FACD4ABCD198E34A0939BA9A0","orcidId":"0000-0003-1746-1279","documentHash":"cfe38190-2fc4-43b5-aaec-546c7577c2f3"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11265-021-01733-4"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["expenditure","forecasting","Russian and Saudi Arabian policy","COVID-19","military security"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b6878c28a047385e24","uid":"bITc4cttztoiiv973rXfccw","uuid":"9d48cae3-39ad-462a-8216-ad67ec5520ed","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wydział Bezpieczeństwa, Logistyki i Zarządzania","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929a878c28a047398ed1","5e70929a878c28a047398eda","5e7093be878c28a0473b0111","5e70929a878c28a047398ed9"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Forecasting of Military Expenditure in Saudi Arabia  in Terms of Military Security","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a2ab","mniswId":"200469","title":"Polish Political Science.

It outlines the important theoretical issues, surveys the major approaches, and identifies areas of both convergence and discrepancy between them. By proposing three sample analyses, the book highlights the relevant questions addressed in different but compatible models, as well as identifies possible avenues of their further development. Finally, it considers several domains of potential interest to the linguistic worldview agenda. Because inquiry into linguistic worldviews concerns the sphere of the symbolic and the cultural, it touches upon the very essence of human lives.\n\nThis book will be of interest to scholars working in cultural linguistics, ethnolinguistics, linguistic anthropology, comparative semantics, and translation studies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057896756","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":"1","volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":"Routledge Studies in Linguistics","translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb75f","mniswId":"2100","name":"Routledge","documentHash":"e0fe2ae4-db98-48bc-8602-82536879acfd"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781003018803","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092f8878c28a0473a028a","name":"Adam","lastName":"Głaz","uuid":"F40316155B2E19B5242FD3567A4CC10A01518690D87D855D75DBA480AB806D84F02741DD6C4BBD148235EC10284B7896278A0B48C3D376CE9A113BBE558FFC65","orcidId":"0000-0002-6143-3542","documentHash":"210935b8-0c8f-40ad-8c97-7ac1fe11f49b"}],"doi":"10.4324/9781003018803"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Marine engines","statistical analysis","Engines","Identification,","reliability"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","uid":"bGA_QwQGoDNg-6MMEBxlWNQ","uuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","parentUuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","rootUuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","name":"Akademia Marynarki Wojennej im.
