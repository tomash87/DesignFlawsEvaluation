The most importantly, it was concluded that the contents of studied nutrients differed significantly (p <0.05) depending on the morphological part of plant. Protein content (2.27–10.58%) was generally higher than in many wild or cultivated fruits, while flowers were distinguished by the highest content (10.58%), as compared with other studied parts of this plant. Cornus mas contained a substancial amount of lipids (3.34–5.23%, except  fruits).  Leaves  proved  to  be  extremely  rich  in  carotenoids,  mainly  β-carotene  (88.5  mg.kg-1)  compared  with  the  rest  of  the  plant.  The  application  of  GC  enabled  detecting  14  fatty  acids  in  lipid  fraction  extracted  from  Cornus mas  samples,  belonging  to  all  groups.  SFAs  were  represented  by  palmitic  acid  (C16:0)  10.87–32.20  g.100  g-1  of  oil.  Among  MUFAs  oleic  acid  (C18:1  9c)  3.25–19.61  g.100  g-1  of  oil  dominated,  with  the  highest  content  in  fruits.  Lipid  fraction was extremely rich in PUFAs: 32.52–61.86 g.100 g-1 of oil. The major PUFA was linoleic acid (C18:2 9c12c): 7.93  (in  leaves)  –  60.18  g.100  g-1  of  oil  (in  seeds);  second  most  abundant  was  α-linolenic  acid  (C18:3  9c12c15c), especially in leaves and flowers (24.59–30.22 g.100 g-1 of oil, respectively). Cornus mas samples may represent a novel dietary source of valuable α-linolenic acid from n-3 PUFAs family. In total, 18 amino acids were detected in Cornus massamples, while 9 of them belonged to essential ones. Flowers were distinguished by the highest content of amino acids with the highest amounts of leucine (6.1 g.kg-1), lysine (6.2 g.kg-1), aspartic (10.7 g.kg-1) and glutamic (10.7 g.kg-1) acids. Calcium was the most abundant element in all samples (2647–25687 mg.kg-1 of dry weight, except fruits. Nutrients content and composition suggest that Cornus mas may become an inexpensive novel plant source of functional foods, and as new ingredient in human diet, especially with regard to underappreciated leaves and flowers."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058127883","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"6","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://agrobiodiversity.uniag.sk/scientificpapers/issue/view/13","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"643adde84097076e1e9e9431","name":"Ján","lastName":"Brindza","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aecd8381-c56c-433b-8b08-5e8918528ca7"},{"objectId":"643adde84097076e1e9e9430","name":"Katarína","lastName":"Fatrcová-Šramková","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"25062c49-1cab-4d51-8122-90fd0e639acc"},{"objectId":"643adde84097076e1e9e942e","name":"Svitlana","lastName":"Klymenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"db1fcdbe-cd96-4478-99c8-fbcbb448e817"},{"objectId":"643adde84097076e1e9e942d","name":"Eva","lastName":"Ivanišová","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"71781bf9-c4cb-4097-8f40-c8986b732ce8"},{"objectId":"5e709386878c28a0473abf13","name":"Agata","lastName":"Antoniewska-Krzeska","uuid":"0835838C212E61DF4D341FB4865AFD91FB0A5550A0A2BF2D2BB69B0E4E2682BB6EB4C94412E2E4B0A031022D3D3CCB95BEC25A0B9FB9E52CE9BFE76CEA1C83DB","orcidId":"0000-0002-4293-5811","documentHash":"b424e35f-643f-42d7-a3ea-f37d2d0d2aef"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390c3d","name":"Anna","lastName":"Bieniek","uuid":"64946E191D0D5BFF24ED9F2B68E06B3706632FF1933E53AFF29CF7CFF22687B442DD68E135750693082590B18486825FD226562E3CC7F4C0CEE0359E3CECE6CF","orcidId":"0000-0002-5903-1405","documentHash":"34aba856-8c66-4a32-92d7-3341ec9ea283"}],"doi":"10.15414/ainhlq.2022.0001"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["finansowanie przedsiębiorstw","województwo lubuskie","małe i średnie przedsiębiorstwa","fundusze unijne"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":"9788366703674","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de6d","uid":"bIyN9cy073sy-77ulzW-Vmw","uuid":"bafdd534-9afd-4d8d-9412-30dc2d48ab6b","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de6d","parentUuid":"bafdd534-9afd-4d8d-9412-30dc2d48ab6b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de6d","rootUuid":"bafdd534-9afd-4d8d-9412-30dc2d48ab6b","name":"Akademia im.

Additionally, the effect of the retention of bioactive components on the antioxidant activity of mushroom extracts was evaluated, taking into account the morphological part. Oyster mushrooms grown in the light of 200 lux had higher riboflavin content compared to mushrooms exposed to the light of lower intensity. The thiamine content of the mushrooms dropped with decreasing light intensity during cultivation. The content of biologically active compounds was found to be equal in the stem and the cap. In the case of riboflavin, it was shown that its contents in cap fractions, irrespective of the cultivation method, was statistically significantly higher than in stems. The mineral composition of caps and stems differed from each other. No differences in Zn and Cu content between the morphological parts of the mushroom studied were found. However, it was shown that the stems, regardless of the type of light, contained less iron, magnesium and sodium. Thus, it was observed that limited light exposure caused an increase in the content of total polyphenolic compounds, which did not correlate with antioxidant activity. There was no effect of the light on the antioxidant activity of mushrooms. It was also shown that stem extracts had higher antioxidant activity compared to the extracts obtained from the caps. This findings point to the possibility and potentail of use both fraction of mushrooms in the new food products development."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058127891","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0262279","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629d02724097070cd34d80bb","name":"Anna","lastName":"Janczewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"17814603-ab2e-4379-a227-43e1481a3e86"},{"objectId":"60c2fe8b9543c72336543860","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Zawadzka","uuid":"10D8304ECAAD0AD92EC216252DF8A43D4E8B32DB8B54AFA5C7EF5CC13D6D4C12250837B7C5748B4347852DE3297EE92ECF1637B4AF9C0757C62F8A24E2AE8C22","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cbd9920c-dd7a-44ff-8ce3-ba88eab84c17"},{"objectId":"602f39ab9543c7410626f223","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Dziedziński","uuid":"9F65744144AB8F67763BE7AD366ACE70808F34A4A52FEFF2CA0C4A0A080AF32D30CFDE44A306DFCABC7BED727E5AC1513D04675817D04782D23A39A1A52BF395","orcidId":"0000-0003-1069-0095","documentHash":"8184c1f9-05d8-4e58-ab6d-dd05d8bb0ca7"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6443","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Stuper-Szablewska","uuid":"89458AD33E90F7D5DA9FFF004F3ED6F9D46DD48F28D476632DF610494D078B410E9A695A0F8B865E8D5320F2B388403A8BCDD94A880E282F730324D9B26CDFC3","orcidId":"0000-0002-9011-8592","documentHash":"4c7eab1d-0090-4e50-a0ef-5e15d76ef13b"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6417","name":"Marek","lastName":"Siwulski","uuid":"1CB424018D0168DCB940F47BD4EF9E01E2361F40B18B8308AEF1B9C231014DBC5C40EBE21A7F20D6FF1242EE458EB290161C0267941760CC6C43165BE045E841","orcidId":"0000-0001-7185-5039","documentHash":"e41e160c-82c7-4f21-89ec-1c6ad6004cb5"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62fc","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kobus-Cisowska","uuid":"925719C4CF592431A02095A6CBB6486E15D08704DEA3F9E8129CD56451DA7498A9F1A9A539C029AACF238280863ADF2A13AC26A894D35596D81677D361D34423","orcidId":"0000-0003-2834-0405","documentHash":"f2409725-eaad-4acd-971d-7797557b8988"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a047392280","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Czarniecka-Skubina","uuid":"D5BB036490313F298C5E6451555C8EDC3D3713055861F93C8013A2B93C9ABC46F2D385D7F5C542E13B384DE9FCCD5A1FEA4CE186A3F80619B41A3399AB548BD4","orcidId":"0000-0001-6557-5436","documentHash":"303e9dd1-7b51-4507-a178-16cec6c13f66"}],"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0262279"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["brine","fishery industry waste","single cell oil","Yarrowia lipolytica"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Brine and Post-Frying Oil Management in the Fish Processing Industry—A Concept Based on Oleaginous Yeast Culture","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547cfa0","mniswId":"16576","title":"Processes","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2227-9717","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"9bbb9f49-7b25-4f2f-accb-63283b7536a1"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629d072e4097070cd34d86ef","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709428878c28a0473b74ab","5e70923b878c28a0473921d8","629d072e4097070cd34d86fb","629d072e4097070cd34d86fc","5e7093d5878c28a0473b19c8"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>Waste management solutions including the valorization of waste materials in biotechnological processes is an important issue needing to be explored. A significant amount of waste is being generated by the food industry. In this study, an attempt was made to utilize two fish industry wastes simultaneously—waste brine and post-frying oil from frying fish fillets in Yarrowia lipolytica culture with high single cell oil synthesis yield. Oxygenation in the culture medium had a positive effect on the biosynthesis efficiency of microbial oil, resulting in the highest content of lipids in yeast cells at the level of 0.431 g/g dm (dry mass). Y. lipolytica yeast preferentially accumulated oleic acid and linoleic acid, and the high content of linolenic acid, valuable from a nutritional point of view, was also found in microbial oil. This study proved that the use of post-frying rapeseed oil gives a chance to obtain valuable storage lipids in Y. lipolytica yeast cells via ex novo biosynthesis pathway. Furthermore, the wastewater stream could be limited using a waste brine as a solvent in medium preparation, but the brine share should not exceed 30% so as not to inhibit yeast cell growth.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058127894","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629d072e4097070cd34d86fc","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Wołoszynowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d4779c85-870a-4b5b-9a1e-9834302db07c"},{"objectId":"629d072e4097070cd34d86fb","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Wierzchowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"828cef3a-f12a-4f3b-af32-a4f0c08357c6"},{"objectId":"5e709428878c28a0473b74ab","name":"Agata","lastName":"Fabiszewska","uuid":"FCE1FF212F172B5426839FF89A0E608AB8EA02930004B584EB137E910108ADE1C744F748A3335CD91D519195D63D3D4715CE58D7D572245769A4488CDDFCF880","orcidId":"0000-0002-4563-6649","documentHash":"a7ad6af7-0fa1-4d8d-a6fd-48fa530a399a"},{"objectId":"5e7093d5878c28a0473b19c8","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Zieniuk","uuid":"D782057207C8C02BBF6CE3E4F0A79D5C1A2774FF2D1EE8B2DC7DBE10CCEBF91BE451DA097CA654A41C34B2C21CAB90CF65EF29313B98F9EC266F38C7AA67262D","orcidId":"0000-0001-6344-8695","documentHash":"8c9330b0-306c-4920-9068-4516860c4627"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a0473921d8","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"B5A7E86DAC27367AA0D083EFF529D9DD4C72CE1E03AB15493429762C87D85F4FBE1CACC8F7C4E673EFFF46BB865BFFB79EF64E1EFBBF4B77F7CA7CEE79526673","orcidId":"0000-0002-5450-8294","documentHash":"fbd403cc-a26e-4812-9d08-4c6180cdffdb"}],"doi":"10.3390/pr10020294"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["węglan propylenu","alkoholiza mocznika","glikol propylenowy"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["propylene carbonate","propylene glycol","urea alcoholysis"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709240878c28a047392743","673d987cfdbe832d85e16f81","5e70923e878c28a047392497"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Synthesis of propylene carbonate by urea alcoholysis - recent advances","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477568","mniswId":"3333","title":"Catalysts","doi":null,"issn":"2073-4344","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"467b91d9-8d0c-4cfd-ab42-eccbc898d26d"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-09","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"622f15842467f016697be467","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923e878c28a047392497","5e709240878c28a047392743","673d987cfdbe832d85e16f81"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>Organic carbonates are considered the chemicals of the future.

The presence of these bacteria in different niches  makes them a potential threat for public health. In the present review, the current  information on the classical and alternative methods used for isolation and identifi\u0002cation of L. monocytogenes in food have been described. Although these techniques  are usually simple, standardized, inexpensive, and are routinely used in many food  testing laboratories, several alternative molecular-based approaches for the bacte\u0002ria detection in food and food production environments have been developed. They  are characterized by the high sample throughput, a short time of analysis, and cost\u0002effectiveness. However, these methods are important for the routine testing toward  the presence and number of L. monocytogenes, but are not suitable for characteris\u0002tics and typing of the bacterial isolates, which are crucial in the study of listeriosis  infections. For these purposes, novel approaches, with a high discriminatory power  to genetically distinguish the strains during epidemiological studies, have been de\u0002veloped, e.g., whole-genome sequence-based techniques such as NGS which provide  an opportunity to perform comparison between strains of the same species. In the  present review, we have shown a short description of the principles of microbiologi\u0002cal, alternative, and modern methods of detection of L. monocytogenes in foods and  characterization of the isolates for epidemiological purposes. According to our knowl\u0002edge, similar comprehensive papers on such subject have not been recently published,  and we hope that the current review may be interesting for research communities."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058127903","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-30","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fsn3.2910","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"608a55de9543c73526c48c68","name":"Beata","lastName":"Lachtara","uuid":"282991714039C961E3319F2426A2863D93470CCBE543F8EC7CE3808AE7F95DEC9E25A5232A45D0AAB8B01CF326F9497B266A34643AE9A696A6239B39FF83989E","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a6cf7b97-c844-48db-a522-0850505ee499"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d66","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Wieczorek","uuid":"77FE94937137879573023F0D11FD72EFFDFDC4214863FDBF15FEEF0A6BDFD2ABA69978BCCFC9FF88D0F012F09560030758068F57DE1D27D7EB8B20C442DC9439","orcidId":"0000-0001-8268-3885","documentHash":"e54d106b-ea77-4715-815a-37b17126e9c0"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc9","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Osek","uuid":"09D7D5320F1FC606BCE9C2D945933A9AD76A02E8625F591A249FCC889F47698A9DDB27A314BD598D2BEBE05552FA565585514F11E04F6B15DA221089044711E2","orcidId":"0000-0003-2295-8837","documentHash":"6dc7582e-e613-4ee9-9ee7-81d949533982"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sous-vide","basil","infusion","sensory quality","volatile compounds profile","color"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Fresh Basil Infusion: Effect of Sous-Vide Heat Treatment on Their Volatile Composition Profile, Sensory Profile, and Color","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":null,"issn":"1420-3049","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"85ea3d3d-2670-4384-98ee-1b5b44edab21"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629d02644097070cd34d7d16","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923d878c28a047392280","629d02644097070cd34d7d18","629d02644097070cd34d7d19","629d02644097070cd34d7d1a"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Herbs, including basil, are used to enhance the flavor of food products around the world.\r\nIts potential is influenced by the quality of fresh herbs and processing practices, wherein conditions\r\nof heat treatment play an important role.

It is proved that the normalized temperature T1 has the greatest effect on the measurement result for both systems. In addition, it was found that in both systems, an increase in the reproduction accuracy of the normalized temperature T1 (with a constant reproduction error of T2) does not lead to a significant improvement in the results. Due to this, it can be argued on the use of non-precision normalized sources to reproduce the temperature T1. However, an order of magnitude increase in the reproduction accuracy of both normalized quantities T1 and T2 also increases the measurement accuracy by an order of magnitude. Computer modeling confirmed that for the redundant measurement equation (11) at the ratio Т1=Ті(0.0005•Ті+1) in the range (10÷200) °С, measurement with a relative error (0.01÷0.00003) % is provided. When applying the redundant measurement equation (13), the accuracy increases to 0.0059 % only at the end of the range. Based on the results obtained, it was found that the accuracy of redundant measurements is influenced by the type of equation itself, not their number. Processing of the results based on the redundant measurement equation, by the way, ensures the independence of the measurement result from the influence of absolute values of the transformation function parameters, as well as their deviations from nominal values under the influence of external destabilizing factors.\n\nThus, there is reason to believe that it is possible to increase the accuracy of measurement in a wide range by observing the ratio between normalized and controlled quantities"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058127907","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62971e3540970702be4f70ac","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"5 (116)","doi":"","documentHash":"ee2d6a2a-a37a-4c08-89bf-c8a852057ba5"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"6-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/254337/252924","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6297223840970702be4fd4a3","name":"Ganna","lastName":"Shchutska","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7182-8556","documentHash":"8bfdfb4f-329a-4852-b5d4-d09563200edf"},{"objectId":"6297223840970702be4fd4a2","name":"Yury","lastName":"Shcherban’","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-5024-8387","documentHash":"91e39104-5d77-4965-9a32-54bf375787ba"},{"objectId":"6297223840970702be4fd4a1","name":"Antonina","lastName":"Volivach","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7119-7774","documentHash":"7a1d9961-d4b9-45f2-942e-e5ca2ebbfe54"},{"objectId":"6297223840970702be4fd4a0","name":"Oksana","lastName":"Kolysko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4043-1238","documentHash":"4df8e39a-7d44-48af-8dc9-923f1d1b5c55"},{"objectId":"6297223840970702be4fd49f","name":"Ganna","lastName":"Korogod","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-1670-3125","documentHash":"7bda35a5-3422-4353-a28c-5dd863e09d2c"},{"objectId":"6297223840970702be4fd49e","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Shcherban’","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4274-4425","documentHash":"56280d1d-fdd4-4f22-ba42-408adf0af765"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.254337"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["kara długoterminowa","interwencje korekcyjne","sprawiedliwość naprawcza"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6295f7f34097072fefba021d","doi":"10.31338/uw.9788323555315","title":"Dożywotni więźniowie.

The examined samples of BSGs were characterised by humidity that is typical for this product (approx. 77–80%). Convective drying of the spent grain contributed to a reduction in the water content in the biomass to below 10%. Samples of dry spent grain that were examined contained a similar amount of ash (3.8–4.1% d.m.) and organic matter (91.0–91.9% d.m.).

In this work thermal oxidation in water vapor ambient, together with the two above mentioned modes, is characterized. All three GaN oxidation modes were comprehensively studied structurally and optically using a wide range of experimental methods. Thermal oxidation of GaN at 950 °C in dry oxygen, in wet oxygen, and in water vapor, was performed for up to 20 min. All oxidation modes resulted in β-phase Ga2O3 growth as confirmed by XRD measurements. A different surface morphology was observed between processes, smooth and featureless for the vapor oxidation, and grainy for dry and wet modes. Similarly, the growth rate varied between modes of oxidation with the slowest observed for the vapor mode and the fastest for the dry mode. An oxygen diffusion into GaN was observed for the dry and wet processes with above background levels of O visible over 150 nm below the oxide/GaN interface.

Although the concept is not new, the current popularity and level of development of digital cameras, especially those embedded in smartphones, allow common and reliable remote advice on various medical problems, which can be very important in the case of limitations in a physical contact with a doctor. The article focuses on the initial stages of photo processing for the needs of telemedicine, i.e., on the assumptions and the process of designing the appropriate template and detecting it in photos for stoma telediagnosis. Research on the developed algorithms for the location of fiducial markers and reference color fields, carried out on the basis of over 2,000 photos, showed a very high tolerance to scene exposure, lighting conditions and the camera used. The obtained results allowed the initial image intensity normalization of the stoma area as well as correct localization and measurement of changes detected on the skin and the mucosa, which, in the opinion of doctors, significantly increased the diagnostic value of the photographs."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058127935","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6673cd6e4097074fa165a0f6","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"32","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"3fe8d35e-d909-4af0-8494-08f720e659c3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"32","pagesFromTo":"147-160","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://sciendo.com/pl/article/10.34768/amcs-2022-0012","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"673719bffdbe832d85af1b5e","name":"Michał","lastName":"Mik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"adc58067-0bf8-4c09-870e-6d35e542f50a"},{"objectId":"673719bffdbe832d85af1b5d","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Mik-Wojtczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bd8d5246-f8c1-412a-9bef-3db7a8453b4d"},{"objectId":"673719bffdbe832d85af1b5c","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Szwoch","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dad2a718-9f38-4c82-b6de-cb9410afdb20"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a0473952f8","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Granosik","uuid":"89CB061CFA55853A568643B2BB74EEE8F8FD5279E4CDE93729CF43FC323A10F022357CC8D01E8E7F776F486E3024C13EDFB9899261A8576B509C4EBAA01B92C4","orcidId":"0000-0002-3345-627X","documentHash":"4565e50a-0ec3-4700-807e-e886a0613850"},{"objectId":"5e70925b878c28a047394505","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Zawiślak","uuid":"3DACE74772FAE13195141C74D1BDBFFF6C7FA250EC76DE3AB7B51B4A8F358ED4D4AFF8BE6827B837C202F295DE8BC45B93C9DF8A1FD68A5F7AC74C98F7F8E46F","orcidId":"0000-0002-8513-8679","documentHash":"09e2e193-f547-4ff2-bc55-1632347e4dc7"}],"doi":"10.34768/amcs-2022-0012"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918c878c28a04737e088","uid":"bUmj6ITUzeAJhYNJMxX1S8w","uuid":"110407bb-e91f-453a-9532-fed2f55572bc","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","parentUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","rootUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","name":"Wydział

Therefore, it is necessary to develop algorithms (methods and techniques) that can assess the state of the monitoring object from different sources of intelligence for a limited time and with a high degree of reliability. Accurate and objective object analysis requires multi-parameter estimation with significant computational costs. That is why the following tasks were solved in the study: the formalization of the assessment of monitoring objects was carried out, a method of increasing the efficiency of assessing the condition of monitoring objects was developed and an efficiency assessment was carried out. The essence of the proposed method is the hierarchical hybridization of binary classifiers and their subsequent training.\n\nThe method has the following sequence of actions: determining the degree of uncertainty, constructing a classifier tree, determining belonging to a particular class, determining object parameters, pre-processing data about the object of analysis and hierarchical traversal of the tree.\n\nThe novelty of the method lies in taking into account the type of uncertainty and noise of the data and taking into account the available computing resources of the object state analysis system. The novelty of the method also lies in the use of combined training procedures (lazy training and training procedure for evolving neural networks) and selective use of system resources by connecting only the necessary types of detectors.\n\nThe method allows you to build a top-level classifier using various low-level schemes for combining them and aggregating compositions. The method increases the efficiency of data processing by 12–20 % using additional advanced

this study, the potential of the biospeckle phenomenon for detecting fruit infestation by Drosophila suzukii was examined. We tested both graphical and analytical approaches to evaluate biospeckle activity of healthy and infested fruits. As a result of testing the qualitative approach, a generalized difference method proved to be better at identifying infested areas than Fujii’s method. Biospeckle activity of healthy fruits was low and increased with infestation development. It was found that the biospeckle activity index calculated from spatial-temporal speckle correlation of THSP was the best discriminant of healthy fruits and fruits in two different stages of infestation development irrespective of window size and pixel selection strategy adopted to create the THSP. Other numerical indicators of biospeckle activity (inertia moment, absolute value of differences, average differences) distinguished only fruits in later stage of infestation. Regular values of differences turned out to be of no use in detecting infested fruits. We found that to provide a good representation of activity it was necessary to use a strategy aimed at random selection of pixels gathered around the global maximum of biospeckle activity localized on the graphical outcome. The potential of biospeckle analysis for identification of highbush blueberry fruits infested by D. suzukii was confirmed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058127958","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/2/763","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629c97684097070cd34800d7","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Słoma","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"02f8c941-5195-4c5d-8e37-6e22794c8ee4"},{"objectId":"5e70923e878c28a047392471","name":"Monika","lastName":"Janaszek-Mańkowska","uuid":"5D3037DF1C6D36A9F19A116DD32A65A75B7E17D56B285512A3A0571F10F99368BD845A92D900440E2E8CE3D0DA0B9B2BB0EAC57320A122A4515FD727FEC8CAE8","orcidId":"0000-0003-0855-9098","documentHash":"4454e964-da4d-44fd-b174-00240ec4284f"},{"objectId":"5e70921b878c28a04738ff15","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Ratajski","uuid":"2D926F7F24B76267F337DE44376297304413117788DBD5CE9A9E2536AA11ECA105539BE8475A7BA035D00054B8C470537AE300E3F497CAFD8AE54C6498748533","orcidId":"0000-0002-9128-1738","documentHash":"be1c6bc3-797f-41ae-9adc-20cc74cd0542"}],"doi":"10.3390/app12020763"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Domator czy włóczykij","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e714b7946e0fb0001c8955b","mniswId":null,"title":"Łowiec Polski","doi":null,"issn":"0137-1266","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"8d2ab5c1-607c-427c-ab03-2bd433bc07ba"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629ccd134097070cd3481c0c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7091f3878c28a04738d9e1"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058127960","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"74-77","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://bw.sggw.edu.pl/info/article/WULS77bdf0a63ea84bcc93438e8fd17a510d/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7091f3878c28a04738d9e1","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Nasiadka","uuid":"F5332F63BA976DEAE0A296B5CEFE629C614F52D1DEAB92D093E493DE90F3B45487ED6456D44D0995C38D6E0005E8BE81FDABD3E9939265EBFCA52222EAFC6679","orcidId":"0000-0001-5193-7635","documentHash":"649d4f50-2ce3-4e6d-9914-cd1e7e4739c9"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Guz mózgu","Glejak","Lipidy","Biopsja"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Brain tumor","glioma","SPME","heterogeneity","lipids","chemical biopsy"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Investigating the potential use of chemical biopsy devices to characterize brain tumor lipidomes","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","doi":null,"issn":"1422-0067","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"850accc5-0c0e-4f6c-9a84-eaa108a84f20"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-24","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6297d44940970702be56f8d0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709349878c28a0473a67da","5e7092c1878c28a04739c12c","5e70938b878c28a0473ac533","5e7093ff878c28a0473b4904","5e70938b878c28a0473ac4cc","5e7092c3878c28a04739c297","5e7092c0878c28a04739c0e6","661fa15c409707626368dc89","661fa15c409707626368dc8a","661fa15c409707626368dc8b"]},"issue":"7","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The development of a fast and accurate intraoperative method that enables the differentiation and stratification of cancerous lesions is still a challenging problem in laboratory medicine. Therefore, it is important to find and optimize a simple and effective analytical method of enabling the selection of distinctive metabolites. This study aims to assess the usefulness of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) probes as a sampling method for the lipidomic analysis of brain tumors. To this end, SPME was applied to sample brain tumors immediately after excision, followed by lipidomic analysis via liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). The results showed that long fibers were a good option for extracting analytes from an entire lesion to obtain an average lipidomic profile. Moreover, significant differences between tumors of different histological origin were observed. In-depth investigation of the glioma samples revealed that malignancy grade and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status impact the lipidomic composition of the tumor, whereas 1p/19q co-deletion did not appear to alter the lipid profile. This first on-site lipidomic analysis of intact tumors proved that chemical biopsy with SPME is a promising tool for the simple and fast extraction of lipid markers in neurooncology.

meat is most often eaten after heat treatment, but the quality of the final product is not always satisfactory. In this study, based on CFD modeling and simulation, optimization of the heat treatment process of beef was performed using RSM. The aim of the research was to select the parameters of thermal treatment in order to achieve the highest degree of denaturation of myosin and collagen proteins, and the lowest degree of actin denaturation and weight loss of the final product. The obtained results were verified by experimental studies, which showed statistically significant similarities with those predicted. Depending on the composition of the basic beef meat, heat treatment parameters should be selected individually in order to obtain a product characterized by the highest quality and, consequently, the highest acceptance among consumers. CFD modeling and RSM forecasting was a useful approach to study the unstable heat transfer in the combi steamer and also mapped the temperature distribution over the whole beef load, thus, optimizing the roasting process."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058127967","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"45","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfpe.14014","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629cfa504097070cd34d62bc","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Półtorak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"53a3da4a-8322-438e-9b4e-2bc6112420ca"},{"objectId":"629cfa504097070cd34d62bb","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Szpicer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"912c4dc7-5375-4e7c-a9cd-ad83e20c0642"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a04739228b","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Wierzbicka","uuid":"B0DDE44760A24226E4305C616289112453E9EC132DFA6F00E0894A86B7405F22A4A2EBA701343A0E1B561FC95399D36295B388AE3233A9276C697969DCF8F290","orcidId":"0000-0002-5770-4573","documentHash":"27d4f042-4168-4ed2-85a4-49da76166ba4"}],"doi":"10.1111/jfpe.14014"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Austempering","Vermicular cast iron","AVG","Abrasion resistance","Abrasion of cast iron"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Initial Analysis of the Surface Layer of AVGI Cast Iron Subject to Abrasion","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479c3f","mniswId":"1669","title":"Archives of Foundry Engineering","doi":null,"issn":"2299-2944","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"f40668ca-6150-4aa0-b46f-49a94751d1bc"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-16","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629a7bc54097072c2b7ffc45","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709447878c28a0473b98ac"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article presents the results of research on the abrasion resistance of cast iron with vermicular graphite in the as-cast state and after austempering (the latter material is referred to as AVGI – Austempered Vermicular Graphite Iron). Austenitization was carried out at the temperature values of either 900°C or 960°C, and austempering at the temperature values of either 290°C and or 390°C. Both the austenitization and the austempering time was equal to 90 minutes. The change of the pearlitic-ferritic matrix to the ausferritic one resulted in an increase in mechanical properties. Abrasion tests were conducted by means of the T-01M pin-on-disc tribometer. The counter-sample (i.e. the disc) was made of the JT6500 friction material. Each sample was subject to abrasion over a sliding distance of 4000 m. The weight losses of both samples and counter-samples were determined by the gravimetric method. It was found that the vermicular cast iron austenitized at 900°C and austempered at 290°C was characterized by the lowest wear among the evaluated cast iron types. The geometric structure of the surface layer after the dry friction test exhibited irregular noticeable grooves, distinct oriented abrasion traces, plastic flow of the material, microcracks, and pits generated by tearing out the abraded material. The largest surface roughness was found for the AVGI cast iron heat-treated according to the variant 3 (Tγ =900 ºC; Tpi = 390°C), while the smallest one occurred in AVGI cast iron subject to either the variant 2 (Tγ =960 ºC; Tpi = 290°C) or the variant 4 (Tγ =900 ºC; Tpi = 290°C) of heat treatment and was equal to either 2.5 μm or 2.66 μm, respectively. It can be seen that the surface roughness decreases with the decrease in the austempering temperature."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058127972","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"1 - 7","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/afe/140436","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709447878c28a0473b98ac","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Jakubus","uuid":"BE6A0FC64A3B6C1DE867427FB60C10EB142AF6F2CD6E617A1952EB4561E10D37334B3A1EBAAF5FA4F21F384CE3CD0556A3BD8886161203503AF1498C85BBE259","orcidId":"0000-0003-4940-2919","documentHash":"64bcf94d-6164-4210-be45-cbe5aea6c8a5"}],"doi":"10.24425/afe.2022.140224"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["alkali-activated materials","calorimetry technique","geopolymer","heat evolution","reaction kinetics","self-curing"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Heat Evolution of Alkali-Activated Materials: a Review on Influence Factors","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454777d3","mniswId":"4336","title":"Construction and Building Materials","doi":null,"issn":"0950-0618","eissn":"1879-0526","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/construction-and-building-materials/","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"2be3fad5-342e-4ebc-89e3-3e15bffa4c59"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"622b24042467f040f243c9c2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["622b24042467f040f243c9c3","622b24042467f040f243c9c4","622b24042467f040f243c9c5","622b24042467f040f243c9c6","622b24042467f040f243c9c7","622b24042467f040f243c9c8","622b24042467f040f243c9c9","5e709202878c28a04738e869"]},"issue":"Vol.314","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The usage of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) in construction has become a great concern among researchers due to the carbon dioxide (CO2) emission during production.

(115)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper reports the spatial mathematical modeling of the process of dressing the working surface of grinding wheels for implementing the double-sided grinding of the ends of cylindrical components. Parts with high-precision end surfaces that are commonly used include bearing rollers, piston fingers, crosspieces of cardan shafts, and others. The geometric accuracy of surfaces is ensured by simultaneously grinding the ends at two-sided end-grinding machines with crossed axes of the part and wheels that operate under a self-blunting mode. Before starting the machining, the wheels are dressed in a working position. Moreover, the total orientation angle of the tools is selected subject to the condition of uniform distribution of allowance along the rough sections of wheels. Dressing involves a single-crystal diamond tool with a variable feed. That ensures different development of the surface of abrasive tools, which prolongs their operating time between dressings and improves overall stability. The constant size of micro irregularities at the calibration site enhances the quality of machining. The calibration site is made in the form of a straight line belonging to the plane that passes through the axis of rotation of the wheel and is perpendicular to the plane of the machined part. Based on the spatial mathematical models of the processes of removal of allowance and shape formation when dressing the wheel, the surface of the grinding wheel was investigated. Mathematical models for shaping the ends of parts when grinding with wheels with conical calibration sites have been proposed; it is shown that when applying the proposed machining scheme, there is no geometric error in the size of the part. In addition, due to the uniform distribution of the allowance along the rough area of the wheel, the quality of the surface layer of the ends of parts increases. The devised method for dressing the working surface of wheels could be used to grind the ends of non-circular components."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058127978","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623355402467f0713d5675a0","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"1 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"c338b7d6-75f4-4465-9dc8-c82700e22216"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"86-93","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/252642/250643","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6233743b2467f0713d577f90","name":"Dmytro","lastName":"Kalchenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7380-6625","documentHash":"cb49c210-deaa-459d-88ba-d29f6bac405c"},{"objectId":"6233743b2467f0713d577f8f","name":"Andrii","lastName":"Yeroshenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1629-9516","documentHash":"febeb4f4-ace0-4d54-82c2-00232696a971"},{"objectId":"6233743b2467f0713d577f8e","name":"Antonina","lastName":"Kolohoida","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1742-2686","documentHash":"0f4d7fe0-c529-4a22-a10b-37c6ebab64d8"},{"objectId":"6233743b2467f0713d577f8d","name":"Vitalіі","lastName":"Kalchenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9850-7875","documentHash":"71a397ff-2cf2-4ac6-85d9-b3aca7eaefaa"},{"objectId":"6233743b2467f0713d577f8c","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Kalchenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9072-2976","documentHash":"9b79db9c-dbe4-487a-8c59-1f944446e536"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.252642"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["synchronous reluctance motor","Nelder-Mead method","finite-element method","partitioned permanent magnets"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5f2a799f2467f01fd1357212","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"National Technical University “Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute”","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62975bc240970702be52f7a7","62975bc240970702be52f7a6","62975bc240970702be52f7aa"]},{"id":"61a78d172467f03711ea82f4","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Kharkiv National Automobile and Highway University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62975bc240970702be52f7a8","62975bc240970702be52f7a9"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"optimizing geometric parameters for the rotor of a traction synchronous reluctance motor assisted by partitioned permanent magnets","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62975bc240970702be52f7a3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62975bc240970702be52f7a6","62975bc240970702be52f7a7","62975bc240970702be52f7a8","62975bc240970702be52f7a9","62975bc240970702be52f7aa"]},"issue":"8 (116)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper considers partitioning parameters and the mutual arrangement of magnets in the rotor of the traction synchronous-jet engine with permanent partitioned magnets. The synthesis of geometrical parameters for the rotor of a synchronous reluctance motor with partitioned permanent magnets was proposed on the basis of solving the problem of conditional optimization. To solve the synthesis problem, a mathematical model has been built to determine the electromagnetic momentum of a synchronous reluctance motor with partitioned permanent magnets. It is based on the calculation of the electromagnetic momentum of the engine employing the results of a finite-element analysis of the magnetic field in the flat-parallel statement of the problem. The model is implemented in the finite-element analysis FEMM environment and makes it possible to determine the electromagnetic momentum of the engine with a variety of partitioning of permanent magnets. As an analysis problem, it is proposed to use a mathematical model of the magnetic field of the engine. The problem of conditional optimization of the rotor of a synchronous reluctance motor was stated according to the geometric criteria of the rotor. Restrictions are set on geometric, strength indicators, as well as on the level of electromagnetic momentum. The chosen optimization method is the Nelder-Mead method.\n\nBased on the results of solving the problem of synthesizing parameters for the partitioned rotor of the traction motor of trolleybus wheels, it was established that the volume of permanent magnets was reduced by 2.27 times compared to the base structure; their optimal geometric dimensions were determined (5 mm, 5.2 mm, and 5 mm), as well as the distance between them, 17.8 mm and 15.3 mm, and the engine load angle, which is 121.12 electrical degrees.\n\nBased on the results of solving the problem of synthesizing parameters for the partitioned rotor of a trolleybus traction synchronous reluctance motor, its optimal geometric parameters have been

On the legal level, this issue is expressed, inter alia, in the discussion on recognition of the right to the environment.

The work presents the key regulations of both international environmental law and the constitutions of various countries. This allowed for the recognition of the role and significance\nof the concept of the dignity of the individual, which, underpinning the international system of human rights protection, also plays an important role in environmental regulations.

This study assessed microencapsulated red powders\r\n(RP) prepared from the aqueous extract of blue cornflower petals.

The mi-\r\ncroencapsulated RP were characterized by spectral (FT-IR and FT-Raman), mineral, structural, and\r\nantioxidant analyses. The FT-IR and FT-Raman band related to guar gum, lecithin, and maltodextrin\r\ndominated over the band characteristic of anthocyanins present in the cornflower petal powders. The\r\nmain difference observed in the FT-Raman spectra was attributed to a shift of bands which is reflection\r\nof appearance of flavium cation forms of anthocyanins.

study aimed to examine the drivers and types of sustainable product innovations undertaken in bakeries with a particular focus on fibre-enriched bread. This type of bread contributes to a healthy diet due to its increased content of dietary fibre, which is an essential but deficient component of the diet, especially in modern consumption patterns in affluent countries. The study was carried out using the Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) method on a sample of 402 companies operating in the Polish baking industry. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) using Burt tables was used to analyse the results. Four groups of companies were identified according to the number of new products introduced to the market: non-innovative, poorly innovative, moderately innovative, and sustainable innovative companies. The results show that the development of a “new formula” was the most frequently mentioned type of innovation in all groups of companies. Other types of product innovation were also identified among the highly innovative companies: a new product for the company, a new product for the consumer, and new packaging. The basic motivation for launching innovative products on the market was to follow new trends and meet consumer expectations. Therefore, the results indicate that a consumer approach to innovation prevailed. The surveyed bakeries perceived fibre-enriched bread as a product with high nutritional value and environmental benefits. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the drivers of sustainable innovation in the food industry and have some practical implications for bakery companies seeking competitive drivers based on sustainable innovation. The study showed that capturing the voice of the customer is important in developing product innovations in bakeries. A consumer-oriented strategy is a win-win strategy, as it will result in an increased range of products suitable for a healthy sustainable diet and environmental benefits using fibre waste from food processing.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128000","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://mdpi-res.com/d_attachment/sustainability/sustainability-14-02743/article_deploy/sustainability-14-02743-v2.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629cfcdb4097070cd34d634a","name":"Michał","lastName":"Wojtaszek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d6847c4a-c645-4463-a63d-00a0e0c315d7"},{"objectId":"629cfcdb4097070cd34d6347","name":"Maksymilian","lastName":"Czeczotko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9231b882-7c57-489b-99e1-5a1f05e76ed1"},{"objectId":"603f6eec9543c711bc6ea42e","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Kwiatkowski","uuid":"216753C63AFDC4F53C734DF841967BA4785199D0595BFBE3B75F4D5C6997800AEF7345EEFEB3DC725C365E8B8DA5901041225EB26FC307CFB71C48B63EB8CF5C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"def18376-1c38-4d51-984b-6f5ef0dcc5d8"},{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b86ae","name":"Julita","lastName":"Szlachciuk","uuid":"4A9D109C2DC202680A2AB123F8DAC89ACC9B5CDC4AB0385552EC3C5DACBFA8F9544B6496D1657A3D74B8C0CD41D7DDBD8FD4715781654D8F5AD65E4DAFB6DD86","orcidId":"0000-0002-9742-2044","documentHash":"eed25324-c247-4017-b895-7a62af8e5bf2"},{"objectId":"5e709414878c28a0473b5e63","name":"Maria","lastName":"Królak","uuid":"2B2653DC27107ABE6332F0CACC7016E1D68E8E778377A85685F01B5034F52FB5E8F3407B79000BCCD107F978716E3292584260AB27D985285A5328BF9EDDEA26","orcidId":"0000-0002-7222-4770","documentHash":"c97726aa-07ec-46e3-af79-29b19f4ee6e5"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a047392284","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Żakowska-Biemans","uuid":"1852E9054695315F3BCC20CB372DFE75432F30E95CFF321B0DD4061F8878A323100A4598A0541C06C3C6F7922D00D7857C9F2A0AF53A7F6B731333A7DC35DCB7","orcidId":"0000-0001-8225-6533","documentHash":"56385e44-fa69-4e1a-bcf6-bf5ef15a11d7"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a047392253","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Górska-Warsewicz","uuid":"DB150AEFC067C71C79BCD04099CD0616E1673D7978DB1CB370ED01F64C28015A7C2C5040D9D141B75A3A2F36BBFAF53B09F53ACF4382C984FC7F3849ACA9852B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5110-7583","documentHash":"9af9787a-19a6-4e3c-8a16-f9e2b962aad9"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a04739224d","name":"Robert","lastName":"Zaremba","uuid":"2249E3219271F2FEEE7C3CE38CDF9CF9C76384A656869F8CDF8AF93D99DE8A23898A3268A17C2F562D792E0403A760A6B56DA240168C2E6AD5A7DF071BA930EB","orcidId":"0000-0002-7667-2300","documentHash":"f17775cb-ac3d-4726-9869-732d4d8ea155"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a047392241","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Rejman","uuid":"03834A2BB5F54B6785801EA9CBE9A65F670673A8DA83B496801C7604BD4025BF3B5AA54189D851DE217C3C85E28E19DD98DF80ECF407E86EC1FBFAE2F61E98A3","orcidId":"0000-0001-8692-4383","documentHash":"885e2c27-bbc6-4be6-9de5-ec260f1a4d99"},{"objectId":"5e70923a878c28a047392183","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Mądra-Sawicka","uuid":"F5537AAD6FD171932E5990A096D727294C82D8E311E4AB7AE73B02318DF13F188BFAE1C28678ECA310A7A24A163FFCCA64338516366A7C0810685AF87768A636","orcidId":"0000-0001-7842-889X","documentHash":"d090f04e-65a3-4e84-a0ab-136367fca61d"}],"doi":"10.3390/su14052743"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["chickens","turkey"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny -

This report presents data on the microbial community in these organs from a comprehensive study of laying chickens and turkey breeders. The main objective was to characterize and compare the compositions of the respiratory system bacteria isolated from birds of different ages and geographical locations in Poland. Using samples from 28 turkey and 26 chicken flocks, the microbial community was determined by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. There was great variability between flocks. The diversity and abundance of upper respiratory tract (URT) bacteria was greater in chickens than in turkeys. At the phyla level, the URT of the chickens was heavily colonized by Proteobacteria, which represented 66.4% of the total microbiota, while in turkeys, this phylum constituted 42.6% of all bacteria. Firmicutes bacteria were more abundant in turkeys (43.2%) than in chickens (24.1%). The comparison of the respiratory tracts at the family and genus levels showed the diversity and abundance of amplicon sequence variants (ASV) differing markedly between the species. Potentially pathogenic bacteria ASV were identified in the respiratory tract, which are not always associated with clinical signs, but may affect bird productivity and performance. The data obtained, including characterization of the bacterial composition found in the respiratory system, may be useful for developing effective interventions strategies to improve production performance and prevent and control disease in commercial laying chickens and turkeys."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128005","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"987","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/10/5/987","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6299d11e4097072c2b7a18ff","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Chrzanowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"32250de2-701f-41c7-a68d-b9e7815fed05"},{"objectId":"61de4b387523403b69b1ed5b","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Adamska","uuid":"F815269EDB2352CD6093E4FBE2A885F08A8D96E81E6018312B075BB80513DE75118276AFB8B3D80A7EBA8588E6BB2ED09715CC47C103BC45E9E38D3CDCC60F3C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"caf9244a-2237-470d-a477-6ea78bcc9d09"},{"objectId":"5e7094af878c28a0473c1b6b","name":"Anna","lastName":"Sawicka-Durkalec","uuid":"74F41A0F85AC155F46A6CCFB26EB711F025B465228066B5B84B02AC6321B340B5E150BCF2A66F7C1772D185C02BC942B7AE9B4870C2127F7D8BF9A52EE8941FA","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bedf887e-9c8e-4e06-b951-662b20cf6e92"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0de5","name":"Olimpia","lastName":"Kursa","uuid":"75402E2E14C8ED8034D357B13AFDE45E9969ED0E1013DCAC5AC579ED65B4C512BE817796CCDCBBC958F09F10CA0E27A409B73C9E9AF9FD4C4A298A3D7F324E63","orcidId":"0000-0002-0058-1568","documentHash":"6ee44e6d-ce9a-41d7-99e0-5633dff83f06"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d5a","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Tomczyk","uuid":"E3C5238621862F074D46922CB3B17195CE27A83F2C9C06B0BA49A69FEE2FB90EC33B4FDD96A897D15FCA91F90109B062B91A53DADD2FC97CF132051ED597C664","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b7a3ee18-b481-4390-a3be-5aeac0b34bca"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["magnesium compounds","alkaline hydrolysis of magnesium chloride","magnesium hydroxide","sorption of metalions"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61a9e5552467f0525e8cb1e3","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"O.

The main popular magnesium compounds are its chloride, hydroxide, and oxide. The most common technology for obtaining magnesium hydroxide is based on the action of alkaline reagents on solutions of magnesium. However, the technology has significant drawbacks. The main issue is that magnesium hydroxide cannot be obtained free of impurity metal ions, and the sediment itself has an extremely low filtration rate from the solution in which it is formed.\n\nMagnesium hydroxide is an excellent sorbent collector for the ions of most metals, so it is possible to utilize this property of absorption of magnesium hydroxide to produce other highly pure compounds, for medicine and pharmacopeia. This paper investigates the processes of alkaline hydrolysis of magnesium chloride and the formation of magnesium hydroxide sediment, the kinetics of processes, as well as the properties of sediments. Empirical formulas for sediment production parameters with a high filtration coefficient that exceeds the known values of 1·106have been derived. The study reported here hasrevealed the possibility of obtaining in a relatively simple way highly pure chloride, hydroxide, and magnesium oxide, sodium chlorides, potassium, calcium, in which the impurity 3d metals content does not exceed the value as a percentage of (1‒4)·10-7. Due to the properties of highly pure magnesium compounds to the sorption of metal ions, it is possible to create reference samples of chemical elements for the needs of metrology. For example, to create MR phantoms to verify measurements and check the operation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in medical institutions. Especially pure magnesium hydroxide can be used for instrumental methods of analytical chemistry (X-ray fluorescent, neutron-activation methods) when fabricating chemical references for testing laboratories."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128006","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6234728f2467f00ffe957ab6","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"6 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"0482f772-1de1-4f25-8803-dec366196436"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"43-52","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/253544/250775","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62347ca52467f00ffe95ca2f","name":"Leonid","lastName":"Kolomiets","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2341-3345","documentHash":"2d430cf9-2993-4d1e-9d8a-55ddd65a9726"},{"objectId":"62347ca52467f00ffe95ca2e","name":"Kostiantyn","lastName":"Boriak","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4226-0102","documentHash":"256d7dcc-6ce9-4c42-9541-bc65aa8f9013"},{"objectId":"62347ca52467f00ffe95ca2d","name":"Mikhail","lastName":"Sichov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4283-7955","documentHash":"59269f6f-6b3d-44fb-afa9-bf274428b118"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.253544"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["geotrupidae","Trogidae","Lucanidae","Ochodaeidae","Scarabaeidae","biodiversity","distribution","nature conservation","new records","Montenegro"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcc9","uid":"bf9NwOtzVuVusQ6j_8CCO6A","uuid":"e6ca39d1-feb1-42d3-8722-a361a8bd83b5","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcc9","parentUuid":"e6ca39d1-feb1-42d3-8722-a361a8bd83b5","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcc9","rootUuid":"e6ca39d1-feb1-42d3-8722-a361a8bd83b5","name":"Wyższa Szkoła Ekologii i Zarządzania w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["629cc4b94097070cd348141c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"New Data on the Occurrence of Scarabaeoid Beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea) in Montenegro","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d59878c28514547c3d4","mniswId":"8403","title":"Insects","doi":null,"issn":"2075-4450","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"a669b1b7-7d5d-49b6-8602-e780e07d9fb2"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629cc4b94097070cd3481417","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7091f3878c28a04738d9fa","629cc4b94097070cd348141a","629cc4b94097070cd348141b","629cc4b94097070cd348141c","629cc4b94097070cd348141d","629cc4b94097070cd348141e"]},"issue":"352","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Montenegrin fauna of the superfamily Scarabaeoidea is not satisfactorily studied.This is evidenced by the small number of species from this superfamily reported from Montenegro,despite the richness of the country’s habitats, especially high-mountain meadows, pastures, lush canyons, riverside, coastal dunes and old forests. Moreover, significant is the greater number of species of scarabaeoid beetles in neighbouring countries. Therefore, we aim to supplement the current information on the distribution of the taxa of the superfamily Scarabaeoidea in the country. The presented scarabaeoid beetles were caught during three expeditions: the first in May/June 2019, the second in May/June 2021, and the third in July 2021. As a result of this study, we have collected 2130 beetles belonging to 107 species and five families of the superfamily Scarabaeoidea: Geotrupidae, Trogidae, Lucanidae, Ochodaeidae and Scarabaeidae. The 28 days of the faunistic study confirmed\r\nthe occurrence in Montenegro of 54.2% of the scarabaeoid species hitherto known from this country and added 16 new species that had not been previously recorded: Odonteus armiger (Scopoli, 1772), Trox sabulosus (Linnaeus, 1758), Ochodaeus integriceps Semenov, 1891, Agrilinus convexus (Erichson, 1848), Melinopterus reyi (Reitter, 1892), M. sphacelatus (Panzer, 1798), Phalacronothus biguttatus (Germar, 1824), Trichonotulus scrofa (Fabricius, 1787), Psammodius nocturnus Reitter, 1892, Platytomus tibialis\r\n(Fabricius, 1798), Pleurophorus mediterranicus Pittino & Mariani, 1986, P. pannonicus Petrovitz, 1961, Rhyssemus berytensis Marseul, 1878, Onthophagus ovatus (Linnaeus, 1767), Rhizotrogus aestivus (Olivier, 1789) and Chaetopteroplia segetum (Herbst, 1783). Six species and three subspecies that are typical for the Balkan Peninsula were also found: Trypocopris alpinus balcanicola (Mikši´c, 1954), Onthophagus panici Petrovitz, 1964, Amphimallon solstitiale simplicissimum (Müller, 1902), Omaloplia illyrica (Baraud, 1965), Triodontella dalmatica (Baraud, 1962), Chaetopteroplia segetum straminea (Brullé, 1832), Anomala matzenaueri Reitter, 1918, Exomala adriatica (Petrovitz, 1968) and Oxythyrea dulcis Reitter, 1899. Thus,\r\nthe number of currently known scarabaeoid species in Montenegro has increased to 184. Twenty-four\r\nspecies of scarabaeoid beetles are illustrated. Our results indicate insufficient knowledge of the Scarabaeoidea of Montenegro and, at the same time, their diversity and the presence of rare species among them. High-mountain and coastal communities of coprophagic scarabaeoid beetles, as well as communities of scarabaeoid beetles inhabiting coastal dunes, are especially valuable, worthy of\r\nprotection. Therefore, further research and new expeditions to Montenegro are highly desirable"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128008","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-25","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/13/4/352","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629cc4b94097070cd348141e","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Tylkowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bbd9e682-444c-4889-b780-c97266f57732"},{"objectId":"629cc4b94097070cd348141d","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Minkina","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2a1f7fd7-a5c1-4707-be38-e13fac3cbb95"},{"objectId":"629cc4b94097070cd348141c","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Marczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dc544895-b565-4d70-9047-01c20ba9f244"},{"objectId":"629cc4b94097070cd348141b","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Gazurek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ee315620-8781-4575-a291-3bb70000b2b6"},{"objectId":"629cc4b94097070cd348141a","name":"Marek","lastName":"Bidas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"50b52a28-507c-4da0-bc63-106d34591b2e"},{"objectId":"5e7091f3878c28a04738d9fa","name":"Adam","lastName":"Byk","uuid":"FB74FB25AF0167F19BDF75A4E07A6C1CD6BA8D289D8DFAFAB16251434E8CF171DBD9E779D15EB7C5B343CEE646DEE18CF625EC2130DF13C6E5E0E298622F5B76","orcidId":"0000-0001-9505-3436","documentHash":"8036d205-4679-4581-92ff-676f34175f99"}],"doi":"10.3390/insects13040352"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet

study was performed to determine the effect of plasma-activated solutions of protein preparations of selected plants, as an alternative nitrite source, on the quality characteristics of pork sausages. The used solutions contained 500 ppm nitrite. Sausages without nitrite (NC), with 75 ppm sodium nitrite (PC), and with solutions of soy (E1), pea (E2) and lentil (E3) preparations (100 g/kg of meat ingredients) were manufactured and stored for 8 days. The results showed that after processing sausages from E1, E2 and E3 groups showed similar nitrite content as PC group (20.69–21.89 mg nitrite/kg; P ≥ 0.05). Performed analyses (residual nitrite, nitrosylhemochrome content, a* values, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, total aerobic plate count) suggested also that addition of nitrite through solutions of soy and pea plasma-activated preparations extended the shelf life of sausages comparable to sodium nitrite without a negative effect on aroma (PCA), as was reported for some other sources

global Covid-19 pandemic has passed. This process required greater attention and care to the specifics of the organization of distance learning and the resolution of problems that arose for participants in the educational process. By late 2021 face-to-face teaching was returning but Russian aggression against Ukraine interrupted the comparatively carefree life of children and hindered access to kindergartens and schools which required a further focus on remote education. The paper outlines the peculiarities of the organization of distance learning under martial law in Ukraine and presents the problems of the organization of training during a time of conflict as well as the challenges presented by Internet platforms for the organization of the distance learning approaches recommended by the Ministry of Education of Ukraine. The aim of the research was theoretical analysis and generalization of literature on research problems, pedagogical observations, surveys, methods of mathematical statistics. The article provides one of the first analyses of the difficulties faced during this period of immense disruption based on empirical data and explains to what extent Ukrainian teachers under martial law have the possibility to organize distance teaching, what problems they face, what is the psychological state of children."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128034","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65c33b9b4097074c89d5d338","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"52","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"299d30d2-087e-42d3-8cdd-f7b5b8e121ad"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"52","pagesFromTo":"213-226","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03004279.2022.2083211?scroll=top&needAccess=true","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629a039e4097072c2b7d12ef","name":"Maria","lastName":"Lavrenova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d05787b1-5a35-4f98-b75e-8a9f40249205"},{"objectId":"5e70923e878c28a0473925ad","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Kruszewska","uuid":"CD7544F1A0E6A147D5A8966093A333A3BBEE41866CDD113E2D68A76BB42C19799013D5E5EA64B65ABDB95FBE1F644E96433F78C709F3A1513DAAAE55C84EC00C","orcidId":"0000-0001-8755-4476","documentHash":"189d66a5-f39f-4a13-a60c-89b70260ac84"}],"doi":"10.1080/03004279.2022.2083211"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Instrumenty kontraktowania rozwoju terytorialnego w Polsce - doświadczenia i perspektywy rozwoju do 2030 r.","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f55f","mniswId":"496812","title":"Regional Development and Regional Policy","doi":null,"issn":"2353-1428","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"975b6982-b613-47fd-a288-616e79f609e9"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-25","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":1},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62986d964097070cd3d4ffa7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f799bf6085dcb410a25e9e5"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058128037","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pressto.amu.edu.pl/index.php/rrpr/article/view/32927","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f799bf6085dcb410a25e9e5","name":"JEREMIASZ","lastName":"SALAMON","uuid":"D78ED9622AC84741F64ACFA6955B383BC2FFAE7DB9E4DFC49A3D78AA8B77F15277D2AC872F1DA96383E4987353E0E9712A9E93A964CA8AE7FAEB5EC7AEACC3D9","orcidId":"0000-0002-6028-1188","documentHash":"5d723335-6752-4b37-8b59-8fd2a6d52649"}],"doi":"10.14746/rrpr.2022.58.05"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency","steam explosion (SE)","liquid hot water (LHW)","bacterial cellulose gel film"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Evaluation of the Hydrolysis Efficiency of Bacterial Cellulose Gel Film after the Liquid Hot Water and Steam Explosion Pretreatments","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479331","mniswId":"16369","title":"Polymers","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2073-4360","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"5c4f8b81-6463-4e5b-8c64-d1384b8f9293"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-16","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629cb55d4097070cd348127f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7091ff878c28a04738e43a","629cb55d4097070cd3481281","629cb55d4097070cd3481282","629cb55d4097070cd3481283","629cb55d4097070cd3481284","629cb55d4097070cd3481285","629cb55d4097070cd3481286","629cb55d4097070cd3481287"]},"issue":"10","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The influence of bacterial cellulose gel film pretreatment methods on the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis was investigated.

This article examines donor-matching focusing on methods used to match donors and recipients, reasons for its use, and laws and practices across several European jurisdictions. The discussion is informed by examination of relevant literature, regulatory instruments, and consultation with practitioners and experts, and aims to inform wider theoretical and policy debates. Differences in practice and issues that arise across jurisdictions are highlighted. That donor-matching has the potential to be used by people born as a result of third-party reproduction to identify their donor is also discussed.

The article presents selected problems surrounding the production of plastic packaging for food storage and distribution that might cause disruptions in the implementation of sustainable production. An important question regards the extent to which the industry that produces this packaging complies with the sustainability requirements. The present work consists in an investigation of the problems observed in a plastic packaging manufacturing company located in Poland, which is part of a global corporation. Plastic waste management was analyzed and compared with the requirements of a closed loop economy. The quantities of raw material processed and the quantities of waste in the defined period were analyzed. During the analyzed period, 0.05% of the monthly production was non-recyclable waste. The quality of raw material seems to be responsible for the majority of wastes. Therefore, the important role of SAP (Systems Applications and Products) in the use of lower quality batches of raw material is indicated. On the other hand, a possibility of converting the wastes into liquid or gaseous fuels is suggested. In addition, the paper investigates the efficiency of machine use in a film bag production line in a three-shift system. Process losses were analyzed and reliability indicators such as overall equipment efficiency (OEE) and its components, mean time between failures (MTBF), and mean failure repair time (MTTR) were determined. The monthly OEE values for each change individually exceeded 80%."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128043","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/7/3924/htm","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629c98804097070cd348067e","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Gola","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"48d674c3-0d2e-4cab-b935-cfb3e0bf73a2"},{"objectId":"629c98804097070cd348067d","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Wasiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"97f499cd-0a63-4c19-a380-a9a54ca8384d"},{"objectId":"629c98804097070cd348067c","name":"Olga","lastName":"Orynycz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bb6444cd-42e2-4df4-ac69-1d20e3fa2505"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afad4","name":"Karol","lastName":"Tucki","uuid":"02D1D1D8B93325A8C1ACE38A4A5534CA76B2DDDF4CDA344C37E8EAD60120E1C6E85A62997333064C918C607B38C79DE24CA8DC7083EF7CE3B24ED9CDD095B7C0","orcidId":"0000-0001-7340-4100","documentHash":"2991d930-5814-4f05-829b-e5a816f37ddd"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a04739245d","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Mieszkalski","uuid":"7E43FD0A22A49A904D769B27A0FB05953F4D4D323A2204E64F7F818B482F7E8A3027E34009C101617E7A2BDC432C12CE35E6D46B5B188A510236D62CA85D4D75","orcidId":"0000-0001-5533-7370","documentHash":"4a41aff1-e66b-4b98-ace2-13a21ec05fb1"}],"doi":"10.3390/su14073924"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["rocket and space technology","space object","space debris","combined diversion system","low Earth orbits"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"611dee322467f0578d12d40f","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Oles Honchar Dnipro National University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6234462d2467f00ffe942993","6234462d2467f00ffe942992","6234462d2467f00ffe942995","6234462d2467f00ffe942994","6234462d2467f00ffe942996"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Determining the performance indicators of employing combined methods for removing space objects from near-earth orbits","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6234462d2467f00ffe942990","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6234462d2467f00ffe942992","6234462d2467f00ffe942993","6234462d2467f00ffe942994","6234462d2467f00ffe942995","6234462d2467f00ffe942996"]},"issue":"3(115)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A methodology for assessing the relative effectiveness of alternative options for building space object diversion systems has been improved. An algorithm for assessing the effectiveness of the system of removal of space objects from near-Earth orbit based on the method of integral assessment is given. It makes it possible to simplify the process of optimal choice of the method to divert space objects and determine efficiency in the early phases of the life cycle of rocket and space technology objects. The use of the appropriate toolset makes it possible to build a system for assessing the effectiveness of projects for the removal of space objects from low Earth orbits using various diversion methods (active, passive, combined). The analysis of defining world indicators of evaluation of objects of rocket and space technology based on regulations by international space agencies has been carried out. An indicator of the total integrated relative efficiency of projects of space object diversion systems from low Earth orbits has been proposed, which makes it possible to build the removal of passive, active, and combined methods for leveling the risks of space activities. It is argued that the selected combined system using an autophagic launch vehicle could reduce environmental losses and, as a result, reduce compensation payments to owners of space objects. The possibilities of building combined systems with reusable engines have been considered in order to reduce such indicators as the period of diversion and reduction of operating costs due to fuel economy."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128045","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623381152467f0713d57a05b","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"3 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"116578f7-1be1-4c2e-8b84-c3840f84a655"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"6-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/253096/250762","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6234462d2467f00ffe942996","name":"Ludmila","lastName":"Dubovik","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-1178-9281","documentHash":"b8f038ad-683d-41df-9bc9-01a1857a4eb1"},{"objectId":"6234462d2467f00ffe942995","name":"Andrii","lastName":"Dreus","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0598-9287","documentHash":"784ab992-95e6-497f-8a78-762ca9d87bad"},{"objectId":"6234462d2467f00ffe942994","name":"Aleksandr","lastName":"Golubek","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7764-6278","documentHash":"e1b06939-f325-46aa-b86f-4f94baddb739"},{"objectId":"6234462d2467f00ffe942993","name":"Tetiana","lastName":"Hilorme","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9598-6532","documentHash":"44f21314-6229-4018-b6c7-fd69cec039ed"},{"objectId":"6234462d2467f00ffe942992","name":"Mykola","lastName":"Dron’","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-9275-4296","documentHash":"57e4b284-1cbf-4e29-869d-60d81ebff58a"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.253096"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec9","uid":"b61xtrk_7aMtYlgdTtxB1KQ","uuid":"c866ff49-25fe-4636-b4ec-5c14998e9eef","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec9","parentUuid":"c866ff49-25fe-4636-b4ec-5c14998e9eef","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec9","rootUuid":"c866ff49-25fe-4636-b4ec-5c14998e9eef","name":"Centralny Instytut Ochrony Pracy -

Although some texts in the CH contain internal inconsistencies and differences to the hermetic “mainstream,” a careful analysis of individual treatises permits us to draw a few general conclusions about the terms “good” and “evil.” In hermetic thought the supreme god is absolute good; the world cannot be good, because it is material, but it is not evil because of its immortality.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the severity of anxiety among pregnant women during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland, and factors associated with it. Cross-sectional study with a total of 1050 pregnant women recruited via social media in Poland during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, from March 1 until June 1, 2020. The survey included validated psychological measures: the GAD-7 (anxiety), the PREPS (pandemic stress), with two subscales: preparedness and infection stress, and obstetric, sociodemographic and COVID-19 related variables. T-tests, ANOVAs, and hierarchical binary logistic regression for dichotomized GAD-7 scores (minimal or mild vs. moderate or severe) were used. Over a third of respondents experienced moderate or severe levels of anxiety. Predictors of moderate or severe anxiety were non-pandemic related factors like unplanned pregnancy and emotional and psychiatric problems, as well as pandemic related pregnancy stress. Levels of anxiety among pregnant women during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland exceeded pre-pandemic norms. Findings suggest that prior psychiatric conditions, unplanned pregnancy, and elevated pandemic-related pregnancy stress due to concerns about infection or poor preparation for birth contributed to the risk of high anxiety in Polish pregnant women during the pandemic onset. Given the harmful effects of antenatal anxiety on the health and well-being of mothers and their children, psychotherapeutic interventions, efforts to alleviate pregnant women’s stress, and training in adaptive ways to cope with stress are vital to reduce the prevalence of maternal anxiety and its potential consequences during this global crisis."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128056","journalIssue":{"objectId":"624ab82f2467f01ec7fca23d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"66d877fc-5541-4eef-8322-0b771152ef57"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-7","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-12275-5","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629718f040970702be4ed4dd","name":"Marci","lastName":"Lobel","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7841-2422","documentHash":"c0c4f2af-96ff-4a57-8bea-9a37efd70339"},{"objectId":"629718f040970702be4ed4dc","name":"Emily","lastName":"Rehbein","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"18dd0ffd-6adf-4296-acb8-85d6b017469f"},{"objectId":"629718f040970702be4ed4bf","name":"Heidi","lastName":"Preis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"11f958de-d6e6-4fb3-80bf-ee345afac058"},{"objectId":"5e709438878c28a0473b84f8","name":"Michalina","lastName":"Ilska","uuid":"9C00257EAA047640A4ED7205BEB3CD75D373FFBAF341047237275E57641584F2A3E40E7187E91CEAC9F99A8B66336108B93A3FA64F2035B13AF02585A8519C88","orcidId":"0000-0002-1733-9604","documentHash":"be79a34a-e168-4ca0-abae-d65427352203"},{"objectId":"5e7093d0878c28a0473b12f4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kołodziej-Zaleska","uuid":"E643394FE741CEA8C31EA914EE02BDBF6BD23C0AFB346EB6FEA6F6E33E4F32DD3014D4FD2B4133AC1C2FA0B3B723BB68971D82FA0CDB70DDB24E1D87BD237B83","orcidId":"0000-0001-5664-8605","documentHash":"016353cf-b619-4606-aa0f-1f05a38b408f"},{"objectId":"5e7092eb878c28a04739f362","name":"Anna","lastName":"Brandt-Salmeri","uuid":"EBB2BEE012025D0DE60D4F804B5BEF199499EB28EEBE9D00824DA51F008CD4630F655C59D568D05E22D452A04618FF7149E469D5CAEEAC7C6777DC15D3EAE30C","orcidId":"0000-0002-9432-3016","documentHash":"8627e73b-e397-4fed-9633-bc6eee6d00b5"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-022-12275-5"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737ddc6","uid":"bDov7-ozjV0GM6aVEab0PKg","uuid":"903dbacc-a32a-4d22-bc56-585899808cfc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737ddc6","parentUuid":"903dbacc-a32a-4d22-bc56-585899808cfc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737ddc6","rootUuid":"903dbacc-a32a-4d22-bc56-585899808cfc","name":"Europejska Wyższa Szkoła Prawa i Administracji w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d844"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Właściwość miejscowa sądu dla roszczeń „z umów","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"60e7241f2467f01e9307d5d5","mniswId":null,"title":"PRZEGLĄD SĄDOWY","doi":null,"issn":"0867-7255","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"ab88b4cc-a2ed-4b0c-a76c-66cb308216ee"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"622f2edc2467f016697c7284","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d844"]},"issue":"1/2022","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058128058","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"55-69","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.profinfo.pl/sklep/przeglad-sadowy,7785,r,2022,nr,1.html#spis-tresci","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d844","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Szanciło","uuid":"D727A8D5DE41FEE5393B9BC27F4ACF91DF3734F13E63E5592F571357EF7531D32E7BADCFB02F9C48FEEE72E725F4D8D68B7D4146D4311EC58CC63DD028D028D7","orcidId":"0000-0001-6015-6769","documentHash":"f9c918e9-9b8e-4cb4-9970-b429471344b1"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"622f1f5b2467f016697c1c73","doi":null,"title":"Kredyty powiązane z walutą obcą.

invariance violation (LIV) is often described by dispersion relations of the form Ei2 = mi2+pi2+δi,n E2+n with delta different based on particle type i, with energy E, momentum p and rest mass m. Kinematics and energy thresholds of interactions are modified once the LIV terms become comparable to the squared masses of the particles involved. Thus, the strongest constraints on the LIV coefficients δi,n tend to come from the highest energies. At sufficiently high energies, photons produced by cosmic ray interactions as they propagate through the Universe could be subluminal and unattenuated over cosmological distances. Cosmic ray interactions can also be modified and lead to detectable fingerprints in the energy spectrum and mass composition observed on Earth. The data collected at the Pierre Auger Observatory are therefore possibly sensitive to both the electromagnetic and hadronic sectors of LIV. In this article, we explore these two sectors by comparing the energy spectrum and the composition of cosmic rays and the upper limits on the photon flux from the Pierre Auger Observatory with simulations including LIV. Constraints on LIV parameters depend strongly on the mass composition of cosmic rays at the highest energies. For the electromagnetic sector, while no constraints can be obtained in the absence of protons beyond 1019 eV, we obtain δγ,0 > -10-21, δγ,1 > -10-40 eV-1 and δγ,2 > -10-58 eV-2 in the case of a subdominant proton component up to 1020 eV.

Analyses involving remote sensing methods, which have added more detail to results obtained in the traditional way, have been carried out only since the 1980s. The paper presents the results of a bibliometric analysis of papers related to the growing season published from 2000–2021 included in the Web of Science database. Through filtering, 285 publications were selected and subjected to statistical processing and analysis of their content. This resulted in the identification of author teams that mostly focused their research on vegetation growth and in the selection of the most common keywords describing the beginning, end, and duration of the growing season. It was found that most studies on the growing season were reported from Asia, Europe, and North America (i.e., 32%, 28%, and 28%, respectively). The analyzed articles show the advantage of satellite data over low-altitude and ground-based data in providing information on plant vegetation. Over three quarters of the analyzed publications focused on natural plant communities.

So far, a majority of EEG recordings in animals have been performed with the use of pharmacological agents restricting animals’ mobility. Assessment of brain electrical activity in animal brain in welfare conditions offers new possibilities of analysis of behaviour, including social and utility-related behaviour. The investigations were conducted on two female trained and untrained dogs. The recordings of the EEG signal were made at full consciousness of the central nervous system and animals’ unrestrained static position. EEG readings at voice-command and complete-silence sessions were recorded. Analysis of the EEG signal frequency in the case of the untrained dog showed maximum amplitude at 17 Hz (beta 1 - beta 2 range), which suggested increased brain activity in response to voice commands. Response of trained female to the sound stimulus was manifested by the dominant components in the beta 3 range (20 Hz - 28 Hz); moreover, there were no periods of dominant alpha rhythm in that measurement. The dog was calm but waited for the commands attentively and actively. However, in the untrained dog during periods of relaxation and rest associated with the presence of a guardian, frequencies close to the alpha rhythm were noted (8 Hz – 14 Hz)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128083","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1558787822000168?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6232ed962467f0713d53ce9f","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Czyżowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"02eb898e-e77c-423f-bcf4-86729fa327a7"},{"objectId":"6232ed962467f0713d53ce9e","name":"Damian","lastName":"Zieliński","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9131-2688","documentHash":"a010de99-2235-48ae-abc0-2c97e5ba6ca4"},{"objectId":"6232ed962467f0713d53ce9d","name":"Wanda","lastName":"Krupa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e4665b55-c260-401c-a3b8-fb1c3ff99eb0"},{"objectId":"6232ed962467f0713d53ce9c","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Garbiec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1d9b9a0b-4671-4949-ae22-80971ca592c7"},{"objectId":"6232ed962467f0713d53ce9b","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Wojtaś","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1275-3240","documentHash":"6cbcd159-ae22-4714-8abe-d0fc73796f27"},{"objectId":"6232ed962467f0713d53ce9a","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Goleman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0bd85c48-1804-4f36-830d-2a5ceceb0272"},{"objectId":"6232ed962467f0713d53ce98","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Karpiński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e982efe1-9bcf-48d4-ad77-537fa66a0170"},{"objectId":"5e7092f7878c28a0473a0237","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Kotyra","uuid":"831A3890636BBC58D2E247097592D71E3C9E426B33AE5C1843154F1ABC0DD4053F7C3524C3815659B59A6A989C312CCC925C76377E55C1C9BADF779D0E99E060","orcidId":"0000-0002-3499-7377","documentHash":"9dedb7b7-1a31-4c1c-8c89-dce0cee3d4b3"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jveb.2022.02.002"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","uid":"bk6a4u9UDD_o3fTovGAeczg","uuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","parentUuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","rootUuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","name":"Instytut Badawczy Leśnictwa","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709227878c28a047390ada","5e7091f3878c28a04738da0b","5e7093de878c28a0473b245c","5e7093f7878c28a0473b4165"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Correcting the Results of CHM-Based Individual Tree Detection Algorithms to Improve Their Accuracy and Reliability","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454794f5","mniswId":"17167","title":"Remote Sensing","doi":null,"issn":"2072-4292","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"05b1e2d5-d1a7-4a36-8bf2-d32e29113bc3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-10","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629758c540970702be52e495","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093de878c28a0473b245c","5e709227878c28a047390ada","5e7093f7878c28a0473b4165","5e7091f3878c28a04738da0b"]},"issue":"8","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Individual tree detection algorithms (ITD) are used to obtain accurate information about trees. Following the process of individual tree detection, it is possible to use additional processing tools to determine tree parameters such as tree height, crown base height, crown volume, or stem volume. However, many of the methods developed so far have focused on parameterising the algorithms based on the study area, height structure or tree species analysed. Applying the parameters of the method can be challenging in areas with dense and heterogeneous forests with a diverse stand structure. Therefore, this work aimed to develop a method to correct the results of ITD algorithms to identify individual trees more reliably, taking into account different ITD methods based on the Canopy Height Model. In the present study, we proposed a three-step approach to correct segmentation errors. In the first step, erroneous (under- and over-segmentation errors) and correct segments were classified. After classification, the second step was to refine the under-segmentation errors. The final step was to merge segments from the over-segmentation class with correct segments based on the specified conditions. The study was conducted in one of the most complex and diverse forest communities in Europe, making tree identification a major challenge. The accuracy of the segmentation improvements varied depending on the method applied and tree species group examined. Thus, based on the results, the paper advocates for the correction method due to its efficiency in mixed forest stands. Therefore, the present study offers a possible solution to reduce segmentation errors by considering different forest types and different CHM-based ITD methods for identifying individual trees."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128088","journalIssue":{"objectId":"629758c540970702be52e49c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"8","doi":null,"documentHash":"707717bc-6bbd-4d7e-85a9-b588e0f04feb"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1822","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/8/1822/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093f7878c28a0473b4165","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Kraszewski","uuid":"CA3C1315B983B5BD6F576872D9238EAD1D3D6AA8790A390C3C867B94F7AEE9E75E4B14DB3E62970A37FDCE5295B8034B960596EC96E63B9D67436C3EB640BCF5","orcidId":"0000-0001-6161-7619","documentHash":"f682ccba-4787-48f7-a72f-8d9fcff8268c"},{"objectId":"5e7093de878c28a0473b245c","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Lisiewicz","uuid":"977AB851F53CF765B5734583496D78D7CFAE5A9097685E10A8D6A3F0616583558A142E84B775DEFC83D1C482D21443151A21193C1AE59AA18A8A10AA9022C03D","orcidId":"0000-0003-0676-8291","documentHash":"e5454098-3b40-44a4-8580-87f5d4900190"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390ada","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kamińska","uuid":"15521DF07898A6689BED54587227FB5C241423AF70D4FFC13A750450D793008DCE798351249323A54FD8D894C90F2632B3E682DE058E8B0DBB942C58F7E2C237","orcidId":"0000-0003-2190-3789","documentHash":"56df8036-b8fc-487d-bef4-74aea27c1d18"},{"objectId":"5e7091f3878c28a04738da0b","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Stereńczak","uuid":"707E285032829804467248AE6243151D6C499D5BF5E0C65CCB799883DB903287755499993C20F34F651D2B7109F318015CCFB3130CCC7F8A92008013F6B0067D","orcidId":"0000-0002-9556-0144","documentHash":"aad329d3-ae61-4521-9272-2d8bd2b128fa"}],"doi":"10.3390/rs14081822"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["flooring","properties","veneer","thickness","plywood-like materials"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Influence of the Thickness of Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)

It is possible to reduce the consumption of electricity for cooling, as well as to reduce capital costs, by integrating the unit with radiative cooling directly into the circulation circuit of the refrigerant of the refrigeration machine. An experimental refrigeration system has been designed, in which in the cold periods of the year the removal of heat from the cooled object is carried out due to the mode of natural circulation of the refrigerant from the evaporator to the heat exchanger, cooled by radiative cooling. A refrigeration system with natural circulation and radiative cooling of the refrigerant R134a was experimentally studied during the autumn period in Almaty. The experimental study established that the chamber is cooled with the help of the examined system while the temperature in the cooled volume is maintained by 5...7 K above ambient air temperature at night. The dependence of the air temperature in the refrigerating chamber on the temperature of the atmospheric air has been determined. A procedure for assessing the cooling capacity of the system has been devised.\n\nThe study reported here demonstrated the possibility of using radiative cooling to remove heat under the mode of natural circulation of the refrigerant.\n\nThe refrigeration system reduces energy consumption in the cold seasons by diverting heat to the environment without the compressor operating"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128093","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62974e8140970702be5282b2","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"8 (116)","doi":"","documentHash":"3f6221f1-4348-4649-a145-a2fa45a923e7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"45-53","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/253651/252947","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629762b940970702be53508a","name":"Dmitriy","lastName":"Koretskiy","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3110-8383","documentHash":"b962b140-db09-4dec-be0a-afcff4208fac"},{"objectId":"629762b940970702be535089","name":"Diana","lastName":"Tsoy","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4059-7924","documentHash":"4604d0a2-dd5d-4ceb-8865-ac724aeaeb56"},{"objectId":"629762b940970702be535088","name":"Alexandr","lastName":"Granovskiy","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1191-038X","documentHash":"112d64bd-7442-4c7f-a53d-d77387130793"},{"objectId":"629762b940970702be535087","name":"Alexandr","lastName":"Tsoy","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3073-6698","documentHash":"41b950ef-27f6-4543-8263-e527f5f8ca04"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.253651"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"622f1f5b2467f016697c1c73","doi":null,"title":"Kredyty powiązane z walutą obcą.

There are no systematic studies and predictions regarding the response of soils to rising air temper-atures and changes in the water supply of landscape ecosystems. Ultimately, it is unknown how cli-mate fl uctuations affect the balance of nutrients and humus in soil depending on the crops grown. There  is  not  enough  scientifi  c  data  to  indicate  that  warming  or  aridization  affect  the  effi  ciency of  plant  fertilizers.  Our  aim  is  to  fi  nd  out  how  changes  in  the  climate  of  the  Western  Ukrainian  mesoclimate  interacts  with  the  trends  in  soil  processes  and  crop  yields  in  the  Northwestern  For-est-Steppe.  We  analysed  the  weather  data  from  1945–2018  provided  by  the  Rivne  State  Weather  Station (Ukraine) and the crop yields of the Main Directorate of Statistics of Ukraine in Rivne region. Field studies were conducted in the conditions of the Northwestern Forest-Steppe of Ukraine dur-ing 1960–2018 at the stationary fi eld experiments of the Luvic Greyzemic Phaeozems (WRB. 2015) of the Institute of Agriculture of the Western Polissia of NAAS (Ukraine). Laboratory analyses were performed using standard techniques. Observations of climatic processes have allowed us to offer polynomial models that confi  rm, with high degree of certainty, the steady trend of regional climate change towards warming in the Northwestern Forest Steppe of Ukraine (an average annual tem-perature R2 = 0.76; the sum of T >5°C R2 = 0.91 and the sum T >10°C R2 = 0.90. Rainfall has declined sharply in the last fi ve years, signifi cantly limiting soil moisture resources. There was a steady ten-dency towards aridization of the agrolandscape mezoclimate. We cannot say that climate warming has had a signifi  cant impact on increasing the nutrient content of soils to contribute to a signifi cant increase in crop yields in the absence of fi eld fertilization. However, crop production of Rivne re-gion (Ukraine), N, P and K application rates have increased periodically over the whole observed period of 1960–2001. There has been a steady upward trend in fertilizer application rates since 2000 and  agricultural  harvests  have  been  steadily  growing  together  with  the  warming  of  the  climate  zone of the Northwestern Forest Steppe of Ukraine in this period."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128098","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"73","pagesFromTo":"1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.soilsa.com/Changes-in-the-agrochemical-indices-of-Luvic-Greyzemic-Phaeozems-under-the-impact,146855,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629ce88e4097070cd34be050","name":"Mykola","lastName":"Lukyanik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b1c08211-f811-487a-9ddf-62077219adb2"},{"objectId":"629ce88e4097070cd34be04f","name":"Liudmyla","lastName":"Lukashchuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"effae4f8-14da-47c8-87a8-7512e60cbb18"},{"objectId":"629ce88e4097070cd34be04e","name":"Oksana","lastName":"Haskevych","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"86fb0ad5-d50e-4bea-9499-a27fed6f479e"},{"objectId":"629ce88e4097070cd34be04d","name":"Mariya","lastName":"Avhustynovych","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"215347bb-4b66-4f1c-b4db-3cbf2cb7b3b8"},{"objectId":"629ce88e4097070cd34be04c","name":"Viktor","lastName":"Ivaniuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0f03c933-aac2-4f47-82c6-e786b90431a5"},{"objectId":"629ce88e4097070cd34be04b","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Lahush","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3ceb2e1d-51b2-4f00-aead-aa30382a0130"},{"objectId":"629ce88e4097070cd34be04a","name":"Petro","lastName":"Hnativ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fd11054c-12b7-4c0f-bd94-4980dc64209d"},{"objectId":"629ce88e4097070cd34be049","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Polovyy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b18ab062-afcb-4345-a076-6754b451d946"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941af","name":"Józef","lastName":"Chojnicki","uuid":"368C7260FDA3CCE2FA25AAD8C15147A15E7D5FB732A1D708AB21DD9872422B80CEFC3EA5617BF704DB4D13A7BBD7B12CBC5699C4BF633E974316AEC6C0851A0E","orcidId":"0000-0001-7719-4331","documentHash":"cd0af76e-89fd-425f-a8eb-9bb83d687207"}],"doi":"10.37501/soilsa/146855"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["mitologizm","chrematonimia","firmonim","konsumpcjonizm","marketing"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mythology-based expressions","chrematonymy","company name","consumerism","marketing"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","uid":"bhdVW0TkXv39ZSgac65mGnw","uuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","parentUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","rootUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","name":"Uniwersytet Komisji Edukacji Narodowej w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fb878c28a0473b4566"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Popularne mitologizmy grecko-rzymskie jako firmonimy identyfikujące profil działalności przedsiębiorstwa","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a2f5","mniswId":"200422","title":"Prace Językoznawcze","doi":null,"issn":"1509-5304","eissn":null,"websiteLink":"http://uwm.edu.pl/polonistyka/pracejezykoznawcze/","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"a825d70e-9d32-4452-8655-7c11ada1cd5a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-03-31","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62962d554097072fefbcd1e6","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093fb878c28a0473b4566"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Celem niniejszego artykułu jest próba ukazania funkcjonalnego aspektu popularnych mitologizmów grecko-rzymskich występujących w chrematonimii w roli firmonimów właściwych, ze szczególnym zwróceniem uwagi na ich funkcję polegającą na identyfikacji branżowego profilu przedsiębiorstwa.

The theory of marketing communication between the company and the customer is referred to, as are business names (company names mostly) forming one of the persuasive elements in this communication. Finally, description of data extracted from the pkt.pl company list is presented, including names with such components as Atena, Wenus, Herkules, Cerber, Hades, Styks and Charon as well as industry classification for particular business activities. The analysis of the source material made it possible to determine functions of mythology-based company names. Meant to produce in their recipients the relevant connotations (and associations) governed by the cultural semantic baggage, besides the core functions ascribed to onyms, such names also serve the informative and identifying, persuasive and axiological, culture-forming and socialising roles, among others. The considerations put forward here are situated in the domain of onomastics related to cultural chrematonymy."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128100","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62876f464097073b3975ca7c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"24","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"ff97294a-b213-4dbd-9795-138bd8b728b1"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"219-234","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://czasopisma.uwm.edu.pl/index.php/pj/article/view/7609","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093fb878c28a0473b4566","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Puda

A commercial electronic nose based on ultrafast gas chromatography (acquisition time 90 s) with a flame ionization detector was used for the research. Static headspace was used as a green procedure to extract volatile compounds without modifying the food matrix. Individual extraction conditions were used for each product group. Similarities and differences between profiles were analyzed by simple Principal Components Analysis. The similarity rating was determined using the Euclidean distances. Global model was built for recognition chromatographic fingerprints of food samples.

Sand and gravel resources are rapidly draining,therefore,it is necessary to reduce consumption.On the other hand,there are a lot of construction waste which can be reused in concrete production. One of possibilities is to use in concrete production ceramic waste. During the research the coarse aggregates were changed to ceramic bricks waste. The changes of fresh concrete workability,density, hardened concrete compression strength, water absorption and frost resistance were evaluated. The results show that ceramic waste has a negative effect to all concrete properties. Ceramic bricks waste should be used to replace coarse aggregate in a lower ratio, such as the possible option of replacing 10 % of coarse aggregates. The stoneware tiles wasteshow better results (Skominas et al., 2020).This wastecan be used replacing up to 60 % concrete coarse aggregates. According to all resultscan be concluded that stoneware tiles waste is better choice for coarse aggregates production."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128129","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2021","pagesFromTo":"166-170","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ejournals.vdu.lt/index.php/rd/article/view/2657","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63d272c44097071d34bd65b2","name":"Dainius","lastName":"Ramukevičius","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1a8cdfad-6635-4c07-ad75-b54ebcad873a"},{"objectId":"63d272c44097071d34bd65b1","name":"Raimondas","lastName":"Šadzevičius","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8fe6f904-0a64-4d2a-9517-30ab0b55eee0"},{"objectId":"63d272c44097071d34bd65b0","name":"Rytis","lastName":"Skominas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ae782a34-fed1-476a-bc20-0f67e4336213"},{"objectId":"5e70935c878c28a0473a7fd8","name":"ANDRZEJ","lastName":"GŁUCHOWSKI","uuid":"44A76D9BFDBBD01955F0BBE43B08F54854494BE7BC08B0A4C0D4EF51FC6CFBCC321368F9F7F0D50CC9EE257DA346819BEF2740346A746B40CDDDBD31C5CC2BD7","orcidId":"0000-0001-6651-6737","documentHash":"a8dcbc90-79d7-4a9e-b615-ba17bacd8aea"},{"objectId":"5e709257878c28a04739416a","name":"WOJCIECH","lastName":"SAS","uuid":"FEA1214C05B3238BD41387E317BFC3FBE0C154D5739AC556FEF307419B2E944D4DDE14DB132551C881A46AF52E701BB15F6C313A35F35A39BF7BCA203DBD0A9C","orcidId":"0000-0002-5488-3297","documentHash":"d754f462-3c13-48b6-8a1a-ad3a89162c10"}],"doi":"10.15544/rd.2021.036"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19","state of emergency","state of health emergency","special administrative powers","fundamental rights and freedoms"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62286fef2467f0086c9bf863","doi":null,"title":"System ochrony praw człowieka w Europie w czasach wyzwań pandemicznych.

Here we describe two leaflets of a compound angiosperm tree leaf overgrown by bryozoan colonies from the Coniacian Wartowice beds in the upper part of the Rakowice Wielkie Formation in Lower Silesia. The bryozoans are preserved as moulds and cannot be precisely identified but are evidently membraniporimorph cheilostomes. By comparison with similar modern cheilostomes, the colonies are estimated to have taken a week or more to grow to their preserved sizes. From this it can be inferred that the encrusted leaves remained intact and may potentially have been transported several kilometres from the site of origin. Without other evidence, the presence of articulated compound leaves is an insufficient criterion for inferring the autochthonous or parautochthonous nature of plant megafossil assemblages."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128139","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6299f4234097072c2b7c2052","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"55","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"73e61c3a-23c2-43ad-9a0f-24111542755a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"55","pagesFromTo":"1-7","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.18261/let.55.1.9","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6299f4234097072c2b7c2050","name":"Paul D.","lastName":"Taylor","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b67330ae-60d8-44c9-9364-f1480989d886"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2c6b","name":"Adam","lastName":"Halamski","uuid":"E772810C3D30ABBBF59E40F24C97F4EC546E1D43CF4420320CF12125B0A4DD45049C9FB1570800D36F905448BCAF6F7F6D52C21F3120385F5D98B114E86CC8DB","orcidId":"0000-0003-4179-9253","documentHash":"5046f788-34e0-4fb7-9783-7e77c9d34e6d"}],"doi":"10.18261/let.55.1.9"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Health and Non-Health Determinants of Consumer Behavior toward Private Label Products—A Systematic Literature Review","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","doi":null,"issn":"1661-7827","eissn":"1660-4601","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e236e16e-7430-4ac3-800c-033637860e22"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629d02f24097070cd34d837b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923d878c28a047392253","5e70923d878c28a04739224d","629d02f24097070cd34d837e"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>This study aimed to analyze the international literature on consumer behavior toward private label (PL) products, guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) method.

We formulated research questions regarding the most studied categories of PL products, the non-health factors determining consumer behavior toward PL products, and the frequency of including health aspects in the choice of PL products. The following were analyzed in the studies included in the systematic literature review (SLR): general data and study design (authorship, year of publication, location, characteristics of the sample, and research category), research specifications (factors/variables, hypotheses, and measured parameters), and general findings (findings and practical recommendations). We found that most of the studies had analyzed dairy products as PL products, and the main non-health selection factors used were lower price and price–quality ratios.

This study aimed to assess the impact of environmental conditions on the competition between (1) ACC-ase and ALS herbicide-resistant (BR) and herbicide-susceptible (BS) blackgrass biotypes, (2) BR and winter wheat cv. Arkadia (W), and (3) BS and W. In the replacement series model, the experiment was conducted at seven sites across Poland during two seasons (2018/19 and 2019/20). In the BR-BS experiment, the BS biotype was in majority more competitive toward the BR biotype. However, in the regime of optimal hydrothermal conditions and at a higher sand content in the soil we observed a higher competitiveness of BR towards BS. The combined interactions between W and BR or BS were also affected by environmental conditions, i.e., soil texture and hydrothermal coefficient, as explained by PCA and k-means cluster analysis. At most sites, W was more competitive toward both BS and BR, which could result from earlier emergence of W in relation to B in majority of sites. Except for two cases, located on heavy, clay soils, during humid seasons, where B was more competitive toward W. We summarize that blackgrass competitiveness towards other biotypes and wheat depends to some extent on environmental conditions; however, the phenomenon should be explored in more detail."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128143","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-12777-2.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a378d40970762633a2a69","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Kwiecińska-Poppe","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1b0671cf-9a19-46e0-bb03-6f293b5c95e7"},{"objectId":"662a378d40970762633a2a67","name":"Cezary","lastName":"Podsiadło","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7f0fbfd8-4de7-4c69-a510-0b8bfa8a1f25"},{"objectId":"662a378d40970762633a2a66","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Wrzesińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"36eed8b8-7bc2-4eb5-921b-aca00d409d66"},{"objectId":"662a378d40970762633a2a65","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Marcinkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6b201cc9-7272-42f1-b1fe-30e2dc0caf4b"},{"objectId":"662a378d40970762633a2a64","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Synowiec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c4ab1e24-8edb-48e5-9d5d-b9ce24f8e374"},{"objectId":"662a378d40970762633a2a63","name":"Anna","lastName":"Wenda-Piesik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9494702a-a8ad-44f9-ab39-6b68633471d2"},{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a0473990bb","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Domaradzki","uuid":"434C660B9E399544C03A234277401E7153D8EE7356A6CDB5471DDA086610E2FB9AD89C2AC39C9BCB2E46B5A25325E81BD442724F2649CAC8D5593B99B3E710CD","orcidId":"0000-0002-3137-1467","documentHash":"79de0008-a1fc-4cc9-8f84-17ac1996dc82"},{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395e87","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kuc","uuid":"04376663C26D4491CC6A2124AD450D5645314A4903C4225B8DDBFB301EC9022660CCBC7272372C6EE90968AF7244369BC4BE674447B388121F291FD08701BDA7","orcidId":"0000-0002-0258-9977","documentHash":"5abc5fa5-9ab5-4727-9067-6f104d5a2955"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-022-12777-2"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","uid":"b-COLbcdAG-k5w4OvZzdVBg","uuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","parentUuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","rootUuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","name":"Narodowy Instytut Onkologii im.

chapter addresses the concepts and methods to assess quantitative \r\nindicators of Climate-Smart Forestry (CSF) at stand and management unit levels. \r\nFirst, the basic concepts for developing a framework for assessing CSF were \r\nreviewed. The suitable properties of indicators and methods for normalization, \r\nweighting, and aggregation were summarized. The proposed conceptual approach \r\nconsiders the CSF assessment as an adaptive learning process, which integrates \r\nscientifc knowledge and participatory approaches. Then, climate smart indicators were applied on long-term experimental plots to assess CSF of spruce-fr-beech \r\nmixed mountain forest. Redundancy and trade-offs between indicators, as well as \r\ntheir sensitivity to management regimes, were analyzed with the aim of improving \r\nthe practicability of indicators. At the management unit level, the roles of indica tors in the different phases of forest management planning were reviewed. A set of \r\n56 indicators were used to assess their importance for management planning in \r\nfour European countries. The results indicated that the most relevant indicators \r\ndiffered from the set of Pan-European indicators of sustainable forest manage ment.

Over a duration of 40 days, the shoots were exposed to 100% red light, 100% blue light, red and blue light at a 7:3 ratio with control fluorescent lamps. Every 10 days plant tissues were tested for their PhRC content with the use of an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC). Shoots&rsquo; morphometric features were analyzed after a multiplication cycle. We identified 35 PhRC including twelve cytokinins, seven auxins, nine gibberellins, and seven stress-related phytohormones. Compounds content varied from 0.00052 nmol/g to 168.15 nmol/g of dry weight (DW). The most abundant group were stress-related phytohormones (particularly benzoic and salicylic acids), and the least abundant were cytokinins (about 370 times smaller content). LED light did not disturb the endogenous phytohormone balance, and more effectively mitigated the stress experienced by in vitro grown plants than the fluorescent lamps. The stress was most effectively reduced under the red LED. Red and red:blue light lowered tissue auxin levels. Blue LED light lowered the shoot multiplication rate and their height, and induced the highest content of gibberellins at the last stage of the culture."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128156","journalIssue":{"objectId":"622af1bf2467f040f2429782","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"27","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"4ebf97fa-5d00-4128-b703-4d40be087388"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27061804","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b85","name":"Michał","lastName":"Dziurka","uuid":"C508B84A3E98AF91D4A7CF2B3F96DCF5CDDD04199D55EC6231120160D35F2346ADF8454B963FAF986327F88BE636B80D8617AF7648BCC065B4DC89242B986449","orcidId":"0000-0002-8265-6243","documentHash":"2fccdaa3-374f-450a-82fb-cb867a75d10a"},{"objectId":"5e70930c878c28a0473a1c81","name":"Monika","lastName":"Cioć","uuid":"4CCBCD4278B045C44E4F4A75C0820F760541D12FC036786FCA78E2439124667835FF51192028A97C1A623155A9288DD01797879339086DE2BB8675EEA1DE37EE","orcidId":"0000-0003-0325-5706","documentHash":"c22ecdbf-5c75-4853-b15e-d2918ba6e2be"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a19dc","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Pawłowska","uuid":"0137F7A93C700FE94CE16E24FF2B2167FA632EB88D0B07FEA765F2CC0787EA64D8FD6FED33DAD57B7429F309D21D5BB367627AD6A6B0D63D6DAA46649F35A624","orcidId":"0000-0003-0922-8194","documentHash":"6bf24336-2248-44b3-9b14-89b810d4b2bf"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules27061804"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Evacuation","information modeling","software system design","data transfer","operational plan"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"629642364097072fefbda149","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Committee of Science of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["629642364097072fefbda14c","629642364097072fefbda14d","629642364097072fefbda14f","629642364097072fefbda150"]},{"id":"61c99bc32467f00f2d512247","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Almaty University of Power Engineering and Telecommunications named after Gumarbek Daukeyev","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["629642364097072fefbda14e"]},{"id":"61ae21252467f00bc8caf1ce","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Almaty Technological University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["629642364097072fefbda151"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Development of an information system and software for effective building evacuation plan","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629642364097072fefbda148","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["629642364097072fefbda14c","629642364097072fefbda14d","629642364097072fefbda14e","629642364097072fefbda14f","629642364097072fefbda150","629642364097072fefbda151"]},"issue":"2 (116)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The main goal of the work is to create the optimal emergency evacuation plan in general education institutions according to the schedule at a certain time.

These animals should be accommodated with suitable space, access to high nutritional fodder and water, and a suitable microclimate in their shelters. When it comes to the environment in the stables, a serious problem is created by particulate matter (PM), which consists of bacteria. PM concentration may be responsible for developing multiple lower respiratory tract diseases in horses, including allergies and recurrent airway obstruction (RAO). In turn, these ailments may lead to decreasing equine physical and mental fitness. Additionally, people who spend time in the stables are exposed to the same harmful factors. The study was conducted in Udórz Stud Farm located in the southern region of Poland. The study was carried out in 2 different types of stables: 3 runners (a type of stable where horses are housed together and occasionally linked up, e.g., for feeding or grooming) and 2 box stables. The research continued for 2 years and the samples were collected in each season. The bioaerosol samples were collected using a six-stage Andersen-Graseby cascade impactor to assess size distribution and concentrations of airborne bacteria. PM concentration was analyzed using the DustTrak™ II Aerosol Monitor 8530, while microclimate parameters were measured using the Kestrel 5000 Weather Meter. There are almost no studies concerning size distribution of airborne bacteria, individual PM fractions, and the impact of everyday handling on the changes in the bioaerosol and PM concentration. This preliminary study provided basic information on this subject. We have revealed a strong correlation between high PM and bacterial aerosol concentrations. Higher contamination levels were recorded in runners, as compared to box stables. The highest bacterial aerosol level was detected in the spring. The analysis of the fractions of the bacterial aerosol in the stables indicated the highest share of ultra-fine fraction (0.65-2.1 µm), while respirable fraction (below 4.7 µm) exceeded 75%.

In Central Europe plants produced in early spring, may suffer from low insolation thus supplemental lighting is necessary. In horticulture LED (light emitting diode) lamps become increasingly common because of their economical aspect and the possibility to provide a specific wavelength. The aim of the current study was to evaluate how the light spectrum may affect growth and flowering of petunia ‘Dark Red’. The plant material was Petunia × atkinsiana, ‘Dark Red’. In the beginning of April, plants were placed in a growing chamber with artificial light and controlled environmental conditions (photoperiod of 16 h, light intensity of 110 μmol m -2), provided by LED lamps (Plantalux, Konopnica, Poland). The light treatments were: 100% white (as a control), white:red (1:1), white: blue (1:1), white:red:blue (0.33:0.33:0.33). There were 15 plants in each treatment. Stem length, number of side shoots, number and diameter of flowers were measured since 16 April until 28 June. Chlorophyll a+b, carotenoid, total sugars and starch contents were analysed in young leaves collected on three dates from five randomly chosen plants in each treatment. The highest shoot and flower number, the largest flower diameter and the longest stems, were observed in plants grown under white:red light. Petunias from white:red light started flowering ca. ten days earlier than plants from other treatments. The control plants had the highest content of total chlorophyll, while the highest carotenoid level was found in plants growing under red:white light.

We used a multicentre approach involving 12 laboratories from nine European countries. All participants applied the same methodology combining a multiplex PCR performed on DNA extracted from a pre-enrichment step, followed by a selective culture step on three commercially available chromogenic agar plates. The test panel was composed of two negative samples and four samples artificially contaminated with E. coli and Salmonella spp. respectively harbouring mcr-1 or mcr-3 and mcr-4 or mcr-5 genes. PCR screening resulted in a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 83%. Sensitivity of each agar medium to detect mcr-positive colistin-resistant E. coli or Salmonella spp. strains was 86% for CHROMID® Colistin R, 75% for CHROMagarTM COL-APSE and 70% for COLISTIGRAM.

The article posited that this highly controversial view was the best way to engage with students and was published in a well-read and utilized medical journal. Due to the growing divide between learning resources provided by medical schools and outside resources actually utilized by students, the conclusions drawn in the mentioned opinion article were understandable but interpreted in the wrong vein.

Here, we describe a methodology based on laser ablation from Fe target in the presence of preliminarily ablated water-dispersed Au nanoparticles (NPs) to synthesize ultrapure bare (ligand-free) core-satellite nanostructures, consisting of large (several tens of nm) Fe-based core decorated by small (mean size 7.5 nm) Au NPs. The presence of the Fe-based core conditions a relatively strong magnetic response of the nanostructures (magnetization of >12.6 emu/g), while the Au NPs-based satellite shell provides a broad extinction peak centered at 550 nm with a long tale in the near-infrared to overlap with the region of relative tissue transparency (650–950 nm). We also discuss possible mechanisms responsible for the formation of the magnetic-plasmonic nanocomposites. We finally demonstrate a protocol to enhance colloidal stability of the core-satellites in biological environment by their coating with different polymers. Exempt of toxic impurities and combining strong magnetic and plasmonic responses, the formed core-satellite nanocomposites can be used in biomedical applications, including photo- and magneto-induced therapies, magnetic resonance imaging or photoacoustic imaging."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128187","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623433202467f00ffe93bb89","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"38b4cf3e-25c0-4f5b-9e71-af31396909e3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"649","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/12/4/649","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623433202467f00ffe93bb85","name":"Andrei

A busy railway corridor was used to determine if the side of a railway track could distort the assessment of soil contamination with potentially toxic elements (PTEs) and if soil phytotoxicity changes up to 50 m away from the track. The studied soils showed a moderate to heavy level of contamination with Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn. Cu, Ni and Zn content decreased significantly with the distance from the track while Pb content increased slightly, probably because the Pb came predominantly from exhaust gases, while the source of the remaining elements was the abrasion of railway infrastructure components. The side of the railway track proved to be a significant factor that influenced Ni and Pb content in particular. The phytotoxicity test predominantly showed a slight inhibition of plant growth with a maximum value reaching 70.4% but with an absence of significant differences in phytotoxicity between the distances. The ecological risk assessment did not reveal a serious threat to the environment from the PTEs in the soil. Based on the results, it is appropriate to define a heavily polluted zone at a minimum distance of 50 m from the track, and both sides of the railway track should be assessed so that the actual level of contamination is not underestimated. Further research is needed on this issue urgently due to the severe and hitherto overlooked environmental risks associated with rail transport."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128194","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"293","pagesFromTo":"1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0045653522000108","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629c98e04097070cd34807a1","name":"Tivadar","lastName":"Baltazár","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3ac5a9b2-e791-4cd0-84ca-f6ad19f6caa9"},{"objectId":"629c98e04097070cd34807a0","name":"Michaela Vašinová","lastName":"Galiová","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"080f2568-93f1-479b-81dd-33409e0078b1"},{"objectId":"629c98e04097070cd348079f","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kowal","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8b72dbc2-4cb7-47a1-bbd9-ae4d33b357b8"},{"objectId":"629c98e04097070cd348079e","name":"David","lastName":"Juřička","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"48f1626b-0c31-40ec-b48c-d49520b31d9f"},{"objectId":"629c98e04097070cd348079d","name":"Václav","lastName":"Pecina","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"48ce7ff5-73ca-4ca2-af5e-9ff88ce78a89"},{"objectId":"629c98e04097070cd348079c","name":"Martin","lastName":"Brtnický","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"315bc335-ccad-4e26-a49a-70053f6b9558"},{"objectId":"5e70933a878c28a0473a53fe","name":"Maja","lastName":"Radziemska","uuid":"F16909B2F0C594C5EA5AB2C145BE90CFEEA14A48CA90D9D4824051912FC2B3FC4FC9E7D2A3266C8A1BD64306A603FDBCAFD3EA7B0AD12A270B5018F1BD77B2DC","orcidId":"0000-0002-3526-5944","documentHash":"c1e899af-a37d-4ddc-8151-8234dcce63ce"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.133521"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918c878c28a04737e089","uid":"bxHCtILZYY8pW7S8fOkWkJQ","uuid":"7752bc98-48af-470c-82a0-9804ab0fbe41","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","parentUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","rootUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","name":"Wydział Hodowli i Biologii Zwierząt","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709307878c28a0473a1816"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Formy ochrony prosiąt przed przygnieceniami","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"60e721dd2467f01e9305202b","mniswId":null,"title":"Hod.

So, the innovative (made only on a laboratory scale) flat-pressed WPCs were the subject of this study. The study consisted of experimental machinability testing of samples of fourteen different types of particleboards. Nine of them were innovative (non-commercial by design) particleboards, which differed from each other in terms of the type of plastic that was used and its percentage. The wood particles were bonded with either polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS) or polypropylene (PP). The percentages of plastic were either 30%, 50% or 70%. The research stand used for testing the machinability while drilling was based on a standard CNC (computerized numerical control) machining center. The experimental procedure involved the use of a specialized, accurate system for measuring cutting forces. Moreover, the maximum widths of the damage zones visible around the hole, on the drill entry side and the drill exit side were monitored using a digital camera and graphical software. Two key relative machinability indices were determined (quality problem index and cutting force problem index). Generally, the machinability of wood–polypropylene (W-PP) and wood–polystyrene (W-PS) composites was relatively good and generally similar both to each other and to the machinability of raw, standard particleboard P4. However, wood–polyethylene (W-PE) composite turned out to be the best wood-based board that was tested (even better than standard MDF) from the point of view of the cutting force criterion. On the other hand, the general quality of the holes made in W-PE composite was very poor (not much better than for raw, standard particleboard P5, but clearly better than for standard OSB)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058128200","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/13/4/584","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709418878c28a0473b615c","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Podziewski","uuid":"70DC31B4917E9AA2C7BF79D507169F3312B7577DBE4DF53B7547D3438C2E4E98B2D726278378443C5D5B67E4CDAE1A86D102004373E27CB1AEEC38E37CA10469","orcidId":"0000-0002-2628-5062","documentHash":"9e20943e-b475-418d-b14b-2e777b936eb1"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923f9","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Górski","uuid":"0AE95BD1B293F1DB9D52246ABCD521FF7BA26C7414467FA3C23343932322B950E503E89A162FD5A7FB920EE5733C978F95BF900EA245DAD02D954A14954EA516","orcidId":"0000-0001-5615-0735","documentHash":"d6a8527b-1910-436a-a37f-945be1b3d7f3"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923d9","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Borysiuk","uuid":"5840C22A72165009AF83E02CBB32F2E8C13A364E0B8236856B64167F577A6D500105B5C0CE0193E901FDF203D5CF7BB01787FAC44F2CC76B12A002615128F0D8","orcidId":"0000-0002-7508-9359","documentHash":"dda98cac-82d2-4ed6-9cb5-7c3d52b92d1d"}],"doi":"10.3390/f13040584"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pork back fat","beef tallow","goose fat","homogenized\nsausage","quality features"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"An attempt to use various fat raw materials  in the production of homogenized sausages ®","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"61b9ac03ad204581b62ebb26","mniswId":"201201","title":"Postępy Techniki Przetwórstwa Spożywczego","doi":null,"issn":"0867-793X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WCN","editor":null,"documentHash":"5716a3f9-ec67-4b3e-9c97-85452fd31d51"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629cffa44097070cd34d6878","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923b878c28a047392213","629cffa44097070cd34d687a","629cffa44097070cd34d687b"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the research was an attempt to use various fat\r\nraw materials in the production of homogenized scalded\r\nsausages and to evaluate their effect on the quality features\r\nof sausages.
