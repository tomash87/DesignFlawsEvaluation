Analysis of the results of the study revealed the dependence of the composition of the microbiota of the reproductive tract of women on the use of tobacco products. An increase in indicators for conditionally pathogenic microorganisms was shown. The rate of detection of elevated levels of M. hominis in samples of biological material varied between 6-8 % but was not recorded in all study groups of women. There was also an increase in the frequency of detection of elevated levels of U. urealyticum, U. parvum in samples of biological material, the values of which ranged from 9 to 50 %.\n\nConclusions. The obtained data allowed to assess the effect of tobacco on the composition of the microbiota of the urogenital tract of women and made it possible to use them in measures of social and preventive work, as an indisputable fact to quit smoking. Therefore, there is a need for further research to establish the role of microorganisms involved in restoring the composition of the microbiota after inflammatory processes in women who use and do not use tobacco products.\n\nThe results may be relevant for the diagnosis of inflammatory diseases, processes caused by opportunistic pathogens of the urogenital tract of women of reproductive age, potentially dangerous occurrence and development of infertility and the basis for social and preventive work among women on the background of smoking"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169214","journalIssue":{"objectId":"628cb9f84097074a658c8670","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"1(30)","doi":"","documentHash":"c18db52e-97ce-401d-bfad-58b1b6318f80"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"16-25","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/sr_bio/article/download/255743/253344","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"628cc2884097074a658cf118","name":"Anastasia","lastName":"Ovcharenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6950-3496","documentHash":"a35b4af2-fa75-402a-bfc3-5128cd05e0e5"},{"objectId":"628cc2884097074a658cf117","name":"Tetiana","lastName":"Turytska","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5333-3453","documentHash":"b18a00c6-d6f6-4b54-a084-96043420a479"},{"objectId":"628cc2884097074a658cf116","name":"Oksana","lastName":"Starishko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7701-9875","documentHash":"d158fd01-cdf2-4820-8e5a-294ab2c914e2"}],"doi":"10.15587/2519-8025.2022.255743"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Oxygen","Strontium","Isotope analyses","Gallo-Roman France","Mediolanum Santonum","Mobility","Bagplot"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet Warszawski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6126fca99543c7051ff01b13"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Assessing Gallo-Roman mobility at the Rue Jacques Brel necropolis site (1st to 3rd c.

With the acquisition of ever- expanding territory and the establishment of new provinces came opportunities for both outward mobility from the Roman heartland as well as immigration to Rome. Discussions of mobility within the Roman empire typically focus on contexts from Rome proper and surrounding regions, while comparatively less is known regarding mobility in the provincial territories. The study presented herein utilises δ18O values from the second molar (M2) dental enamel of 39 adults, 20 of whom were additionally analysed for 87Sr/86Sr, to assess for potential mobility events among individuals interred in the ca. 1st to 3rd c. CE Gallo-Roman necropolis of Rue Jacques Brel in the Aquitaine region of France. Located in the modern-day municipality of Saintes, Jacques Brel functioned as a manufacturing location on the periphery of Mediolanum Santonum, the capital of Roman Aquitaine. While several individuals have isotope values that fall outside of the expected local δ18Odw and 87Sr/86Sr ranges, suggesting mobility events, combine bagplot analysis of δ18Odw and 87Sr/86Sr did not identify any distinct outliers, bringing into question the nature of mobility to the site of Rue Jacques Brel. The small proportion of individuals identified as non-local among the individuals sampled from the Rue Jacques Brel necropolis raises several questions regarding the nature of mobility within Roman provincial settings and implications of site size and function on mobility.\nLay summary: One of the main questions about living in the Roman empire was “who was mobile?” With such a large territory covered by the Roman empire there were many opportunities to move from place to place, with some of the most common reasons for moving resulting from military deployment, government administration positions, and business ventures. Among the studies conducted to date, a significant number have focused on mobility to the capital of Rome itself, while fewer studies have looked directly at mobility in provincial contexts. The study presented here focusses on mobility to a provincial site in western France, a short distance from Bordeaux, called Rue Jacques Brel Necropolis. This site was the location of a small manufacturing operation and has an associated cemetery. Using statistical analyses of chemical data, it was possible to gain insights to potential mobility among the individuals interred in this cemetery. Of 39 individuals investigated, only a small number appeared truly non-local to the area of Rue Jacques Brel. Additional statistical analysis did not identify any distinct outliers, which brings forth several questions about approaches to gauging mobility. Numerous questions remain to be further investigated to help clarify these initial observations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169216","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6295c9014097072fefb80add","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"43","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"516789fa-023d-4ec7-950f-9654e3d0a096"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"43","pagesFromTo":"103470","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2352409X2200133X?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6295c9014097072fefb80adb","name":"Tracy L.","lastName":"Prowse","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f43b6220-5fff-4bde-b396-856c7b14e618"},{"objectId":"6295c9014097072fefb80ada","name":"Dominique","lastName":"Castex","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"989ccdcd-d799-4ced-929f-5eb7196a470d"},{"objectId":"6295c9014097072fefb80ad9","name":"Henry","lastName":"Schwarcz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1c5430b2-cb55-4cee-a49e-fe35b9860e24"},{"objectId":"6295c9014097072fefb80ad8","name":"Matthew V.","lastName":"Emery","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"64878f55-8dbe-4bb4-8de4-a97778be3f60"},{"objectId":"6126fca99543c7051ff01b13","name":"Robert","lastName":"Stark","uuid":"88DC0A15E0F9ABA3DDFE3996E2491037B6A6118D8E0D4321A207F6036924DB975F4E93D2A941DB66854AD5A5FEEE2B2F5AC6492FD0F2D7085A951D853764777A","orcidId":"0000-0003-0330-3907","documentHash":"e29d915a-49ed-4a94-b464-1295bd42e30a"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2022.103470"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6311dcfb409707352b6a5ed2","doi":null,"title":"Podstawy chirurgii.

here describe abundant new snake material from the late Miocene (MN 13) of Salobreña, Spain. Vertebral morphology suggests a referral of the specimens to the extant psammophiid Psammophis, documenting the first occurrence of this genus in Europe. The diversity and disparity across the vertebral morphology of different psammophiid genera are discussed. We identify vertebral features that could diagnose Psammophis and therefore enable the recognition of the genus in the fossil record. A comparison of the new Spanish form with other taxa is conducted. We provide a detailed review of the psammophiid fossil record. Material previously described from the middle Miocene of Beni Mellal, Morocco is here tentatively referred to as ?Psammophis sp., an action that renders that occurrence as the oldest (probable) record of the genus and Psammophiidae as a whole, providing thus a potential calibration point. On the other hand, Eastern European Pliocene material that had been previously supposedly referred to Psammophis is here discarded as being rather fragmentary, not affording any more precise determination. The two psammophiid genera Psammophis and Malpolon appear almost simultaneously in the European fossil record (MN 13), with the former achieving only a short-lived and apparently geographically limited distribution in the continent, while the latter still exists in its modern herpetofauna. We assess biogeographic implications of the new find, suggesting a direct dispersal event from northwestern Africa to the Iberian Peninsula during the late Miocene, facilitated by the Messinian Salinity Crisis."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169233","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"305","pagesFromTo":"3263–3282","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.24892","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629065df409707780b00a2e9","name":"Georgios","lastName":"Georgalis","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7759-6146","documentHash":"1fc2f02c-b2b6-4121-9538-df21eb5b0cbf"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fa56","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Szyndlar","uuid":"160091F1974A96D91504ABDBEB2215C8E37C3D0842DAC55EA7EFC5850252B592813BD62B2615FC4667A2C1D79E3DD066785BAA8B431ACDB37525963314096DDD","orcidId":"0000-0002-8645-7225","documentHash":"0964ca54-b937-4532-a548-9bcaafbe7d64"}],"doi":"10.1002/ar.24892"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcb0","uid":"b0r66eP7HoJMHsuBaW-45aQ","uuid":"add982ff-1e14-4375-84f5-07977f9fd994","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcb0","parentUuid":"add982ff-1e14-4375-84f5-07977f9fd994","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcb0","rootUuid":"add982ff-1e14-4375-84f5-07977f9fd994","name":"Uniwersytet WSB Merito w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393afd"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Dokumenty cyfrowe podstawą funkcjonowania instytucji państwa","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d51878c285145479cd8","mniswId":"1000637","title":"Biuletyn Polskiego Towarzystwa Ekonomicznego","doi":null,"issn":"1507-1383","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"7b04ea99-0be5-4ea1-a822-e9ba46a35ba8"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629487044097070db8341027","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709252878c28a047393afd"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058169236","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"96","pagesFromTo":"40-44","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.pte.pl/pliki/1/68/Biuletyn_2022-1.pdf.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393afd","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Cellary","uuid":"82BB058C8C46AA8B4656FB9F387F894C1EE72A6DE46B5BB9A30645E26DA769377E7716B061FC9F2DCDB63D2507D086C503EE7193B3CDFF29AD363DC7C16E807C","orcidId":"0000-0001-8578-4307","documentHash":"00ac3faa-cdbc-41d7-9c67-156fdf61c1fa"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"61f3f49b2467f061bc137db6","doi":null,"title":"Spektrum autyzmu – od diagnozy i terapii do integracji i inkluzji","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-62182-99-2","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://www.continuo.wroclaw.pl/home?func=productPage&wid=40&pid=417&cid=1&prid=","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"94566dac-5738-4390-bc47-aae62d217850","publisher":{"objectId":"5d78c016878c284eaa45d3e2","mniswId":"67100","name":"Wydawnictwo Continuo","documentHash":"4effbd0a-f1c4-4267-8b84-1fe59b6d2da9"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Rozważania wstępne.

It is determined, that the violation of the child's psychological space causes a painful attitude to everything around and contributes to the formation of internal psychological conflict, which inevitably leads to loss of learning motivation, reduced cognitive activity, disrupted relationships with teachers and peers. The aim is to prove that the formation of psychological space will contribute to the successful adaptation of children with speech disorders to study in primary education.\n\nThe methods of research of the outlined problem are theoretical methods that allowed to separate the provisions that needed to be verified. Empirical methods allowed to identify the level of adaptability of children to study in an educational institution, among them: observation, conversation, testing, statement experiment, processing of research results (presented as a percentage). \n\nIt was found, that psychological space, a sense of comfort, safety is one of the most important areas of human life, and a properly constructed psychological space can provide a sense of security in the school environment during the period of adaptation.\n\nIt is noted, that in order to facilitate the adaptation of children to learning, in the primary level should be a deep and expanded diagnosis of readiness for learning activities and preparatory work with children who have insufficient school adaptation.\n\nThe diagnostic procedure and the program of research of psychological space as a factor of successful adaptation to school of children with speech disorders are described.

The improvement, modernization, and introduction of new solutions that change the reliability, as well as the quality and conditions of use and operation of wind farm equipment, require testing. Based on these tests, it is possible to continuously evaluate the reliability of the equipment of WF. The issue of reliability assessment of wind farm equipment, for which intelligent systems, diagnostic systems DIAG, and Wind Power Plant Expert System (WPPES) are used to modernize the operation process, can only be tested in a simulative way. The topic of testing the reliability of complex technical objects is constantly developing in the literature. In this paper, it is assumed that the operation of wind farm equipment is described and modeled based on Markov processes. The adoption of this assumption justified the use of the Kolmogorov–Chapman equations to describe the developed model. Based on this equation, an analytically developed model of the wind farm operation process was described. The simulation analysis determines the reliability of the wind farm in terms of the availability factor Kg(t). The simulation tests are performed in two phases using the computer program LabView. In the first stage, the reliability value in the form of the readiness factor Kg(t) as a function of changes in the mean repair time value ranging {from 0.3 to 1.0} was investigated. In the second stage, the reliability value of WF devices was examined as a function of changes in the value of the average time between successive failures, ranging from 1000 to 3000 (h)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169252","journalIssue":{"objectId":"628e8bcc40970776244ff94c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"11","doi":null,"documentHash":"b0a985af-2c64-4798-9de3-8fac95360440"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"3860","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/11/3860/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"641451954097073a0ac7792d","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Duer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ac75be6a-a896-4b2f-b621-ccedd458b53d"},{"objectId":"618353b97523400564d82047","name":"Marek","lastName":"Woźniak","uuid":"C08BF976AF40E914F47E34562C1AF6BCFB92879E83E09F32C155812B0D74816A082DAB1FE8D55A1A5BA60154D3BD4B5006B1B9E0A53DD0C806E41487223B2CA9","orcidId":"0000-0002-4314-5790","documentHash":"fbdfad6c-b83b-4a84-bd2a-fd181460c728"},{"objectId":"6160fea975234017e050df2c","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Ostrowski","uuid":"8C1C8417F00906DE4727509871A070C9F69B5B6995D09F82397944E78BC7F635771069354F189F2ABFA34E3ED7D738B0AC281FEFA5FEA34D37A62F9F2B1B41AB","orcidId":"0000-0002-3929-3686","documentHash":"f69c26b4-e081-4ba8-b156-18dc8c9d61f0"},{"objectId":"5e7092b2878c28a04739aea6","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Hapka","uuid":"58EC7F5718707640A372ACAA2ABAEDB8E03534300B4D77ADD59711D513B38CBFCE1FE78CE32F58AFCDA8DED13485EDC32560566BD7A204356D78E70078C414C5","orcidId":"0000-0003-4613-2570","documentHash":"9fa5b0dc-7cda-4909-a813-97b7422151f9"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a99e","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Duer","uuid":"82CBF0F2AC124A7958C9E317B2FD625FF5A2CB971665ACADDEFC11F0F6EBAE704AA251240F489C4CCCF1F75E10282AC67A5000566F8486094C327CA54F66B73B","orcidId":"0000-0001-9627-015X","documentHash":"3d5fa0ca-2fd3-46e0-9e43-249f42f744d9"},{"objectId":"5e7092a2878c28a047399b06","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Paś","uuid":"58A65433918E3ABE49393BE165D955B2AAC292FE140B3B6D3FB277C74C90AE26A55C0BE74ECFA92CCE4D6780999B3618C9A9859FD4E6F73C79A5080ABE915B19","orcidId":"0000-0001-8900-1445","documentHash":"4ae76f32-a63d-4e2c-8682-4f386595688f"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15113860"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709193878c28a04737f082","uid":"b9SXTF1Zzo_eiHN0JX9AfyA","uuid":"951ff117-fef4-4ad2-81fa-149f6095a5a7","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Centrum Nowych Technologii UW","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944b878c28a0473b9d6e","602fa5f39543c7410626f6fa","5e709358878c28a0473a7b88"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df15","uid":"bR42jPDMRkKGHv60Y9Q25kQ","uuid":"9b699ae6-6e42-406f-ab02-2d5c171b6c86","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Fizyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602fa5f39543c7410626f6fa","5e70935b878c28a0473a7f1b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Chemically Modified Poly(A) Analogs Targeting PABP: Structure Activity Relationship and Translation Inhibitory Properties","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775f1","mniswId":"3513","title":"CHEMISTRY-A EUROPEAN JOURNAL","doi":null,"issn":"0947-6539","eissn":"1521-3765","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"ec090d5e-519e-4659-a4e0-44ae7248f128"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62f36a04409707058d1b841b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602fa5f39543c7410626f6fa","5e70944b878c28a0473b9d6e","5e709358878c28a0473a7b88","5e70935b878c28a0473a7f1b"]},"issue":"42","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) is an essential element of cellular translational machinery. Recent studies have revealed that poly(A) tail modifications can modulate mRNA stability and translational potential, and that oligoadenylate-derived PABP ligands can act as effective translational inhibitors with potential applications in pain management. Although extensive research has focused on protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions involving PABPs, further studies are required to examine the ligand specificity of PABP. In this study, we developed a microscale thermophoresis-based assay to probe the interactions between PABP and oligoadenylate analogs containing different chemical modifications. Using this method, we evaluated oligoadenylate analogs modified with nucleobase, ribose, and phosphate moieties to identify modification hotspots. In addition, we determined the susceptibility of the modified oligos to CNOT7 to identify those with the potential for increased cellular stability. Consequently, we selected two enzymatically stable oligoadenylate analogs that inhibit translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates with a higher potency than a previously reported PABP ligand. We believe that the results presented in this study and the implemented methodology can be capitalized upon in the future development of RNA-based biological tools."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169259","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62f36a04409707058d1b841c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"28","number":"42","doi":null,"documentHash":"0694c2b1-0837-4e4b-9e9f-91ddcc6b86df"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"28","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/chem.202201115","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602fa5f39543c7410626f6fa","name":"Olga","lastName":"Perzanowska","uuid":"D102ACE2E5CFC2CDE9F2067054EEA60FB2C5B966FDCC35643372451A45FF6889D1CFCE1F27DE9B27345EE91B7345923765C89BFF5BD729BFD4B8760FD4A513E7","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4a6c5cc8-aafe-4829-a7c9-261c1e0d5538"},{"objectId":"5e70944b878c28a0473b9d6e","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Śmietański","uuid":"C866479217BA6006A70167E40BF37C7CE28A039D3204B4C2F7C340971FBE11A16C0BD5CD6481CA14C68E8CFBCA5237164D0359EA65AA3BEC04CDF7703D823304","orcidId":"0000-0002-9482-6588","documentHash":"8df186d0-18e8-4f57-83c9-a8bdc1112ade"},{"objectId":"5e70935b878c28a0473a7f1b","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kowalska","uuid":"E7C92BED5D7CBD90DB9D6C11424AE1A70E93C6C373E3CD809EDE37F42CD54D950C737F004994EF89D4485562FA2335F770BF03C790F2FB3159AF299AB55DA953","orcidId":"0000-0002-9174-7999","documentHash":"98819b10-bae2-4de2-b4bb-1d61f4876e7d"},{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7b88","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Jemielity","uuid":"A64BFA3CDF2C8B56CAB5BF6FE6382C461222DA16A47190011C0B5C1648507A44A93C21A06573C49F2BB90FF75E86262ECBA5B9FEA33F4D117A8FAC00780586B9","orcidId":"0000-0001-7633-788X","documentHash":"01e3ba5f-d536-4b24-af41-2f30dfdae676"}],"doi":"10.1002/chem.202201115"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Bioconversion efficiency","Estrogens","Products of enzymatic conversion","Electrospun fibers","Enzyme immobilization"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9e","uid":"b4-9zzGvUfyUhirAhWcr-QA","uuid":"eb155ad0-f9cf-4c26-b470-4c6501ea0a66","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9e","parentUuid":"eb155ad0-f9cf-4c26-b470-4c6501ea0a66","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9e","rootUuid":"eb155ad0-f9cf-4c26-b470-4c6501ea0a66","name":"Instytut Chemii Bioorganicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["628f28b3409707500aa98e8e","5e70934a878c28a0473a68b1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Bioremoval of estrogens by laccase immobilized onto polyacrylonitrile/polyethersulfone material: Effect of inhibitors and mediators, process characterization and catalytic pathways determination","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547874d","mniswId":"11283","title":"Journal of Hazardous Materials","doi":null,"issn":"0304-3894","eissn":"1873-3336","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"8b966343-bcac-4265-b4f1-fb6d79e3aaa0"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"628f28b3409707500aa98e8a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["628f28b3409707500aa98e8c","628f28b3409707500aa98e8d","628f28b3409707500aa98e8e","5e70934a878c28a0473a68b1","628f28b3409707500aa98e90","628f28b3409707500aa98e91","628f28b3409707500aa98e92"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The presence of micropollutants in water, wastewater and soil are a global problem due to their persistent effect on ecosystems and human health.

It was shown that 92% of E2 and 100% of EE2 were degraded after 24 h of the process. Moreover, the effect of surfactants, metal ions and mediators on conversion efficiencies of estrogens was investigated and it was confirmed that immobilized enzyme possessed higher resistance to inhibitory agents as well as thermal and storage stability, compared to its native form. Finally, estrogenic activities of E2 and EE2 solutions decreased around 99% and 87%, respectively, after enzymatic conversion, that corresponds to significant reduction of the total organic carbon and formation of low-toxic final products of estrogens degradation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169261","journalIssue":{"objectId":"628f28b3409707500aa98e94","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"432","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"7b328579-4f96-4bdc-9535-a22c0735a1ab"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"432","pagesFromTo":"128688-1 - 128688-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304389422004770","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"628f28b3409707500aa98e92","name":"Teofil","lastName":"Jesionowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f5695abd-7b2a-480e-8499-84f926e78d70"},{"objectId":"628f28b3409707500aa98e91","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Oleskowicz-Popiel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3f7a0e3e-9139-41fc-8850-2cad59f3c47b"},{"objectId":"628f28b3409707500aa98e90","name":"Luong N.","lastName":"Nguyen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"469a7b56-b1bb-4bbb-b6f3-2f913e3ea378"},{"objectId":"628f28b3409707500aa98e8e","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Strybel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"81adb7d6-88d2-4734-933d-5cbb84d2e90c"},{"objectId":"628f28b3409707500aa98e8d","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Jankowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"62ee18a1-d233-4d78-adb8-a8a0c93fae05"},{"objectId":"628f28b3409707500aa98e8c","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Zdarta","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"38bc4a8a-4540-4174-af8f-239f04b3076c"},{"objectId":"5e70934a878c28a0473a68b1","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Marczak","uuid":"70143D1B739C890711A42564919B0F526CCBD4EC1D07748E36DCC49F5D48744D6D1377E630890E710DE7A4323B4BDE3F614E6D0407CE8ACFA96ACA75BF18388C","orcidId":"0000-0001-8602-0077","documentHash":"4575fdb1-52fe-4b56-af9f-d8a67a24388e"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.128688"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["zaburzenia depresyjne","trening relaksacyjny","efektywno","ść uwagi","test ci","ągłego wykonywania"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["depressive disorders","relaxation training","attention efficiency","continuous performance test"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Impact of One-Time Relaxation Training on Attention Efficiency Measured by Continuous Performance Test in Depressive Disorders","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","doi":null,"issn":"1661-7827","eissn":"1660-4601","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e236e16e-7430-4ac3-800c-033637860e22"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6294b3284097070db836416c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5ebed80d752340254fc40e0a","5e7092e0878c28a04739e96d"]},"issue":"11","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Abstract: AbstractIntroduction: People with depression often complain of dysfunction in cognitive\r\nprocesses, particularly attention. Pharmacotherapy is one of the most commonly used methods of\r\ntreating depressive disorders and related attention difficulties. Patients also benefit from various\r\nforms of psychotherapy and frequently support themselves with alternative therapeutic methods. The\r\npurpose of this study was to examine whether a 15-min-long relaxation training session could improve\r\nthe efficiency of attention and perceptiveness in individuals diagnosed with depressive disorders.\r\nMethods: Forty-two individuals participated in the study, including 20 individuals diagnosed with\r\nrecurrent depressive disorder (rDD) and 22 healthy subjects (comparison group, CG). The so-called\r\ncontinuous performance test in the Polish version (Attention and Perceptiveness Test, APT) was\r\napplied in the study. In the first stage, the participants completed the 6/9 version of the APT test and\r\nthen took part in a 15-min relaxation training session (autogenic training developed by the German\r\npsychiatrist Johannes Heinrich Schultz). The next step of the study was to perform APT again (parallel\r\nversion—3/8). Results: The analyses showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.001) in the\r\nresults obtained in the two versions of APT between the studied groups (rDD versus CG) in terms of\r\nthe perceptual speed index. These differences were seen both before and after the introduction of the\r\nrelaxation training. There was a statistically significant difference in the value of the perceptual speed\r\nindex before and after the applied relaxation training for the subjects with depression (p = 0.004) and\r\nfor the whole study group (p = 0.008). A significant correlation of illness symptom severity with\r\ndecreased attentional efficiency was observed in the rDD group (perceptual speed index)—both\r\nbefore (r = −0.864; p < 0.001) and after the relaxation training (r = −0.785; p < 0.001). Conclusions:\r\nThe continuous performance test (APT) is a reliable indicator of impaired attention efficiency among\r\npatients with depressive symptoms compared to healthy subjects. 15-min-long one-time relaxation\r\nexercise has a beneficial effect on attention efficiency measured by APT in people with depression."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169262","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/11/6473","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebed80d752340254fc40e0a","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Rucka","uuid":"3644F633AFF2E9267031B5EE977DF6CC00AB9069956ED9E2D9B542B690530691ED231DBD87E3E979614C86B393B21E03172B4AFB8F0B6F38EB01FBCF71563062","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8ac4d998-c081-4292-9097-495eb1c1d525"},{"objectId":"5e7092e0878c28a04739e96d","name":"Monika","lastName":"Talarowska","uuid":"A86456D892F2D67C7B2CE404B164DFAE334D1A254549C9D7F28A18FAB52EC06850403ABF004E9DFFB920D08488FBE3EE4BB3795AAE0815D62D170A9160663AF6","orcidId":"0000-0002-3451-1250","documentHash":"be4eac36-53ae-4f70-8783-667c920f79c3"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19116473"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Bohemian Massif","HP metapelites","phase diagram modelling","P–T path","quartz-in-garnet barometry"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63a04a5c4097072312045f56","5e709232878c28a047391767"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Combined phase diagram modelling and quartz‐in‐garnet barometry of HP metapelites from the Kamieniec Metamorphic Belt (NE Bohemian Massif)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478886","mniswId":"11857","title":"Journal of Metamorphic Geology","doi":null,"issn":"0263-4929","eissn":"1525-1314","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"619c6316-5469-4218-a701-1ac5f42137b8"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2021-05-18","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61f3c0a62467f061bc0f122a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709232878c28a047391767","63a04a5c4097072312045f53","63a04a5c4097072312045f54","63a04a5c4097072312045f55","63a04a5c4097072312045f56"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Kamieniec Metamorphic Belt belongs to the Variscan Belt of Europe as the NE part of the Bohemian Massif. It comprises a supracrustal succession dominated by micaschists that has not been yet recognized as a high-<i>P</i>, low-<i>T</i> (<i>HP</i>–<i>LT</i>) metamorphic unit. Our work demonstrates the significance of metapelites in the study of <i>HP</i> metamorphism of the NE part of the Bohemian Massif. To reconstruct the <i>P–T</i> history of the Kamieniec Metamorphic Belt, we have investigated three samples using independent geothermobarometric techniques including phase diagram modelling, Si<sup>4+</sup> content in white mica and quartz-in-garnet elastic barometry. Two samples contain mineral assemblages bearing a record of <i>HP</i> metamorphism followed by an <i>LP</i> event. The oldest assemblage is mostly preserved in the first generation of garnet and it comprises phengitic white mica and rutile. In one of the investigated samples, we also recognized chloritoid and inferred pseudomorphs after lawsonite composed of quartz, clinozoisite associated with margarite. The third of the investigated samples is strongly retrogressed and only contains the relics of phengitic white mica. All three samples contain a younger mineral assemblage comprising white mica with low Si<sup>4+</sup> content and ilmenite. Mineral equilibria modelling indicates the <i>P–T</i> conditions of the <i>HP</i> event culminated at ~15.5–18 kbar and ~470–570℃, while the <i>LP</i> episode occurred at ~5–7 kbar and ~530–570℃. The Raman shift measured in quartz inclusions in garnet in samples with a well-preserved record of the <i>HP</i> stage points to their entrapment at pressures between 11 and 16 kbar. The quartz inclusions within the strongly retrogressed micaschist sample exhibit Raman shifts corresponding to the <i>LP</i> episode at ~5–8 kbar. Discrepant results obtained for one of the samples are discussed in detail. Our investigations show that the supracrustal succession of the Kamieniec Metamorphic Belt contains a record of <i>HP–LT</i> metamorphism typical for subduction systems. A recently established tectonic model for the crystalline complexes exposed in the Bohemian Massif suggests that they were formed via the collision of the Saxothuringian, Teplá–Barrandian, and Brunovistulian domains. Therefore, we interpret the Kamieniec Metamorphic Belt as representing fragments of the Saxothuringian crust that experienced cold extrusion from below the Teplá–Barrandian domain in front of the rigid Brunovistulian indenter."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169266","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"40","pagesFromTo":"3-37","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jmg.12608","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63a04a5c4097072312045f56","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Goleń","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9e6c9f5b-4e40-402e-9c83-8034117a1cc6"},{"objectId":"63a04a5c4097072312045f55","name":"Haozheng","lastName":"Wang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"57aad099-c9ec-4174-9f17-d90c094c01ec"},{"objectId":"63a04a5c4097072312045f54","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Dąbrowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6eca3465-884a-49f8-a8f8-ffdad092ab58"},{"objectId":"63a04a5c4097072312045f53","name":"Xin","lastName":"Zhong","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9b406c80-bf2f-4c25-b9df-8c36a2cae951"},{"objectId":"5e709232878c28a047391767","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Szczepański","uuid":"3B38BDBE1249484BB6DC4616DA60CC9A3550B6CD316CA48A35C7B04598FCEC8DF120156F9ED956F5564704B878D64EF6CA4F2203374790736FFB40FA8454D297","orcidId":"0000-0001-9087-8164","documentHash":"3212dcac-c742-4362-967c-556ac46f0596"}],"doi":"10.1111/jmg.12608"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Magnetic-plasmonic nanostructures","Surface-enhanced Raman scattering","SERS","Penicillin G","Coffee-ring effect"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afb66","5e70938d878c28a0473ac852","628e187840970776244d052d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Magnetic iron oxide cores with attached gold nanostructures coated with a layer of silica: An easily, homogeneously deposited new nanomaterial for surface-enhanced Raman scattering measurements","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454797fa","mniswId":"18836","title":"SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART A-MOLECULAR AND BIOMOLECULAR SPECTROSCOPY","doi":null,"issn":"1386-1425","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"a2b03b5d-b57f-4114-b7bf-3d6600939c77"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-15","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"628e187840970776244d052c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["628e187840970776244d052d","5e70938d878c28a0473ac852","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb66"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Nanostructures made of magnetic cores (Fe3O4) with many smaller plasmonic (Au) nanostructures attached were covered with a very thin layer of silica.

Moreover, due to the nanomaterial’s strong magnetic properties, it can be easily manipulated using a magnetic field, and it is therefore possible to form homogeneous layers (with no significant ‘coffee-ring’ effect) of (Fe3O4@Au)@SiO2 nanoparticles using a very simple procedure: depositing a drop of a sol of such nanoparticles and evaporating the solvent after placing the sample in a strong magnetic field. Synthesised (Fe3O4@Au)@SiO2 nanostructures have been used for the SERS detection of penicillin G in milk.

Herein, we report the synthesis of three fluorinated PAPS analogues that bear fluorine or trifluoromethyl substituents at the C2 or C8 positions of adenine and their evaluation as substitute cofactors that enable ST activity to be quantified and real-time-monitored by fluorine-19 nuclear magnetic resonance (19F NMR) spectroscopy. Using plant AtSOT18 and human SULT1A3 as two model enzymes, we reveal that the fluorinated PAPS analogues show complementary properties with regard to recognition by enzymes and the working 19F NMR pH range and are attractive versatile tools for studying STs.

sputtering and annealing are standard preparation methods for obtaining a stoichiometric TiO2(1 1 0) surface for surface science experiments. However, both processes result in a reduction in TiO2 crystal when used separately, leading to the modification of the physical and chemical properties of oxide materials. Our investigation aims to determine how these two processes affect the electronic properties of the surface and subsurface regions at the nanometer scale. To accomplish this goal, we utilized local microscopy (Kelvin probe force microscopy and local-conductivity atomic force microscopy) and spectroscopy methods (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry). We found that repeated sputtering and annealing does, in fact, affect both the conductivity and work function of the surface. The work function, as well as conductivity, increase with increasing number of cycles, but then reach a plateau. Furthermore, we show that the way the surface is prepared, using multiple cycles or one cycle of equivalent ion-beam fluence, matters. We attribute the differences in the crystal properties to the dynamics of stoichiometric changes during sputtering and subsequent annealing which we illustrate using secondary ion mass spectroscopy, which shows that after multiple cycles the subsurface layer is modified, even though XPS shows a stoichiometric surface."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169282","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"571","pagesFromTo":"1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169433221023564","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"656db37e40970749a862f199","name":"F.","lastName":"Krok","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3aabc804-628a-4952-b28f-49c5bba4ce5d"},{"objectId":"656db37e40970749a862f197","name":"P.","lastName":"Dąbczyński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4a2cce2a-38d3-436f-b5be-56b37ece4225"},{"objectId":"656db37e40970749a862f196","name":"C.","lastName":"Rodenbücher","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0f0e0fec-1dca-470a-ad99-63fd4cd1fc18"},{"objectId":"656db37e40970749a862f195","name":"W.","lastName":"Bełza","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3a8cfe9e-4341-4923-9349-8fd298704464"},{"objectId":"656db37e40970749a862f194","name":"K.","lastName":"Szajna","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a09839e4-5613-4206-ad00-050dc6858ca7"},{"objectId":"656db37e40970749a862f193","name":"D.","lastName":"Wrana","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"44937165-7145-4dd2-b032-5072d414f48d"},{"objectId":"656db37e40970749a862f192","name":"K.","lastName":"Cieślik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8b8bafe3-c643-4b6a-ba71-50a1bc2cc30b"},{"objectId":"5e7093c1878c28a0473b030e","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Rogala","uuid":"7160420E171470657931D803952C00417F882C1B201426CFCFAA86D9703F73EAB06C385D6052CDCFEE08657318AB0213264294887AB24AEC658EF4F80859823E","orcidId":"0000-0002-7898-5087","documentHash":"4d94229e-7279-4d01-a118-513c2187c042"},{"objectId":"5e7092e6878c28a04739ee7f","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Szot","uuid":"8462D4C6D937D00B47B6DF85100440CB6CFE152522F11DD2BDF1B9732D9261D342E5318F3C5BB0AEB2CE84BDE114B76BDA38962A9CEC7484BC2AE398FE7E2D34","orcidId":"0000-0001-8773-2754","documentHash":"05fa3792-3808-4091-8ea8-4a23c66f38ae"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.apsusc.2021.151303"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","uid":"bQp8ITDzg_V-1GFpvOVvvtg","uuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","parentUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","rootUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","name":"Politechnika Opolska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70920f878c28a04738f45e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Postural control through force plate measurements in female AIS patients compared to their able‑bodied peers","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":null,"issn":"2045-2322","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62f36b0b409707058d1b8812","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709223878c28a04739071a","64f86ac640970739aa8d1778","5e70920f878c28a04738f45e"]},"issue":"12","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The present understanding of the mechanisms responsible for postural deficit in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is still insufficient. This is important because some authors see one of the causes of this disease in the impaired postural control. Moreover, there is a reciprocal link between the level of postural imbalance and the clinical picture of these people. Therefore, we compared the center-of-pressure (COP) indices of 24 patients with AIS to 48 controls (CON) during four 20-s quiet stance trials with eyes open (EO) or closed (EC) and on firm or foam surface. This included sway amplitude, speed, sample entropy and fractal dimension. AIS had poorer postural steadiness only in the most difficult trial. In the remaining trials, AIS did as well as CON, while presenting a greater COP entropy than CON. Thus, the factor that made both groups perform equally could be the increased sway irregularity in AIS, which is often linked to higher automaticity and lower attention involvement in balance control. After changing the surface from hard to foam, puzzling changes in sway fractality were revealed. The patients decreased the fractal dimension in the sagittal plane identically to the CON in the frontal plane. This may suggest some problems with the perception of body axes in patients and reveals a hitherto unknown cause of their balance deficit."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169286","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-17597-y","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64f86ac640970739aa8d1778","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Piątek-Krzywicka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7433155c-a12f-4861-8ade-e4d4d89c2cc1"},{"objectId":"5e709223878c28a04739071a","name":"MICHAŁ","lastName":"KUCZYŃSKI","uuid":"953DA295EF90525B81D0C24C42FB92F4D7E682C47A0737945FCBC29A5490E0A888C488B460D80023BB9B1703E11CC0D4AFE8426150012AB9F77367F4491E7BA9","orcidId":"0000-0003-0260-8733","documentHash":"f3ff9eca-d5b3-40a8-87db-e3bd8dad69ba"},{"objectId":"5e70920f878c28a04738f45e","name":"DOROTA","lastName":"BORZUCKA","uuid":"4CE5BC6EF8B23A31E2529C92FB04EE078AF896C9981B0A62406EFE46D40179842AF876182916D6128A3363B8A6392C0D4724BFE301490755EFD2D0F01144A718","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9a17d78e-3629-46bb-9caa-ae24802d8b7a"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-022-17597-y"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["retencja wodna, odbudowa zasobów wodnych, urządzenia hydrotechniczne, piętrzenie wód, Program Kształtowania Zasobów Wodnych"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","uid":"bFhiVYWupXf-L0BTdpdX5dg","uuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","parentUuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","rootUuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","name":"Instytut Meteorologii i Gospodarki Wodnej - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709475878c28a0473bd79e"]},{"id":"5f512fe12467f03e3ec566cc","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Państwowe Gospodarstwo Wodne Wody Polskie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709475878c28a0473bd79e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Działania retencyjne Wód Polskich na obszarze Pojezierza Wielkopolsko-Kujawskiego","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"61b9abf9ad204581b62ebafb","mniswId":"201138","title":"Gospodarka Wodna","doi":null,"issn":"0017-2448","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WCN","editor":null,"documentHash":"0cb55f04-a1e1-4d7f-8e74-c807b50435b6"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"628d612e4097074a65913913","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709475878c28a0473bd79e"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Przeciwdziałanie skutkom suszy oraz powodzi to obecnie jedno z  najważniejszych wyzwań, jakim musi sprostać Państwowe Gospodarstwo Wodne Wody Polskie.

At the local level, this goal may be\nsupported by local authorities, but in Poland, as in many countries, the use of renewable energy is\nnot a mandatory task of local government units. The aim of this study is to analyze the role of local\ngovernment, i.e., municipalities, in the adaptation of RES installations in residents’ households. The\nsource of empirical materials was a survey of households using renewable energy installations, carried\nout in 2021 in the Podkarpacie region in Southeastern Poland. It has been shown that the inhabitants\nbenefit from the support of municipalities in financing the installations, as well as information and\nconsulting support. Municipalities support renewable energy in the “civic” segment mainly through\nthe implementation of the so-called umbrella projects. They have a positive effect on the adaptation\nof RES not only in the households of the project participants, but through the imitation effect, also in\nother households in the immediate vicinity. The municipality effectiveness in this type of activities\ndepends on the efficiency of project implementation and the quality of information on the conditions\nof participation in the project and the benefits of renewable energy."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169293","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62666df44097071c15d93ea7","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"9","doi":null,"documentHash":"3c6b244e-c443-4cd7-96dc-558288e783a0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"3163","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/9/3163/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094cf878c28a0473c4424","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Pitera","uuid":"05C2405888314FEC7F6B227847070C1E15A198C8F7EEBCD9D6553D622A45FEF421EF8CF9C5DFAA20E0A7F06755A8EAA6CAE6AD47385B97C1790A7446833DA77C","orcidId":"0000-0001-9598-1240","documentHash":"cb3f05d4-2511-4081-9fa9-ab40c2f5bcb7"},{"objectId":"5e709228878c28a047390d8e","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Dybka","uuid":"A9359E0B75B623D63ADA6E9D171D9714771CA49A1FF91A913ADDBB083E5F59ECB0CE5B1A52D03498CD404C4A19BDC6A470774765F4C54333F891C8DAE9F086EA","orcidId":"0000-0002-2160-647X","documentHash":"052668f7-02d8-4435-9c27-97f4610098a7"},{"objectId":"5e709228878c28a047390d4f","name":"Kazimierz","lastName":"Cyran","uuid":"DE04E2004DEB9FBC82B3236F8AB1FED31551A20A9047010FCFB7EF4CDD0F85D593995D2D916DD763F25750350CEFAE1AD74515D2AFCDDA1CF92B5C69E626D8CC","orcidId":"0000-0002-8075-9804","documentHash":"a93a6239-7c68-467e-8ca5-5a2797b0d8f8"},{"objectId":"5e709216878c28a04738fb4d","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Kata","uuid":"A9DA1AD4812EC33CB08D8F5D7ECFCE95999B01C2E1C78CD6DB83542C229319F5812CA63300DF67959A5468208ACBF4A07088844047942CB18CCCBF97B154CC8A","orcidId":"0000-0001-6085-3935","documentHash":"a74d8626-0072-4026-a6fc-11c6661016b9"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fae8","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Lechwar","uuid":"2D0592350A25FB5ADC318A077961BFB2DA69F18610C6CE28A8B4A8BCE98E1A31B884DE6C4107172C37D4CAEFCFA31BCECBFA6F817FBA683A84852D6EB6E2E095","orcidId":"0000-0001-8719-8918","documentHash":"95ab3599-0b77-4f98-9dc3-9c6c7993f429"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15093163"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6294a9e94097070db835f595","doi":null,"title":"Życie prywatne Polaków w XIX wieku.

with fluorinated benzylamines, a series of 2-unsubstituted imidazole N-oxides was prepared and subsequently deoxygenated in order to prepare the corresponding imidazoles. The latter were treated with benzyl halides yielding imidazolium salts, which are considered fluorinated analogues of naturally occurring imidazolium alkaloids known as lepidilines A and C. A second series of oxa-lepidiline analogues was obtained by O-benzylation of the initially synthetized imidazole N-oxides. Both series of imidazolium salts were tested as anticancer and antiviral agents. The obtained results demonstrated that the introduction of a fluorine atom, fluoroalkyl or fluoroalkoxy substituents (F, CF3 or OCF3) amplifies cytotoxic properties, whereas the cytotoxicity of some fluorinated lepidilines is promising in the context of drug discovery. All studied compounds revealed a lack of antiviral activity against the investigated viruses in the nontoxic concentrations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169307","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/11/3524","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"656db4a740970749a862f9db","name":"Agnieszka B.","lastName":"Olejniczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"90af4139-de8d-4ca4-9778-05cdfa506da1"},{"objectId":"656db4a740970749a862f9da","name":"Marta","lastName":"Denel-Bobrowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e1a706c3-47c5-40c6-87db-e762ec013f29"},{"objectId":"6168e7a875234017e053d55a","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"32ca82f4-7f96-4914-aef0-a935a61893bc"},{"objectId":"5e7094b0878c28a0473c1be7","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Celeda","uuid":"C96441ABF40F190DA6C38B563C8D721374F458BC93A04AB4F17F675591A1776742E9C908F9C6C00674F033207A8DAA9375E892439B29408A0C844EC10EE73977","orcidId":"0000-0003-0603-4204","documentHash":"6e2d0b46-a83a-4b3f-accb-b1385e3b3db5"},{"objectId":"5e70939e878c28a0473add82","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Jasiński","uuid":"C16055E5EEC2357D09DBCEDD3B8FCB387415D40F38DC9E7C12655E98A132E0DAA1FE625FF70402BB429BB2B03066FDEE999E21B8A6B2B6426DA94A679A9BD71A","orcidId":"0000-0002-8789-9690","documentHash":"6d798634-de61-46f2-8ad2-9cd1c0cdd466"},{"objectId":"5e709360878c28a0473a8612","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Mlostoń","uuid":"96B04DBD6CDEF853FAB7AF3D12F03FBA6AA666DAC77CC082030037F3A0A6802C67732F62794FC7FE99D77FD12BA0F751D22722B1852BF8BF1CE15B60C9DC70F4","orcidId":"0000-0003-3631-3239","documentHash":"9aaff168-fe88-4032-81ad-f5a9a2d78e1d"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules27113524"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918c878c28a04737e08c","uid":"bbip_kWUjcRWwim80LuSB4g","uuid":"92447067-30f0-4cec-82d0-68fd4d6f1c81","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","parentUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","rootUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","name":"Wydział Inżynierii Produkcji i Energetyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709306878c28a0473a155a","5e7093f7878c28a0473b4177"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","parentUuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","rootUuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

Worldwide expansion of NLL as a crop attracted various pathogenic fungi, including Colletotrichum lupini causing a devastating disease, anthracnose. Two alleles conferring improved resistance, Lanr1 and AnMan, were exploited in NLL breeding, however, underlying molecular mechanisms remained unknown. In this study, European NLL germplasm was screened with Lanr1 and AnMan markers. Inoculation tests in controlled environment confirmed effectiveness of both resistance donors. Representative resistant and susceptible lines were subjected to differential gene expression profiling. Resistance to anthracnose was associated with overrepresentation of “GO:0006952 defense response”, “GO:0055114 oxidation–reduction process” and “GO:0015979 photosynthesis” gene ontology terms. Moreover, the Lanr1 (83A:476) line revealed massive transcriptomic reprogramming quickly after inoculation, whereas other lines showed such a response delayed by about 42 h. Defense response was associated with upregulation of TIR-NBS, CC-NBS-LRR and NBS-LRR genes, pathogenesis-related 10 proteins, lipid transfer proteins, glucan endo-1,3-beta-glucosidases, glycine-rich cell wall proteins and genes from reactive oxygen species pathway. Early response of 83A:476, including orchestrated downregulation of photosynthesis-related genes, coincided with the successful defense during fungus biotrophic growth phase, indicating effector-triggered immunity. Mandelup response was delayed and resembled general horizontal resistance."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169352","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-12257-7.pdf?origin=ppub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a379940970762633a2ac6","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Jędryczka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c088edac-3b7c-4b6a-8f0a-ae78728dc91b"},{"objectId":"662a379940970762633a2ac5","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Krajewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7c12756b-ca42-4e86-ab2c-022970532da7"},{"objectId":"662a379940970762633a2ac4","name":"Maria","lastName":"Nuc","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"49b6f662-faf5-4ec5-ad72-eac3eb23d76f"},{"objectId":"662a379940970762633a2ac3","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Bielski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"274667c7-a16e-4329-bece-3463fadc4a21"},{"objectId":"662a379940970762633a2ac2","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Plewiński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6b2ab495-331b-4418-88eb-b2f3a6a8821c"},{"objectId":"662a379940970762633a2ac1","name":"Michał","lastName":"Książkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f2eb98bc-cc1b-44f5-ad75-3471050cfd61"},{"objectId":"5e709474878c28a0473bd6b0","name":"Sandra","lastName":"Rychel-Bielska","uuid":"AF79AEAA442FAFB99D93F6D5EEE2E4F45FD8A7319502B5A67967C71E10DEE5D3C990143B9721982B62AC198B6526D4C46C37F252DDD8F0EA41B4F597DF1D3EC1","orcidId":"0000-0002-2429-8054","documentHash":"374ad935-1f48-4179-a87c-69115760b6bf"},{"objectId":"5e709447878c28a0473b9805","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Kozak","uuid":"4BD88618A807058F00EEC5EE9BE504283EC0BA248B59DCB15B5AAE2C720561E9FE90F4BA823566FA67BDCE919AB53E3A92C2D4435B7733A5E66C32389433823A","orcidId":"0000-0001-6472-3273","documentHash":"c38b8f9a-625e-426c-a5bc-008bed2586a3"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-022-12257-7"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["żółć","konceptualizacja","językowy obraz świata","emocje i uczucia","gniew","metafora i frazeologia"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bile","conceptualisation","linguistic worldview","emotions and feelings","anger","metaphor and phraseology"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709204878c28a04738eafc"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Konceptualizacja GNIEWU na przykładzie ŻÓŁCI w języku czeskim i polskim","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d51878c285145479ce3","mniswId":"21302","title":"Bohemistyka","doi":null,"issn":"1642-9893","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"db974f4d-63db-48ff-a420-e82a4c860cde"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_ND","releaseDate":"2022-03-09","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"628e041940970776244bec65","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709204878c28a04738eafc"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Analiza wykazała, że z punktu widzenia lingwistyki nazwa żółć czes. žluč jest jednym z podstawowych wykładników do określania uczuć, koncentrując się zwłaszcza na konceptualizowanym ‘gniewie’, ale i na ‘złości’, ‘irytacji’, ‘wściekłości’, ‘rozdrażnieniu’, ‘oburzeniu’, ‘zdenerwowaniu’, ‘szale’ i ‘furii’. Przedstawiono koncepcję kognitywną, że uczucie gniewu rozumiane jest jako pewien proces, który zaczyna się w jakimś określonym momencie, następnie rozwija się i później kończy. Na ten proces ma wpływ temperatura i ciśnienie. Po wybuchu człowiek już uczuć nie kontroluje. Wszystkie te etapy przytoczono przy użyciu odpowiednich czasowników w tekście. Udowodniono trzy ważne stwierdzenia, że: ciało (experiencera) jest pojemnikiem dla fizjologicznych efektów gniewu; że konceptualizacja uczuć jest związana z ucieleśnieniem myśli oraz że myślimy i mówimy metaforami, które są ujęzykowionymi pojęciami. Przeprowadzona analiza pokazała, że czeski zasób szeroko pojmowanych związków frazeologicznych z komponentem leksykalnym żółć czes. žluč wskazuje liczne podobieństwa i zbieżności z językiem polskim (ze względu na typologicznie i genetycznie bliskie pokrewieństwa językowe), chociaż zdarzają się od tej reguły nieliczne odstępstwa."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The analysis showed that from the linguistic point of view, the name bile, Polish żółć, Czech žluč is one of the basic determinants of feelings, focusing especially on the conceptualized ‘anger’, but also on ‘irritation’, ‘rage’, ‘wrath’, ‘indignation’, ‘nervousness’, ‘madness’ and ‘fury’. The cognitive concept was presented that the feeling of anger is understood as a certain process that begins at a certain moment, then develops and then ends. This process is influenced by temperature and pressure. After the outbreak, you no longer control your feelings. All these steps are referenced using the appropriate verbs in the text. Three important statements have been proven that: the experiencera's body is a container for the physiological effects of anger; that the conceptualization of feelings is related to the embodiment of thought, and that we think and speak with metaphors, which are linguistic concepts. The conducted analysis showed that the Czech stock of broadly understood phraseological relations with the lexical component bile Polish żółć, Czech žluč shows numerous similarities and similarities with the Polish language (due to the typologically and genetically close linguistic affinities), although there are few exceptions to this rule."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169354","journalIssue":{"objectId":"628e045340970776244bee83","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"e83a5987-0e3f-494e-9497-05a597189c0d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"56-72","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"The conceptualization of ANGER on the example of the BILE in Czech and Polish"}],"publicUri":"https://pressto.amu.edu.pl/index.php/bo/article/view/31807/27733","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709204878c28a04738eafc","name":"Lubomir","lastName":"Hampl","uuid":"78982318653B73C4DAE6D099E5A39D3DDFE64B60950F3B982E9988E7155E529F9E0F577A9CBF55925DF17EA0612570CB1DA907D44DA722CA4D13EF45E98F4955","orcidId":"0000-0002-9549-8360","documentHash":"8edd04dd-266b-4bd9-85b8-e4fe918df151"}],"doi":"10.14746/bo.2022.1.4"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918c878c28a04737e08d","uid":"b_2SL7EJHW_bpe-duzSevtA","uuid":"d9e45b87-1c29-437e-b310-49f8311d9171","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","parentUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","rootUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","name":"Wydział Technologii Żywności","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f8e6f77085dcb424e4c184e","5e709309878c28a0473a1972","5e709309878c28a0473a196e","5e709431878c28a0473b7f21"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Impact of Dry Yeast Rehydrated in Different Plasma Treated Waters (PTWs) on Fermentation Process and Quality of Beer","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"Foods","doi":null,"issn":"2304-8158","eissn":null,"websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"064a8447-000a-4e4f-950b-4311ffde6ca3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6295bb4d4097072fefb77512","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f8e6f77085dcb424e4c184e","5e709309878c28a0473a196e","5e709431878c28a0473b7f21","5e709309878c28a0473a1972"]},"issue":"9","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058169356","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6295bb4d4097072fefb77519","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"11","number":"9","doi":null,"documentHash":"046a5ee1-9329-487f-b105-aa3b5b6eb818"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/11/9/1316/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f8e6f77085dcb424e4c184e","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Pater","uuid":"55A2634BA3E9E238E246F49A8078C813991C64958AF7122FB93EABFD6A01C3FCA472695A207C7EFFB11D966F486768BF8B597DCC03C0B3567BC4E4E04B1DD375","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"28032c26-91f2-4c14-85bb-f718ce279ce3"},{"objectId":"5e709431878c28a0473b7f21","name":"Marek","lastName":"Zdaniewicz","uuid":"9DD5505019C629BE38E8255C253DB67E7DBDEEC2C320D95D5E32A9D235AAD400DDE7727A99292F06E7F84B79EA35B92747330FAB5A340C25BB62D7699BA901CF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6075-6078","documentHash":"aab794eb-2bd4-43bd-955a-142882fcb018"},{"objectId":"5e709309878c28a0473a1972","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Sroka","uuid":"2BF58B2EE83CAEF6B6CB449E8586148A67BF3991E229B496D6C1AD00B0C0F1F0F4C336D99C646F1D4C2AF2B0D6529AE715D4C1FF871ED37A1DCA51D5C7B4478A","orcidId":"0000-0001-6428-9198","documentHash":"8572a9aa-d9ad-40b2-83e3-b211ea0806f0"},{"objectId":"5e709309878c28a0473a196e","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Satora","uuid":"ABDBA86980724E8BFD046CDDEA5F35CE5062B9D79D98E4900CBE8A33AF0338D68127648972C8350E1D267C920D11AA989E2507CA8C50A43E83354DF5DAAE8B89","orcidId":"0000-0003-4091-5822","documentHash":"b59dc770-cc63-48ff-8c9c-5c8569ad5fb9"}],"doi":"10.3390/foods11091316"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

BDD symptoms are more prevalent in patients with dermatological conditions than in the general population, but there are no large sample studies comparing the prevalence of BDD symptoms between patients with dermatological conditions and healthy skin controls.\r\nObjectives: To compare the prevalence of BDD symptoms between patients with different dermatological conditions and healthy skin controls and to describe sociodemographic, physical and psychological factors associated with BDD symptoms to identify patients who may have a particularly high chance of having this condition.\r\n\r\nMethods: This observational, cross-sectional, comparative multicentre study included 8295 participants: 5487 consecutive patients with different skin diseases (56% female) recruited among dermatological outpatients at 22 clinics in 17 European countries, and 2808 healthy skin controls (66% female). BDD symptoms were assessed by the Dysmorphic Concern Questionnaire. Sociodemographic data and information on psychological factors and physical conditions were collected. Each patient was given a dermatological diagnosis according to ICD-10 by a dermatologist. The study was registered with number DRKS00012745.\r\nResults: The average participation rate of invited dermatological patients was 82.4% across all centres. BDD symptoms were five times more prevalent in patients with dermatological conditions than in healthy skin controls (10.5% vs. 2.1%). Patients with hyperhidrosis, alopecia and vitiligo had a more than 11-fold increased chance (adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) > 11) of having BDD symptoms compared with healthy skin controls, and patients with atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, acne, hidradenitis suppurativa, prurigo and bullous diseases had a more than sixfold increased chance (adjusted OR > 6) of having BDD symptoms. Using a logistic regression model, BDD symptoms were significantly related to lower age, female sex, higher psychological stress and feelings of stigmatization.\r\nConclusions: Clinical BDD symptoms are significantly associated with common dermatological diseases. As such symptoms are associated with higher levels of psychological distress and multiple unhelpful consultations, general practitioners and dermatologists should consider BDD and refer patients when identified to an appropriate service for BDD screening and management."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169361","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"187","pagesFromTo":"115-125","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjd.21021","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630be8d4097076263e74538","name":"Joerg","lastName":"Kupfer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d304732d-491c-4ce9-93d2-a2486f7fb600"},{"objectId":"6630be8d4097076263e74537","name":"Claudia","lastName":"Zeidler","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cea529d2-e0c1-46f1-96a1-741a4b55e20d"},{"objectId":"6630be8d4097076263e74536","name":"Andrew

However, the stay-at-home order could have reduced PA the most, i.e., the ban of unnecessary outdoor activities. It affected free walking, running, skiing, active tourism, etc. It is, therefore, crucial to estimate how the stay-at-home order affected PA. We estimated how the stay-at-home order affected perceived PA and sedentary behavior compared to the pre-pandemic time in Poland.\n\nMethods\nWe used a self-reported International Physical Activity Questionnaire—Long Form (IPAQ-LF) to estimate the time (minutes per day) of vigorous and moderate PA and walking and sitting time.\n\nResults\nWe gathered data from 320 Polish participants. Bayesian approaches, including t-test and Bayesian correlations, were used to find differences and correlations between PA before and during the stay-at-home lockdown. Our data supported the hypotheses that vigorous PA, as well as walking, declined during the lockdown. Surprisingly, our data did not support the hypothesis that moderate physical activity was reduced. We found that moderate PA during lockdown increased compared to the pre-lockdown PA. As hypothesized, our data strongly evinced that sitting time inclined during the lockdown. PA decline was not correlated with the available living space. People who had access to gardens did not demonstrate a higher PA level than those without.\n\nDiscussion\nWalking and sitting time have drastically changed during the stay-at-home lockdown, decreasing and increasing, respectively. Given results from studies focusing on lockdowns without the stay-at-home restriction, it may be assumed that letting people go outside is crucial in keeping them more active and less sedentary. Authorities should take into account the effect the stay-at-home order may have on PA and sedentary behavior and as a result, on health. Stay-at-home orders should be the last considered restriction, given its detrimental consequences."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169367","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61f795e92467f01b5a145410","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"10","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"e49a7406-3036-4d7c-beb0-21fd12ae9576"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"e12779","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://peerj.com/articles/12779.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047394fee","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Czyż","uuid":"C9EB9C02F9370A2A8FDB7F1EBAC46057CCA059E76567757A6054800E36B815CF293064435CC978B02FD2DEF63C68F45E3789A3F3B4B8125485BF30CDBF8F4759","orcidId":"0000-0001-9395-9584","documentHash":"59a42a4d-f61e-4b19-b11f-6ee7b867f394"},{"objectId":"5e709262878c28a047394c9f","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Starościak","uuid":"1EA788831EAB964BC286BE83B257F1253BB96DF7C20279BBC03B59038AD4E958CD8AF14BB04FEB82133DFC5195509081826F753CFF2BA6F67E1453663DE02E6A","orcidId":"0000-0003-4202-5727","documentHash":"27dd759e-960f-4b1a-87a9-a884de78dc1f"}],"doi":"10.7717/peerj.12779"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Lyapunov stability theory","Wheeled mobile robot","intelligent control","tracking control","neural networks","mecanum wheels"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

It is composed of two key parts: a vision system and an automatic landing system. The first part exploits dedicated image-processing algorithms to identify the number of red and white PAPI lights appearing on an onboard video camera. Its output data—information about an aircraft’s position on a vertical profile of a landing trajectory—is used as one of the crucial inputs to the automatic landing system (the second part), which uses them to control the landing. The control algorithms implemented by the automatic landing system are based on the fuzzy logic expert system and were developed to imitate the pilot’s control actions during landing an aircraft. These two parts were teamed together as a component of a laboratory rig, first as pure software algorithms only, then as real hardware modules with downloaded algorithms. In two test campaigns (software in the loop and hardware in the loop) they controlled an aircraft model in a simulation environment. Selected results, presenting both control efficiency and flight precision, are given in the final section of the paper."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169368","journalIssue":{"objectId":"629f23e340970718a3857a7d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"11","doi":null,"documentHash":"b11eed5d-7034-4750-b726-6505c403ee63"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/11/5322","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f87e1c6085dcb410a25efb0","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Szeremeta","uuid":"DCA45BDD73AD2AC57DDD08515B586507F793681F0FCB6D4D08C76C88A90631A7E5DBA376E53E15A2E37E81EE8A5E8A57918C649BFAE280FA00C77EB439DB7D6D","orcidId":"0000-0003-0489-4438","documentHash":"3e81a978-91ef-4c95-b528-f662289fbd0d"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d584","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Szuster","uuid":"0D135E21170609FDD43C724D43AFDFB88CEA057BB0E96D88D1B7F8042657CB2F81E17DC6EBBB16BFFFF8019B63E310B369E823D70E9FC2DA10FEDA8A630C40B3","orcidId":"0000-0002-9713-4456","documentHash":"3fd57b63-27bb-4a5b-a6ee-6215233f5689"}],"doi":"10.3390/app12115322"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Children and adolescents","Indirect calorimetry","Metabolism","physical activity","Resting energy expenditure"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

In the case of young players, when these changes can infuence their strength and power, it seems to be equally important. Our aim was to examine whether resting energy expenditure (REE) and body composition would change after 10months from baseline in physically active children and adolescents. Methods: We obtained data from 80 children and adolescents aged 9 to 17 years at two measurement points: the baseline in September 2018 and after 10months in July 2019. The study was carried out using a calorimeter (Fitmate MED, Cosmed, Rome, Italy), a device used to assess body composition using by the electrical bioimpedance method by means of a segment analyzer (TANITA MC-980). The Student’s t-test and linear regression analysis were used. Using the stepwise forward regression procedure, the selection of factors in a statistically signifcant way that describes the level of REE was made. Results: We noticed that REE was not signifcantly diferent between baseline (1596.94±273.01 kcal) and after 10months (1625.38±253.26 kcal). When analyzing the diference in REE between studies girls, we found body height as a signifcant predictor. The results of our study show a negative relationship between growth and REE. Diferences between sexes and age in REE between baseline and after 10months were not signifcant. Conclusions: Our study involving physically active children and adolescents, which used repeated objective measures and longitudinal statistical modeling to analyze them, was unable to demonstrate any interaction between body weight change, body composition measurements, and REE."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169373","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6586ceb64097076c143de2a5","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"22","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"574beea0-1cb5-400e-a2d8-ad0a180906a0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://bmcpediatr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12887-022-03326-x","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"658f16c44097076c145d86e3","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Dereń","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4ea06fca-1e7b-41f8-b21f-89b46052bb00"},{"objectId":"658f16c44097076c145d86e2","name":"Artur","lastName":"Mazur","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d3d0adfb-9189-4480-a308-d21cbfe78dfe"},{"objectId":"658f16c44097076c145d86e1","name":"Olga","lastName":"Adamska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f4456a93-4f91-4ac4-b4b1-3fa161d48a0a"},{"objectId":"658f16c44097076c145d86e0","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Łuszczki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6bee9147-462a-4a67-b495-537174edc647"},{"objectId":"658f16c44097076c145d86df","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Kuchciak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2dfb12c5-f62c-49d5-9e5b-4e3f0da7ba03"},{"objectId":"658f16c44097076c145d86de","name":"Anna","lastName":"Bartosiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"455ab824-adbf-4408-931d-15acaba08117"},{"objectId":"5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f63","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Oleksy","uuid":"D2EE678DA6F41EF7B1D53C6E024AB8473A27C18E7E451EB1718E98CB6C1060024D0A5E63D36B42D61A656AC1459E60BE13E9DD9E0507D59F7594AE4939734B3C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0589-0554","documentHash":"964e962b-b723-4760-874c-5f5662db8723"}],"doi":"10.1186/s12887-022-03326-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet

year, the incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) disease increases. NAFLD is a chronic disease. One of the most common causes of NAFLD is an inadequate lifestyle, which is characterized by a lack or low physical activity and eating highly processed foods rich in saturated fat and salt and containing low amount of fiber. Moreover, disturbances in intestinal microbiome and the use of certain drugs may predispose to NAFLD. NAFLD is an increasingly described disease in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Recent data also indicate a frequent coexistence of metabolic syndrome in this group of patients. Certain groups of drugs also increase the risk of developing inflammation, liver fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Particularly important in the development of NAFLD are steroids, which are used in the treatment of many diseases, for example, IBD. NAFLD is one of the most frequent parenteral manifestations of the disease in IBD patients. However, there is still insufficient information on what dose and exposure time of selected types of steroids may lead to the development of NAFLD. It is necessary to conduct further research in this direction. Therefore, patients with IBD should be constantly monitored for risk factors for the development of NAFLD."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169378","journalIssue":{"objectId":"628f7fb5409707500ab00fe1","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2022","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"59f8b8f1-7c6b-4c17-957e-b51fa5ffffd0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2022","pagesFromTo":"Article ID 4344905","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cjgh/2022/4344905.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebede0c752340254fc428aa","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Pardak","uuid":"BC6C324F98E1C253FB0732A0D4A014369104A85710A84187F5B944D30237D9EDFE3DDAC7B90212B765713FCA11A6AF4F10F98F0CF5C4515B0560A2AD108E2944","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"07fa249c-97ef-46fe-a87e-ebba1bdb1fd9"},{"objectId":"5e7093a1878c28a0473ae172","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Sokal-Dembowska","uuid":"143FB4FA36CF5DE11D0A47A261D9AA246B4F0E804FC905AD7336701B63300C43B70D04B39B35ED181925322D4B85753D7B589A4B6AFDE39814741AD5B3149A6E","orcidId":"0000-0003-4727-8766","documentHash":"fc6f093f-0cdb-41d0-8928-67ab829a7b72"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d8a7","name":"Sara","lastName":"Jarmakiewicz-Czaja","uuid":"95AB62C0970A41B5E87773560B2CB71660B45D462CE5F08E458F3D85FE34762EA136E6713F8B32592AB506C7220E66FA62DFE7918BD25B8CC01AED765AEF296E","orcidId":"0000-0001-6896-4744","documentHash":"932deb54-bc4c-4e51-9739-ce1116c81520"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a047392271","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Filip","uuid":"2E4439E8F6EC6CFDC67F6E9B81C52B12CE6DF0245219ED2CC7CA9146341B0CB0E14932DB9EE97A71F3DBC331C8782C686D90B808A5E7ABF727CEAF7163060776","orcidId":"0000-0002-5954-151X","documentHash":"e7b93929-4865-43b9-831a-47663ee1263e"}],"doi":"10.1155/2022/4344905"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["information technologies","artificial intelligence","augmentation","humanitarian vector of education","employment"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61b0862a2467f07864fe8a52","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Volodymyr Dahl East Ukrainian National University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["628d2fda4097074a659092d1","628d2fda4097074a659092d0"]},{"id":"61a8e72c2467f03813174764","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Odessa National Polytechnic University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["628d2fda4097074a659092d2","628d2fda4097074a659092cf"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Pedagogical assessment of augmentation","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5ec007c2ad49b31ccedb5abf","mniswId":null,"title":"ScienceRise: Pedagogical Education","doi":null,"issn":"2519-4976","eissn":"2519-4984","websiteLink":"http://journals.uran.ua/sr_edu","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"b5d3c2ec-f4f4-445e-b371-83bda1950cfb"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-31","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"628d2fda4097074a659092cc","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["628d2fda4097074a659092cf","628d2fda4097074a659092d0","628d2fda4097074a659092d1","628d2fda4097074a659092d2"]},"issue":"2(47)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The education challenges in the information technology progress are considered. In particular, the problem of artificial intelligence is equal to humans and thus poses a challenge to the teaching system. The augmentation concept as the human and machine’s interaction that enhances the capabilities of each party is analyzed. We assessed these opportunities as the ability to create more value and get more personal benefit on the economic plane. But a worthy place for a human - to be above technology. Purpose of the study is to provide a pedagogical assessment of augmentation. The analysis of futurological research on human-machine synergy gave the opportunity to determine the social consequences and educational prospects of such development. It is questioned the prospect of singularity, the point at which artificial intelligence will match or exceed human intelligence. We will become dependent on «the society of the program», but it will not depend on us. It causes the spontaneous progress of techno-science. On the study basis (questionnaire), there were identified the predominant models of pedagogical interaction in traditional and online learning; described changes in teachers’ behavior under the influence of computer technology. We emphasized the threats of computer-mediated learning: «cool» [cold] environment according to Jean Baudrillard, «robot» as a pedagogical communication model, hyper-formalization of the educational process. But the concept of increase can be useful in the short term. The results of the study confirm the conclusions about the need to humanize education, balance technology and live communication.

This intermittency is probably the most important drawback in terms of increasing the participation of these energies in the power systems. A proper distribution of wind and solar plants in a region has been reported to be a successful way to reduce the fluctuations in the aggregated-power supply. This reduction is enhanced when the allocation of the renewable power capacity makes use of the spatiotemporal variability of the wind and solar energy resources. Indeed, by exploiting the spatial and temporal complementarity of the wind and solar energy resources, below-normal power generation in some areas can be balanced with above-normal generation in other areas at given times, thereby reducing the fluctuations in the power generation. The main objective of this study is to assess the extent to which the wind and solar power generation is coupled in Spain on daily time scales, as well as to analyze their associated weather patterns. A byproduct of this study is the identification of coupled wind–solar power generation modes exhibiting balancing. To this end, gridded daily solar and wind power generation time series, spanning a period of 10 years (2001–10) and covering Spain, are used as input of a clustering algorithm. As a result, coupled power regimes (CPRs) are obtained. For each of these CPRs, the spatial distribution of the wind and solar power generation and the associated synoptic weather patterns are evaluated. The CPRs are interpreted on the light of these weather patterns and the topographic features of the study region. The results reveal the existence of six-coupled modes for winter and four for the rest of the seasons, with only some of these modes being relevant regarding the balancing between the wind and solar power generation. A marked seasonality of the balancing strength as well as their spatial and temporal covering is observed. The most relevant balancing is detected during autumn, followed by winter, spring, and, lastly, summer. It is found that all the balancing modes, except the summer ones, are associated with the presence of a positive/negative (alternating) center of pressures anomalies located, roughly, over Ireland. The interaction of the resulting wind circulation with the existing topographical features explains the balancing patterns. The results reported in this study may have important consequences regarding the optimal spatial allocation of new renewable power plants over Spain. Nevertheless, the practical usefulness of the results implies the use of some daily energy storage system."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169399","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"215-243","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323855273000182","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6290ed7b409707780b06e28d","name":"David","lastName":"Pozo-Vázquez","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b8949286-580d-4bc2-8ad6-bded53e6e9b2"},{"objectId":"6290ed7b409707780b06e28c","name":"Antonio","lastName":"Jiménez-Garrote","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"527eabe1-1392-4706-8dda-a2514358f5c4"},{"objectId":"6290ed7b409707780b06e28b","name":"Francisco","lastName":"J.Santos-Alamillos","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"95b7567f-9e9f-497b-a27a-e6e30f356e9a"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["rytuał,

increases in bacterial infections, which are often suspected (though rarely confirmed) in paediatric influenza. We retrospectively verified procalcitonin’s usefulness in antibiotic guidance in children hospitalized due to laboratory-confirmed influenza. The ROC curve analysis evaluated procalcitonin’s performance in terms of antibiotic implementation or continuation in patients who were naive or had been receiving antibiotic treatment prior to hospital admission. We also assessed the procalcitonin’s usefulness to predict lower-respiratory-tract infections (LRTI), the presence of radiologically confirmed pneumonia, an intensive care unit transfer and a fatal outcome. Multiple regression models were built to verify the previously reported procalcitonin cut-off values. The study enrolled 371 children (median age 33 months). The AUC (area under the curve) for antibiotic implementation reached 0.66 (95%CI: 0.58–0.73) and 0.713 (95%CI: 0.6–0.83) for antibiotic continuation; optimal cut-offs (0.4 and 0.23 ng/mL, respectively) resulted in a negative predictive value (NPV) of 79.7% (95%CI: 76.2–82.9%) and 54.6% (95%CI: 45.8–63%), respectively. The use of 0.25 ng/mL as a reference decreased the odds of antibiotic treatment by 67% (95%CI: 43–81%) and 91% (95%CI: 56–98%), respectively. Procalcitonin showed lower AUC for the prediction of LRTI and pneumonia (0.6, 95%CI: 0.53–0.66, and 0.63, 95%CI: 0.56–0.7, respectively), with a moderately high NPV in the latter case (83%, 95%CI: 79.3–86.1%). Procalcitonin use may decrease the antibiotic frequency in hospitalized influenza cases both in terms of antibiotic administration and continuation. Procalcitonin concentrations may suggest bacterial suprainfections at lower concentrations than in adults, and a focus on its rule-out value is of special interest."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169409","journalIssue":{"objectId":"628e229d40970776244d6f90","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"10072716-0235-4841-b5ef-c3bcd987c506"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"[1-13]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/12/5/1148/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6295d3914097072fefb88ab8","name":"Oliwia","lastName":"Wrotek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"34b19b0d-8b77-4872-a4b2-d8ba64f694f6"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bdeef","name":"August","lastName":"Wrotek","uuid":"BB369CF1E94175CE07F81482F5D4069AEDC04F1EFE74B32BF740347F54AB7EB02B6E52ECBCCAC76B22C108CF08EF61FC2F728F0E448F904F5AEEE2B05ED18D63","orcidId":"0000-0002-3167-3975","documentHash":"f6d493fa-0765-4f52-98dd-5c89fc667daf"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390869","name":"Teresa","lastName":"Jackowska","uuid":"3FDD019EECE678437E8F05FF0411151F722F4DA0D26448A665937DE0E361FD7EF9F295317F56F8BF1E89FC3E031D949C681407F5DFEF1F4D8B26ED23E61D8554","orcidId":"0000-0003-0131-7854","documentHash":"53869c16-ca18-48e9-ba6f-596b6264684f"}],"doi":"10.3390/diagnostics12051148"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Linie lotnicze","Lotnictwo cywilne","Marketing","Obsługa klienta","Psychologia","Public relations","Reklama","Satysfakcja konsumentów","Usługi","Zachowania konsumentów"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Airlines","Clienting","Consumer bahaviour","Consumer satisfaction","Marketing research","Private flying","Psychology","Public relations"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","uid":"bABmAiyO82JgMB2LqzOepAg","uuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","parentUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","rootUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","name":"Akademia Sztuki Wojennej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709481878c28a0473bea7c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Commercials Efficacy in Airline Services Promotion","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"628f6ad2409707500aaf2e7b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"628f5c73409707500aad8cc9","mniswId":null,"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"fullName":"International Conference on Economics and Social Sciences","shortName":"E&SS","city":null,"country":null,"website":"https://eclss.org","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"996b7427-aee5-42c0-a703-379c4d84b654"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709481878c28a0473bea7c"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058169411","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"628f5d60409707500aadc783","mniswId":null,"startDate":"2022-05-07","endDate":"2022-05-08","fullName":"7th International Conference on Economics & Social Sciences","shortName":"E&SS 2022","city":"Kyrenia","country":"CY","website":"https://eclss.org/kyrenia/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"e3966a82-929d-4327-bec6-f7f14e4e65d1"},"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"16 -

To this end, it analyses the case of a fully operational coking plant in Bytom-Bobrek and a closed coking plant in Ruda Śląska-Orzegowo, which was transformed into a memorial park and playground. In this context, the concepts of ultimate place and post-ultimate place are introduced as spaces that encourage reflection on human pride, unlimited extraction, and limits on fossil fuel burning coking. The two case studies are supplemented with an interpretation of Jakub Pszoniak’s poetry and Diana Lelonek’s multimedia exhibition \"O węglu i lodzie\" [On Coal and Ice]. While exploring the cultural responses to unlimited coal burning and coking, both of which are detrimental to human health and cause environmental degradation later requiring long-term revitalisation and significant financial investments, the author ponders on the critical potential of images created by architects, poets, and artists. Similarly to the Greek tragedy referred to by Kallis, these images can scare and shock, thus motivate people to abandon their pernicious habits and shift from the policy of growth towards a more balanced living and moderation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169412","journalIssue":{"objectId":"629475504097070db8331d8a","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"1 (117)","doi":null,"documentHash":"0a00022c-1017-4983-ba66-56389f4d311e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"122-136","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nck.pl/wydawnictwo/kultura-wspolczesna/archiwum/kultury-umiaru","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092eb878c28a04739f308","name":"Marta","lastName":"Tomczok","uuid":"43FCE2BF5B94275717D06E0BE331D4D160F3DA27B43B1E73D88D48B21FC98DCA06E116304B9E89D415C87BE16A47CF42448D4A780FDC63861B0B62DF459136E0","orcidId":"0000-0001-9512-007X","documentHash":"dece0475-ed71-4858-acd7-fc8201b1f012"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["genetic markers","rheumatic diseases","rheumatoid arthritis","rheumatology"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092c7878c28a04739c731","5e7094c7878c28a0473c383f","5e709373878c28a0473a9db7"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The lack of association between PADI4_94 or PADI4_104 polymorphisms and RF, ACPA and anti-PAD4 in patients with rheumatoid arthritis","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":null,"issn":"2045-2322","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-13","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62f3611e409707058d1a7e1d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094c7878c28a0473c383f","5e7092c7878c28a04739c731","5e709373878c28a0473a9db7"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that leads to chronic inflammation of synovial tissue, ultimately causing joint damage, disability, and premature mortality. The peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) family of proteins is involved in the production of anticitrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA), which are clinically relevant markers of RA. ACPA recognizes citrullinated proteins generated mainly by PAD4. Polymorphisms of the PADI4 gene have been associated with RA in Asian populations, but in Europeans these associations are still difficult to estimate. A total of 147 subjects, 122 patients with RA, 52 ± 12.3 aged, 84.4% women and 25 healthy controls, 53 ± 8.4 aged, 72% women were enrolled in the study. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the PADI4 gene (PADI4_94, rs2240340 and PADI4_104, rs1748033) were genotyped using a real-time polymerase chain reaction. Genetic models (co-dominant-1 and 2, dominant, over-dominant, and recessive) were applied to find the associations between genotypes and ACPA as well as PAD4 antibodies (anti-PAD4) levels. We found no relationship between the distribution of genotypes in different genetic models and the levels of anti-PAD4, ACPA and RF antibodies. There were also no differences with respect to the haplotypes.

Large-scale molecular analyses in maize do not only focus on the identification of new markers and quantitative trait locus (QTL) regions. DNA analysis in the selection of parental components for heterotic crosses is a very important tool for breeders. The aim of this research was to identify and select new markers for maize (SNP and SilicoDArT) linked to genes influencing the size of the yield components in maize. The plant material used for the research was 186 inbred maize lines. The field experiment was established in twolocations. The yield and six yield components were analyzed. For identification of SNP and SilicoDArT markers related to the yield and yield components, next-generation sequencing was used. As a result of the biometric measurements analysis, differentiation in the average elevation of the analyzed traits for the lines in both locations was found. The above-mentioned results indicate the existence of genotype–environment interactions. The analysis of variance for the observed quality between genotypes indicated a statistically significant differentiation between genotypes and a statistically significant differentiation for all the observed properties betweenlocations. A canonical variable analysis was applied to present a multi-trait assessment of the similarity of the tested maize genotypes in a lower number of dimensions with the lowest possible loss of information. No grouping of lines due to the analyzed was observed. As a result of next-generation sequencing, the molecular markers SilicoDArT (53,031) and SNP (28,571) were obtained. The genetic distance between the analyzed lines was estimated on the basis of these markers. Out of 81,602 identified SilicoDArT and SNP markers, 15,409 (1559 SilicoDArT and 13,850 SNPs) significantly related to the analyzed yield components were selected as a result of association mapping. The greatest numbers of molecular markers were associated with cob length (1203), cob diameter (1759), core length (1201) and core diameter (2326). From 15,409 markers significantly related to the analyzed traits of the yield components, 18 DArT markers were selected, which were significant for the same four traits (cob length, cob diameter, core length, core diameter) in both Kobierzyce and Smolice. These markers were used for physical mapping. As a result of the analyses, it was found that 6 out of 18 (1818; 14,506; 2317; 3233; 11,657; 12,812) identified markers are located inside genes.

The conducted research is to contribute to a partial explanation of the course of photosynthesis processes in soybean plants, which may facilitate the decision making before sowing this species in a given tillage system. The aim of the study was to assess the dependence of photosynthesis on the yield and variable hydrothermal conditions of tillage systems, as well as their impact on the productivity and quality of soybean. A field experiment was carried out using soybean cv. Merlin, between 2017 and 2019 in Boguchwała, Poland. The plant tested was soybean cv. Merlin. The tillage systems—conventional (CT), reduced (RT) and no-tillage (NT)—were the experimental factors. The use of CT and RT influenced growth in leaf area index (LAI) and soil plant analysis development (SPAD) and improved the photosynthesis process, which increased the values of the maximal quantum yield of the photolysis system of the donor side of PSII (Fv/F0), and performance index of PS II (PI) and net photosynthetic rate (PN), stomatal conductance (gs) parameters, compared to NT. CT treatment increased the yield of soybean plants to significantly higher compared with NT treatment, and seeds treated with the CT treatment contained more protein. The content of fat and phosphorus (P) were significantly higher in the NT system and the content of potassium (K) from RT. In 2017, under drought conditions (the June–September period), the seed yield of NT was similar to the yield of CT and significantly higher than the yield of RT. The higher value of hydrothermal coefficients in 2019 resulted in an increase in photosynthesis parameters, seed yield as well as the content of fat and elements P and K."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169452","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62662ab84097071c15d85102","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"9","doi":"","documentHash":"4fc7b66f-ba84-4fed-a7c5-424b1db2c187"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"ID number 4903","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/9/4903","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094ca878c28a0473c3bdf","name":"Marta","lastName":"Jańczak-Pieniążek","uuid":"609CBC19957C284442D3DF68448DE529E6A77E006C98F7AE710EB3183AB1752B745A8183AB6C1E90E0DC552CDAE2276851037D5380DEE3843D987F959A963AAA","orcidId":"0000-0003-4655-7974","documentHash":"63001b83-a9a7-4a69-a059-7fa7276a4f10"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fadb","name":"Jan","lastName":"Buczek","uuid":"F003C11F7CCF3B17332DE6E527878843780854ED853FDE5DCFEE52C3AFFE7D1ED11E6EB449D9BBE0FDA1B6299B67FEDB66CCA7A607C900D19631870B4A68B805","orcidId":"0000-0002-9760-3603","documentHash":"bcce6706-3154-4a20-a732-072205324710"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fa3f","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Bobrecka-Jamro","uuid":"17F914261ABF1DF82B3158158B5A9266F00BEFC5F712E8DA79EC8226547422AC6D9FE37D004946B32F6A96B86EBD5A61760DBC554A2755EFC95F1C79C9920D77","orcidId":"0000-0002-1740-0911","documentHash":"23a79bb5-5188-4d8f-9e0f-3594fd9381da"}],"doi":"10.3390/su14094903"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["glass transition","sorption isotherms","state diagran"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918c878c28a04737e08d","uid":"b_2SL7EJHW_bpe-duzSevtA","uuid":"d9e45b87-1c29-437e-b310-49f8311d9171","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","parentUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","rootUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","name":"Wydział Technologii Żywności","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397d5d","5e709309878c28a0473a197b","5e70937f878c28a0473ab2d8"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Thermal Characteristics, Sorption Isotherms and State Diagrams of the Freeze-Dried Pumpkin-Inulin Powders","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":null,"issn":"1420-3049","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"8615ffac-9999-41cd-9658-bd5ed633cde5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"MARCH","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"628c9c484097074a658aeaf3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70937f878c28a0473ab2d8","5e70928e878c28a047397d5d","5e709309878c28a0473a197b"]},"issue":"7","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Powders based on plant raw materials have low storage stability due to their sorption and thermal properties and generate problems during processing. Therefore, there is a need to find carrier agents to improve their storage life as well as methods to evaluate their properties during storage. Water adsorption isotherms and thermal characteristics of the pumpkin powder with various inulin additions were investigated in order to develop state diagrams. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to obtained glass transition lines, freezing curves and maximal-freeze-concentration conditions. The glass transition lines were developed using the Gordon&ndash;Taylor model. Freezing data were modeled employing the Clausius&ndash;Clapeyron equation and its development&ndash;Chen model. The glass transition temperature of anhydrous material (Tgs) and characteristic glass transition temperature of maximum-freeze-concentration (Tg&prime;) increased with growing inulin additions. Sorption isotherms of the powders were determined at 25 &deg;C by the static-gravimetric method and the experimental data was modeled with four different mathematical models.

One of the most important attributes of a forest ecosystem is site productivity, an essential determinant of resource availability. Knowledge of site productivity is crucial for sustainable forest management because it is the basis for predictions of future forest growth and is fundamental to long-term planning in forestry. Models of forest dynamics allow us to better understand the functioning of forest ecosystems and to assess the provision of ecosystem services. However, discussions on the factors affecting forest growth are ongoing. Previous research has not clarified the influence of stand density on the height increment of trees. Consequently, this uncertainty leads to inconsistent predictions for stand growth and nonoptimal forest-management decisions. We aimed to analyse the effect of stand density on top height (TH) growth and the development of the TH growth model for Scots pine based on bitemporal ALS measurements. We applied repeated ALS observations from two acquisitions (2011, 2019) to fit a density-sensitive TH growth model. We found that stand density affected the TH growth of Scots pine. A higher stand density stimulated TH growth, particularly in productive sites showing a TH increment of about 10%. We demonstrated the usefulness of bitemporal ALS measurements for developing a TH growth model for Scots pine considering stand density.

To study the interaction of various factors affecting the process of squeezing oil from melon seeds, mathematical methods of experiment planning were applied. Melon seeds were used as the object of the study. The results of studying the physical and mechanical indicators of melon seeds are reported; the rational modes of pressing melon seeds have been determined; the aerodynamic indicators of melon seeds have been defined in order to design a cold-pressed press for melon seeds.\n\nVentilation modes have been substantiated; the soaring coefficient for melon seeds was derived. The coefficient of resistance for a melon seed is 1.54.\n\nThe highest critical velocity values for melon seeds were 6.4, for kernels 4.67, and for husks 3.94, respectively, with seed moisture content of 24.08 %.\n\nThe dependence of the oil yield on huskness has been determined. It is established that in the process of pressing there is a decrease in the oil content of the oil seed meal as it moves from the receiving chamber to the exit from the press, at the same time there is a compaction of the compressed product. Based on the study’s results, a plant for squeezing oil from melon seeds was designed. As a result of solving the problem with the vector optimization criterion, optimal intervals of input parameters were obtained: the initial humidity of the raw material is 9.15...10.27 %, the speed of rotation of the oil press screw is 0.843...0.895 s–1, the clearance for the yield of cake is 0.750...0.800, the oil seed meal temperature at pressing=87...89 °С, the huskness of the starting product is 7.13...7.23 %"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169475","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6294b38f4097070db83653d3","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"11 (116)","doi":"","documentHash":"b26c593f-33e3-4616-a6ae-56fd8d7feeeb"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"12-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/255731/252917","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6294b6204097070db8366b3a","name":"Yesmurat","lastName":"Mateyev","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"100afe0b-d3f4-4e14-92d3-248d05fed339"},{"objectId":"6294b6204097070db8366b39","name":"Kalima","lastName":"Mukhamadiyeva","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0336-9167","documentHash":"1cb2e1fa-d4eb-4ec9-bcff-38cf3178f78d"},{"objectId":"6294b6204097070db8366b38","name":"Alimzhan","lastName":"Imanbayev","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4443-265X","documentHash":"3dd1f563-1e54-4a12-abfa-291221904861"},{"objectId":"6294b6204097070db8366b37","name":"Dinara","lastName":"Tlevlessova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5084-6587","documentHash":"b4b303da-299f-4955-aa46-ab80553b9a98"},{"objectId":"6294b6204097070db8366b36","name":"Ainura","lastName":"Kairbayeva","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9578-7795","documentHash":"79672e1f-5b67-44a4-abe7-e3d62b7abd74"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.255731"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hydrocephalus","neurodysfunction","developmental disorders"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709229878c28a047390e5b","5e709214878c28a04738fad7","5e709229878c28a047390e1d","5e709228878c28a047390d38"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Somatic Development Disorders in Children and Adolescents Affected by Syndromes and Diseases Associated with Neurodysfunction and Hydrocephalus Treated/Untreated Surgically","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","doi":null,"issn":"1661-7827","eissn":"1660-4601","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e236e16e-7430-4ac3-800c-033637860e22"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-07","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"628f5c11409707500aad88b8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709228878c28a047390d38","5e709229878c28a047390e1d","5e709229878c28a047390e5b","5e709214878c28a04738fad7"]},"issue":"9","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: This study was conducted to evaluate the co-occurrence of hydrocephalus treated/untreated surgically and congenital nervous system disorders or neurological syndromes with symptoms visible since childhood, and with somatic development disorders, based on significant data obtained during admission to a neurological rehabilitation unit for children and adolescents. Methods: The study applied a retrospective analysis of data collected during hospitalization of 327 children and adolescents, aged 4–18 years, all presenting congenital disorders of the nervous system and/or neurological syndromes associated with at least one neurodysfunction that existed from early childhood. To allow the identification of individuals with somatic development disorders in the group of children and adolescents with hydrocephalus treated/untreated surgically, the adopted criteria considered the z-score values for body height, body weight, head circumference, body mass index, and head circumference index. Results: Treated/untreated hydrocephalus was observed in the study group at the rates of 8% and 0.9%, respectively. Among 239 patients with cerebral palsy, 9 (3.8%) had surgically treated hydrocephalus, 17 (70.8%) of 24 patients with neural tube defects also had hydrocephalus treated with surgery, and 3 (12.5%) of 24 patients with neural tube defects had untreated hydrocephalus. This medical condition was a more frequent comorbidity in subjects with neural tube defects compared with those with cerebral palsy (p < 0.001). Subjects with untreated hydrocephalus most frequently presented macrocephaly (p < 0.001), including absolute macrocephaly (p = 0.001), and with tall stature (p = 0.007). Excessive body mass co-occurred more frequently with surgically untreated hydrocephalus, but the relationship was not statistically significant (p = 0.098). Conclusions: Surgically treated hydrocephalus occurred in patients with cerebral palsy and neural tube defects, and untreated hydrocephalus was present only in patients with neural tube defects. Untreated hydrocephalus negatively changed the course of individual development in the studied group of children, in contrast to surgically treated hydrocephalus."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169484","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62664e2b4097071c15d8ac2d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"19","number":"9","doi":"","documentHash":"c558534a-bd36-488f-87e5-04ba77466276"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"5712","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/9/5712/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709229878c28a047390e5b","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Podgórska-Bednarz","uuid":"3148EC4A12FBDEE70778FE0BDB593DD90F90CDD3D4385D064CC24A27C43C267EF63DCDCDA4985193F1AF385046CEDDDAFE456D4C5578DE8379DE7E5C966FB661","orcidId":"0000-0002-2057-2351","documentHash":"72b900ef-3f65-46f4-bcd6-f4ec2a0e66ec"},{"objectId":"5e709229878c28a047390e1d","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Guzik","uuid":"432F0AD888D04635B708C52634E73C55B85F500AC161740CEBAAD07AA27A34C09DF0D8BE20D66117A26DBAFFF08699D901A9642DACF5A96E4E9A314E307CBD17","orcidId":"0000-0002-4582-4383","documentHash":"80859422-2e05-4b5b-acd6-12ceed5cc4df"},{"objectId":"5e709228878c28a047390d38","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Perenc","uuid":"BB2E46E1255F2F6D1B96A6FE9F58F696F51BE770CEA9E9E0EF2A14904BBF558560FA7769CB76E88E379A74C86DF2E2034030BA5A31C8A5ADAE6C171CBBB6EBA5","orcidId":"0000-0001-8378-2340","documentHash":"c80b3680-890f-4484-ab7c-34c6b48a377f"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fad7","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Drużbicki","uuid":"38AF350228498D2C2A5FD210CB1398D5E50B82543B5DDC0A0F423806507CD42AA0683DAD3DB80D885A66113A65FE6A61CD726720B87CCAD217B8FBD3A2FD518F","orcidId":"0000-0003-4511-8419","documentHash":"5f788fc8-254d-4421-9414-9eb90041ccf6"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19095712"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afb66","5e70938d878c28a0473ac852"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60dda4479543c7233654463c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Formation and selected catalytic properties of ruthenium, rhodium, osmium and iridium nanoparticles","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547962f","mniswId":"18024","title":"RSC Advances","doi":"","issn":"2046-2069","eissn":"","websiteLink":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/journals/journalissues/ra#!subjects","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"7bdc5735-05e6-4090-aed0-e4bd45deccc8"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-13","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"628e140940970776244cc66c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70938d878c28a0473ac852","5e7093b9878c28a0473afb66","60dda4479543c7233654463c"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The synthesis and applications of nanoparticles formed from various platinum-group metals have been intensively investigated for many years because such systems have many important commercial applications, mainly as heterogeneous catalysts.

Geographic information systems (GIS) provide flexible and comprehensive options for the spatial analysis and visualization of different renewable energy features, which is especially interesting for researchers, planners, and policy-makers. This chapter presents a vision of how GIS applications have been utilized for estimating and visualizing energetic complementarity. After presenting the main GIS tools employed in this type of endeavor, the reviewed studies are presented and summarized according to the geographic region of their case study.

pools are ephemeral freshwater habitats characterized by their small size, well-defined boundaries, and periodic desiccation, making them ideal model systems to answer numerous ecological questions. Although there are numerous studies on rock pool fauna around the world, tardigrades have only rarely been recorded. We conducted the first tardigrade-focused study on rock pools by quantitatively extracting and classifying them from rock pools in the Italian Apennines. Rock pools were divided into three types, based on maximum duration of their inundation period. Following the patterns usually observed with rock pool invertebrates, we tested the hypothesis that desiccation has a negative effect on prevalence, abundance, and diversity of tardigrades, and thus could alter the trophic structure of their communities. In contrast to what is commonly found for other animal groups in the same type of habitat, we found that tardigrades were more diverse and prevalent in shallower, more desiccation prone, rock pools. Moreover, the trophic structure of tardigrade communities was different among the different pool types. Lastly, we also provide DNA barcodes of the most commonly found taxa. Ultimately, our study demonstrates that tardigrade communities in rock pools provide a valuable model system for the study of abiotic factors influencing meiofauna communities."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169511","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"849","pagesFromTo":"1995-2007","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10750-022-04820-0.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62907581409707780b02f9b4","name":"Sara","lastName":"Calhim","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-9059-2641","documentHash":"fcb1f4c1-2c4b-4e0b-ac71-1dc5d164278d"},{"objectId":"62907581409707780b02f9b2","name":"Claudio","lastName":"Ferrari","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3852-7495","documentHash":"c2c0511c-7e3e-49ed-b71d-5132fc81f76b"},{"objectId":"62907581409707780b02f9b1","name":"Matteo","lastName":"Vecchi","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7995-6827","documentHash":"d1248af6-f272-44b4-a753-db3f243cdb45"},{"objectId":"619db1b87523402fabde7dab","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Stec","uuid":"CFCC0FB89F0A5BD739428683B5D5FC21A2AADAA5539C51D64C09F7A1CE391A8E94F79C749C1845ABCE013345478FBC6A395554E58A60A9DBCA0B45F329959870","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f219356c-8bea-42ca-8241-15967631c87d"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10750-022-04820-0"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Influence

EF are also very important for the effective performance of military tasks including the shooting performance (SP) of soldiers. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of EF with SP and gender differences in the level of these traits among cadets of the General Tadeusz Kosciuszko Military University of Land Forces in Wroclaw i.e., 156 persons (19 females and 137 males). The level of EF and processes related to attention was measured with usage of the Color Trails Test (CTT-1 and CTT-2). SP was assessed on the basis of scores from four different small arms and rifle shootings at a fixed target and at emerging targets. The relations between explained and explanatory variables were assessed using Spearman correlation. The variation in the mean values of CTT scores and SP of men and women was compared using the Mann–Whitney U test for independent samples. The results of the present study did not reveal any significant differences between women and men in the level of EF and SP. The key finding of the present study is that the higher SP of males in all shooting events of the study and of females in pistol shooting were significantly correlated with higher executive functions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169525","journalIssue":{"objectId":"628f17b6409707500aa92e88","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"19","number":"10","doi":"","documentHash":"43db99f9-8490-4a3f-8b7b-a7d4fafe81ce"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"6007","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/10/6007/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"628f15e4409707500aa91288","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Dulnik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8cb4d8d7-fece-4ded-bc5b-f179ca90ba76"},{"objectId":"617a0b297523400564d4b515","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Lachowicz","uuid":"9A649821AB3B16132EA9B7C9915794F15C6BB56F76521ABB9575966BF92D217CBE2969D1DC537217F9BC73C5041C39271E775E76BB810DE6391E9ECE359D6100","orcidId":"0000-0002-6139-7879","documentHash":"68f6b18d-5f04-4295-9f26-b523fce4e92f"},{"objectId":"5e70934d878c28a0473a6e1e","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Lenart","uuid":"1C6E06B50DA1B148AB240AB1DF4F61A2EC05F0572BF995BB2A7033EA024B16E6645422E34CDBDC0493A8F49B31E4E750E7011CF4C9601D45496E83C92D8C4D52","orcidId":"0000-0002-0229-2444","documentHash":"6bbb29e0-9ebb-46a5-b92f-d4a73467740c"},{"objectId":"5e709299878c28a047398bdf","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Jamro","uuid":"1ACCB2418D633DF077DD7D07632ACC5763D443285310E43C57777CAD983AF2635601FC54FB89B5565521328E678F699EAC295AAA99F20FA9A6724D4EEFB67285","orcidId":"0000-0002-8724-2365","documentHash":"0b4f883c-41a8-4b3f-a102-baf159b6a58d"},{"objectId":"5e709222878c28a0473906a5","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Żurek","uuid":"58CA342B4757B8908FDBCE653BAD365381CEE96497CEBD0D35CE8932BBBC5EA2892C859385E891CEFFECAF67AE1542E5D25568506170889F0FDB1B23B30ECE7B","orcidId":"0000-0002-1795-4367","documentHash":"7407c063-ce4d-45bb-88c7-e42b05154aa5"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19106007"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6290e650409707780b06c7b6","doi":null,"title":"Complementarity of Variable Renewable Energy Sources","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-0-323-85527-3","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780323855273/complementarity-of-variable-renewable-energy-sources#book-info","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"77e6b3a1-7d61-4476-84a5-9d5f13d904fb","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb7dc","mniswId":"22600","name":"Elsevier","documentHash":"159aa552-a0f4-4616-8a63-8488cd70979f"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Complementary concentrated solar power-wind hybrid system with thermal storage and ORC","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6290f37f409707780b06f472","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6290f37f409707780b06f473","5e70938d878c28a0473ac971","6290f37f409707780b06f475"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Energy from the Sun is by far the major source of renewable energy and about 1·105 TW reaches the surface of the Earth. As a consequence, it represents the most promising and clean energy for future power generation. Among the different solar technologies, concentrated solar power (CSP) systems are foreseen as a valuable alternative to substitute thermal and electric power generation from fossil fuels. These technologies are able to concentrate sunlight from a large area onto a smaller one by means of optical devices like lenses or mirrors. The concentrated light is then collected using a solar receiver and converted into electric or thermal power depending on the temperature level and the plant scale. At low and medium temperature levels, organic Rankine cycle (ORC) systems are used to convert solar energy into generated power. In turn, wind power is an alternative but complementary source to solar power. It exhibits a greater spatial variability than solar power and also lacks an obvious and predictable daily cycle. As a consequence, the wind power integration into the power system is a significant challenge and with the increase of its capacity events of wind, power curtailment is unavoidable. When discussing both sources simultaneously, we can see that their temporal complementarity, especially from a seasonal perspective, makes them a perfect match for hybrid energy systems. The combination of wind turbines and CSP plants in hybrid renewable energy systems can solve the issues related to grid stability and power reliability from intermittent renewable energy sources and at the same time increase the energy conversion of CSP systems by prolonging their operation also during the nighttime. Therefore, in this chapter, the benefits of the complementary of these technologies are addressed by considering a small-scale hybrid system based on 440 m2 collector area of linear fresnel reflectors, 20 kWe/100 kWth ORC unit, 19 tons latent heat thermal energy storage system, and two 20 kWe wind turbines for the supply of electrical and thermal energy to a small energy community consisting of five residential buildings with four apartments each for three different locations in Poland. The analysis, performed by means of an advanced simulator developed by the authors in MATLAB/ Simulink, allows assessing the performances of the proposed hybrid system compared to the separate operation of wind turbine and CSP+ORC while taking into account the inertia of the different components of the integrated system. In general, the overall energy production increase in the case of hybrid configuration, and the energy demand of the users are satisfied more by renewables (the annual electricity demand coverage increases from 49.1% to 49.7% while the thermal energy demand coverage from 16.9% to almost 22%). Indeed, by storing the excess power from the wind, it is possible to exploit also the low solar radiation by bringing the latent heat thermal energy storage in its melting range and extending its operation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169528","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"377-412","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323855273000054","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6290f37f409707780b06f475","name":"Roberto","lastName":"Tascioni","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ad233869-b06e-419e-b6c7-2d26ea40e4e0"},{"objectId":"6290f37f409707780b06f473","name":"Luca","lastName":"Cioccolanti","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b09432b6-299f-414a-81df-0f52f7cff546"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473ac971","name":"JAKUB","lastName":"JURASZ","uuid":"3081C0BB4F0EF514CA641470481D69226C1945D0CE8203C81138FFD1FEE59B6982FE62D0E55B99F90E1CF83BCF00893EC4A3182F6118376AEF90799544929A42","orcidId":"0000-0001-9576-7877","documentHash":"d2f6e60a-5181-48c7-85de-e78f96276eba"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","uid":"bUD9SiLi4D9CSv6IIg7PEOg","uuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","parentUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","rootUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","name":"Państwowy Instytut Geologiczny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70934a878c28a0473a6a02"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Jurassic–Cretaceous transition in the Transdanubian Range (Hungary): integrated stratigraphy and paleomagnetic study of the Hárskút and Lókút sections","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547903c","mniswId":"15087","title":"Newsletters on Stratigraphy","doi":null,"issn":"0078-0421","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"da6f1315-64e8-403c-a550-e4adea48c028"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61f3b4702467f061bc0e5b8b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602dff119543c7410626e9e3","5e7093f6878c28a0473b4114","61f3b4702467f061bc0e5b8f","61f3b4702467f061bc0e5b90","5e70934a878c28a0473a6a02"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A high-resolution stratigraphic calibration is presented using biostratigraphic (calpionellids, calcareous dinoflagellates, calcareous nannofossils), magnetostratigraphic and chemostratigraphic (δ13C, Al) techniques on the uppermost Jurassic–lowermost Cretaceous sedimentary successions from Hárskút and Lókút in the Bakony Mountains (Transdanubian Range, Hungary). These localities are characterized by noticeably distinct facies developments, despite their geographic proximity. Relatively condensed deposits of early Tithonian–early Valanginian age (ca. 15 m thick; M22r–M13r magnetozones) in the Hárskút succession revealed stratigraphic discontinuities; however, our methodology allowed us to identify hiatuses and condensation levels within the magnetostratigraphic record. The Tithonian–Berriasian boundary, marked by the base of the Alpina calpionellid Subzone, falls in the M19n magnetozone, below the base of the NC0 calcareous nannofossil Zone. In turn, the Berriasian–Valanginian boundary, marked by the base of the Calpionellites darderi calpionellid Subzone, is located in magnetozone M14r, below the base of the NC3 nannofossil Zone. A continuous record of Maiolica-type lower Berriasian limestone is exposed in the Lókút succession, between magneto­zones M21r–M17n. A consistently decreasing lithogenic influx throughout the Tithonian–lower Berriasian is correlated with a Tithonian trend of climate aridization, while elevated upper Berriasian influxes primarily correspond to tectonic activity within the Neotethyan Collision Belt. The demise of the Saccocoma microfacies and the timing of Nannofossil Calcification Events are interpreted as both mutually related to paleoceanographic

problem of freedom of speech caught the attention of thinkers from the very beginning of our civilization, but it was only in the modern age that it became a central issue both in theoretical

Freedom of speech is not only a matter of the individual’s private rights but also one of the fundamental conditions for the proper functioning of the public sphere. The space of mutual communication has gone through extremely dynamic changes in the last decades —we live in the proverbial “global village”, where the possibilities seem unlimited. However, parallel to these possibilities, extremely real threats appear. The aim of my paper is the presentation of the idea of freedom of speech in traditional understanding and describing new challenges.

Little research, however, has examined the consequences of climate change on the distribution patterns of the rich endemic flora of this ecoregion. Climate change can be a major, and undesirable, threat to the various species of the Hyrcanian Forests ecoregion. Therefore, determining suitable habitats for the endemic species from this ecoregion is crucial for their conservation. Populus caspica Bornm, for example, is one of the endemic species of this area. We used the current locations of natural populations of P. caspica to predict the potential habitat range of this species by applying MAXENT algorithm for the present, past (Last Glacial Maximum-Holocene Optimum), and future (2070s) climatic conditions. Our results suggest that the range of the natural habitat of P. caspica expanded during the Holocene, and the present range is wider than that of the past (about 6 ka BP) ages. Climate changes, however, will negatively impact the future habitat range of this species, reducing suitable range by up to 63.46% in the Hyrcanian forests, and only 36.54% of the stable habitats will be retained. These findings can be used to develop an effective conservation strategy for the future. Our models suggest a common priority area in the Eastern part of the Hyrcanian Forests, where the populations of P. caspica are at high risk and should be taken under special protection."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169542","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62907a56409707780b03abb6","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"f09827b4-f167-4573-9727-aef0ebb95d90"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11056-022-09918-w.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62907a56409707780b03abb3","name":"Kambiz","lastName":"Espahbodi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d4f50782-4ff7-4271-8007-416324c92283"},{"objectId":"62907a56409707780b03abb1","name":"Farhad","lastName":"Asadi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"56a33ddb-7e92-4baa-b46b-6dd1edfccfb1"},{"objectId":"62907a56409707780b03abae","name":"Hamed","lastName":"Yousefzadeh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2af08de6-b514-43c9-990c-323e20d36940"},{"objectId":"62907a56409707780b03aba8","name":"Ziaedin","lastName":"Badehian","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2368-6354","documentHash":"0879dfc1-369f-46ef-85fc-6bc139a5803e"},{"objectId":"609badcb9543c73526c48ddc","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Walas","uuid":"E1487E209BFE1859BC19AE81536E570F7441462D7640828646C2A178167548E2FAB950B628D6E3175BF4B9F287E730921BE7B613AC07554C874A38EDD7300CA8","orcidId":"0000-0002-4060-9801","documentHash":"3b7fa0ae-0321-4b2a-ad87-b43027d64501"},{"objectId":"5ffed5c0085dcb0e357dce7f","name":"Shirin","lastName":"Alipour","uuid":"79160FA4D8B555E9B532A0DC6829DB0A10E8E944DA99A07ACEF357FDA745BC5FAC6CE787680C2CCD526B3361B0E0B9A0B422874C54D68AA280A314D8E0CA2B58","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bdeb60c1-6f71-4afe-88ef-f152416a797f"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11056-022-09918-w"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pumpkin seed meal","konjac","maltitol","biscuits","single-factor","orthogonal test"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5f99d94c2467f06b5e42422f","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Sumy National Agrarian University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6294c9214097070db83723d0","6294c9214097070db83723d4","6294c9214097070db83723d5","6294c9214097070db83723cf"]},{"id":"61a5eefe2467f0269e7aadc6","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Hezhou University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6294c9214097070db83723d3","6294c9214097070db83723d4","6294c9214097070db83723d5","6294c9214097070db83723cf"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Development of pumpkin seed meal biscuits","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6294c9214097070db83723cc","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6294c9214097070db83723cf","6294c9214097070db83723d0","6294c9214097070db83723d3","6294c9214097070db83723d4","6294c9214097070db83723d5"]},"issue":"11 (116)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Biscuits are common snacks, which have a wide variety of flavors. With the enhancement of modern health awareness, regular biscuits with high sugar, oil, fat and low protein cannot meet the demand of customers. Customers need more healthy biscuits in the market. In this study, pumpkin seed meal, konjac along with low-gluten wheat powder were used as the main material and maltitol was added as a sweetener to make a kind of healthy biscuits with high protein, high dietary fiber and low sugar. Pumpkin seed meal is a by-product of the oil production from pumpkin seed, which has high protein content. Pumpkin seed protein is composed of albumin, globulin, glutenin, and proline. It contains high-quality protein and necessary amino acids for people. Konjac is rich in dietary fiber, which can promote intestinal peristalsis. Maltitol is a healthy sugar substitute. Both of them have a low calorie level. In this study, the effects of the addition ratio of the main material (low-gluten wheat powder, pumpkin seed meal, and konjac powder), the addition ratio of plant oil and butter, and the addition amount of maltitol on the flavor and hardness of the biscuits were analyzed by a single-factor test. Besides, the orthogonal test was conducted, and the results showed that the optimal formula was the ratio of the main material (low-gluten wheat powder, pumpkin seed meal, and konjac powder) of 2:1:1, the amount of plant oil and butter of 4 % and 12 %, and maltitol amount of 20 %. According to the nutritional determination, the pumpkin seed meal biscuits contain 20.4 % protein, 18.0 % fat, 1.8 % ash, 59.2 % total carbohydrate (including 19.1 % dietary fiber and 40.1 % available carbohydrate), and 0.6 % water"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169551","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6294b38f4097070db83653d3","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"11 (116)","doi":"","documentHash":"b26c593f-33e3-4616-a6ae-56fd8d7feeeb"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"36-42","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/254940/252920","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6294c9214097070db83723d5","name":"Feifei","lastName":"Shang","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7648-9568","documentHash":"2c31bf22-c6a4-448d-b038-34e3816de303"},{"objectId":"6294c9214097070db83723d4","name":"Yan","lastName":"Liu","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6322-7013","documentHash":"d4c67258-9339-4de0-8097-4702d20f2e4c"},{"objectId":"6294c9214097070db83723d3","name":"Zhenhua","lastName":"Duan","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9283-3629","documentHash":"31ba3d8f-0742-495b-ac1a-ce0f2cec2623"},{"objectId":"6294c9214097070db83723d0","name":"Anna","lastName":"Helikh","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3769-1231","documentHash":"629b6933-8357-4102-89e0-0415ec897a93"},{"objectId":"6294c9214097070db83723cf","name":"Dan","lastName":"Gao","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3814-5374","documentHash":"e339a088-a46f-4154-a9af-db487413ef2e"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.254940"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["house dust mite","molds","sensitization","allergen-specific IgE","cross-reactivity","household allergens","Dnipro"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"611dee322467f0578d12d40f","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Oles Honchar Dnipro National University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["628cc2074097074a658ce830","628cc2074097074a658ce82f","628cc2064097074a658ce82a"]},{"id":"628cc2064097074a658ce829","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Municipal Institution of Higher Education «Dnipro Academy of Continuing Education» Dnipropetrovsk Regional Council","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["628cc2074097074a658ce831"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Peculiarities of the etiological spectrum of household allergens","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"61f39d812467f061bc0cb388","mniswId":null,"title":"ScienceRise: Biological Science","doi":null,"issn":"2519-8017","eissn":"2519-8025","websiteLink":"http://journals.uran.ua/sr_bio","metadataSource":"USER","editor":null,"documentHash":"fcf533f0-dc27-433d-98ab-5d5438c80a53"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-07","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"628cc2064097074a658ce827","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["628cc2064097074a658ce82a","628cc2074097074a658ce82f","628cc2074097074a658ce830","628cc2074097074a658ce831"]},"issue":"1(30)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the study was to study the range of substances that cause respiratory sensitization in adults and children living in Dnipro as of 2019.\n\nMaterials and research methods. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to study the serum of venous blood, which determined the specific IgE of up to 9 allergens that are most common in the home. Kits for quantification of allergen-specific IgE from Vitrotest Specific-IgE, Ukraine were used. Conducted allergy diagnosis for 380 people with certain features of allergy history of various types of allergies, who went to the laboratory to specify the etiological root cause of their disease.\n\nResearch results. As a result of the analysis of the received data the distribution of allergens on their prevalence among the population of Dnipro was established. The degree of hypersensitivity to each specific allergen and their ability to cross-react with each other was determined. Among the allergens of the household panel, the most dangerous were allergens of molds, which caused a sensitization reaction in 292 people, which was 76.8 % of all surveyed. The top three (in prevalence) of household allergens included: cat epithelium, which caused sensitization in 125 people (32.9 %) and Derm mite. Farinae, sensitivity to which was found in 117 patients (30.7 %). The share of inadequately strong allergopathological reactions is one third of all examined and prevails in people with sensitization to allergic agents of the household panel such as cat epithelium, Derm mite. Farinae and Derm. Pteronyssinus. Hyperractivity to fungi of the genus Candida and mold has been found in 9–12 % of people. The lowest severity of sensitization was observed in the epithelium of the dog and house dust, and low sensitivity in the reactivity structure of allergopathological reactions was observed for allergens of the epidermal group (down and feathers of poultry) and cockroaches. The development of cross-reactions took place between allergens of epidermal origin: there was a hypersensitivity to the hair and epithelium of dogs and cats (r=0.94, P˂0.01), poultry feathers and cockroaches (r=0.99, P˂0.01). This association of cross-reactions is possible, given the theory of minor and major proteins, and is due to their similarity: the similarity of the inclusion in the allergen structures of specific forms of molecules inherent in both allergic agents that may have allergy-stimulating effects.\n\nConclusions. Cross-linking between several types of related allergens is the best way to further investigate this issue. It makes sense to include in the laboratory study a molecular method for the determination of major and minor proteins in the case of the greatest relationship to determine not only a specific allergen as an etiological factor, but also a specific sensitizing protein that is part of them. This is of great importance for subsequent immunotherapy when the removal of only one (major) protein agent can reduce the risk of susceptibility reactions to several types of allergens"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169552","journalIssue":{"objectId":"628cb9f84097074a658c8670","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"1(30)","doi":"","documentHash":"c18db52e-97ce-401d-bfad-58b1b6318f80"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"8-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/sr_bio/article/download/255390/253343","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"628cc2074097074a658ce831","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Chaus","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6581-6359","documentHash":"dc192683-4df5-437e-8297-36abed9eb828"},{"objectId":"628cc2074097074a658ce830","name":"Olena","lastName":"Snisar","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4940-3922","documentHash":"c79fde0c-e86d-4bf8-9343-ed7ed4502ea1"},{"objectId":"628cc2074097074a658ce82f","name":"Tetiana","lastName":"Turytska","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5333-3453","documentHash":"1c8361b4-e73a-48ce-80d9-0ce9132c3e31"},{"objectId":"628cc2064097074a658ce82a","name":"Svitlana","lastName":"Latsynska","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7080-9866","documentHash":"cf2351e7-a29b-453f-9a9a-d702ade3cc29"}],"doi":"10.15587/2519-8025.2022.255390"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1e4","uid":"bkbp2VYA4xopaIA4HrQlzTQ","uuid":"21621076-b7f2-4bc3-a5a5-e684c8630041","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wydział Inżynierii Lądowej i Geodezji","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709438878c28a0473b85d8","5e709256878c28a047393f80"]},{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61a98f3975234066bac870b1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Urban flood vulnerability assessment in a densely urbanized city using multi-factor analysis and machine learning algorithms","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547990c","mniswId":"19426","title":"Theoretical and Applied Climatology","doi":null,"issn":"0177-798X","eissn":"1434-4483","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"6b8a9ad0-2fe3-46f1-9e91-d7a453ca239b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62909a8a409707780b055311","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62909a8a409707780b055313","62909a8a409707780b055314","5e709438878c28a0473b85d8","5e709256878c28a047393f80","62909a8a409707780b055316","61a98f3975234066bac870b1"]},"issue":"1-2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Flood is considered as the most devastating natural hazards that cause the death of many lives worldwide.

The perfomance of these three methods was assessed in order to select the best method for flood vulnerability mapping in densely urbanized city. Thus, initially, thirteen flood predictors were evaluated using the information gain ratio (IGR), and eight most important predictors were considered from model training and testing. The performance of the applied models and accuracy of the result was evaluated through the area under the curve (AUC) and statistical measures. By using the testing dataset, the result reveals that DLNN (AUC = 0.877) is the more performant model in comparison to ANN (AUC = 0.851) and BLR (AUC = 0.697). However, the BLR model has the lowest predictive capability.

The availability of wind and solar energy is directly linked to meteorological conditions and the two sources show thus a natural variability, but also complementarity. This study provides an analysis of this phenomenon based on the most recent data for the year 2020 provided by all the European electricity transmission system operators. The analysis focuses on the countries where this phenomenon is more evident, which are large enough to play a dominant role for generation and demand in Europe and/or where the wind & solar energy have a higher share in the energy mix, namely France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and United Kingdom. The presented results indicate that patterns of complementarity differ strongly among investigated countries: southern countries produce relatively more power in summer months compared to winter months than the United Kingdom and France. In fact, United Kingdom, Germany, and France have a stronger summer–winter difference in capacity factors of wind and solar than Spain and Italy. From the power system perspective, the resource complementarity might be beneficial assuming the possibility to transfer the surplus of low-carbon electricity via cross-border exchanges. In the summer, when wind resources are slightly worse than in winter, southern European PV generation could be transferred to the north, while the opposite is true in the winter."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169559","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"197-214","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323855273000236","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6290ece9409707780b06e159","name":"Matteo","lastName":"De Felice","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"288044f2-6fef-459d-b28c-da24fc115ebc"},{"objectId":"6290ece9409707780b06e158","name":"Alexander","lastName":"Kies","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2c08a8c9-4314-4042-a7bd-55a031d2e8bf"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473ac971","name":"JAKUB","lastName":"JURASZ","uuid":"3081C0BB4F0EF514CA641470481D69226C1945D0CE8203C81138FFD1FEE59B6982FE62D0E55B99F90E1CF83BCF00893EC4A3182F6118376AEF90799544929A42","orcidId":"0000-0001-9576-7877","documentHash":"d2f6e60a-5181-48c7-85de-e78f96276eba"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ethnopharmacology","pharmacopoeias","antimicrobial","herbal drugs","polyphenols"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709307878c28a0473a17af","5e7091f3878c28a04738d9df"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Gall Nuts Cynips quercusfolii (Linnaeus) and Andricus infectorius (Hartig) as Tannin Raw Materials","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-3417","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ff202409-59bf-494e-82ae-6802b8fb2444"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-10","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629493564097070db834bdd2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65c341c24097074c89d6ed11","63ae09c2409707109b9c19a7","63ae09c2409707109b9c19a8","5e709307878c28a0473a17af","65c341c24097074c89d6ed12","65c341c24097074c89d6ed13","5e7091f3878c28a04738d9df","5e709217878c28a04738fbe3"]},"issue":"10","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The study included gall nuts caused by Cynips quercusfolii collected from Quercus robur and\r\nAndricus infectorius, harvested from Quercus infectoria.

Over the last few years, hundreds of clinical trials have been initiated in a wide panel of indications. Disorders and injuries of the nervous system still remain a challenge for the regenerative medicine. Neural stem cells (NSCs) are the optimal cells for the central nervous system restoration as they can differentiate into mature cells and, most importantly, functional neurons and glial cells. However, their application is limited by multiple factors such as difficult access to source material, limited cells number, problematic, long and expensive cultivation in vitro, and ethical considerations. On the other hand, according to the available clinical databases, most of the registered clinical trials involving cell therapies were carried out with the use of mesenchymal stem/stromal/signalling cells (MSCs) obtained from afterbirth or adult human somatic tissues. MSCs are the multipotent cells which can also differentiate into neuron-like and glia-like cells under proper conditions in vitro; however, their main therapeutic effect is more associated with secretory and supportive properties. MSCs, as a natural component of cell niche, affect the environment through immunomodulation as well as through the secretion of the trophic factors. In this review, we discuss various therapeutic strategies and activated mechanisms related to bilateral MSC–NSC interactions, differentiation of MSCs towards the neural cells (subpopulation of crest-derived cells) under the environmental conditions, bioscaffolds, or co-culture with NSCs by recreating the conditions of the neural cell niche."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169582","journalIssue":{"objectId":"627bb428409707127179188b","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"11","number":"9","doi":null,"documentHash":"f16a366e-2f97-4dc3-8817-200089693ee6"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1464","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/11/9/1464/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64716b2b40e3ff6728fcdc15","name":"Klaudia","lastName":"Radoszkiewicz","uuid":"74221BDD8EB7D14B7D3FC4BCF8ABC869B3DD617C08273D44CB0B7032928EDB0F6D35E5F72A58A743E2031DC6540D1217F7B5972D40C63C84B816A3CBB41E5B88","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"faba2998-e048-4ea4-a914-537c461e3736"},{"objectId":"6290c1a9409707780b05e5c3","name":"Agnieszka

To determine the influence of the winter and summer bee nest temperature (20–22 °C and 35–36 °C, respectively) on the duration of Nosema species development of winter bee generation isolated in hoarding cages, and to trace the life cycle of Nosema species of bees with natural infection and overwintering in natural conditions, from November to the beginning of bee brood rearing (February).\n\nMaterials and methods. For this, 200 bees Apis mellifera sossimai, selected from bee colony in November, were infected by syrup feeding containing Nosema species (5×104 spores per bee). Half of the bees were kept at 35–36 °C and half at 20–22 °C. The stages of Nosema species development were monitored daily for 13 days in midgut smears, stained according to Romanovsky-Giemsa (magnification 900x). Furthermore, with a 15 days frequency, from November to mid-February, 30 bees were selected from 20 bee colonies overwintered in natural conditions, and monitored the stages of Nosema species development at natural infection.\n\nResult. It was found that the Nosema species development of winter bee generation artificially infected by Nosema species, was suspended at meronts and sporonts stages until the 13th day from the moment of infection, regardless of the temperature at which the bees were kept in the experiment.

In the research field of energetic complementarity, metrics and indices allow readers to get a preliminary understanding of the relationship between variables or serve as a base for comparing different data series of one or more renewable sources or regimes at various locations and at different timescales. This chapter provides an overview and formulation of the main metrics and indices employed in the literature for conducting energetic complementarity studies. The reviewed studies show that correlation coefficients (especially Pearson's, Spearman's, and Kendall's) are the most common metric in these studies, mostly because they'd indicate if two time-series exhibit similarity or complementarity characteristics at different timescales. Moreover, as the comprehension of this subject has increased, researchers have employed or proposed other metrics and indices to evaluate additional complementarity features, such as the reliability of generation or the aggregated behavior of more than two variable renewable sources."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169595","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"35-55","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323855273000200","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6290e8e2409707780b06cff8","name":"Guillermo","lastName":"J.Acuña","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0814f4af-e8dd-4b9c-90cf-9861ab720fab"},{"objectId":"6290e8e2409707780b06cff7","name":"Fausto","lastName":"Alfredo  Canales","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"395fe906-cf24-4276-b98e-135027d8dd83"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["attentional control","moderation analysis","focused skin picking","negative affectivity"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","uid":"bhdVW0TkXv39ZSgac65mGnw","uuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","parentUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","rootUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","name":"Uniwersytet Komisji Edukacji Narodowej w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398283","5e70941b878c28a0473b6578"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709316878c28a0473a2a76","5e709470878c28a0473bd03b","6168e7a875234017e053d578"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Negative affectivity moderates the relationship between attentional control and focused skin picking","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","doi":null,"issn":"1661-7827","eissn":"1660-4601","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e236e16e-7430-4ac3-800c-033637860e22"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-14","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629490b74097070db834976f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709292878c28a047398283","5e70941b878c28a0473b6578","5e709470878c28a0473bd03b","6168e7a875234017e053d578","5e709316878c28a0473a2a76"]},"issue":"11","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Very little is known about the cognitive functioning of people with body-focused repetitive behaviours and the few existing studies provide mixed findings. The aim of this study was to investigate the interplay between attentional control, negative affectivity, and focused skin picking. We hypothesized that the control of attention is associated with focused style of skin picking and that this relationship is moderated by negative affectivity. The final sample consisted of 273 non-clinical subjects (79% women) aged 18 to 54 years; study variables were assessed using questionnaires. Moderation analysis was conducted, followed by a simple slope analysis, and the Johnson-Neyman technique was used to probe the interaction effect. We found that at the low level of negative affectivity, the relationship between attentional control and focused skin picking is negative, but not at the higher levels of this trait. Interestingly, when negative affectivity reaches very high intensity, the association between attentional control and skin picking becomes positive. This relationship seems to be quite complex and may depend on the way that cognitive abilities are used by the individual, as well as on the stage of cognitive processing that they are applied to. Further studies using behavioural measures of attention are needed to better understand this issue."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169598","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/299346","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6168e7a875234017e053d578","name":"Rachela","lastName":"Antosz-Rekucka","uuid":"5BDE09DB791D89A751A96140345432971BDE382CE5CF30FE602CCA1CC94ACC4BC3924C5851BB1A9C08D30D5D772F8E9C602B7245654D97D0C12920E19DC77B19","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"52c7a1fb-c0ca-4b23-8165-13f6de0e486d"},{"objectId":"5e709470878c28a0473bd03b","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kłosowska","uuid":"099354663E104C2EC886FF54133AFA0C61FE76C9AD4B09137B722E907859697036AC617C7AD1B21FC510A8D07146F8E5C3F41217C0B2B3410347166833E7C6C8","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3b1a8180-8c2b-4299-a133-897e210037ff"},{"objectId":"5e70941b878c28a0473b6578","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Sznajder","uuid":"9B0E1D5CEBCCB1601E289E783D54DB571D9EFD53105F67627031FDE6E1BA2B9DB4652436BFE9B50324EEF1BCDD315D18EA80A681BAA05620E7A96B84DAFBD2DD","orcidId":"0000-0002-7611-8756","documentHash":"a2d8b389-c874-4c76-974a-eb759ca49e6a"},{"objectId":"5e709316878c28a0473a2a76","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Prochwicz","uuid":"DA01EF0D204FB481BF2A2EBA6A80196B8FCA1984534AB21AC68516FD1D563EFD75244BFF874AFC4E8EB8FC2C7B4C027FF2C98A5FBED5B13C39EA289EFE416E19","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c0a9b417-1c4f-49c6-b736-424b43c33e8c"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398283","name":"Alina","lastName":"Kałużna-Wielobób","uuid":"0C21616E65288069FFF946B91A925F6FCC078DD385865E15E20869037A37E9BFC0A65CE2873A65B1A9151AC825A2911D9F05FA2CCB148284EA63A7CE72491ED2","orcidId":"0000-0002-1921-8822","documentHash":"15929360-9f2c-4af3-af08-3b3a62b6f571"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19116636"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["active screen method","austenitic steel","ion nitriding","plasma potential"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Nitriding of 316L Steel in a Glow Discharge Plasma","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1944","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-24","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629480b94097070db833b31f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709202878c28a04738e837","5e709202878c28a04738e830","5e70943c878c28a0473b8958","5e709202878c28a04738e83b"]},"issue":"Iss.9","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article presents the results of the research on the nitriding process of 316L austenitic steel and the change in surface properties resulting from this process used in medicine, orthopedics, and in fuel cells.

and wormlions are distantly related insect taxa, both digging pits in loose soil and ambushing arthropod prey. Their hunting method, which is rare in the animal kingdom, is a clear example of convergent evolution. There is little research directly comparing the 2 pit-building taxa. Using the same experimental platform to investigate how they respond to biotic and abiotic environmental factors enables an examination of their convergence and its limits. We investigated the response of antlions and wormlions to 3 factors common in their daily life: disturbance to the pits, prey arrival, and conspecific competitors. Although both increased the pit size following disturbance, wormlions increased it faster than antlions. Antlions responded to prey faster than wormlions, but wormlions improved their response time over days. The most diverging response was toward conspecifics. Whereas antlions relocated their pits fast in response to increasing conspecific density, wormlions never relocated. We suggest explanations for the behavioral differences between the taxa. Our results imply that despite the similar hunting method of the 2 taxa they may differ greatly in their behavior, which in turn might have consequences for their habitat use and population dynamics."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169608","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62906bd2409707780b00e111","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"d3c0a97e-3fd7-478b-a290-ea39a32aff49"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"710-719","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1749-4877.12654","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62906bd2409707780b00e10f","name":"Inon","lastName":"SCHARF","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fcbd8a2f-03d8-44b0-affc-2aeaab7b1d54"},{"objectId":"5e709328878c28a0473a3d7f","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Miler","uuid":"18E05A8103307AE916169004274D53958BBA6E5053DD908046E1F67532BB282F8A3B64F5DB5FEC686D29153F7E6B45AB696C1041D37742C51C17BDC37D2D3FB9","orcidId":"0000-0001-7684-0629","documentHash":"43f54d10-4211-4e87-a315-c8ee2078e8e4"}],"doi":"10.1111/1749-4877.12654"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet

Depending on the applied combination of 40 mT and 80 mT magnetic flux density and stimulation time, a progressive or regressive effect of the electromagnetic field was noted. In the case of 40 mT electromagnetic field irrespective of the stimulation time, a significant decrease in the antimicrobial properties of tea tree oil was noted."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169621","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"R.98","pagesFromTo":"152-156","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://pe.org.pl/articles/2022/5/28.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709428878c28a0473b744f","name":"Anna","lastName":"Miernik","uuid":"31DCDF33BEC81675AB62F5DC7FCDC33AB27B639B130BE88074D7AEDAAEDB30C9DEF995F8BB1AB24F59CDBAC8810279788ED57D6BB338661DDFEC2904ADA5ED45","orcidId":"0000-0003-0394-9185","documentHash":"577f8cd9-6780-42f0-bce8-e6bb0c254d83"},{"objectId":"5e7093b3878c28a0473af66d","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Dróżdż","uuid":"262785E5DFF78FDD9E649849AC85A3C6A11C143E6644F7372F9E7801D7DF0433324741787A0038B541E288F2CE45392FD8372573EB1E24DE05FCAE139D5FF86F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6624-9798","documentHash":"00c6a644-f797-4cae-9d6c-f0cbc51d1d15"},{"objectId":"5e709306878c28a0473a154e","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Kiełbasa","uuid":"57DB77AC3D14BADFEE4F770BFBDDD191E2E2873FB2B76BD2B616CF5DC51D80A49229F9243267009DB36E847D0E00FEC3B1F6B50856D3FB6742775A6CAE384A9B","orcidId":"0000-0003-0249-8626","documentHash":"f5cabdba-c7ad-4c30-847b-88fab6fd508f"},{"objectId":"5e709202878c28a04738e7f2","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Szczegielniak","uuid":"BDD23BFADB4EA632588E319E9C653DD5A8E78E635F9AE26C507659739270B29DC547C2B5DEC4428E98E607DA3DA238C788D531C6571B76FF9199A67CC4C99CB2","orcidId":"0000-0002-1864-1135","documentHash":"66025d64-3755-406b-86f4-0cfc633e9b3b"}],"doi":"10.15199/48.2022.05.28"},{"mainLanguageName":null,"keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Tom
