For each train, fiber diameters were chosen at random within the allowed ranges. For each discharge the delay of triggering for each fiber at the end-plate was selected at random from an assumed range. The mean jitter values were calculated, together with the median and 95% quantile.\nResults\n\nThe results suggest that jitter is related to the mean of the individual SFP shifts.\nConclusion\n\nThese findings extend the understanding of reduced jitter measurements using a concentric needle electrode. If more than one fiber forms the peak, then jitter decreases due to averaging of individual time shifts of potentials constituting the peak, rather than due to detection of the SFP with the earliest peak."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526362","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63f60248409707158a884c70","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"52","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"e7b00513-ef71-4211-8118-c21ccd8c342b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"52","pagesFromTo":"252-258","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0987705322000260?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709287878c28a047397482","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Zalewska","uuid":"47DCDBF677EBEAE28478A5C806A782B0CAB3A981264F1DD3C13BBB3EA56ADF53DD4A79150489E5ED94C0BA23A91B19AAC97EFF5150900E7FDE566B91CC99DE42","orcidId":"0000-0002-0926-9976","documentHash":"dd16d4d6-978f-4791-ac74-e5bf3ebf3780"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.neucli.2022.03.006"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["vitiligo","keratinocytes","melanocytes","cell-based therapies","melanogenesis","cell transplantation"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","parentUuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","rootUuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The treatment of vitiligo, which aims at repigmentation, depends both on the clinical characteristics of the disease as well as on molecular markers that may predict the response to treatment. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the clinical evidence for vitiligo cell-based therapies taking into account the required procedures and equipment necessary to carry them out as well as their effectiveness in repigmentation, assessed using the percentage of repigmentation of the treated area. This review was conducted by assessing 55 primary clinical studies published in PubMed and ClinicalTrails.gov between 2000 and 2022. This review concludes that the extent of repigmentation, regardless of the treatment method, is highest in stable localized vitiligo patients. Moreover, therapies that combine more than one cell type, such as melanocytes and keratinocytes, or more than one method of treatment, such as the addition of NV-UVB to another treatment, increase the chances of >90% repigmentation. Lastly, this review concludes that various body parts respond differently to all treatments."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526365","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63eddd484097077b76bea645","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"24","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"3e9b5dce-c0dd-4129-9a8e-ff606c8f05f6"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"3357","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/4/3357/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6407177440970735349c2ed7","name":"Marta","lastName":"Krzyżanowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"551d7f6b-0c1f-4e38-8197-54a70f48648e"},{"objectId":"6407177440970735349c2ed6","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Polak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"afa9bb7e-fff2-40bd-a46f-b69c7735ec19"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b0749","name":"Anna","lastName":"Domaszewska-Szostek","uuid":"D064CB61DBA7DC9F2050FA1862981FC7B682D6A384A888E3CFB9BE724BD0252074317545F61FFB8B8C4DF27392D2F3CFC17684C6EE6D3DCBFF398B6D171D84AD","orcidId":"0000-0002-7672-1838","documentHash":"7fe6765b-f691-45c6-b1da-4b9a98c4ae5d"},{"objectId":"5e7092d8878c28a04739df45","name":"Monika","lastName":"Puzianowska-Kuźnicka","uuid":"11D9DB5B15FBBEC623AC84A2C729C5FC9D79BFAB69EA22AEF87CCE5CFF634F57BD4FD830BDE696B0F4DA325CD96D559F3816751003B8F88DBE621E4B61AFE861","orcidId":"0000-0001-5295-3848","documentHash":"b563ef37-0f1d-432e-9bd3-38f8d92f26a8"},{"objectId":"5e70928a878c28a04739782e","name":"Monika","lastName":"Słupecka-Ziemilska","uuid":"65673DE59033D8557825F260C6F1EED7608F2AF388C3C02DAAD50DACD6A0ADABDACCB893F1DF2B9CF304BF33A5B76A2D296065A4C3D8278DF268AC13A35785B7","orcidId":"0000-0001-8167-5744","documentHash":"b2f249c9-3b96-44bd-b121-a2ee033b41fe"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms24043357"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebee541752340254fc4491c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Zapalenie skóry palca (dermatitis digitalis)","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a110","mniswId":"1001326","title":"Lecznica Dużych Zwierząt","doi":null,"issn":"1895-9024","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e6ab1096-fb8e-4f04-97eb-c58e2ca3c2f1"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"640705c640970770355cff07","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5ebee541752340254fc4491c"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058526367","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"64","pagesFromTo":"49-53","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://bazawiedzy.upwr.edu.pl/info/article/UPWr691ac24313a846b186587df20faf2c18/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebee541752340254fc4491c","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Pyrek","uuid":"519AF70EC7F6660EC0F04DABE440330331CAC0461DBE0677C1908D55B3DB0C330A4140760146543F254FD1105641D08F0E819CB7EE70079FD972222CA5D3BABF","orcidId":"0000-0001-8432-6523","documentHash":"f4a09a15-15b6-48cd-8ac8-2a0e3415eeb6"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ON-OFF electrode;

The strong interactions between the crosslinker disulfide bridges and the gold surface were employed. The shape and morphology of the microgel particles were determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The gel sensitivity to pH was examined using the dynamic light scattering technique (DLS). The impact of pH on electrode processes at the modified Au surface was studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV). It was found that at appropriate pH the microgel particles formed a loose monolayer on the electrode surface, which, in the swollen state, was able to block the transport of negatively charged redox probe to the electrode surface. On the other hand, when the microgels were in the shrunken state, the electrode surface was partially uncovered, and that allowed the redox probe to reach the electrode surface. The anchoring process of the microgels on the Au electrode surface was monitored with a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation technique (QCM-D). The electrochemical properties of the modified with the pH-sensitive microgel layer electrodes were examined in the presence of either positively or negatively charged redox probes using CV and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). It turned out that the electrochemical signals were strongly affected by both: degree of swelling of the microgel and protonation of the carboxylic groups of acrylic acid in the polymer network. The switching of electrode behavior was fully reversible and relatively fast."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526370","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d676a04097075382949398","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"931","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"67271665-6f7e-4601-813c-7ce715006f1c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"931","pagesFromTo":"117183","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1572665723000437?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ec4a2a07523407996eaea64","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Marcisz","uuid":"3AC8A2EB7758A79A38B4C0C30FEA7DD6C77FC795C12A8D205A89B28E9E69C4D9337EA249C9BE5018124C213083A733FBA845F23B06F8ED5D379A7CDB2D120634","orcidId":"0000-0002-5750-3798","documentHash":"452bf34f-4158-48b8-b2d6-985f8e17eaf3"},{"objectId":"5e70936e878c28a0473a9647","name":"Klaudia","lastName":"Kaniewska","uuid":"B9D7F803DA95AC056CFB87D686EB6D61CFF8860BF797E0C1F789933F8D2441CBEBD6C8AEB8BE8FBD6B28A3B9C08D953024CFAB3DBF847717AB317BAA1D47F009","orcidId":"0000-0002-1959-2726","documentHash":"1ed23309-1e75-47c1-a235-5f24a655c02d"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7d7f","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Karbarz","uuid":"118363E187D0019CFEBD4BEEDEEAC60BFC135D719A20DDBD9B1427FAEB8AB4FB005D09F9BD85F823EDB65EDD28CBDEF3885BD2419D9EA7F36934FEF72E0B299D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7813-0513","documentHash":"f5a2e2a3-4a45-461a-8c36-1d28aa08b09a"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jelechem.2023.117183"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"63f8c726409707099276f63a","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"National Museum Institute Janpath","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63f8c726409707099276f639"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Sihr ul Bayan: Awadh Poetry in Delhi Painting (An imperial later Mughal manuscript from the National Museum, New Delhi)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d51878c285145479c5e","mniswId":"200463","title":"Art of the Orient","doi":null,"issn":"2299-811X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":"http://art-of-the-orient.world-art.pl/","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"10d65aae-67f6-4182-a1a3-c05df5504a6f"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63f8c726409707099276f638","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63f8c726409707099276f639"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058526372","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63f8c4c6409707099276e45c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"11","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"ddb0d65e-3486-45f3-a1e8-a9b5fb912056"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"79-92","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.15804/aoto202204","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63f8c726409707099276f639","name":"Savita","lastName":"Kumari","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"098bee45-77a6-4829-8932-b70f78a06ea5"}],"doi":"10.15804/aoto202204"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["oxidative stress","simulated diving","diving physiology","heat shock protein","nitric oxide synthase"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

An initial boundary-value problem is formulated replacing fixed walls of the tank with two orthogonal twin piston-type wavemaker paddle pairs. The proposed equivalent mechanical system may be applied to a class of problems covering irrotational flow of an inviscid and incompressible fluid inside partially-filled rectangular containers exposed to translatory oscillations. An analytical solution to the problem is provided under the assumption of a small-amplitude monochromatic forcing for a classical linear wavemaker in a closed flume and two- and three-dimensional twin wavemaker problems. The model is extended to cover an arbitrary horizontal motion using a semi-analytical approach based on a difference time-marching schemes applied to linearised evolution equations in a spectral domain. This relatively simple conceptual model may be used to design a novel experimental framework for studying water wave mechanics at smaller scales relying on elongated sloshing tanks substituting typical wave flumes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526388","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63f87da34097070992704a73","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"272","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"b39863ce-1524-48cd-86ac-6196fa2b9be4"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"272","pagesFromTo":"113919","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0029801823003037?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d784","name":"MACIEJ","lastName":"PAPROTA","uuid":"37FFEE0C3130F428F8DBF348A689F9A56C9257982FB11B22E54BDC8A0D58860A171A0CA6B164734CC7A740565824912193BE6B680B23E8141EE5744016F99332","orcidId":"0000-0001-6642-2589","documentHash":"7de06888-ef52-4b28-ba0d-cef2984bfb7b"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.oceaneng.2023.113919"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["stress resistance","increases","consumption","expression","support","balance","cells"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091fc878c28a04738e1c9","5e7091fc878c28a04738e1ca"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Chili pepper extends lifespan in a concentration-dependent manner and confers cold resistance on Drosophila melanogaster cohorts by influencing specific metabolic pathways","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477d00","mniswId":"6674","title":"Food and Function","doi":null,"issn":"2042-650X","eissn":"2042-6496","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"0880a7df-16de-4857-af57-ebf2b4f662e3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"640701d040970770355cebd1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["640701d040970770355cebd2","640701d040970770355cebd3","640701d040970770355cebd4","5e7091fc878c28a04738e1c9","5e7091fc878c28a04738e1ca","640701d040970770355cebd5","640701d040970770355cebd6","640701d040970770355cebd7","640701d040970770355cebd8"]},"issue":"15","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Chili powder is a widely used spice with pungent taste, often consumed on a daily basis in several countries. Recent prospective cohort studies showed that the regular use of chili pepper improves healthspan in humans. Indeed, chili pepper fruits contain phenolic substances which are structurally similar to those that show anti-aging properties. The objective of our study was to test whether consumption of chili-supplemented food by the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, would prolong lifespan and in which way this chili-supplemented food affects animal metabolism. Chili powder added to food in concentrations of 0.04%-0.12% significantly extended median lifespan in fruit fly cohorts of both genders by 9% to 13%. However, food supplemented with 3% chili powder shortened lifespan of male cohorts by 9%. Lifespan extension was accompanied by a decrease in age-independent mortality (i.e., death in early ages). The metabolic changes caused by consumption of chili-supplemented food had a pronounced dependence on gender. A characteristic of both fruit fly sexes that ate chili-supplemented food was an increased resistance to cold shock. Flies of both sexes had lower levels of hemolymph glucose when they ate food supplemented with low concentrations of chili powder, as compared with controls. However, males fed on food with 3% chili had lower levels of storage lipids and pyruvate reducing activity of lactate dehydrogenase compared with controls. Females fed on this food showed lower activities of hexokinase and pyruvate kinase, as well as lower ADP/O ratios, compared with control flies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526389","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"8313-8328","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/FO/D2FO00930G","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"640701d040970770355cebd8","name":"Oleh","lastName":"Lushchak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e94527b8-0cae-4048-86ed-78d38a354352"},{"objectId":"640701d040970770355cebd7","name":"Maria M.","lastName":"Bayliak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1a2c93a6-7e04-4225-a987-5912764b339c"},{"objectId":"640701d040970770355cebd6","name":"Kenneth B.","lastName":"Storey","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"34b08944-2dcc-419d-8d85-7e9165979175"},{"objectId":"640701d040970770355cebd5","name":"Nadia I.","lastName":"Burdyliuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5d17e003-771b-45f4-92c4-c152227315d4"},{"objectId":"640701d040970770355cebd4","name":"Olha M.","lastName":"Strilbytska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"14d68306-d7ef-4ad1-bd41-e8cc6af31b38"},{"objectId":"640701d040970770355cebd3","name":"Dmytro V.","lastName":"Gospodaryov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0a79b563-42a3-4daf-a636-b22d3dff981e"},{"objectId":"640701d040970770355cebd2","name":"Uliana V.","lastName":"Semaniuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c13f1294-8fcc-4b48-b6d7-0814b454d781"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e1ca","name":"Anna","lastName":"Sokół-Łętowska","uuid":"2167119824E2D3AAE1FA2F4F610D620EE39EEC5E3A6505E841831E3580AEB90496ADBE642B564A4CE860A00F80431AF8676F47B56F878E60B1CD04C0CEEF1FFB","orcidId":"0000-0003-2785-2791","documentHash":"404a7218-0869-4c78-834f-e7323278a781"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e1c9","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Kucharska","uuid":"649C839F45985ABA91816E2818FD6BFB370778014AF4EC150FC884B75D84D218FC083630C1F79045E78B33D5C42234926D1241506BDD31A0AA2CF1F4D78F5941","orcidId":"0000-0002-2172-0408","documentHash":"d779e36d-bc68-433f-87d2-9a4a77deac65"}],"doi":"10.1039/d2fo00930g"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["klaster energetyczny","OZE","społeczność energetyczna","strategia","zarządzanie"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["energy cluster","energy community","management","renewable energy","strategy"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63f70e004097074c8dc19b88","doi":null,"title":"Zarządzanie firmami rodzinnymi i nierodzinnymi w zmiennym otoczeniu rynkowym","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-7193-915-0","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://bg.pcz.pl/apisnb/book/68319/Zarzadzanie-firmami-rodzinnymi-i-nierodzinnymi-w-zmiennym-otoczeniu-rynkowym","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"e48266b6-125f-4017-b597-1f4f98f5a494","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb892","mniswId":"47700","name":"Politechnika Częstochowska","documentHash":"8192b262-5605-47c7-a362-817d1478d004"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Efektywne tworzenie i zarządzanie społecznościami energetycznymi","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63f714774097074c8dc1d3d8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709203878c28a04738e8d2"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Celem rozdziału było zaprezentowanie koncepcji funkcjonowania społeczności energetycznej na przykładzie klastra energetycznego.

Background: The main source of transmission of Listeria monocytogenes is contaminated food, e.g., fish and meat products and raw fruit and vegetables. The bacteria can remain for 13 years on machines in food processing plants, including fish plants. (2) Methods: A total of 720 swabs were collected from a salmon filleting line. The research material consisted of 62 (8.6%) L. monocytogenes isolates. Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) allowed detecting a pool of persistent strains. All persistent strains (n = 6) and a parallel group of strains collected sporadically (n = 6) were characterized by their ability to invade HT-29 cells, biofilm formation ability, and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of selected disinfectants. (3) Results: Among the obtained isolates, 38 genetically different strains were found, including 6 (15.8%) persistent strains. The serogroup 1/2a-3a represented 28 strains (73.7%), including the persistent ones. There were no significant differences in invasiveness between the persistent and sporadic strains. The persistent strains tolerated higher concentrations of the tested disinfectants, except for iodine-based compounds. The persistent strains initiated the biofilm formation process faster and formed it more intensively. (4) Conclusions: The presence of persistent strains in the food processing environment is a great challenge for producers to ensure consumer safety. This study attempts to elucidate the phenotypic characteristics of persistent L. monocytogenes strains."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526399","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/11/10/1492/pdf?version=1653050940","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a3e0c40970762633a5c20","name":"Eugenia","lastName":"Gospodarek-Komkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"447bbecc-a94f-4639-b89c-ac2e0f29ffe9"},{"objectId":"662a3e0c40970762633a5c1f","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Kraszewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"204603e0-770b-462a-9394-e22a4b02b24d"},{"objectId":"662a3e0c40970762633a5c1e","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Bauza-Kaszewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ddd5afe6-46c3-4b0b-9f5c-5676d3840018"},{"objectId":"662a3e0c40970762633a5c1d","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Bernaciak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c53a9cea-8ba3-4e72-b3d6-65899e27ceaf"},{"objectId":"662a3e0c40970762633a5c1c","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kijewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"17b6753a-1c78-4fe5-8bc5-9bc569be5e20"},{"objectId":"662a3e0c40970762633a5c1b","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Skowron","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cfbcdd9a-04e2-4aac-921e-8371707d0f29"},{"objectId":"662a3e0c40970762633a5c1a","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Wiktorczyk-Kapischke","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"054ab00f-60e4-425a-ba12-6016aed52886"},{"objectId":"5e709241878c28a04739289e","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Wałecka-Zacharska","uuid":"4C0866A11D63EEF40C5E3EB04923EEBDD951B75128A7A89CB0F7A2687162A5A37D60FC88693E590FE315268A3728DDA5C5F8E26A7EAB66C0E50D08471A6FAC67","orcidId":"0000-0002-1840-9731","documentHash":"fb8be2b0-364d-48d7-a102-576213042863"}],"doi":"10.3390/foods11101492"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["edukacja powszechna","egalitaryzm","sensualizm","asocjacjonizm"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mass education","egalitarianism","sensualism","associationism"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63e16c1640970740cdd2c94a","doi":null,"title":"Edukacja a państwo","year":2022,"volume":"IX","isbn":"9788367209182","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://katalogi.bn.org.pl/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma9913166155505606&context=L&vid=48OMNIS_NLOP:48OMNIS_NLOP&lang=pl&search_scope=NLOP_IZ_NZ&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=LibraryCatalog&query=any,contains,edukacja%20a%20pa%C5%84stwo&offset=0","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"f809b303-0d79-49b4-aac0-987bfd3724ad","publisher":{"objectId":"5d77949d878c284eaa45d0ad","mniswId":"69200","name":"Wydawnictwo Libron - Filip Lohner","documentHash":"c4addb9f-e390-4a27-aa52-e41516da9141"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de35","uid":"bbhWY-GzmS7IoRMQpyKKYhw","uuid":"ea6c2a5f-cea7-406c-84ca-cb69452fa94e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de35","parentUuid":"ea6c2a5f-cea7-406c-84ca-cb69452fa94e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de35","rootUuid":"ea6c2a5f-cea7-406c-84ca-cb69452fa94e","name":"Uniwersytet Bielsko-Bialski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709291878c28a0473980eb"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Nadzieje i złudzenia.

UAVs are expected to become a mainstream delivery element by 2040 to address the ever-increasing demand for delivery services. Similarly, UAV-assisted monitoring approaches will automate the inspection process, lowering mission costs, increasing access to remote locations and saving time and energy. Despite the fact that unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are gaining popularity in both military and civilian applications, they have a number of limitations and critical problems that must be addressed in order for missions to be effective. One of the most difficult and time-consuming tasks is charging UAVs. UAVs’ mission length and travel distance are constrained by their low battery endurance. There is a need to study multi-UAV charging systems to overcome battery capacity limitations, allowing UAVs to be used for a variety of services while saving time and human resources. Wired and Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) systems have emerged as viable options to successfully solve this difficulty. In the past, several research surveys have focused on crucial aspects of wireless UAV charging. In this review, we have also examined the most emerging charging techniques for UAVs such as laser power transfer (LPT), distributed laser charging (DLC), simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) and simultaneous light wave information and power transfer (SLIPT). The classification and types of UAVs, as well as various battery charging methods, are all discussed in this paper. We’ve also addressed a number of difficulties and solutions for safe operation. In the final section, we have briefly discussed future research directions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526407","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.13","pagesFromTo":"brak","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-666X/13/6/977","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63f75aed4097074c8dc8d6b9","name":"Hussain","lastName":"AMJAD","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"60b5e257-0f18-4a43-8477-87f091f5f95a"},{"objectId":"63f75aed4097074c8dc8d6b8","name":"Muhammad Asghar","lastName":"KHAN","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b93c911f-5dbc-4509-912a-91c1a58a970c"},{"objectId":"63f75aed4097074c8dc8d6b7","name":"Nawaf Qasem Hamood","lastName":"OTHMAN","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b40050c4-1781-489b-821b-0d1afbb61f55"},{"objectId":"63f75aed4097074c8dc8d6b6","name":"Syed Agha Hassnain","lastName":"MOHSAN","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bab9d216-9643-46cf-9b09-a61032374f9d"},{"objectId":"5e70943c878c28a0473b897a","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Żywiołek","uuid":"196B1CC2E358BAB1484850A659E6DCC56BCC36FECC9A9FD49C67E56A8EE4817A7117AF1D3C2EDF355A7646A076FF5A9726296F13E582E50814390A23836D95EC","orcidId":"0000-0003-0407-0826","documentHash":"42c70dfc-8770-4766-a145-fc0c73dca552"}],"doi":"10.3390/mi13060977"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["lab-on-chip","microfluidics","cell culturing","astrobiology","fungi research","RWV microgravity simulator"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094b6878c28a0473c235c","602f448a9543c7410626f291","5e709274878c28a047395f5a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Lab-on-Chip Culturing System for Fungi—Towards Nanosatellite Missions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-3417","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ff202409-59bf-494e-82ae-6802b8fb2444"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-20","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6406fe4c40970770355cdf27","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["662a381840970762633a2e9a","662a381840970762633a2e9b","602f448a9543c7410626f291","662a381840970762633a2e9c","5e7094b6878c28a0473c235c","5e709274878c28a047395f5a","662a381840970762633a2e9d","662a381840970762633a2e9e"]},"issue":"20","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, a lab-on-chip system dedicated to fungi cultivation in Earth’s gravity and simulated microgravity, being a solution that could be used in future nanosatellite missions, is shown. For the first time, a fully glass lab-on-chip structure enabling the proper environment for cultivation of fungi species—Fusarium culmorum—is presented. Apart from the biological validation of the fungi cultures with the use of the lab-on-chip system, tests were carried out under induced microgravity utilising a Rotary Wall Vessel. Correct functioning of the lab-on-chip system was obtained, enabling the growth of fungi spores both in ground and in simulated microgravity conditions. Interestingly, culturing tests have shown that microgravity stimulates the growth of fungi notably, compared to the ground-based experimentation performed simultaneously. The findings of this study can provide substantial new knowledge on microscopic fungi cultivation in lab-on-chip devices, other soil organisms, as well as a potential behavior of these species in microgravity conditions. Culturing system shown in this work can help mycologists to provide better understanding of microscopic fungi nature and their development mechanisms at a single spore level. This opens the way towards regular usage of microfluidic tools in agriculture and horticulture fields and more importantly, in future research on microscopic fungi in space, e.g., as a part of nanosatellite missions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526415","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/20/10627","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a381840970762633a2e9e","name":"Jan","lastName":"Dziuban","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"88022572-8c6d-4044-845b-41b0a48cbbd8"},{"objectId":"662a381840970762633a2e9d","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Walczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7d6eadc7-6773-4a43-a31a-e6fbc131b4a0"},{"objectId":"662a381840970762633a2e9c","name":"Marcin J.","lastName":"Białas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a70ab739-c42e-4687-bb14-e7134eab2968"},{"objectId":"662a381840970762633a2e9b","name":"Patrycja J.","lastName":"Śniadek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b1138398-807e-464d-81c9-2f52ba134db3"},{"objectId":"662a381840970762633a2e9a","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Podwin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"66f4d9bd-f606-4827-ad8b-223c71273593"},{"objectId":"602f448a9543c7410626f291","name":"Marta","lastName":"Jurga-Zotow","uuid":"D3EA92FEA1DA8D7F2CF4EA646E1AA6922F63F593B4C9347B373E83C994ACAE0F3EB94D0773D4DF4B3780FED688E748D248697B9A828DDAD2FDBA0345158AB0EA","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"903b9a1e-66d7-48fd-9107-6749f39bcc07"},{"objectId":"5e7094b6878c28a0473c235c","name":"Agata","lastName":"Kaczmarek-Pieńczewska","uuid":"3F62CC5C5D54FB09E933C667D0346BDC81505CB070F96A505745041D560DA3AC745E4940D9C3C8A8EE5137685CCC4D09BD723EA1534958B96B28FF1CBA7A2BDB","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d23419a2-8447-43bf-b0a0-6c65121b47e7"},{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a047395f5a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Matkowski","uuid":"F5E3E683D9006945D0ACE14DAC8C9AC37213FD74B001F0C4D13F776C86431560F16AE1C52624886A947D9A3A31859167E6775DF25F6D85ECEE19B919695F7A24","orcidId":"0000-0002-8832-3765","documentHash":"b6ca64b7-aba9-4b2c-a9c6-1427c52cfefb"}],"doi":"10.3390/app122010627"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pride","lexicography","dictionary definition","semantics"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63f52c4d4097075e45d7f770","doi":"10.14746/amup.9788323241416","title":"Superbia : aspekty, efekty, obrzeża","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-232-4140-9","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/309217","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":null,"translationFromPolish":null,"bookProjectNCN":null,"bookProjectFNP":null,"bookProjectNPHR":null,"bookProjectUE":null},"documentHash":"89695e95-858f-457e-923a-f1e4cedbb676","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb8ee","mniswId":"58900","name":"Uniwersytet im.

The main source material consists of semantic descriptions taken from selected twentieth-century dictionaries of the Polish language. Additionally, definitions from representative etymological dictionaries were also used. The analysis of the collected material made it possible to achieve two assumed research goals: the linguistic image of „pride” reflected in the definitions was recreated, and it was also examined whether the semantic description of the name „pride” contains a similar set of meanings in individual dictionaries. The definitions quoted in the article reflect the general meaning of the name „pride”, commonly adopted by the users of the Polish language. Dictionary definitions of the studied name indicate that it denotes a trait and attitude consisting in an inflated sense of self-worth. Lexicographers point out that such feelings towards oneself lead in consequence to disrespectful treatment of other people and considering them as less valuable subjects. The concept of pride is related to valuation, which manifests itself on three levels: 1) the individual positively valorises himself, 2) the individual evaluates other people negatively, 3) society is reluctant to the attitude itself and to those who present it. The collected research material allows us to conclude that the semantics of the individual „pride” has not changed significantly over the years."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526417","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"225-242","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://press.amu.edu.pl/pl/superbia-aspekty-efekty-obrzeza-pdf.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709368878c28a0473a8f35","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Gorlewska","uuid":"E0A20ACB77093788A1FF1176F16E7CDC979BAE00CC839776EA6CBB449B383FB7C49BB1B8500FB55A1B5BABAE2A9E563425B99C056DBAE27FA081976E3B8DEA65","orcidId":"0000-0003-1513-0601","documentHash":"91606de1-21ce-49c0-a085-08b22e57a932"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Molecularly imprinted polymer   Chemosensor","Electroactive polymer","Nanoparticle","Estriol","Electrochemical characterization"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","5e70940c878c28a0473b56a9","616a392975234017e05459f9"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709355878c28a0473a781d","5e709359878c28a0473a7ca0","5e709356878c28a0473a7989"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Synthesis of conducting molecularly imprinted polymer nanoparticles for estriol chemosensing","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796ff","mniswId":"18385","title":"Sensors and Actuators B - Chemical","doi":null,"issn":"0925-4005","eissn":null,"websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/sensors-and-actuators-b-chemical","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"a4a599b0-8904-44b7-8446-b23dd4815dbc"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-04","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63f6039e409707158a88592f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["616a392975234017e05459f9","5e709359878c28a0473a7ca0","5e70940c878c28a0473b56a9","5e709356878c28a0473a7989","5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","5e709355878c28a0473a781d"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Herein, electrochemically active molecularly imprinted polypyrrole nanoparticles (PPy NPs) were synthesized with the aid of micelles. Iron(III) p-toluenesulfonate induced polymerization of pyrrole resulting in the imprinting of estriol in growing NPs. Two separate imprinted NPs were prepared with pristine and derivatized pyrrole monomers. Techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron micro-scopy (TEM), confirmed the synthesis of imprinted PPy NPs of ~60 nm in size. NPs prepared with pristine pyrrole showed an imprinting factor of 4.2, while NPs prepared with derivatized pyrrole showed no imprinting. The electrochemical-based transduction allowed for the determination of estriol in the concentration range of 0.5–5 μM and 10–100 μM with the 0.16 μM limit of detection (LOD). Furthermore, the selectivity of the MIP NP-coated electrode toward estriol and its structural analogs, namely β-estradiol and estrone, was satisfactory."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526419","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63f6039e409707158a885930","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"382","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"bfc230a9-9836-4e96-91c9-c8342234eb03"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"382","pagesFromTo":"133476","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.snb.2023.133476","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"616a392975234017e05459f9","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Korol","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4390-729X","documentHash":"c56f6d8a-e55e-41c0-905f-26a7c11b7cef"},{"objectId":"5e70940c878c28a0473b56a9","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Cieplak","uuid":"313998F60C13F1EFFE27D0DDA66A1486D9766A1EC194DBB6940663D2D674B6CE7EA1E01955BD604B83FB566855B9B102C63F008441135CAC313C98A3228818CD","orcidId":"0000-0002-2663-7259","documentHash":"47e01327-eeee-47cc-9a31-e487fa015ae4"},{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b4246","name":"Piyush","lastName":"Sharma","uuid":"E13DBE297A73F2ACA1DA7F32D373EDA5FB882AC5C4DDE593B81140BAD5BD6DA80677830414B610AFC144957EF4E20FF1A8CC4A4F5367FEC382ACC689DAE8CD18","orcidId":"0000-0002-7729-8314","documentHash":"d3733567-ec08-40ae-9d79-439c8d659f9e"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7ca0","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kisiel-Kwiatek","uuid":"21B7602EE509AB399549AD30B4C92BDD54F0B0EA816BEBC9A9D4465BC6A9EFB1EB45AAD25D59A197AF7A8740B7B7FFCCE7B4087CB2F8E302C64EE64C7B4F3D8D","orcidId":"0000-0002-1605-456X","documentHash":"663fb70f-8442-4d6e-9a73-a6ebdd908a6c"},{"objectId":"5e709356878c28a0473a7989","name":"Agata","lastName":"Michalska-Maksymiuk","uuid":"C59058CB5691F605B03A369B06B6A064DA929757C178E25710B3C7F6EDEDC47597E39AC4244555981D7A44C894C70A56336D5009DD9CB5CDD450DAEE9C673B09","orcidId":"0000-0002-8509-1428","documentHash":"c3e5c242-447b-4ef9-b897-9c5d8441bef2"},{"objectId":"5e709355878c28a0473a781d","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Maksymiuk","uuid":"4940937F0F67C0465181C8086B16A036CB4985EFC60A4F10497E4B5C2971DAD73865B1C1A48B8277D132F7D61BA0239BB903DF854665ACF8B62D660053C8DE0F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3931-3798","documentHash":"48984cb0-bcb4-4429-a40e-df2c1f266b61"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.snb.2023.133476"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-67153-37-9","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Procesy i systemy w zarządzaniu przedsiębiorstwem","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":206,"publicationPlace":"Toruń","translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63f9d13e409707479ab4a84f","editors":[{"objectId":"5e709203878c28a04738e96c","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Kiełtyka","uuid":"A359BC7C9C93F7B35E6F4CE9EF6322286771697B1136FB6F6F2B6B07A3A3527E7BF91471AD2E16C6AF9FA2669C1A20D5B8F93E7D2B4D59CF6392326A0C4F94CC","orcidId":"0000-0001-7551-491X","documentHash":"5fe446e6-937b-4f38-9d8d-cbe105162679"},{"objectId":"5e709203878c28a04738e95c","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Jelonek","uuid":"5DE5473997F08BAABB82C562472A7D957DF21DC2F055F018D2193E5883C7E03C58A5B051D0C74EAC8D1C87D2EA15ACDC0CB1BA4F2FD10678E61E1770DD284D9E","orcidId":"0000-0001-7487-5975","documentHash":"db819541-b964-44bd-8515-c990fb38f7d2"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["5e709203878c28a04738e96c","5e709203878c28a04738e95c"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058526421","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8d0","mniswId":"55800","name":"Towarzystwo Naukowe Organizacji i Kierownictwa.

The development of high-performance electrocatalysts to selectively reduce NO3- wastes into value-added NH3 will open up a different route of NO3- treatment, and impose both environmental and economic impacts on sustainable NH3 synthesis. Transition metal phosphides represent one of the most promising earth-abundant catalysts with impressive electrocatalytic activities. Herein, we report for the first time the electrocatalytic reduction of NO3- using different phases of iron phosphide. Particularly, FeP and Fe2P phases were successfully demonstrated as efficient catalysts for NH3 generation. Detection of the in-situ formed product was achieved using electrooxidation of NH3 to nitrogen (N2) on a Pt electrode. The Fe2P catalyst exhibits the highest Faradaic efficiency (96 %) for NH3 generation with a yield (0.25 mmol h-1 cm - 2 or 2.10 mg h-1 cm-2) at - 0.55 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The recycling tests confirmed that Fe2P and FeP catalysts exhibit excellent stability during the NO3- reduction at - 0.37 V vs. RHE. To get relevant information about the reaction mechanisms and the fundamental origins behind the better performance of Fe2P, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed. These results indicate that the Fe2P phase exhibits excellent performance to be deployed as an efficient noble metal-free catalyst for NH3 generation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526422","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d273c040970773d53f24bb","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"11","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"a1b77882-4071-46fa-b670-e10a4495486b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"109275","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2213343723000143?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63f734af4097074c8dc418df","name":"Saim","lastName":"Emin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a28fb5cd-81ba-4180-9694-f9016c4a1918"},{"objectId":"63f734af4097074c8dc418de","name":"Luis Miguel","lastName":"Azofra","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"491234ad-e074-4502-becc-3964993d2a8a"},{"objectId":"63f734af4097074c8dc418dd","name":"Moussab","lastName":"Harb","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c2c7d40e-e827-4a46-8e8b-1d28b45f30b7"},{"objectId":"63f734af4097074c8dc418dc","name":"Georgi","lastName":"Tyuliev","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9c7844ca-4e10-4457-98b1-58577aa244f0"},{"objectId":"63f734af4097074c8dc418db","name":"Beata","lastName":"Rytelewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5e1a9092-2376-4e18-8062-0e650c70deba"},{"objectId":"63f734af4097074c8dc418da","name":"Manel","lastName":"Machreki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"251d3234-80b4-404a-bbc9-17daa47ba41c"},{"objectId":"63f734af4097074c8dc418d9","name":"Takwa","lastName":"Chouki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"99e81912-379b-41ce-9a6a-9b1804667e87"},{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7bc8","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Rutkowska","uuid":"5527659A084DF9876B638BBB9123FFE838BA262D8041F3B64AD8293383CC00E782FBE7666D88A3120940095B4B1BAB442DF8DCDB855033177D71289AF245554C","orcidId":"0000-0002-8785-8733","documentHash":"f58615f6-e148-4b0e-921a-dd177f80bd89"},{"objectId":"5e709355878c28a0473a772e","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Kulesza","uuid":"F3DB97A54D8898884D698D25C9888598567FF4CE74197B61E03C9D5A6E0C6172AD4DE028197E1DADE6D850F498FAFB7800F993CB79EA32BAC089C512EF8ADFE9","orcidId":"0000-0002-6150-8049","documentHash":"ecbe159e-743e-41b9-ad80-37446458c8b8"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jece.2023.109275"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63f867d840970709926f4697","doi":null,"title":"Lekarz i duchowny na prowincji = Lěkař a duchovní v provincii","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"9788366536647","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"http://katalog.bu.ujd.edu.pl/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?bib=248682","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"c2dde3a8-b5c6-47da-a1b6-91ddac092910","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb8ed","mniswId":"58800","name":"Uniwersytet Humanistyczno-Przyrodniczy im.

The high susceptibility of poultry sperm to cryodamage leads to low fertility rates after cryopreservation. Therefore, the present study aimed at evaluating the effect of including a cryoprotectant, dimethylacetamide (DMA), in the chicken semen freezing extenders at a final concentration of 3%, 6%, or 9% on the post-thawed sperm motility, quality, antioxidant biomarkers, anti-freeze gene expression, and fertilizing ability. Results showed that the total motile sperm, progressivity, and viability were quadratically increased (p < 0.05) in the 6% DMA group. The antioxidant enzyme activity and lipid peroxidation were negatively (p < 0.05) affected by the increase in DMA concentration. Furthermore, some anti-freeze-associated genes such as heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and ras homolog family member A (RHOA) were linearly and quadratically down-regulated (p < 0.05) with the high concentration of DMA.

In the SS-FON considered, the quality of transmission (QoT) of optical signals is degraded due to the inter-core crosstalk (XT) effect occurring in MCFs. To account for the XT impairment when planning lightpath connections, we make use of a reliable QoT model based on the OSNR estimation, in which the XT impairment is integrated with other physical-layer impairments. To model the lightpath planning optimization problem, we develop a novel mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation that incorporates the OSNR model. In addition, we propose an efficient heuristic method that is capable of solving larger instances of the optimization problem considered. The results of numerical experiments indicate the low scalability of the MIP method due to the presence of XT and high effectiveness of the heuristic method. The analysis of three different network topologies and two types of MCFs shows a high impact of XT on network performance and limited performance gains from the presence of the central core in a 7-core MCF."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526434","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"3","pagesFromTo":"467-483","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2673-4001/3/3/25/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709331878c28a0473a4a74","name":"MIROSŁAW","lastName":"KLINKOWSKI","uuid":"F9012996F387DF01CCF9CA7EE99C0C97DBCA2DF20BA8199E87C6306034F4728309F28A4EF0500A02FD5C68103617834DC6CA51F90A6B6928D7504B76C298B144","orcidId":"0000-0002-8375-2827","documentHash":"a5081e84-df54-4f0f-bb73-d6a9d80bef8c"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397f10","name":"Marek","lastName":"Jaworski","uuid":"15E109B50453BC95A60F7C9052586F275944869FB558CB62EC0EF849A7F3605A95F0CB024B2A12E607A7A5EF0664ECC331A8D462B0EAC55857F669F6A720782F","orcidId":"0000-0002-6742-4874","documentHash":"a5bf3592-1e1a-4374-8109-2d14381c770b"}],"doi":"10.3390/telecom3030025"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"9788387275525","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709195878c28a04737f560","uid":"b-QhPpCcUJetk1AqkjBdSkQ","uuid":"07208b1f-4d34-483a-a884-05ac93b6fcec","parentId":"5e709195878c28a04737f560","parentUuid":"07208b1f-4d34-483a-a884-05ac93b6fcec","rootId":"5e709195878c28a04737f560","rootUuid":"07208b1f-4d34-483a-a884-05ac93b6fcec","name":"Uniwersytet Papieski Jana Pawła II w Krakowie","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bf878c28a0473b026c"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"\"Wierzę w Kościół” : „Przymierze Boga z ludźmi” (por.

Roth is one of the most expansive clonal grass species. Despite many publications about its biology, the expansive mechanism of C. epigejos is relatively unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine: I. the dependency between Calamagrostis epigejos ramet density, habitat properties, and the biometric variability of the species; II. the relation between clone architecture and the diversity parameters and the productivity of grassland biocoenoses; III. the expansion strategy of Calamagrostis epigejos within mesic meadows, representing three stages of degradation. The research was conducted in the Central Sudetes (SW Poland). Ten transects were selected for the study, each representing Arrhenatheretalia-type meadows with patches degraded as a result of Calamagrostis epigejos expansion:initial, intermediate, and advanced. The phalanx strategy was observed within the studied range of the Calamagrostis epigejos expansion in the mesic mountain meadows.

To fill this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review and summarized the current state of the art. By addressing research questions, we identified a set of five factors, namely: Perceived Value, Perceived Ease of Use, Managerial Attitudes, Facilitating Conditions and Quality of Information, and specified their inter-relationships.

The key symptoms of ASD include social deficits, verbal and non-verbal communication deficits, and restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities. Dietary patterns have been evidenced to be related to maternal nutritional status that might lead to different metabolic conditions, and maternal metabolic dysfunction has been observed to be associated with ASD. Furthermore growing evidence suggests that the gut microbiota has a role in the pathophysiology of ASD. Differences in composition of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota in children with ASD compared to unaffected siblings and/or healthy unrelated controls have been reported in various studies. The above-mentioned ASD factors and symptoms can be regulated by proper nutrition. The importance of nutrition and its possible impact on ASD patients is key to integral therapy. According to numerous research studies, various nutritional approaches succeeded in reducing the severity of patients' core ASD symptoms. The numerous options for diet that is used in the ASD therapy, as described in the scientific literature, are related to the problem of choosing an appropriate nutritional treatment. Each nutrition programme needs to be personalised and tailored to an individual patient. The aim of the paper is to review the  available literature on dietary interventions in children with ASD and provide up-to-date

The aim of this research was to compare the fruit composition of specific varieties with those grown wild in urban and ecologically clean conditions. Six varieties of elderberry grown on one experimental farm and two wild-growing samples from the city center and the landscape park were assessed. The content of vitamin C, antioxidant activity, sugar and organic acid content, triterpenes and carotenoids was marked in the tested fruits. The analyses show that there were significant differences in the content of the tested ingredients between the varieties tested, while the place of cultivation was of less importance. Apart from organic acids and triterpenes, fruits from wild-growing shrubs were more abundant in other compounds determined.

Differences in particle size, morphology, porosity, but especially in defect structure and in the surface chemical composition of nanoceria had a crucial impact on their reactivity in several environmentally and biologically oriented model reactions. Ceria-catalyzed hydrolysis of two phosphodiester biomolecules (p-NPPC and p-NP-TMP) revealed high phospholipase C and D mimetic activity of all tested materials. On the other hand, the efficiency in degradation of toxic organophosphates (methyl parathion/oxon, agent VX, GD) is highly dependent on the solvent used (water or acetonitrile). Water slows down the degradation rate, but has a strikingly different effect on each ceria sample, which is related to the ceria surface structure and its interaction with the model compound and/or water. Two materials with a significant number of defects and oxygen-containing surface groups also showed highly virucidal properties against enveloped (adenovirus 5) and non-enveloped (human herpes simplex) viruses while having very low cytotoxicity"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526463","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"3485-3501","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2022/en/d2en00173j","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a3d7e40970762633a5655","name":"Pavel","lastName":"Janoš","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f46428b6-50f6-431b-ba6f-428ab59bc73b"},{"objectId":"662a3d7e40970762633a5654","name":"Karel","lastName":"Mazanec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1683536e-a5ed-4bcf-9e3e-d7fb90170d7b"},{"objectId":"662a3d7e40970762633a5653","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Stygar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1856b00d-ca26-41df-9a33-0d45eafd0722"},{"objectId":"662a3d7e40970762633a5652","name":"Petr","lastName":"Ryšánek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"df919c3b-27c6-49a4-8335-16bceff285e2"},{"objectId":"662a3d7e40970762633a5651","name":"Martin","lastName":"Kormunda","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"908da9a2-ec76-45ae-9a43-fdb1f853dc8d"},{"objectId":"662a3d7e40970762633a5650","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Tolasz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f82e76db-1378-465d-a61e-86946ab30bbf"},{"objectId":"662a3d7e40970762633a564f","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Pogorzelska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ca5fdeb9-d82b-4390-aa4e-f6000b238e70"},{"objectId":"662a3d7e40970762633a564e","name":"Zuzana","lastName":"Němečková,","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cfb60ee2-71aa-4f9d-8b9d-a09f017f105b"},{"objectId":"662a3d7e40970762633a564d","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Ederer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bc899f93-a176-4a76-a876-769b00af8398"},{"objectId":"662a3d7e40970762633a564c","name":"Martin","lastName":"Šťastný","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"33bc70b4-b2fc-4762-b58a-79777918e082"},{"objectId":"662a3d7e40970762633a564b","name":"Jiri","lastName":"Henych","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f032cf23-10b9-4247-aadd-f9da3b5eea15"},{"objectId":"5e709235878c28a047391b4a","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Bażanów","uuid":"8C31B251196A4211A269D8C2D031A5CED683E21C2A02A349CD7B8001C142C63767E3E4BC70700079C5B7AADE0926D964287929AD0FD2D24EBEEADA50797F36A2","orcidId":"0000-0002-6694-2872","documentHash":"6008fd52-4fc9-43c3-ab2f-5c7e48f71714"}],"doi":"10.1039/d2en00173j"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Ethnodermatology","Medicinal plants","Healing properties","Human skin diseases","Human environment","Pharmacological activities"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Ethnodermatological use of medicinal plants in India: From ayurvedic formulations to clinical perspectives – A review","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454786a3","mniswId":"11022","title":"Journal of Ethnopharmacology","doi":null,"issn":"0378-8741","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"291d469b-3c7f-4eaa-9fbf-432dce1b1f82"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2021-10-14","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6406f71740970770355cbcd6","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709231878c28a0473916a6","65e82dbe409707626313ba95","65e82dbe409707626313ba96","65e82dbe409707626313ba97","65e82dbe409707626313ba98","65e82dbe409707626313ba99","65e82dbe409707626313ba9a","65e82dbe409707626313ba9b"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Ethnopharmacological relevance\r\nTraditional knowledge is a particular form of practice or skill set that was developed in ancient times and was sustained through generations via the passing of knowledge, essentially confined within a specific tribe, local people, or family lineages. Ethnodermatological use of medicinal plants in India is still a subject to conduct more studies to see if there is chemical, microbiological, and/or clinical evidence, from a scientific perspective, of their effectiveness for those skin disorders. Thus, this review can be the basis for further studies and may provide targets for drug development.\r\n\r\nAim of the study\r\nWe compile and emphasize the most important part of ethnodermatology, namely, traditional knowledge of medicinal plants and their applications for several skin diseases in India. We also include a brief review and explanation on dermatology in Ayurvedic and Unani medicine. We review the pharmacological activity of extracts derived from some of the most cited plants against problem skin diseases as well.\r\n\r\nMaterials and methods\r\nDifferent kinds of key phrases such as “Indian traditional ethnodermatology”, “ethnodermatology”, “ethnobotany”, “skin diseases”, “Ayurveda dermatology”, “pharmacological activity” were searched in online search servers/databases such as Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/), ResearchGate (https://www.researchgate.net/), PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), NISCAIR Online Periodicals Repository (NOPR) (http://nopr.niscair.res.in/). Based upon the analyses of data obtained from 178 articles, we formulated several important findings which are a summary shown in Tables. Tables. A total of 119 records of plants’ uses have been found across India against 39 skin diseases. These are depicted with their localities of report, parts used, and preparation and administration methods against particular skin diseases.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nThe knowledge and utilisation of herbal medicine in the Indian subcontinent has great potential to treat different kinds of human skin disorders. The administration of extracts from most of the plant species used is topical and few only are administrated orally. We also investigated the pharmacological activity of the extracts of the most cited plants against mice, bacterial and fungal pathogens, and human cells.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nComplementary therapy for dermatological problems and treatment remains the main option for millions of people in the Indian subcontinent. This review on the practices of ethnobotanical dermatology in India confirms the belief that their analysis will accelerate the discovery of new, effective therapeutic agents for skin diseases. However, more studies and clinical evidence are still required to determine if the identified species may contribute to skin condition treatment, particularly in atopic eczema. Today, ethnodermatology is a well-accepted international discipline and many new practices have been initiated in numerous countries. We hope this article will further accelerate the development of this area to identify a new generation of natural human skin treatments that will help meet the growing consumer demand for safe, sustainable, and natural treatments. In this context, research on plants utilised in ethnodermatology in India and elsewhere should be intensified."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526465","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"284","pagesFromTo":"1-28","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378874121009739/pdfft?md5=9edd8fad0b440bb70266b5ce2042d205&pid=1-s2.0-S0378874121009739-main.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e82dbe409707626313ba9b","name":"Abhijit","lastName":"Dey","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"34ad7fd9-8895-4bc4-adca-525ff3633b6f"},{"objectId":"65e82dbe409707626313ba9a","name":"Gary J.","lastName":"Loake","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"03784c86-3a7f-4b1f-8586-5d7407c6a168"},{"objectId":"65e82dbe409707626313ba99","name":"Vijay","lastName":"Tripathi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9002298a-58a3-47a6-a14d-32fbe3748b05"},{"objectId":"65e82dbe409707626313ba98","name":"Kumari","lastName":"Sunita","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c2f45b6c-6d21-42e2-a8f2-a6b6f5fc9749"},{"objectId":"65e82dbe409707626313ba97","name":"Samapika","lastName":"Nandy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"09a5763b-67f0-4dd3-862a-90f33f437b79"},{"objectId":"65e82dbe409707626313ba96","name":"Champa Keeya","lastName":"Tudu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1a0f8793-eb8f-4d93-ace6-f358cb29b05f"},{"objectId":"65e82dbe409707626313ba95","name":"Uttpal","lastName":"Anand","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6852ca59-2acc-4992-8ef9-04d17e4178b0"},{"objectId":"5e709231878c28a0473916a6","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Proćków","uuid":"70701C5C678163514436375EF8CAD6D3DB2B353579CDC817CDB9CDC66060DA03F8247EF622FD5202713335D60FD7F634D7DE07E31CA1363A9333A985C3EC803F","orcidId":"0000-0003-4100-3438","documentHash":"3f63635c-e25d-4333-ba43-89dbe7f84a86"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jep.2021.114744"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["accessory organs of the eye","eye tunics","morphology","morphometry","orbit"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709408878c28a0473b51f8","5e709210878c28a04738f653"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Morphological evaluation of the orbit, eye tunics, eyelids, and orbital glands in young and adult aardvarks Orycteropus afer, Pallas, 1766 (Tubulidentata: Orycteropodidae): Similarities and differences with representatives of the Afrotheria clade","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547701d","mniswId":"1104","title":"Anatomical Record","doi":null,"issn":"1932-8486","eissn":"1932-8494","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"c7dab312-50f0-4b7d-9926-e8d333f39ff1"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6407056540970770355cfccc","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709210878c28a04738f653","5e709408878c28a0473b51f8","662a3da240970762633a57c5"]},"issue":"11","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Afrotheria clade includes a large group of extant mammals, and the aardvark (Orycteropus afer) is the only representative of the order Tubulidentata in it.

The obtained samples were analyzed using macroscopic, histological, and histochemical methods. We observed choroidal tapetum lucidum fibrosum in all specimens, which was typical for aardvarks. The superficial gland of the third eyelid was a compound multilobar tubular branched gland of a mucous nature. The deep gland of the third eyelid produced a serous secretion. The seromucous secretion was typical for the lacrimal gland. We compared the morphological data of the O. afer skull with that from other endemic African mammals in the Afrotheria clade. We found that other authors provided different anatomical names for some bones and foramina located within the orbit. The types and function of eyelid glands, as well as eyeball glands of aardvarks, can primarily be connected with their habitat.

Giovanni Paolo Mucante poinformował, że Hieronim Powodowski jakiś czas wcześniej odnalazł pergamin z zapisem nieznanego wówczas w Rzeczpospolitej tekstu Omni die dic Mariae i poprosił kapelmistrza królewskiego (Krzysztofa Klabona) o napisanie do niego muzyki, a następnie dał utwór do druku. Czterogłosowe opracowanie muzyczne tekstu, opatrzone polskim tłumaczeniem Stanisława Grochowskiego i Przecława Mojeckiego, bez wskazania autora muzyki, zostało wydane w Krakowie w 1598 r. Kancjonały staniąteckie zawierają anonimowe zapisy tego utworu, które powstały zapewne przed ukazaniem się druku. W 1601 r. król Zygmunt III wraz z wileńskimi hierarchami Kościoła katolickiego podjęli starania o wprowadzenie przez papieża Klemensa VIII Kazimierza Jagiellończyka do kalendarza rzymskiego, co stanowiłoby jego tzw. kanonizację równoznaczną. Efektem tych działań było brewe Klemensa VIII z 1602 r., które zawierało jedynie zgodę na kult św. Kazimierza w Polsce, na Litwie i w krajach podległych. Na tej podstawie urządzono jednak w 1604 r. w Wilnie uroczystości ku czci św. Kazimierza. Zostały one opisane przez kanonika Grzegorza Święcickiego w wydanym w tym samym roku Theatrum S. Casimiri. W publikacji tej Święcicki zawarł m.in. także tekst Omni die dic Mariae, nazywając go modlitwą ułożoną przez św. Kazimierza i informując, że została ona odnaleziona przy jego grobie. Od tego czasu zaczęły się ukazywać liczne edycje tekstu łacińskiego i jego tłumaczeń oraz nowe opracowania muzyczne określane jako hymn lub modlitwa św. Kazimierza, a często też jako hymn ułożony przez św. Kazimierza. Te publikacje, podobnie jak wydawane żywoty św. Kazimierza czy jego wizerunki, miały służyć rozbudzeniu przygasłego w XVI w. kultu, istotnego dla osiągnięcia celu, jakim było ostateczne uznanie Kazimierza Jagiellończyka za świętego w Kościele powszechnym, o co, jak pokazują przytaczane w artykule dokumenty, Zygmunt III i biskupi wileńscy nadal się starali i co osiągnęli w 1621 r."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In an account of his 1597 stay in Kraków, Giovanni Paolo Mucante reports that Hieronim Powodowski  had  discovered,  sometime  earlier,  a  piece  of  parchment  containing  record  of  a text then unknown in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Omni die dic mariae, and addressed the royal Kapellmeister (Krzysztof Klabon) with a request to set it to music. He then had the work printed. The four-part musical setting, complete with a Polish translation by Stanisław Grochowski and Przecław Mojecki, was published without naming the music composer, in 1598 in Kraków. The ‘Staniątki Cantionals’ include anonymous records of this piece, probably made before it was printed. in 1601, King Sigismund III Vasa and the Vilnius Catholic church hierarchs undertook efforts to have Prince Casimir Jagiellon entered in the Roman calendar, which would be tantamount to the so-called equipollent canonisation. This led to a brief issued by Pope Clement VIII (1602), which, however, only permitted the cult of St Casimir in Poland, Lithuania, and the dependent countries. on this basis, celebrations in honour of St Casimir were organised in Vilnius (1604) and described by canon Grzegorz Święcicki in his Theatrum S. Casimiri, published in the same year. it contains, among others, the text of Omni die dic Mariae, referred to in the Theatrum as a prayer composed by St Casimir himself, with the information that it was found next to his grave. From that time onwards,  numerous  editions  of  the  latin  text  and  its  translations  began  to  appear,  along  with new musical settings variously described as St Casimir’s hymn or prayer, frequently – as a hymn composed by St Casimir. These publications, similarly as printed lives of the saint and his images, served to revive the cult, which had waned to some extent in the sixteenth century. The cult was important for the aim of having Prince Casimir eventually named as a  saint  of  the  universal  Church,  which,  as  demonstrated  by  the  documents  quoted  in  this  paper, continued to be the subject of king Sigismund III’s and the Vilnius bishops’ efforts, eventually crowned with success in 1621."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526469","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ef71584097075fda42a9e9","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"67","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"fdde8d5d-03c4-4eff-b163-fe09dd8f373d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"67","pagesFromTo":"3-32","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"The Hymn Omni die dic Mariae in the Context o Early Seventeenth-Century Efforts to Canonise Prince Casimir Jagiellon"}],"publicUri":"https://czasopisma.ispan.pl/index.php/m/article/view/1400","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"646dd8b0409707704049e052","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Jarmiński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"05983cbf-f181-4f89-a974-a4edae97ca46"},{"objectId":"5e709236878c28a047391c8b","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Przybyszewska-Jarmińska","uuid":"51F728642F3448D86D72E97E932DC488E433B6B92116C58E670907E1F5CA2F5028B78E2ACF8E3BD56B178A260BD54F98C7B81A0BE97D86C20A44092BD9270436","orcidId":"0000-0002-9625-7366","documentHash":"bf3d258a-35f9-4a07-95d0-065626555d9a"}],"doi":"10.36744/m.1400"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6364f3d04097070e8728a5d7","doi":null,"title":"Ochrona dóbr kultury w sytuacjach kryzysowych i konfliktach zbrojnych","year":2022,"volume":"1","isbn":"978-83-963739-7-7","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://katalogi.bn.org.pl/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma991053018957805066&context=L&vid=48OMNIS_NLOP:48OMNIS_NLOP&lang=pl&search_scope=NLOP_IZ_NZ&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&isFrbr=true&tab=LibraryCatalog&query=any,contains,978-83-963739-7-7&offset=0","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"36b1d5c7-5600-49f4-a34e-968de94dd91e","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb777","mniswId":"11200","name":"Akademia Marynarki Wojennej im.

One of\r\nthe more common are Collembola, which play an important role in suppressing soil-borne pathogens such as Fusarium spp. Here, Folsomia candida was taken for laboratory studies. The aim of the study was to assess whether springtails influence the growth of wheat and pea plants. The purpose was also to evaluate whether Collembola will reduce the occurrence of fungal diseases, presumably by feeding on fungi. The factors tested were (1) wheat grown individually or in the mixture with pea; (2) number of Collembola; and (3) the pathogenic presence of the plant fungus Fusarium culmorum.The experiment was carried out in four replicates for each treatment in two series. The soil used for the test was a mixture of field soil, sand, and peat. The following analyses were performed: measuring plant growth and decomposition rate, assessment of plant infection, and assessment of F. culmorum in springtails bodies. There was no effect of F. culmorum infection on plant growth, although the pathogen was present in the root neck of the plants incubated with this fungus. Collembola decreased\r\nthe number of fungus colonies isolated from plants by about 45% in comparison to pots incubated without these organisms. The decomposition of plant biomass was accelerated by springtails by about 7% in the pots with moderate Collembola number. However, this was not related to improved\r\nplant growth. Additionally, F. culmorum was isolated from the bodies of Collembola, indicating its ability to feed on this fungus. To conclude, it was found that Collembola can decrease pathogenic fungal growth. This issue needs further studies in relation to other plants and fungus species, as well to study observed effects in the field conditions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526474","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/7/1599/pdf?version=1656682419","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602f448a9543c7410626f291","name":"Marta","lastName":"Jurga-Zotow","uuid":"D3EA92FEA1DA8D7F2CF4EA646E1AA6922F63F593B4C9347B373E83C994ACAE0F3EB94D0773D4DF4B3780FED688E748D248697B9A828DDAD2FDBA0345158AB0EA","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"903b9a1e-66d7-48fd-9107-6749f39bcc07"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bde3a","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Gruss","uuid":"F73745DE431BDEDFB17DC82C09FA52BD7D0C9697874B20116A450F43E344255F40EC3380C81E4B164FCE5116E3F923FAC20737FB792481F654EA391F813BFD18","orcidId":"0000-0002-3562-5962","documentHash":"e1e502e0-d360-4f46-b74f-f38fa4ef0e04"},{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a047395f5a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Matkowski","uuid":"F5E3E683D9006945D0ACE14DAC8C9AC37213FD74B001F0C4D13F776C86431560F16AE1C52624886A947D9A3A31859167E6775DF25F6D85ECEE19B919695F7A24","orcidId":"0000-0002-8832-3765","documentHash":"b6ca64b7-aba9-4b2c-a9c6-1427c52cfefb"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e1ed","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Twardowski","uuid":"9490111A29C1724E589D126A5DDEB7EE1694D859F869A4C0734A32D75877E0191CCE94E4F1CB5EAC283CAEBAE2E3713B8E5216ACE10513425AB08AA067375384","orcidId":"0000-0003-2412-8992","documentHash":"a03035f0-dff2-467a-9a0d-b7dc558c0e07"}],"doi":"10.3390/agronomy12071599"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["risksocial","social resilience","local safety","prevention","components of social resilience"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df08","uid":"bkIJHJpQNKsrvtM8Wh9DD9w","uuid":"62b1bfdd-fc86-44b6-8f44-098cdc87f941","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df08","parentUuid":"62b1bfdd-fc86-44b6-8f44-098cdc87f941","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df08","rootUuid":"62b1bfdd-fc86-44b6-8f44-098cdc87f941","name":"Akademia Pożarnicza","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61a83db87523402fabe26cf3"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"AN ORIGINAL CONCEPT OF MEASURING COMMUNITY RISK BY BUILDING SOCIAL RESILIENCE","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"61b9abfaad204581b62ebafd","mniswId":"201143","title":"Zeszyty Naukowe SGSP","doi":null,"issn":"0239-5223","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"3c49c206-084e-4c9f-b620-eba5a938f579"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"DECEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6407137540970735349bd13f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61a83db87523402fabe26cf3"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"An element that can influence the actual value of risk is social resilience, however, the value of\nthe impact of the main components of social resilience on risk is not known.

A","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Loess landscapes are highly susceptible to soil redeposition processes and thus may provide detailed insights into the record of denudation processes. Using optically stimulated luminescence dating and the soil micromorphology of 12 soil profiles, we reconstructed a complete record of denudation processes in south-western Poland. The first episode of soil redeposition took place around 9.1 ka. The denudation events that followed were attributed to the Neolithic (6.4 ± 0.3 ka), early Bronze Age (3.8 ± 0.2 ka), early and late Middle Ages (1.5 ± 0.1 ka and 0.7 ± 0.03 ka, respectively) and early Modern (0.4 ± 0.02 ka). As a consequence of the denudation processes, the soil cover in the studied area had been strongly reshaped. The predominant Luvisols had experienced progressive erosion processes that led first to a significant shallowing of the eluvial and argic horizons (truncated Luvisol) and, after some time, to their complete removal. Further thinning of the loess mantles had exposed geological substrates with very weak pedogenic alternations, thus pushing their transformation towards Regosol types. Similarly, Regosols occurred in toeslopes where freshly eroded material had been deposited, and where diagnostic horizons had not yet developed. Modern soil erosion rates in the studied loess area have considerably increased, and it is estimated that the Luvisol status may be completely transformed within approximately 80–300 years, if not sooner, due to progressive climate change."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526484","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"220","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S034181622200710X","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a374040970762633a27c1","name":"Manfred","lastName":"Frechen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"034b9747-5036-46d1-9f31-96a10386853d"},{"objectId":"662a374040970762633a27c0","name":"Marek","lastName":"Kasprzak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"30ea324c-7d0a-4a5b-8032-ac66b85b6d35"},{"objectId":"662a374040970762633a27bf","name":"Sumiko","lastName":"Tsukamoto","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5b893959-92ef-4f39-863e-425ef307e9a2"},{"objectId":"662a374040970762633a27be","name":"Junjie","lastName":"Zhang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cccd3aca-c1f4-4fbc-bab8-426b40b2e991"},{"objectId":"662a374040970762633a27bd","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Loba","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"205aa8b4-7c7a-4a2c-aab4-2f5608ae5a2f"},{"objectId":"5ed719637523404d1000e8ca","name":"JOANNA","lastName":"KOWALSKA","uuid":"AB8F919D82AB85AA3476A535E95E4A20444CF4CFA2A7134B9F4759C28AD7BA914FDE86412FECDB45718022748B4EB33C15F3ED3EC0E6116778A059A0B27B68BB","orcidId":"0000-0002-4086-5696","documentHash":"9be08dac-63ca-4700-8150-89fda6085a3c"},{"objectId":"5e709360878c28a0473a8601","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Waroszewski","uuid":"1D8D7BE0C3C4C6E1F0A8D9BE9CDAFD7ABA5968B6661C3A1279786001166DD6CD451A48A4B247E754EE83DD72A5054D3E4253916C5EFE19006EA37C54BF7704B5","orcidId":"0000-0002-3064-4232","documentHash":"8db5b334-1575-4cd7-85c7-ac99a8b0f0b5"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.catena.2022.106724"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["agricultural vehicle","tire deformation","radial tire","bias-ply tire","contact area","3D scanning"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602f3bab9543c7410626f237","5e709273878c28a047395e14","662a37d240970762633a2c85","5e7091fc878c28a04738e2b9","5e709407878c28a0473b510c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Evaluation of Agriculture Tires Deformation Using Innovative 3D Scanning Method","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d1","mniswId":"675","title":"Agriculture (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2077-0472","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"fb8db9b6-d4d7-498a-b26c-2119c1ad43da"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-27","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6406fe5940970770355cdf60","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602f3bab9543c7410626f237","5e709273878c28a047395e14","5e709407878c28a0473b510c","5e7091fc878c28a04738e2b9","662a37d240970762633a2c85"]},"issue":"8","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study presents the results of research related to agriculture tire deformation under variable vertical load and inflation pressure. The research objects were two tires of the same size and different internal structures. Three levels of inflation pressure and five levels of vertical load were used. The loaded tire with each inflation pressure was scanned using the 3D scanner—the effect of this operation was a three-dimensional image of a tire part (near the place of contact with the surface). The next step was the creation of vertical and horizontal cross-sections of the tire profile, which allowed the analysis of tested parameters: profile height, location of the point of maximum tire deflection, the width of the tire profile, and the area of horizontal cross-sections. Finally, the mathematical model was formulated, describing contact areas of horizontal cross-sections as a function of the factors. Based on the conducted research, it was stated that an increase in vertical load caused reductions in both types of heights. Moreover, the width of tire profiles and the area of horizontal cross-sections increased due to the increase in vertical load (for bias-ply, increases were smaller than for radial tires). Similar changes were observed after the reduction of inflation pressure."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526486","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/12/8/1108/pdf?version=1658990089","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a37d240970762633a2c85","name":"Agata","lastName":"Małecka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0bb02240-c29e-4ba9-9ef0-91cc3e6a2388"},{"objectId":"602f3bab9543c7410626f237","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Ptak","uuid":"7BCC3F50F85C0EB31632B44F7822CAF89AD3FE6CF9B8765D6F7F5F5CD3666378475DA9F1C0D2FDABC3C0065458AA5E96F03AD6239048D7187F0BAE086E3CAABC","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"597d4111-162c-477c-8ea4-66d31500ad92"},{"objectId":"5e709407878c28a0473b510c","name":"Marek","lastName":"Brennensthul","uuid":"34CD89AA510ED9A7EF753A2906A856E533C0D17D0170156745752B8C1FDC2411BE43C0F480A2AEE394584C75FF96026396F9733A63C09DA115E7A136BB2FF3B0","orcidId":"0000-0003-4964-482X","documentHash":"48cb4bdd-c2ce-4e39-a1b4-eab944ccfb42"},{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395e14","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Czarnecki","uuid":"08C2A4755B5F7AAC902CCE04544F34F77F32A456546850FFA163DD79214A6155C58D24D7DCF649CB1C1032E12BB0F66BF0B79692463F500F27E26E75F089978D","orcidId":"0000-0001-7086-1525","documentHash":"8e90f8cf-dcdc-4451-9593-af4d9dcfd441"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e2b9","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Lejman","uuid":"0F148B143432B12E4C4D6B30370C0C455D138A9688EAC5AD5FA693B984912BD12C3C56AE59DB734AFBF99B6D71DAF4F889BEF3A7E497A7686B95679F684B0A5A","orcidId":"0000-0002-7223-6595","documentHash":"a0ae3900-f081-41b1-b634-ad482e99327e"}],"doi":"10.3390/agriculture12081108"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["upbringing","stereotypes","antisemitism"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","uid":"bGA_QwQGoDNg-6MMEBxlWNQ","uuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","parentUuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","rootUuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","name":"Akademia Marynarki Wojennej im.

Currently, work is underway on the genetic modification of flax fibers to improve their properties. Genetic modifications have resulted in an increased content of antioxidants and more favorable mechanical properties. The works published so far have presented independent tests of fibers and dressings after appropriate technological treatments in cell cultures. This study aimed to compare the properties of the fibers and the dressing produced in cell cultures—hamster fibroblasts—V79. The research material was traditional NIKE fibers; genetically modified M, B, and MB fibers; and linen dressings obtained from these fibers. The extract from 48-h incubation of 40 mg of fiber in the culture medium, which was desolved into 10, 20, and 30 mg, was administered to the cell culture. On the other hand, a linen dressing was placed on cells with an area of 0.5 cm2, 1 cm2, 1.5 cm2, and 2 cm2. Cells with fiber or dressing were incubated for 48 h, and then, biological tests were performed, including cell viability (in propidium iodide staining), cell proliferation (in the SRB assay), evaluation of the intracellular free radical level (in the DCF-DA assay), genotoxicity (in the comet assay), assessment of the apoptotic and necrotic cells (in staining anexin-V and iodide propidium), the course of the cell cycle, and the scratch test. The correlation between apoptosis and genotoxicity and the levels of free radicals and genotoxicity were determined for the tested linen fibers and fabrics. The tests presented that the fibers are characterized by the ability to eliminate damaged cells in the elimination phase. However, the obtained fabrics gain different properties during the technological processing of the fibers into linen dressings. Linen fabrics have better regenerative properties for cells than fibers. The linseed dressing made of MB fiber has the most favorable regenerative properties.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526491","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"art.10480 [22 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/18/10480/htm","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630bd594097076263e72bf5","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Gębarowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"90c2c2d8-0282-4557-9cf8-e2f367a0eb21"},{"objectId":"5e709390878c28a0473acfae","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Jęśkowiak-Kossakowska","uuid":"46AB97FE304B6ACD16832CFDD8129557708F8B0DCE4D9BE8E90830C809907ED2B70EBE56FE33D491F8337730E28B791981B0ADF9F033BDEFE2D3A45366D8740A","orcidId":"0000-0002-8829-4482","documentHash":"5944ba74-d4eb-4010-830d-3eaaf7a2eb4e"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398df3","name":"Benita","lastName":"Wiatrak","uuid":"15B10EC052D1999E98426EE856EC5E778993B5E37DE32980441D40DABD0E5B80EDF18CEB00D591C7A791684F74B9E0D4213F23D2AD58A5F03B9DA80052D1EFDA","orcidId":"0000-0002-1404-2274","documentHash":"1e070791-706d-4bdd-8d0f-a10a4a576fdd"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms231810480"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Cypr","Żydzi","Józef Nasi","Imperium Osmańskie","Wenecja"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cyprus","Jews"," Joseph Nasi"," Ottoman Empire","Venice"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709195878c28a04737f49e","uid":"bXY_DMagKuf8Wt0-tVB5Guw","uuid":"f39171b5-f192-4064-bc1b-c5c84006a634","parentId":"5e709195878c28a04737f49e","parentUuid":"f39171b5-f192-4064-bc1b-c5c84006a634","rootId":"5e709195878c28a04737f49e","rootUuid":"f39171b5-f192-4064-bc1b-c5c84006a634","name":"Uniwersytet Ignatianum w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b7878c28a0473afa39"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Cypryjska Ziemia Obiecana.

Suspensory ligament damage is a major cause of lameness in sports horses. The suspensory ligament is a very strong anatomical structure – an average force of 1338 kg is needed to damage the suspensory apparatus.

Growing scientific evidence suggests that merging ethnic knowledge with new scientific findings can lead to socially acceptable and environmentally friendly approaches essential for the long-term prosperity of local communities. In the high-altitude region, where livestock raising is a key income source, and plant-based utilization for ethno-veterinary practices is widely practiced. In this context, this study was conducted with the aim of documenting the ethno-veterinary use of plant resources in different bio-geographical regions of Jammu and Kashmir's Himalayas (J & KH). Semi-structured interviews and group discussions were used to collect information. Principal component analysis (PCA) and Pearson correlation were conducted to analyze the data. We documented 148 species from 53 families that locals used for various purposes: medicine, fodder, tonic, antidote, magic, and also used to protect themselves from ectoparasite such as Pediculus humanus capitis by the local inhabitants. There were significant differences in the relative usage of plant resources across the three biogeographic regions. Comparatively, the highest number (41%) of plant species were used for ethnoveterinary in the Jammu region, while the lowest number (28%) of species were used in Kashmir. Across the regions, Kashmir and Jammu had the highest level of species similarity (17%), while Jammu and Ladakh had the lowest (1%). A cross-regional assessment of plant resources revealed that 18% of plants were shared among the regions. The reported use of Amaranthus blitum, Morus alba, Ficus palmata, Vitex negundo, Juniperus semiglobosa, Ulmus wallichiana, and Rumex nepalensis are novel for the ethno-veterinary uses of this part of the Himalayan region. The various dry unique traditional fodder preparations (gaaslov, gass khor, pan baath, kaandbaath, Lovgooad, Karb, and Phungma) from plant resources are reported for the first time from the Himalayan region and can be ascribed to the novelty of this study. Plant resources were not only a source of fodder and medicine but also presented themselves as an opportunity for livelihood generation. Therefore, our findings bridge the knowledge gap by documenting key ethnoveterinary applications of native plant species from the study region that are used to cure livestock diseases and disorders by the mountain inhabitants."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526503","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"9","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2022.944046/full","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e82ddb409707626313bcb5","name":"Antonio","lastName":"Morales de la Nuez","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"35eb91a9-bbe1-4991-8ec4-22aed85d1f89"},{"objectId":"65e82ddb409707626313bcb4","name":"José M Pérez ","lastName":"de la Lastra ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3114dfd5-4c13-4f4c-9a13-8f34c6397f36"},{"objectId":"65e82ddb409707626313bcb3","name":"Eduardo","lastName":"Soares Calixto","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f8204053-6d1e-455d-9e3a-836e95675b4d"},{"objectId":"65e82ddb409707626313bcb2","name":"Rainer Willi","lastName":"Bussmann","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"75501fca-7ddb-4e43-bf12-7b1bca3365df"},{"objectId":"65e82ddb409707626313bcb1","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Waheed","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8f6d8326-e5da-441d-9e41-9e8d5446383e"},{"objectId":"65e82ddb409707626313bcb0","name":"Riyaz","lastName":"Ahmad","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ed149e33-b7d0-4118-a40b-f974f8aab48a"},{"objectId":"65e82ddb409707626313bcaf","name":"Musheerul","lastName":"Hassan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"00694cac-01ff-4585-92fc-591a22340bb8"},{"objectId":"65e82ddb409707626313bcae","name":"Muhammad Shoaib","lastName":"Amjad","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"99b9d8dc-5d91-4343-a55e-79520232ac18"},{"objectId":"65e82ddb409707626313bcad","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Majeed","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4f11d78d-a71a-499b-810c-de7fa3a63fa3"},{"objectId":"65e82ddb409707626313bcac","name":"Umer","lastName":"Yaqoob","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cfe8dbab-ef4c-4222-b4a5-d2201c6f172e"},{"objectId":"65e82ddb409707626313bcab","name":"Shiekh Marifatul","lastName":"Haq","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6003f967-f495-499d-87ef-2070eb7d1d3a"},{"objectId":"5e709231878c28a0473916a6","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Proćków","uuid":"70701C5C678163514436375EF8CAD6D3DB2B353579CDC817CDB9CDC66060DA03F8247EF622FD5202713335D60FD7F634D7DE07E31CA1363A9333A985C3EC803F","orcidId":"0000-0003-4100-3438","documentHash":"3f63635c-e25d-4333-ba43-89dbe7f84a86"}],"doi":"10.3389/fvets.2022.944046"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["naringenin","naringenin derivatives","antimicrobial activity","anti-inflammatory activity","antioxidant activity","antifungal activity"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

It has a wide range of pharmacological and biological effects beneficial to human health. Its antioxidant, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, antifungal and antimicrobial activity is frequently reported in scientific literature. In this review we presented the current state of knowledge on the antimicrobial activity of naringenin and its natural and synthetic derivatives as a phytobiotic against resistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as fungi in humans. Most of the data reported here have been obtained from in vitro or in vivo studies. Over the past few years, due to the overuse of antibiotics, the occurrence of bacteria resistant to all available antibiotics has been growing. Therefore, the main focus here is on antibiotic resistant strains, which are a significant, worldwide problem in the treatment of infectious diseases. The situation is so alarming that the WHO has listed microbial resistance to drugs on the list of the 10 most important health problems facing humanity. In addition, based on scientific reports from recent years, we described the potential molecular mechanism of action of these bioflavonoids against pathogenic strains of microorganisms. As plant-derived substances have been pushed out of use with the beginning of the antibiotic era, we hope that this review will contribute to their return as alternative methods of preventing and treating infections in the epoch of drug resistance."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526505","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"art.1628 [22 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6382/11/11/1628","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630c8fe4097076263e7ce87","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kozłowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9ef31e24-a51f-4a5a-9c0a-7a9a44ef14fb"},{"objectId":"6630c8fe4097076263e7ce86","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Szymańska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f897bbaa-019d-4f0d-a81b-61976aca5fc9"},{"objectId":"6630c8fe4097076263e7ce85","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Sobieraj","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"58d5e339-acc4-4854-8ee4-91ad80ac0bec"},{"objectId":"6630c8fe4097076263e7ce84","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Stecko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"05558dbc-e58a-4fa3-b580-bb4228196510"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a12e4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Duda-Madej","uuid":"3C6469857A9ED0355051163521948C95EAEB974D4E0ACD3C6E2E7C7F0D64A04C0022E8BBEEEC0418DD1AB3F4F9E30F7C927DCA0E49141EAD9A08E841A6B85654","orcidId":"0000-0001-8559-1695","documentHash":"732a5ebd-f75b-45c6-b9ac-2eb76d581a3e"}],"doi":"10.3390/antibiotics11111628"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["methanolic plant extracts","black nightshade","biological activity","chemoprevention","LC-MS","MS","flavonoids","steroidal glycoalkaloids","solanine","Solanaceae"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Nine Holstein Friesian bulls, 3.5 years old, of known health status, were used for the study. The animals were kept and fed equally. Semen was collected once a week using an artificial vagina. The commercially available Holothuroidea extract was used as a supplement to the commercial extender (0, 2, 4 and 6 µL/mL) before the freezing/thawing process. The viability, motility, motion parameters, and acrosome integrity of the sperm were analyzed with (test) or without (control) extract samples. Furthermore, the concentration of the proAKAP4 biomarker in frozen sperm was assessed. It was shown that the addition of 4 and 6 µL of the extract may have a positive effect on the quality parameters of the sperm after thawing. The results indicate that extender supplementation with the above extract modulates (increases) the concentration of proAKAP4 in sperm at all tested levels. Additionally, this indicator has become helpful in identifying sperm of poor biological quality. Moreover, it has been proven that the proAKAP4 biomarker can be successfully used to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of various extenders for semen cryopreservation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526513","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/12/4/521/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a486140970762633a758d","name":"Anna","lastName":"Bubel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a8c1bf09-58f4-4a22-9eb7-4cf33a9a1df3"},{"objectId":"662a486140970762633a758c","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Gałęska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0e9660d7-f479-4e80-91ef-a0b9fbba45c5"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6cb0","name":"ALICJA","lastName":"KOWALCZYK","uuid":"C705216E59FBAAFF2A7C88BB52B61ED0953F96BE8F409A91F245C381B4D326994B9DCAD17731D944FF8827468890DDB642B964255EF2DAF115CB1F0912FEDB35","orcidId":"0000-0003-1908-2942","documentHash":"bcfe947d-bb6d-4d1f-9007-b5865024847a"}],"doi":"10.3390/ani12040521"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Chili powder","antioxidant enzymes","sex dependence","oxidative stress indices","thiol-containing compounds","fruit fly"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091fc878c28a04738e1c9","5e7091fc878c28a04738e1ca"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Chili-supplemented food decreases glutathione-S-transferase activity in Drosophila melanogaster females without a change in other parameters of antioxidant system","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454794e1","mniswId":"17087","title":"Redox Report","doi":null,"issn":"1351-0002","eissn":"1743-2928","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"88c03d88-9662-4f92-a12d-e878e526de09"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-06","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"640701d440970770355cebea","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["640701d440970770355cebeb","640701d440970770355cebec","640701d440970770355cebed","5e7091fc878c28a04738e1c9","5e7091fc878c28a04738e1ca","640701d440970770355cebee","640701d440970770355cebef","640701d440970770355cebf0","640701d440970770355cebf1"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objectives\r\nMany plant-derived anti-aging preparations influence antioxidant defense system. Consumption of food supplemented with chili pepper powder was found to extend lifespan in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. The present study aimed to test a connection between life-extending effect of chili powder and antioxidant defense system of D. melanogaster.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nFlies were reared for 15 days in the mortality cages on food with 0% (control), 0.04%, 0.12%, 0.4%, or 3% chili powder. Antioxidant and related enzymes, as well as oxidative stress indices were measured.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nFemale flies that consumed chili-supplemented food had a 40–60% lower glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity as compared with the control cohort. Activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was about 37% higher in males that consumed food with 3% chili powder in comparison with the control cohort. Many of the parameters studied were sex-dependent.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nConsumption of chili-supplemented food extends lifespan in fruit fly cohorts in a concentration- and gender-dependent manner. However, this extension is not mediated by a strengthening of antioxidant defenses. Consumption of chili-supplemented food does not change the specific relationship between antioxidant and related enzymes in D. melanogaster, and does not change the linkage of the activities of these enzymes to fly gender."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526516","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"221–229","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13510002.2022.2123884","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"640701d440970770355cebf1","name":"Oleh","lastName":"Lushchak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bfb7e8d0-3be4-460f-88f5-e74cbfa9d99e"},{"objectId":"640701d440970770355cebf0","name":"Maria M.","lastName":"Bayliak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4d9d7caf-da58-4e44-a042-57e17f0cd6f1"},{"objectId":"640701d440970770355cebef","name":"Kenneth B.","lastName":"Storey","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ef7e84ef-1c09-40ed-95e5-cc5183c9af7a"},{"objectId":"640701d440970770355cebee","name":"Nadia I.","lastName":"Burdyliuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cb772b25-f560-4577-ab5a-2cbcaecc2db4"},{"objectId":"640701d440970770355cebed","name":"Olha M.","lastName":"Strilbytska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e6e1f418-aca4-407c-9ebc-bf0eff8f2ead"},{"objectId":"640701d440970770355cebec","name":"Dmytro V.","lastName":"Gospodaryov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9c746a8c-4749-4b57-bdb1-0285908596a4"},{"objectId":"640701d440970770355cebeb","name":"Uliana V.","lastName":"Semaniuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"83eea65f-4c58-42a5-9b86-c87881217227"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e1ca","name":"Anna","lastName":"Sokół-Łętowska","uuid":"2167119824E2D3AAE1FA2F4F610D620EE39EEC5E3A6505E841831E3580AEB90496ADBE642B564A4CE860A00F80431AF8676F47B56F878E60B1CD04C0CEEF1FFB","orcidId":"0000-0003-2785-2791","documentHash":"404a7218-0869-4c78-834f-e7323278a781"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e1c9","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Kucharska","uuid":"649C839F45985ABA91816E2818FD6BFB370778014AF4EC150FC884B75D84D218FC083630C1F79045E78B33D5C42234926D1241506BDD31A0AA2CF1F4D78F5941","orcidId":"0000-0002-2172-0408","documentHash":"d779e36d-bc68-433f-87d2-9a4a77deac65"}],"doi":"10.1080/13510002.2022.2123884"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["florfenicol","renal portal system","turkey","pharmacokinetics","site of drug administration"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["662a3d0540970762633a516f","662a3d0540970762633a516e","5e7093c9878c28a0473b0b2b","60407b8b9543c711bc6ea5f3"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The influence of the site of drug administration on florfenicol pharmacokinetics in turkeys","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547934f","mniswId":"16421","title":"Poultry Science","doi":null,"issn":"0032-5791","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"c9af2e3d-4296-4e43-bd81-af7507096421"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2021-10-08","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6407032940970770355cf055","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60407b8b9543c711bc6ea5f3","5e7093c9878c28a0473b0b2b","662a3d0540970762633a516e","662a3d0540970762633a516f"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Florfenicol is a broad-spectrum antibacterial drug used in the treatment of farm animals, including poultry.

The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of florfenicol in turkeys after a single intravenous, intramuscular and subcutaneous administration at a dose of 15 mg/kg body weight. Additionally, to evaluate the effect of renal portal system on drug kinetics, the intramuscular administration was divided into pectoral and caudofemoral administration. The study showed that the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was similar regardless of the route of administration. The mean values ​​for clearance and volume of distribution were 0.33 L/kg/h and 0.92 L/kg, respectively. The mean residence time (MRT) was 2.87 h for an intravenous bolus, while for the extravascular administrations it was approx. 5.5 h. The elimination half-life was approx. 4 h regardless of the route of administration. The maximum plasma concentration did not differ statistically between intramuscular (approx. 6.8 mg/L) and subcutaneous (8.2 mg/L) administrations, while the time to appear for this concentration was the longest for caudofemoral administration (1.5 h). The bioavailability was 88.64% for subcutaneous administration, 77.95% for pectoral administration and 85.30% for caudofemoral administration. Overall, all three routes of extravascular administration allowed for efficient drug absorption. There was no evidence of an influence of the renal portal system on the kinetic parameters of the drug administered to the lower extremities of the body."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526518","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"101","pagesFromTo":"1-7","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579121005587/pdfft?md5=2c4edb52e3fa439f2923424a40c41790&pid=1-s2.0-S0032579121005587-main.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a3d0540970762633a516f","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Świtała","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"47c4afce-ac82-4736-aa41-73aaf54289d4"},{"objectId":"662a3d0540970762633a516e","name":"A.","lastName":"Smutkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ce055fd5-060a-494e-8288-aa11aa6a8290"},{"objectId":"60407b8b9543c711bc6ea5f3","name":"Abubakar","lastName":"Bello","uuid":"4CE1B1D6A1E297F82A4837334E28AD88A19EC86D99FDE1F67912B341899ED72FEEFA6CDF56ECA409D26553CB31977F130153081FD924271447980FB161AD03E1","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aa0100c8-0e62-4efb-a45b-cde499f23542"},{"objectId":"5e7093c9878c28a0473b0b2b","name":"Błażej","lastName":"Poźniak","uuid":"9D34C68EF7BCE1CDFDD881E3E25B0DA19FF3E9A265E42AD3B7C1D00B060E62E5DE777064700C999A93D8B03A4A6A11D7CF0AA200CAB79DC9B7AA242ECF6CFCF6","orcidId":"0000-0002-5813-1404","documentHash":"50bd7f0a-8bf5-4736-9b38-a4b5990d8561"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.psj.2021.101536"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63f867d840970709926f4697","doi":null,"title":"Lekarz i duchowny na prowincji = Lěkař a duchovní v provincii","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"9788366536647","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"http://katalog.bu.ujd.edu.pl/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?bib=248682","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"c2dde3a8-b5c6-47da-a1b6-91ddac092910","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb8ed","mniswId":"58800","name":"Uniwersytet Humanistyczno-Przyrodniczy im.

But military hand-to-hand combat training uses methods, forms and means from physical culture to ensure soldiers’ all-round psycho-physical development. The combative aspect of preparing soldiers for close combat is based on effective techniques from selected martial arts, combat sports and self-defence systems. The aim of this article is general knowledge about the origin the select of military hand-to-hand combat system techniques in Polish Armed Forces.\n\nMaterial and Methods: The military hand-to-hand combat system of the soldiers of the General Tadeusz Kościuszko Military University of Land Forces was analysed. Due to the civilian nature of this work, the sensitive data of the soldiers cannot be made public. The case study of the research sample was dictated by the accessibility to the Wrocław population of soldiers. The method of observation of exercisers during practical classes and the method of analysis of secondary sources were used.\n\nResults: The analysed system of military hand-to-hand combat is based on hand techniques from boxing. Foot techniques are specific to kyokushin karate. Meanwhile, the techniques of throws, grabs, chokes and levers are based on judo. All incapacitating elements are derived from the Israeli combat system krav maga.\n\nConclusions: The combination of combat techniques from boxing, judo, karate kyokushin and krav maga is highly effective in military close combat. An even use of aspects of martial arts, combat sports and self-defence systems is noted."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526523","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62f34fad409707058d18eeaf","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"18","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"d663e64a-620b-430d-86e2-fafd764384e2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"341-345","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://archbudo.com/view/abstract/id/15646","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af0e6","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Kupryjańczyk","uuid":"AB9035245AD80487DB1102396FE995C89041D2BA10FCA9BD2B7AC0EF5562F27E59E2648A3B6AFAF8A01B527D0302BC1E68496562B8B97E756F0AD295B66F8EB6","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"871f77d3-c043-4ee5-8251-ba720bd553c5"},{"objectId":"5e7092a1878c28a0473997dd","name":"Marek","lastName":"Sokołowski","uuid":"A169D0758E4955D0D3CE14BA5D4395452557B7E1B121C45A2FC3D4166ED60F3317AE9396607C519E16A99D561920120FAD2506A0E38AC822B9F986464EEA6E57","orcidId":"0000-0002-0926-6046","documentHash":"73a331e5-b611-4b06-9f0e-2a6aef48b69e"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047395018","name":"Kazimierz","lastName":"Witkowski","uuid":"CC37B410BAB0D82AD450D7E571118D9EC49278F8F943A35C9E48374475E2106D40583895F33307E073D83BA4A25F4FFC88CE16E796C45B9F34E4EABE8125213A","orcidId":"0000-0003-1503-9904","documentHash":"3e7d48f4-1488-453f-bc2d-39ff1fe09f00"},{"objectId":"5e709264878c28a047394e18","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Piepiora","uuid":"43BCB9DE63C409AF2525059BBC6258519D04B434E022D70BBEB1BFD8045EB31EC07F3043AAF7EC03A7281DDEC1E8FD57EADDC446A662D8D7E656C749A9503C03","orcidId":"0000-0002-6525-3936","documentHash":"13cf1a28-5505-4b2b-a2fb-47baf7a34a1b"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["permit to work system","task risk analysis"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f85479f085dcb410a25ed62"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Permit to work and risk analysis as an element of safety management systems applied on oil and gas installations","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d54878c28514547a747","mniswId":"200171","title":"Zeszyty Naukowe.

The material used was yellow flesh cv. Ismena and purple flesh cv. Provita. Potato slices were blanched (1–5 min at 80–90 °C) and then fried (155–175 °C). The control sample was comprised of crisps that were not blanched. The fat content and color parameters were determined in crisps, while in defatted samples, the following were determined: the content of total polyphenols; antioxidant capacity, measured by the ability to scavenge the ABTS•+ radical cations (TEAC ABTS) and by the FRAP method; and the level of fluorescent intermediary compounds (FICs) and browning index (BI), as indicators of the progress of the Maillard reaction. The content of kynurenic acid (KYNA) was examined in the raw material, in slices, in the water after blanching and in the crisps. Blanching affected the fat absorption, with time being more critical than temperature. The color of crisps from yellow flesh potatoes after blanching lightened, while the color in the purple samples darkened. The content of total polyphenols was higher in purple crisps. Increasing the temperature and shortening the time of blanching increased the polyphenol content and the antioxidant capacity. Blanching decreased the level of FICs, while frying increased FICs.

Obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) constitute a rapidly increasing health problem and contribute to the development of multiple comorbidities like acute and chronic kidney disease. Insulin resistance, inappropriate lipolysis, and excess of free fatty acids (FFAs) are associated with glomerulus hyperfiltration and atherosclerosis. The important component of MetS, oxidative stress, is also involved in the destabilization of kidney function and the progression of kidney injury. Natural polyphenols have the ability to reduce the harmful effect of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS). Extract derived from Punica granatum L. is rich in punicalagin that demonstrates positive effects in MetS and its associated diseases. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of bioactive substances of pomegranate peel to kidney damage associated with the MetS. Methods. In this study, we compared biomarkers of oxidative stress in kidney tissue of adult male Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats with MetS and healthy controls that were treated with Punica granatum L. extract at a dose of 100 or 200 mg/kg. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of polyphenolic extract on kidney injury markers and remodeling. The concentration of ROS/RNS, oxLDL, glutathione (GSH), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), metalloproteinase 2 and 9 (MMP-2, MMP-9), and the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were measured. Results. The data showed significant differences in oxidative stress markers between treated and untreated MetS rats. ROS/RNS levels, oxLDL concentration, and SOD activity were lower, whereas CAT activity was higher in rats with MetS receiving polyphenolic extract. After administration of the extract, markers for kidney injury (NGAL, KIM-1) decreased. Conclusion. Our study confirmed the usefulness of pomegranate polyphenols in the treatment of MetS and the prevention of kidney damage. However, further, more detailed research is required to establish the mechanism of polyphenol protection.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526530","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2023","pagesFromTo":"art.6144967 [14 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630eac24097076263e8ad3c","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Noszczyk-Nowak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cadd3d64-7160-4597-87b9-bf0d151e6f35"},{"objectId":"6630eac24097076263e8ad3b","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Niewiadomska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"15f38d14-cfbe-4014-81a7-ac9a7f4733ed"},{"objectId":"5fc4c148085dcb1e6ae0b8e3","name":"Anna","lastName":"Radajewska","uuid":"EF8151305BE9B1DB9E0A70A130716A1BBA616A67355057C7F3E19D2823631207D8D36905CB495A2CB945A83EE5288A22D3EB8B8A772F28096565B8CED8F29B1B","orcidId":"0000-0003-1639-3155","documentHash":"2073a152-dc24-45d0-89bf-5fb02f7524de"},{"objectId":"5f9da73e085dcb3b6122becb","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Szyller","uuid":"C4FCDDE24C88B8DFE69BFEFC48E222C4AB596D2596268D482FCEFF5578BEA2F0B681052360598E37BA8DB67FCC201C782CACC8FEBC585D07CCBF741B3F5DC56E","orcidId":"0000-0002-1320-4112","documentHash":"a61bd300-069c-4f13-b95e-68da3492e25b"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a137c","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Bil-Lula","uuid":"D66A1DB032713BFB138728227FA9E8FE4C5B2992F21133631980E51990ACC2AAAAC7BEF4006CB53C610BD6C8FF7D90ADF5BA936805820BCC3C4F06C6F38BF309","orcidId":"0000-0002-2769-0166","documentHash":"2d2a9fc6-e38e-4934-8c67-e06dbf177428"}],"doi":"10.1155/2023/6144967"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709195878c28a04737f560","uid":"b-QhPpCcUJetk1AqkjBdSkQ","uuid":"07208b1f-4d34-483a-a884-05ac93b6fcec","parentId":"5e709195878c28a04737f560","parentUuid":"07208b1f-4d34-483a-a884-05ac93b6fcec","rootId":"5e709195878c28a04737f560","rootUuid":"07208b1f-4d34-483a-a884-05ac93b6fcec","name":"Uniwersytet Papieski Jana Pawła II w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f802000085dcb410a25ec31","5e7093d0878c28a0473b12d0"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Teologia nauki – propozycja nowego otwarcia teologii na nauki","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa83c9aff2974850cd0f","mniswId":"499108","title":"Człowiek i Społeczeństwo","doi":null,"issn":"0239-3271","eissn":"","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"3bb35b8b-0c63-46f9-a8fd-3b72d074202f"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_ND","releaseDate":"2023-02-14","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63f753274097074c8dc85355","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093d0878c28a0473b12d0","5f802000085dcb410a25ec31"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper we discuss the idea of theology of science, which is understood as a new branch of the- ology concerned with the problems arising in the context of natural sciences.

Herein we report on the preparation of the uracil nucleoside (1) and nucleotide ester GNA (2). The compounds are functionalised with a luminescent phenanthrenyl group. In DMSO, 1 and 2 are brightly fluorescent, with emission maxima at 390 nm, nanosecond decay times (0.6 and 0.75 ns, respectively), and quantum yields of ca. 0.2. In the solid phase, they show excimeric emission, with maxima at 495 nm (1) and 432 nm (2), and decay times of 3.7 ns (1) and 2.9 ns (2). The anticancer activity of the GNA components, as well as gemcitabine hydrochloride, used as a reference drug, were examined in vitro against human cancer HeLa and Ishikawa cells, as well as against normal L929 cells, using a battery of biochemical assays. Furthermore, biodistribution imaging studies were carried out in HeLa cells, with luminescence confocal microscopy, which showed that the compounds localized mainly in the lipophilic cellular compartments. Nucleoside (1) and nucleotide ester (2) features two different anticancer activity profiles. At 24 h of treatment, the nucleoside acts mainly as a toxin and induces necrosis in HeLa cells, whereas the nucleotide ester exhibits pro-apoptotic activity. At longer treatment times (72 h), the nucleoside and the reference, gemcitabine hydrochloride, featured almost identical signs of anticancer activity, such as S-phase cell cycle arrest, proliferation inhibition, and apoptosis induction. In view of this data, one can hypothesize that despite the structural differences, the newly obtained phenanthrenyl GNA nucleoside (1) and gemcitabine may share a common mechanism of anticancer activity in HeLa cancer cells. The GNA components were also examined as antiplasmodial agents against Plasmodium falciparum, in vitro. Nucleoside (1) was found to be more potent than nucleotide (2), displaying activity in the low micromolar range. Furthermore, both phenanthrene derivatives were found to display resistance indices at least 9-fold lower than chloroquine diphosphate (CQDP)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526540","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"125","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0045206822002528","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"656db44a40970749a862f726","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Czerwieniec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eb101b78-df21-4f04-b795-aacce900a33d"},{"objectId":"656db44a40970749a862f725","name":"Gregory S","lastName":"Smith","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0ed0ca4c-011a-49d2-9249-2149bbaa1d4b"},{"objectId":"656db44a40970749a862f724","name":"Tameryn","lastName":"Stringer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d030d60e-66ce-40fe-b121-49bfcbd6d040"},{"objectId":"656db44a40970749a862f723","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Woźniak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"84676ca6-dd66-460d-9af6-1d042283832b"},{"objectId":"656db44a40970749a862f722","name":"Damian","lastName":"Trzybiński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"901764d1-f4d0-4155-9559-6e99bcac4504"},{"objectId":"5e70947d878c28a0473be4e3","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"867DA088C06F259F70FBD588AA5170309BAA1A94E98F0524C1285F65EDDF4B0E838691BBFA63232441DF1E1143A645C3FF702FA9877D61DF2ECF9D99D7584B25","orcidId":"0000-0001-9607-7173","documentHash":"c268aa62-9237-4363-ba24-e612e6ab4e79"},{"objectId":"5e7093d1878c28a0473b1488","name":"Michał","lastName":"Piotrowicz","uuid":"31C8D83C9108BDCE35A39B4EBC798DF188BDC0F5FAC15A89273E281E5774426DBEF4C2668BEBF7204489FC71892466D4678A0D55F384869DF44E330613CB2183","orcidId":"0000-0001-7214-858X","documentHash":"639e399c-308f-46ab-b15c-8a305f90e890"},{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9c62","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Gapińska","uuid":"E53B3B3B5C6D0E6DFE8AAA55C76427CAF28BCD63990E53216C164D151ABC5AE373E20BA97C42648DB03BA634DE5C8459D89240E4592D01718B6DBAEF3BC11C29","orcidId":"0000-0002-3125-7920","documentHash":"f8e94ef0-4e06-4808-a689-43e483984a8b"},{"objectId":"5e709360878c28a0473a8607","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Kowalski","uuid":"CA9A38F3CAB095CCE24C21B47978813A59B7F415149F85DD27B9367C749F9B5FC7E33FBDF1F4D8CA78E298F8B2ECA548A990662C002D41A46D63DC7AB19B48F5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0600-3205","documentHash":"25e7f1e1-23c5-440d-b351-209835a12549"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.bioorg.2022.105847"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Marcin Kromer, Umbra Saxonis, origo gentis, historiografia renesansowa, warsztat historyka"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Marcin Kromer, Umbra Saxonis, origo gentis, Renaissance historiography, historical craft"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f82f","uid":"bNCMholzVnf_d36v4lxrTXQ","uuid":"26ff7291-2207-4714-96a4-243ace7074f4","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","parentUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","rootUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","name":"Wydział Historii i Stosunków Międzynarodowych (od 1.10.2019 r.)","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047390f83"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Opowieść etnogenetyczna a warsztat szesnastowiecznego historyka","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479ecd","mniswId":"483942","title":"Historyka.

Two specific examples would be analysed: Marcin Kromer’s Sarmatian origine of the Poles and Nicolaus Petreius’s Cimbrian origine of the Danes. The general presentation of non‑political and non‑ideological presumptions for accepting the mythical past known from the medieval texts delivers the background on which it can be\ngrasped, how Early Modern historians treated that tradition. The analysis of the working meth\u0002ods would be also preceeded by showing the variety of approaches observed in terms of the topic: when dealing with the ethogenetic theories, the historians decided to use polemical oration/treatise as the main form. Another form: the legendary history was applied for presenting the past “before” and “after” the process of shaping the nation/state. The scholarly methods used by both historians included both tradition and novelty: ethymological deductions, endorsment of the classical authorities (and obviously, the Bible), forgery, but at the same time impressive erudition and attempts to addopt some historical criticism."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526542","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63f71ac14097074c8dc257c3","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"bf98f2c5-9999-4d29-ab9f-71dcf943f9b7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/Content/125995/PDF/2022-HSRK-21.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047390f83","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Szelągowska","uuid":"5C11CEDDB1DFB26A7DFA130B7FA602949092294846CD4673F9BA430C1DCB303084EB80FD2F5987125760DAD7467CDA30ADAD3E289E519CB44C46F9026FD90B2F","orcidId":"0000-0002-5195-044X","documentHash":"966ae006-7011-45d8-bc15-83b55ed826a8"}],"doi":"10.24425/hsm.2022.142734"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["obesity","laminitis","horses","equine metabolic syndrome","draft horses"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709422878c28a0473b6d46","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e22","662a3e4940970762633a5e44","662a3e4940970762633a5e43","5e709224878c28a047390866","662a3e4940970762633a5e42","5e709440878c28a0473b8ec2","5e70921f878c28a047390313"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Differences in Histoarchitecture of Hoof Lamellae between Obese and Lean Draft Horses","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-2615","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"cf012089-3ed8-4dde-a05c-d5b280240cb4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-11","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"640705d040970770355cff39","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e22","5e709422878c28a0473b6d46","5e709440878c28a0473b8ec2","5e70921f878c28a047390313","5e709224878c28a047390866","662a3e4940970762633a5e42","662a3e4940970762633a5e43","662a3e4940970762633a5e44"]},"issue":"14","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Obesity is a common problem in horses. The associations between obesity and equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) and between EMS and laminitis are known. However, there is a lack of data on whether obesity itself can affect hoof lamellae. Forelimbs and blood from 12 draft horses (six obese and six lean) from a slaughterhouse were acquired. To exclude laminitis and EMS horses, insulin concentration was measured, and hooves were radiographed. Histological evaluation was performed. The shape of the primary and secondary epidermal lamellae (PEL and SEL) was evaluated, and the length of the keratinized and total primary epidermal lamellae was measured (KPEL and TEL). All horses showed pathological changes in lamellae. In the lean group, the changes were longer SELs, more proliferated and separated PDLs, and less standard PDLs. In the obese group, the changes were a lower number of club-shaped and standard SELs and significantly more tapered SELs. No difference in the shape of PELs and the length of KPELs was noticed. The research did not confirm the effects of obesity on lamellar failure. The measurements taken indicate that the lamellae are much longer compared to other research studies; this could indicate that the length of the PEL depends on the hoof size."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526544","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/12/14/1774/pdf?version=1657598497","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a3e4940970762633a5e44","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kaleta-Kuratewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f37bfaed-ce28-4808-b13d-c5b18926738d"},{"objectId":"662a3e4940970762633a5e43","name":"Marta","lastName":"Rykała","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2d1db7b1-bcb8-471b-8781-98f5b6713015"},{"objectId":"662a3e4940970762633a5e42","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Senderska-Płonowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f54227ad-9f21-467c-ada5-6a1d05df8a04"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e22","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Siwińska","uuid":"F0912E4A0D62D49C494C42C8EE0FB1E91AA22AAB6EABDF35ED58AF5291152DB48147C7D714F1DDD3CE1F3C02A097C3085DA35140BCA424E983C75BF02B4686EB","orcidId":"0000-0002-5205-5826","documentHash":"a1d05863-24cb-4911-bc4d-417b0f4b2a0a"},{"objectId":"5e709440878c28a0473b8ec2","name":"Malwina","lastName":"Słowikowska-Łoś","uuid":"F818AE4F22C980AF65A67FDF94D8FA17F83365DD00243234726315C701FB1D7CF697A9F572FF40073D457F9DC4F433EF85D4D3492CC1DF736353A81B7E89DF36","orcidId":"0000-0002-7014-956X","documentHash":"7220ec1b-6732-4743-84d0-1eb6ec512679"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6d46","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Żak-Bochenek","uuid":"F89426231B983C5ECA13AD7BD38B00506808B19DDA229A20545F29AD6D5D38759E56338EE4A1CA530F5936EAAB3347EEA746F6F49DC8105E956099F57052EC86","orcidId":"0000-0002-3532-6508","documentHash":"450a298c-43bf-4530-81c7-f70107530542"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390866","name":"Artur","lastName":"Niedźwiedź","uuid":"84C165546FFD3E6CC97099B651BBA80106A81BB29345A493177C3FBBA7E97483F7FA14342B5CE5D45505D8AF30F2F32B1E5412FD9DA2BC4EF7CE3CD17069A3D5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8925-4853","documentHash":"dc367c82-f8db-4036-99a4-0b0d54e66616"},{"objectId":"5e70921f878c28a047390313","name":"Jan","lastName":"Madej","uuid":"123761383077CEBD5EB138AA3FA883A19A7528D494D4B55C8BAEAC26F10EB4BFA11842AC3BDEB1DF8D2DABF50A22E755FA6063C02FD306F63525FD19E588E79F","orcidId":"0000-0003-3213-9691","documentHash":"47705654-86e7-42ed-9835-a3ac117ef8f3"}],"doi":"10.3390/ani12141774"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biomimetic propulsion system","hybrid drive","Remote Operating Vehicle (ROV)","semi-autonomous underwater vehicle","Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV)"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","uid":"bGA_QwQGoDNg-6MMEBxlWNQ","uuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","parentUuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","rootUuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","name":"Akademia Marynarki Wojennej im.

In the first, birds were fed grain–soybean meal mixtures, and in the second, two kinds of diets based on corn–soybean or corn–soybean–rapeseed meal were applied. In the experiments, we determined the levels of the blood serum thyroid hormones fT3 and fT4, as well as the morphological structure of the thyroid gland. In the second experiment, the concentration of immunoglobulins in blood serum was assayed. In both experiments, no influence of iodine source on thyroid hormone concentration was observed. However, increasing the iodine level in the full mixture and adding rapeseed meal in both experiments caused an increase in fT3 concentration. Increasing I-addition in both experiments led to a decrease in thyroid gland follicle diameter. Rapeseed meal inclusion (at a level of 10%) to the complete hen mixture led to an increase in thyroid gland follicle diameter. Applying KIO3 as an iodine source in both experiments caused a decrease in the thyroid gland height of follicle epithelial cells. Immunoglobulin concentrations in the serum were not affected by experimental factors. The results suggest that the methodologies of studies on the bioavailability of minerals and the corresponding analytical methods require unification.

The samples were preserved, prepared, and stained according to the standard protocols. The immunohistochemical reaction was assessed using the semi-quantitative IRS method. The results were documented and statistically analysed. The most significant increase was seen in gastrin (G) cell activity. The activity of other endocrine cells (cholecystokinin (I) cells, somatostatin (D) cells, and somatotropin receptor (SR) cells) was less dynamic.

A field experiment was conducted in 2019 at Pawlowice Experimental Station near Wroclaw city (Poland) to study the effect of a foliar spray of the algal extract prepared from freshwater Cladophora glomerata on the growth of two varieties of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill.)—Polish Erica and Japanese Enrei—cultivated under Polish environmental conditions. The foliar spray was applied once during the beginning of the soybean flowering (BBCH65) at one concentration (20%) of algal extract. The research showed that the foliar application of C. glomerata extract significantly enhanced the yield parameters. The plant height, first pod height, number of first branches, 1000-seed weight and yield were significantly higher compared with the control. The home variety Erica was better adapted to the climatic conditions in Poland than the Japanese variety Enrei.

agro-industrial by-products corn steep liquor (CSL) and olive mill wastewater (OMW) were evaluated as low-cost substrates for rhamnolipid production by Burkholderia thailandensis E264. In a culture medium containing CSL (7.5% (v/v)) as sole substrate, B. thailandensis E264 produced 175 mg rhamnolipid/L, which is about 1.3 times the amount produced in the standard medium, which contains glycerol, peptone, and meat extract. When the CSL medium was supplemented with OMW (10% (v/v)), rhamnolipid production further increased up to 253 mg/L in flasks and 269 mg/L in a bioreactor. Rhamnolipids produced in CSL + OMW medium reduced the surface tension up to 27.1 mN/m, with a critical micelle concentration of 51 mg/L, better than the values obtained with the standard medium (28.9 mN/m and 58 mg/L, respectively). However, rhamnolipids produced in CSL + OMW medium displayed a weak emulsifying activity when compared to those produced in the other media. Whereas di-rhamnolipid congeners represented between 90 and 95% of rhamnolipids produced by B. thailandensis E264 in CSL and the standard medium, the relative abundance of mono-rhamnolipids increased up to 55% in the culture medium containing OMW. The difference in the rhamnolipid congeners produced in each medium explains their different surface-active properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of rhamnolipid production by B. thailandensis using a culture medium containing agro-industrial by-products as sole ingredients. Furthermore, rhamnolipids produced in the different media recovered around 60% of crude oil from contaminated sand, demonstrating its potential application in the petroleum industry and bioremediation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526574","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"106","pagesFromTo":"7477–7489","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00253-022-12225-1","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6406fab740970770355cccab","name":"José A.","lastName":"Teixeira","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9414ec9e-27c8-45a0-87e3-54f56f8bfc48"},{"objectId":"6406fab740970770355ccca9","name":"Eduardo J.","lastName":"Gudiña","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a26b81a5-fdc5-4805-911c-86eb31fb254a"},{"objectId":"6406fab740970770355ccca8","name":"Jéssica","lastName":"Correia","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cd50b233-dfdf-42eb-82cc-63c812de136d"},{"objectId":"5e70941f878c28a0473b69b5","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Janek","uuid":"FD18E1891C456484C1D659FDEF8BB5A3AEBE6587A66E64517F5907B328F5B3491AA7573CAD923A655DBC16502C523E5D6952296E2294034A396BC5280259F92F","orcidId":"0000-0003-1939-5500","documentHash":"06728d3b-2da9-422e-8d69-407e300b6d8f"},{"objectId":"5e709264878c28a047394d52","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Lazar","uuid":"0843CDDD8995D1429FD4292000E7C232DD292731DC692CAFCA05C7C82DA9331F09264155E1F209DB0FBB517CA07C71A461A1D5F3B4437EDA2C37FA7A459FF30D","orcidId":"0000-0001-7315-1983","documentHash":"a8e353ea-d189-40d3-8f08-b68e6299d02f"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00253-022-12225-1"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Bryophyta","volatile compounds","antimicrobial activity","antibacterial and antifungal potential","cytotoxic compounds"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709273878c28a047395e34","5e7091fc878c28a04738e21f","662a383840970762633a2f9c","5e7091fc878c28a04738e2a7"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Modern Use of Bryophytes as a Source of Secondary  Metabolites","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d9","mniswId":"689","title":"Agronomy","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2073-4395","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ecde59b8-e697-42b5-b3f5-ad846db663c6"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-17","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6406fd4940970770355cdabb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7091fc878c28a04738e21f","5e7091fc878c28a04738e2a7","5e709273878c28a047395e34","662a383840970762633a2f9c"]},"issue":"6","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Bryophytes constitute a heterogeneous group of plants which includes three clades: approximately 14,000 species of mosses (Bryophyta), 6000 species of liverworts (Marchantiophyta), and 300 species of hornworts (Anthocerotophyta). They are common in almost all ecosystems, where they play important roles. Bryophytes lack developed physical barriers, yet they are rarely attacked by herbivores or pathogens. Instead, they have acquired the ability to produce a wide range of secondary metabolites with diverse functions, such as phytotoxic, antibacterial, antifungal, insect antifeedant, and molluscicidal activities. Secondary metabolites in bryophytes can also be involved in stress tolerance, i.e., in UV-absorptive and drought- and freezing-tolerant activities. Due to these properties, for centuries bryophytes have been used to combat health problems in many cultures on different continents. Currently, scientists are discovering new, unique compounds in bryophytes with potential for practical use, which, in the age of drug resistance, may be of considerable importance. The aim of this review is to present bryophytes as a potential source of compounds with miscellaneous possible uses, with a focus on volatile compounds and antibacterial, antifungal, and cytotoxic potential, and as sources of materials for further promising research. The paper also briefly refers to the methods of compound extraction and acquisition.

Cyclodextrin derivatization has been always accompanied by the development of characterization methods, able to unfold complicated structures with increasing precision. One of the important leaps forward is represented by mass spectrometry techniques with soft ionization, mainly matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI). In this context, esterified cyclodextrins (ECDs) benefited also from the formidable input of structural knowledge, thus allowing the understanding of the structural impact of reaction parameters on the obtained products, especially for the ring-opening oligomerization of cyclic esters. The current review envisages the common mass spectrometry approaches such as direct MALDI MS or ESI MS analysis, hyphenated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and tandem mass spectrometry, employed for unraveling the structural features and particular processes associated with ECDs. Thus, the accurate description of complex architectures, advances in the gas phase fragmentation processes, assessment of secondary reactions, and reaction kinetics are discussed in addition to typical molecular mass measurements."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526577","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63f7457d4097074c8dc69533","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"28","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"35743a81-76a1-42d3-b683-2171690c3d87"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"28","pagesFromTo":"2001","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/28/5/2001/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63f7457d4097074c8dc69535","name":"Cristian","lastName":"Peptu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c3e0de85-413e-444d-af58-30a35d2bd3af"},{"objectId":"63f7457d4097074c8dc69534","name":"Diana-Andreea","lastName":"Blaj","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e94a81ca-8420-4fb1-9d44-a53f31e79f39"},{"objectId":"5e70923e878c28a0473925a0","name":"Marek","lastName":"Kowalczuk","uuid":"D8B7065F49494234A707A1B46AE4BE634AD3E9F42E7A62094D06DEB3DD3125907DF38E4DB1ABB7ECC733A052D0330B8A95C364673A5746976A1000AA3C75F79E","orcidId":"0000-0002-2877-7466","documentHash":"ee167db3-ac9b-464d-adf9-a70b80afa73b"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules28052001"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bacteriophages","food safety","phage biocontrol","foodborne pathogens","bacteriophage application","phage commercial products","foodborne illness"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Recent Advances in the Application of Bacteriophages against Common Foodborne Pathogens","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b9bb","mniswId":"1353","title":"Antibiotics","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2079-6382","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"491ddc91-9d9f-4982-aa71-dd451a3b74fc"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-02","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6406f7c240970770355cc041","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709220878c28a047390349","65e876d0409707626314920a","65e876d0409707626314920b"]},"issue":"11","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Bacteriophage potential in combating bacterial pathogens has been recognized nearly since the moment of discovery of these viruses at the beginning of the 20th century.

This includes the food safety sector in which the presence of pathogens poses an explicit threat to consumers. This is also the field in which commercialization of phage-based products shows the greatest progress. Application of bacteriophages has gained special attention particularly in recent years, presumably due to the potential of conventional antibacterial strategies being exhausted. In this review, we present recent findings regarding phage application in fighting major foodborne pathogens, including Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli, Yersinia spp., Campylobacter jejuni and Listeria monocytogenes.

An increase in air temperatures translates into higher temperatures of water constituting the habitat of a wide range of species. The purpose of this study is to present the direction and extent of water temperature increases in eight rivers and three lakes on a monthly and annual basis. The analysis of river water temperatures used both measured data and data reconstructed using artificial neural networks from the period of 1984–2020. The analysis of the direction and extent of changes in air and water temperatures was performed using Mann-Kandall tests and a modified Sen test. The analysis of water temperature changes was conducted against the background of climatic conditions and catchment characteristics. The results indicate that in the Warta River basin in the period of 1984–2020, the average annual temperature rise reached 0.51 °C decade−1, ranging from 0.43 to 0.61 °C decade−1. This translated into an increase in mean annual water temperatures in lakes in a range from 0.14 to 0.58 °C decade−1, and for rivers in a range from 0.10 to 0.54 °C decade−1. The greatest changes in air temperature occurred in April, June, August, September, and November. It was reflected in an increase in water temperature in lakes and rivers. However, these changes did not occur in all rivers and lakes, suggesting the role of local factors that modify the effect of climate change. The study showed that the extent of air temperature changes was significantly higher than the extent of water temperature changes in rivers.\n."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526581","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63f8af41409707099274c787","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"076e7d98-6573-45ab-a51a-6e8852ee1313"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"330","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos14020330","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63f8af41409707099274c788","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Gizińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"192b5c92-f62b-4a9b-83bb-f3ddbff162a2"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6437","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Sojka","uuid":"073495857CF13E01195275681F67A79A3968A817DA229A3E551674CE4B5A13D63A1A529AD939BD49C64AE9D95F29F2363CE487F71459B13C87BFD3F26B2FBFDC","orcidId":"0000-0002-1453-0374","documentHash":"61520225-d1dc-4fbb-99c7-30e50a32e15c"}],"doi":"10.3390/atmos14020330"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Monooxygenase","Flavonoids","Yeasts","Rhodotorula glutinis","Synthetic biology","Ortho-hydroxylation","FMO","Biotransformation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091fc878c28a04738e2b2","662a2760409707626339cde7","662a2760409707626339cde8","662a2760409707626339cde9","5e709447878c28a0473b9805","5e709442878c28a0473b90e2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Novel flavonoid C-8 hydroxylase from Rhodotorula glutinis: identification, characterization and substrate scope","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478e67","mniswId":"14325","title":"Microbial Cell Factories","doi":null,"issn":"1475-2859","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"0e806c34-e745-491e-8238-a309e0719b1c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6406f78a40970770355cbf1e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709447878c28a0473b9805","5e709442878c28a0473b90e2","662a2760409707626339cde7","662a2760409707626339cde8","662a2760409707626339cde9","5e7091fc878c28a04738e2b2"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: The regioselective hydroxylation of phenolic compounds, especially flavonoids, is still a bottleneck of classical organic chemistry that could be solved using enzymes with high activity and specificity. Yeast Rhodotorula glutinis KCh735 in known to catalyze the C-8 hydroxylation of flavones and flavanones. The enzyme F8H (flavonoid C8-hydroxylase) is involved in the reaction, but the specific gene has not yet been identified. In this work, we present identification, heterologous expression and characterization of the first F8H ortho-hydroxylase from yeast.\r\n\r\nResults: Differential transcriptome analysis and homology to bacterial monooxygenases, including also a FAD-dependent motif and a GD motif characteristic for flavin-dependent monooxygenases, provided a set of coding sequences among which RgF8H was identified. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that RgF8H is a member of the flavin monooxygenase group active on flavonoid substrates. Analysis of recombinant protein showed that the enzyme catalyzes the C8-hydroxylation of naringenin, hesperetin, eriodyctiol, pinocembrin, apigenin, luteolin, chrysin, diosmetin and 7,4ʹ-dihydroxyflavone. The presence of the C7-OH group is necessary for enzymatic activity indicating ortho-hydroxylation mechanism. The enzyme requires the NADPH coenzyme for regeneration prosthetic group, displays very low hydroxyperoxyflavin decupling rate, and addition of FAD significantly increases its activity.\r\n\r\nConclusions: This study presents identification of the first yeast hydroxylase responsible for regioselective C8-hydroxylation of flavonoids (F8H). The enzyme was biochemically characterized and applied in in vitro cascade with Bacillus megaterium glucose dehydrogenase reactions. High in vivo activity in Escherichia coli enable further synthetic biology application towards production of rare highly antioxidant compounds."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526583","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"21","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://microbialcellfactories.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12934-022-01899-x.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a2760409707626339cde9","name":"Agata","lastName":"Matera","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"205ed8e2-e201-4452-af3d-c3fcbbf80dba"},{"objectId":"662a2760409707626339cde8","name":"Sandra","lastName":"Sordon","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2eb90655-ee36-4187-9eb2-d2d1ce9e146f"},{"objectId":"662a2760409707626339cde7","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Dulak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f9c01eda-cce2-4819-b0de-95d6355c8b61"},{"objectId":"5e709447878c28a0473b9805","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Kozak","uuid":"4BD88618A807058F00EEC5EE9BE504283EC0BA248B59DCB15B5AAE2C720561E9FE90F4BA823566FA67BDCE919AB53E3A92C2D4435B7733A5E66C32389433823A","orcidId":"0000-0001-6472-3273","documentHash":"c38b8f9a-625e-426c-a5bc-008bed2586a3"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b90e2","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Popłoński","uuid":"F562093A6BE609BBF7D2866DAB41B65E871FFFE4A5905338EFF101A4A229E78070F7DDAF5BD75C606A7F3361E4BB962AC0EC94198EB87A7E70FAE0AA8446AB87","orcidId":"0000-0002-7254-5937","documentHash":"856e504b-06f4-4e80-89a2-69ca97c824c6"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e2b2","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Huszcza","uuid":"DDFA5F7E84B39F29D5118E8887F226AAEAC1BE8176F6A6AA4E9599FA33202EAC5CE3D479CE6491D8495B430C7B05AA34B36C1C1E8A1DE019B209AB5E44D2E07F","orcidId":"0000-0002-5950-3695","documentHash":"bd851e2e-29ce-4e6a-8c90-4ed506de61b7"}],"doi":"10.1186/s12934-022-01899-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["ICG","NIRF","chirurgia weterynaryjna","obrazowanie śródoperacyjne","laparoskopia","węzły wartownicze"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ICG","NIRF","veterinary surgery","intraoperative imaging","laparoscopy","sentinel lymph nodes"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6407072f40970770355d0693","doi":null,"title":"Vet Chirurgia.

Meteoric 10Be provides information about long-term soil redistribution rates (millennia), while 137Cs and 239+240Pu give medium-term rates (decades). A significant progress in developing new models and approaches for the calculation of erosion rates has been made; thus, we provide a global review (n = 59) of research articles to present these three isotopes (meteoric 10Be, 239+240Pu and 137Cs) as soil erosion markers in different environments and under different land-use types. Understanding the dynamics and behaviours of isotopes in the soil environment is crucial to determine their usefulness as soil erosion tracers; thus, we discuss the chemical–physical behaviour of meteoric 10Be, 137Cs and 239+240Pu in soils. The application of these isotopes sometimes has strong limitations, and we give suggestions on how to overcome them or how to adapt them to a given situation. This review also shows where these isotopic methods can potentially be applied in the future. A lack in knowledge about soil redistribution rates exists particularly in loess-dominated areas where the tillage system has changed or in areas with strong wind erosion.

It is possible to distinguish between an acute, disposable process, as well as recurrent colic symptoms (abdominal pain) caused by an ongoing chronic inflammatory process. This paper presents a retrospective analysis of the histopathological findings of duodenal and rectal samples taken from horses with recurrent colic, with the aim to determine the frequency and extent of inflammation. The samples, i.e., duodenal biopsy (60 samples) and rectal biopsy (17 samples), were taken from 77 horses showing recurrent colic symptoms. Histopathological examination included staining with hematoxylin and eosin. The examination included evaluation of the superficial epithelium, mucosal lamina propria, and submucosa. All samples from the duodenum and rectum showed the presence of leukocyte infiltration in the mucosal lamina propria. The most frequently observed cellular infiltration was a moderate infiltration consisting of lymphocytes and plasma cells in duodenum and mixed populations of plasma cells, lymphocytes, and eosinophilia in the rectum. Mott cells were also noted among the inflammatory infiltrates. More than one-fourth of the horses were found to have shortened intestinal villi. The results presented here showed the involvement of inflammation in the course of recurrent colic, which can be both its cause (by impairing motility and absorption) and its effect (as a result of obstruction or ischemia)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526588","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/12/24/3527/pdf?version=1671514797","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a3e1640970762633a5c83","name":"Wolfram","lastName":"Haider","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"291b14c9-0229-453f-a65f-4f41cb244b52"},{"objectId":"662a3e1640970762633a5c82","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Długopolska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6b751676-240a-4ca3-bca8-654f45240f48"},{"objectId":"662a3e1640970762633a5c81","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Paszkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8ee0ad7a-595a-491f-988c-7cf6108b9759"},{"objectId":"5e7094c7878c28a0473c39b4","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Karczewski","uuid":"D601AD5B5B8EBE266C323CB1973F7383BECC23D6D875049B374C9BE11DBF013C5FF67B66AA2BCA3F58BCF5B18D03C5491A5033A101FB1585FD9CB69037A9CAEF","orcidId":"0000-0001-8811-8916","documentHash":"073ebafa-bc18-45db-82d8-9e76c2ad8b69"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e22","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Siwińska","uuid":"F0912E4A0D62D49C494C42C8EE0FB1E91AA22AAB6EABDF35ED58AF5291152DB48147C7D714F1DDD3CE1F3C02A097C3085DA35140BCA424E983C75BF02B4686EB","orcidId":"0000-0002-5205-5826","documentHash":"a1d05863-24cb-4911-bc4d-417b0f4b2a0a"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6d46","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Żak-Bochenek","uuid":"F89426231B983C5ECA13AD7BD38B00506808B19DDA229A20545F29AD6D5D38759E56338EE4A1CA530F5936EAAB3347EEA746F6F49DC8105E956099F57052EC86","orcidId":"0000-0002-3532-6508","documentHash":"450a298c-43bf-4530-81c7-f70107530542"}],"doi":"10.3390/ani12243527"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["photodynamic effect","Photolon","bacteria photoinactivation","photoactive materials","free radicals detection","Kelvin probe microscopy","digital holographic tomography","confocal microscopy"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091fc878c28a04738e299","5e709438878c28a0473b856c","662a3d6940970762633a554d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Photolon nanoporous photoactive material with antibacterial activity and label-free noncontact method for free radical detection","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","doi":null,"issn":"1422-0067","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"850accc5-0c0e-4f6c-9a84-eaa108a84f20"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6407034a40970770355cf132","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["662a3d6940970762633a5549","662a3d6940970762633a554a","5e709438878c28a0473b856c","662a3d6940970762633a554b","662a3d6940970762633a554c","662a3d6940970762633a554d","5e7091fc878c28a04738e299","662a3d6940970762633a554e","662a3d6940970762633a554f"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The worldwide increase in bacterial resistance and healthcare-associated bacterial infections pose a serious threat to human health.

The material was characterized by its porosity, optical properties (fluorescence and absorbance), and laser-induced antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. The permanent encapsulation of Photolon in the silica coating and the antimicrobial efficiency was confirmed by confocal microscope and digital holotomography. The generation of free radicals from nanoporous surfaces was proved by scanning Kelvin probe microscopy. For the first time, it was confirmed that Kelvin probe microscopy can be a label-free, noncontact alternative to other conventional methods based on fluorescence or chemiluminescence probes, etc. It was confirmed that the proposed photoactive coating enables the antibacterial photodynamic effect based on free radicals released from the surface of the coating. The highest bactericidal efficiency of the proposed coating was 87.16%.
