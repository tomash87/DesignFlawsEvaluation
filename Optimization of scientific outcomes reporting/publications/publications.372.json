The experiment included the following treatments: (i) control (unfertilized soil), (ii) no fertilization + soil application of fungi, (iii) no fertilization + soil application of bacteria. The mixture of beneficial fungi contained two species: Aspergillus niger and Purpureocillium lilacinum. The mixture of beneficial bacteria contained three strains of Bacillus (Bacillus sp., Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Paenibacillus polymyxa). The application of beneficial microorganisms (especially bacterial strains) to the soil (without additional mineral fertilization) enhanced the growth of the apple trees. In the third year of the study (2020), the trees grown in the plots inoculated with bacteria bloomed the most intensively. Plant nutritional status (expressed as concentrations of elements in leaves) was not affected by the application of the bacterial strains or filamentous fungi. The stronger growth of trees in the plots where the bacteria were used was likely related not so much to the nutritional status of the trees, but to the mitigation of the influence of the negative factors that cause the replant disease."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058523431","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"I","pagesFromTo":"43-60","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://yadda.icm.edu.pl/baztech/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-482983d0-0cdf-401a-ade9-60b8f1013228","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c3425","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Frąc","uuid":"3A94F63454C49E41B84ACF88E742513FA46784E063FFCDE6A25F6137BE1290AB588E05C3C3923E8293C94AE7CEA79E9131C37FA4E1B4A5088DF875A4D4AB581E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9220-4227","documentHash":"43337914-19d4-42d3-8e7b-12f617ffde90"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0ef1","name":"Augustyn","lastName":"Mika","uuid":"755585F5BB298ABF09C1CD86E53CC1644A4F3FCB57013F834CA9F700CBD1FEA37AFA1E79E8391CC80B04AE394F1257CA0A7591EB3C25F9279925DCF8C7063EE5","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3d785e07-0d49-4d5c-bb49-dbfc367be7c0"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bdde0","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"97CA3174080827A6B0A0270F12F022527EAC69DEAF9A298A7090DB405A36D9BD3C5300A23E15C79339219E9F5C5A610F383406AAEF43CA7180E096A8773B797B","orcidId":"0000-0001-7802-9733","documentHash":"5b2d0c7c-4406-469f-b682-f04386f8910b"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4ac0","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Derkowska","uuid":"DC2C866AE8A6C089963E14A3845F032DBE76438ED234E2ECFB55841FDA45D276725BB2F275E7B39BC568D8C8887852E3B052F02A216D95BD81DC65C8A9577276","orcidId":"0000-0003-4108-336X","documentHash":"2c421a7d-ba04-4bea-af0d-5cd6b446754d"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4a21","name":"Anna","lastName":"Tryngiel-Gać","uuid":"98A77A282439EDFDCA5A17C1FCC501D6ACC64EE0DDE21EC927CAE3EE0F051AFE4F6A667D73E28FFE19E620EEB1194BF4B6A9636A0DD3524FA5494BB0B1F7D3D5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8766-6010","documentHash":"483e9d4e-640a-450f-9733-0cdcfc8af5db"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a0473986e0","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Treder","uuid":"CA809C02520EED47C9A82056AF627806F94D6BB9721D9DB8BB14025A6684CE9FE71CFD1C9D18ECE0B1A2610D5554D573E7368A857C8E508CD75D20E6A051643E","orcidId":"0000-0003-1640-9671","documentHash":"c6034984-8a2c-4af0-ae6a-63868a0ca950"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398362","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Sas-Paszt","uuid":"F65BF0798F03691C5ACA3C2A1EA4E5FD87ED5CB37729DF32BC5DB47710F0EBA374AA8CB082C6E75E322B257742E90231A958EB8FE9204AC6F2B651D5DF6471FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-4076-4032","documentHash":"c4b1b795-a964-4309-87da-3ec6e5c5aacd"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397ea4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Lisek","uuid":"C38FF7CEE15417AD4CC38A70CE53F9A2560AE5D83DA50BC26F276FAF8784228713271870F15964508BC5C7EBD2E2300F98393D7F45D8360A6B078185F7CB312E","orcidId":"0000-0002-3421-8759","documentHash":"a5bd2572-1af0-4f84-8b9e-d52fcf895ac8"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a0473979a2","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Klamkowski","uuid":"7E450B39DF810DB41FC8F651E1A7E17AD750C7E9A422D49912DC393B84655FBED245B386CD93F921C9DE3C513917FBB447B953F71C4C91C5B479A20AFAD3CB05","orcidId":"0000-0003-0358-3726","documentHash":"cbebff37-3723-4ee6-9d6e-43c807f2539a"},{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a04739774c","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Górnik","uuid":"19AD443F777649DA4F15E704C3941EEF104D6A04AFF5BDD504891FF22EAEDDB9D1AFA2A3756E511232FFA08C6F55B87394C1AC7473173212E5961083E7CE3B34","orcidId":"0000-0002-6612-6779","documentHash":"76a1c56b-5e2d-4e68-b4f3-93eae65930b6"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["solar

fuels are non-renewable, finite, and exhausting. Therefore, it is necessary to find alternative sources of energy. Solar energy is abundant in nature, so it can be considered as the best alternative to meet the energy demand. It is sustainable, renewable, and scalable. Increasing the efficiency of harnessing solar energy should be one of our top concerns because it is a renewable resource. The challenge in utilizing this energy is to increase efficiency as well as reduce production costs. So, a dual-axis solar tracker was developed in this study to ensure that the tracked solar cells create more electrical energy than stationary solar cells, improving the performance of the solar panels and expanding their ability to make the most of the solar radiation. The experiment yielded great results. Due to its constant exposure to sunlight, the temperature of the mobile cell is higher than that of the stationary cell. The radiation intensity of the tracked cell is more than that of the fixed cell. The radiation intensity for the traced cell is more than that of the fixed cell and peaks at 1282 W/m2 on September 10 and 1028 W/m3 on September 11. For day 10, there was a daily rate of rise in radiation intensity on the tracker cell of 42 % compared to the fixed. Day 11 saw a difference of 210 W/m2/h, or 61 percent. The results are almost same from midday until dusk. During the day, the tension in the vacuum is somewhat different for stationary cells and tracking cells, with the value of the tracker being marginally lower than the fixed value. The increased temperature in the cell caused by more solar radiation and a warmer environment is thought to be the reason for the lower energy gain in the tracker"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058523438","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ab252240970732a0a8f97c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"5","number":"8(119)","doi":null,"documentHash":"387514f0-8123-447c-80cb-f9152e181dc8"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"5","pagesFromTo":"79-88","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/266256/262383","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63ab2b2240970732a0a91df2","name":"Laith","lastName":"Jaafer Habeeb","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"964f207e-07a3-4708-8475-962b9b1f66af"},{"objectId":"63ab2b2240970732a0a91df1","name":"Yasir","lastName":"Ali Mezaal","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9b9814b8-dd1d-4bdb-a364-db5de86b8410"},{"objectId":"63ab2b2240970732a0a91df0","name":"Salem","lastName":"E Salem Elzwa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0e0e8a7d-83bf-468d-b515-37755563b924"},{"objectId":"63ab2b2240970732a0a91def","name":"Abdalla","lastName":"Saad Ahmed Eltawati","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b027dd73-1be4-422a-98a1-c8f8a4041803"},{"objectId":"63ab2b2240970732a0a91dee","name":"Monaem","lastName":"Elmnifi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"531f9c0a-9968-4d98-9fe7-07333091d5ff"},{"objectId":"63ab2b2240970732a0a91ded","name":"Ali","lastName":"Najim Abdullah Saieed","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"af879b99-8376-405b-8a53-a19c92fb3b8a"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.266256"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63ea1e244097076b4a83ded2","doi":null,"title":"Społeczeństwo gospodarka siły zbrojne.

panel discussed how Egyptology addresses ancient Egyptian interconnections; how interconnectedness is shared with and conveyed to modern Egyptians, their neighbours and the general audience; how it is

Many issues have been raised during the discussion, and they mostly derive from the Egyptocentric, and self-centring views applied by Egyptology. There is a great need for decentring the discipline and interconnecting both ancient Egypt and Egyptology.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human FKBP5 gene were shown to modulate disease risk. To enable investigation of disease-related SNPs in behaviourally relevant context, we generated humanised mouse lines carrying either the risk (AT) or the resiliency (CG) allele of the rs1360780 locus and exposed litters of these mice to maternal separation. Behavioural and physiological aspects of their adult stress responsiveness displayed interactions of genotype, early life condition, and sex. In humanised females carrying the CG- but not the AT-allele, ELA led to altered HPA axis functioning, exploratory behaviour, and sociability. These changes correlated with differential expression of genes in the hypothalamus, where synaptic transmission, metabolism, and circadian entrainment pathways were deregulated. Our data suggest an integrative role of FKBP5 in shaping the sex-specific outcome of ELA in adulthood."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058523452","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63aaf82640970732a0a532b8","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"27","number":"8","doi":null,"documentHash":"be321638-7a11-48c2-b807-ebcce3e23d1a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"3544-3555","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-022-01549-z.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63aaf82640970732a0a532c2","name":"Kelly

study aimed to determine the effect of L-carnitine and Bio-Mos administration on selected production performance, slaughter parameters, elemental and mineral content of liver, breast and thigh

The experiment was conducted on 360 six-week-old Big-6 turkey females, randomly divided into three groups of 120 birds each (six replicates of 20 birds). The turkeys of the control group were fed standard feed without additives; group II was fed with drinking water, a preparation containing L-carnitine at a dose of 0.83 mL/L, while group III was provided mixed feed with 0.5% Bio-Mos. The addition of L-carnitine and Bio-Mos increased body weight at 16 weeks (p = 0.047) and reduced the proportion of fat in the breast muscle (p = 0.029) and liver (p = 0.027). It also modified the content of some minerals in breast muscle, thigh muscle, liver, and bone. Furthermore, the addition of L-carnitine and Bio-Mos increased bone mass and length and modified the value of selected morphometric and strength parameters. The results indicate a positive effect of the applied feed additives on selected rearing indices and carcass quality while improving the elasticity and fracture toughness of the femur. There is a need for further research to determine optimal doses of L-carnitine and Bio-Mos in poultry nutrition."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058523454","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"770","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/4/770","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ffeb18a085dcb0e357dcc8d","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Jachimowicz-Rogowska","uuid":"EAD3B44AD4628FE89C58902FF375F1F88D65AD8F52EEA36218B95F0306B429AC695803631787DA5F3F02DEED2C0C39CE1D50D544580AC24C902888E4D44635A9","orcidId":"0000-0001-7540-813X","documentHash":"00157926-c786-4e89-af04-0727ae304234"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a047390a3c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Winiarska-Mieczan","uuid":"2C73DE6253E41BC2E574456AA1E116276677018F4BCBB3DB71580FD175207FAC95BAC1AAB3DBEFBC910CAF1498D3AC65804633059014C0405BE97A6CC4C8FAC6","orcidId":"0000-0003-1981-7005","documentHash":"6139e410-06ca-4974-8636-2c444402d2b1"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390975","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kwiecień","uuid":"2DE1EA2277F1D76ECAF0478A3925D05C2B7CBB0C1C69FA06DFF0BA6BA9D08097D67852A240194AFDB904C7B5B4E5CBB43775E8A3331B95EBE99C06EE786E8176","orcidId":"0000-0002-8047-8682","documentHash":"8ae7afe7-b1bc-4123-b3a5-97152237f09c"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a04739096c","name":"Wanda","lastName":"Krupa","uuid":"745811083F68E5ED1C1DC6CB849052FC1FE9B8E68624D3C164BE6E880A5069873890AD5E0A6509E36D0A02CE5DF6F7285DC3606D5D1F87085411D3D4AF9822BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-0148-2115","documentHash":"55252e76-eadd-4526-bccf-2fd421f54961"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390963","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Krauze","uuid":"08F232437BE0EB72F61DB5718C37FFF84C9ED7BBE7EA33825453E0C230DF163B2834915476DF8C40A2AE34037B12111B2F77526F32BE91E0F6EB7B361FF3280B","orcidId":"0000-0003-4287-4665","documentHash":"01ba7f83-660f-40aa-8188-a97388c58fa5"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Kwercetyna","Kosmetyki","Zdrowie","Uroda","Medycyna","Dieta"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Quercetin","Cosmetics","Health","Beauty","Medicine","Diet"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","uid":"bz_6XXECFL3_CFkpms5BsDQ","uuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","parentUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","rootUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","name":"Uniwersytet w Siedlcach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709420878c28a0473b6ae6"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Kwercetyna - właściwości kosmetyczne i prozdrowotne","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"64f04bfacf9a7471b0ea4129","mniswId":"201659","title":"Polish Journal of Cosmetology","doi":null,"issn":"1731-0083","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"95a24040-aac0-4e40-a54c-59713312df09"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6405ec2a40970761b8e26a79","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709420878c28a0473b6ae6"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Kwercetyna jest to jeden z najbardziej popularnych flawonoidów, zaliczany do grupy flawonoli.

It occurs naturally in vegetables (onion, broccoli, cabbage, sorrel, lettuce, asparagus), fruit (blueberry, black currant, cherry, strawberry), cereals (oats, buckwheat), plants (horsetail, chamomile, black elderberry, horse chestnut ) and in very large amounts in spices (tarragon, coriander, lovage, turmeric), as well as in red wine, coffee, green tea, beer, cocoa and chocolate. Extensive literature data confirm the health-promoting effect of quercetin. It has antioxidant, anti- inflammatory, anti-cancer and antiviral properties, and also supports the treatment of heart disease and obesity. In addition, extracts from flowers, leaves, seeds, seeds, fruits and roots of plants rich in quercetin are used in cosmetics. They can be easily found in cosmetics for skin and hair care, anti-aging cosmetics, sunscreen, anti-acne and anti-psoriasis cosmetics. They are often a component of cosmetic preparations for children."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058523456","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6405ec2a40970761b8e26a7a","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"f435ffd3-cec3-46fc-9b8a-ddf77fd949d1"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"143-151","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.kosmet.pl/pjc.php?opc=AR&lng=pl&art=1058","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709420878c28a0473b6ae6","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Jabłońska","uuid":"3C09608A0C3540958890C23A495AE9C708992D2921E87221C278D84422692A0CE8CEF4DC354CDADD5648B454C34EEE0D46CE659568B54B6BAA599A6043970781","orcidId":"0000-0001-9673-1761","documentHash":"5b1eb505-8ac1-406a-8ae8-c9f3748739cb"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Context-Dependent Regulation of Gene Expression by Non-Canonical Small RNAs","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547e60c","mniswId":"25194","title":"Non-coding RNA","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2311-553X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ff96ed16-0625-44db-b892-00d1e3ce81a6"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6405cd3e409707703558961f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6405cd3e4097077035589620","5e7092ef878c28a04739f804"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>In recent functional genomics studies, a large number of non-coding RNAs have been identified. It has become increasingly apparent that noncoding RNAs are crucial players in a wide range of cellular and physiological functions. They have been shown to modulate gene expression on different levels, including transcription, post-transcriptional processing, and translation. This review aims to highlight the diverse mechanisms of the regulation of gene expression by small noncoding RNAs in different conditions and different types of human cells. For this purpose, various cellular functions of microRNAs (miRNAs), circular RNAs (circRNAs), snoRNA-derived small RNAs (sdRNAs) and tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) will be exemplified, with particular emphasis on the diversity of their occurrence and on the effects on gene expression in different stress conditions and diseased cell types. The synthesis and effect on gene expression of these noncoding RNAs varies in different cell types and may depend on environmental conditions such as different stresses. Moreover, noncoding RNAs play important roles in many diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and viral infections.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058523459","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"8","pagesFromTo":"29","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6405cd3e4097077035589620","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Plawgo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"57e94c0f-a94a-4a6d-bd84-12be03174fcd"},{"objectId":"5e7092ef878c28a04739f804","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Raczyńska","uuid":"2162FB477F819769D794266EF77D152524FFC5165FBC5F695B77132964A7F9061A6853600DCBA5A575F33AD914573ECA11B84952E157245CD050DFF3972FBECB","orcidId":"0000-0002-3712-3528","documentHash":"5aa9014c-e8bc-45a8-997c-3faba784fa19"}],"doi":"10.3390/ncrna8030029"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["agricultural land prices","agricultural land market","agricultural property","undeveloped property"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Agricultural Land Transaction Prices Against the Background of Property Intended for Investment Purposes in Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a3d7","mniswId":"25872","title":"Real Estate Management and Valuation","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2300-5289","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"09674b60-4af0-4483-a8fd-8d3dd2480867"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-22","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6406f22c40970770355cb197","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7091fc878c28a04738e204","65e96a0240970762631a1be4","65e96a0240970762631a1be5","65e96a0240970762631a1be6","65e96a0240970762631a1be7"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Since  Poland’s  accession  to  the  European  Union  in  2004,  a  steady  increase  in  transaction  prices  of  agricultural  property  has  been  observed.  Also  in  other  countries,  mainly  in  Eastern  and  Central  Europe,  there  has  been  an  ongoing  increase  in  the  prices  of  agricultural  land.  The  situation  on  the  agricultural  land  market  is  influenced  not  only  by  the  market  mechanisms,  but  also  by  the  political  decisions, including the restrictions in land properties turnover. The purpose of the study is to analyse the  agricultural  land  market  in  Poland  and  to  determine  the  relationship  of  average  land  prices  for  housing, service and industrial purposes against the average prices of agricultural land in 2004-2019. In  the  course  of  the  study,  price  changes  on  the  discussed  market  were  assessed  as  well  as  the  forecasts  and  simulations  concerning  the  prices  of  agricultural  property  and  land  intended  for  the  selected  investment  purposes  were  prepared.

However, this is not possible for every infant. Therefore, a second choice of feeding, as close as possible to the gold standard, is needed. For historical reasons, this has been cow's-milk-based feeding. This paper discusses if this second-choice feeding method should contain intact protein or partially hydrolyzed proteins. The limited data available indicates that mother's milk is relatively rich in bioactive peptides. Whether partially hydrolyzed protein might be a protein source closer to human milk protein content than intact cow's milk needs further research. However, more research on protein and bioactive peptides in mother's milk should be a priority for future scientific development in this field. Results of such research will also provide an answer to the question of which option would be the best second choice for infant feeding if sufficient breast milk is not

errors of purine and pyrimidine (P/P) metabolism are under-reported and rarely mentioned in the general literature or in clinical practice, as well as in reviews dedicated to other inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs). However, their diagnosis is important because genetic counseling can be provided and, in some cases, specific treatment exists that may slow or even reverse clinical signs. The purpose of this review is to provide a practical guideline on the suspicion and investigation of inborn errors of P/P metabolism. Failure of a physician to recognize the presence of these disorders may be devastating for affected infants and children because of its permanent effects in the patient, and for their parents because of implications for future offspring. Diagnosis is crucial because genetic counseling can be provided and, in some cases, specific treatment can be offered that may slow or even reverse clinical symptoms. This review highlights the risk factors in the history, the important examination findings, and the appropriate biochemical investigation of the child. Herein we describe the approach to the diagnosis of P/P disorders and emphasize clinical situations in which physicians should consider these diseases as diagnostic possibilities."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058523471","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63aae39e40970732a0a413b3","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"136","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"3906753c-f82c-4b5c-973f-85836724f862"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"136","pagesFromTo":"164-176","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1096719222001391?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63aae39e40970732a0a413b4","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Jurecka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"133dae79-fc4a-48fe-9a5f-7fc32a86b709"},{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b22c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Tylki-Szymańska","uuid":"8D9EA4667BF5C6EDAF222B8EFD804E158C350FE33E715C11A94C71326A8B5503D8D29EC2C7F445BCFD1F71D75518B8D3D1DE5A2365B609C4570E4905EB8DA62A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a84e74f1-a27f-440f-988f-112f60dd27cd"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ymgme.2022.02.007"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["anemia, fenugreek supplementation, hemoglobin, PCV, hematopoietic stem cells"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Effect of fenugreek seed supplementation on Hemoglobin and PCV among 20-30 years old females: a pilot study","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5ebff443ad49b31ccec1447b","mniswId":null,"title":"European Journal of Translational and Clinical Medicine","doi":null,"issn":"2657-3148","eissn":"2657-3156","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"a487381d-6af8-4fac-8024-1d52c3128e0c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2022-03-09","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63aaee1740970732a0a4ad83","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63aaee1740970732a0a4ad84"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background\nFemales are more likely than males to suffer from anemia. There have been many studies investigating the nutritional qualities of traditional plants. The of this study was to assess the effect of fenugreek seeds on hemoglobin and PCV values in 20-30 years old females.\n\nMaterial and methods\nBaseline hematological tests were obtained from 10 females aged 20-30 years. Supplementation of the standard amount of fenugreek was given to the population. After 48 days the same hematological parameters were analyzed as a post-test. The results of the pre- and post-test analysis were compared by using a paired-sample t-test. Relevant details were also collected and analyzed.\n\nResults\nThe mean value of hemoglobin before supplementation (Hb1) and hemoglobin after supplementation (Hb2) was 12.3200 and 11.3300 respectively and the mean value of packed cell volume before (PCV1) and after supplementation (PCV2) was 36.7970 and 35.4700, respectively. This shows that there is a mild decrease in hemoglobin and PCV values after fenugreek supplementation, but not at a statistically significant level.\n\nConclusions\nWithin the limitations of our pilot study, we conclude that fenugreek has no significant effect on Hemoglobin and PCV values and can’t be used as an exact supplement to cure anemia."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058523472","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63aaecc340970732a0a49c36","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"5","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"31187d46-2412-4592-96c5-2d1608ea7ebb"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"5","pagesFromTo":"27-32","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ejtcm.gumed.edu.pl/articles/115.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63aaee1740970732a0a4ad84","name":"Brundha","lastName":"MP","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e059d42a-266c-41d8-a905-fa3d111824ae"}],"doi":"10.31373/ejtcm/145360"},{"mainLanguageName":"niemiecki","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63f4d3cb4097075e45d446b6","doi":null,"title":"Stadtleben

in molecular technologies, from genomics and transcriptomics to epigenetics, are providing unprecedented insight into the molecular landscape of pediatric tumors. Multi-omics approaches provide an opportunity to identify a wide spectrum of molecular alterations that account for the initiation of the neoplastic process in children, response to treatment and disease progression. The detection of molecular markers is crucial to assist clinicians in accurate tumor diagnosis, risk stratification, disease subtyping, prediction of treatment response, and surveillance, allowing also for personalized cancer management. This review summarizes the most recent developments in genomics research and their relevance to the field of pediatric oncology with the aim of generating an overview of the most important, from the clinical perspective, molecular markers for pediatric solid tumors. We present an overview of the molecular markers selected based on therapeutic protocols, guidelines from international committees and scientific societies, and published data."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058523485","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62455d922467f01551375ae2","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"11","number":"7","doi":null,"documentHash":"9f69bcab-e967-46ff-8b84-8af42ef9ecbc"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1238","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/11/7/1238/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afcdc","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Trubicka","uuid":"343B7E9415674F1B4222B9235A8EB16BD6F197173E7FDABD2D24BFCE66FE9134AA57664805B1EABE7FC08097D26DDC1C4BF11C89B643242539FADC16A3EC4917","orcidId":"0000-0002-9848-3674","documentHash":"a364519f-71d6-4a99-ba11-73f15cba0ae1"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afc8d","name":"Bożenna","lastName":"Dembowska-Bagińska","uuid":"DEA71BD812489C0D0A4A795AD6D127F2CA445A57B5A25A5EC2EA56E773142DBA99B172AD7FEEDBD5AD09B0F6A1B56376FA0078B53B96B61C8B70C19CA4D42C63","orcidId":"0000-0002-3845-5380","documentHash":"e145e42d-73b4-4aed-b018-150294b1db81"},{"objectId":"5e70927a878c28a047396747","name":"Wiesława","lastName":"Grajkowska","uuid":"E5238D8F2D3E769723941F0278A2DADDF97424259B2CE12BF83BFF3D9AE3FC9B3069BCEB7064B0057652584BA2A8A38453AB098C24B9D61FDA95565A9DBD2B16","orcidId":"0000-0001-8318-5781","documentHash":"53205405-0c1c-488c-9f2b-fe8718a006d9"}],"doi":"10.3390/cells11071238"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["prosthetic ankle","ankle kinematics","above knee amputee","prosthetic gait","energy storage and release foot"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61c98f6b2467f00f2d4e0385","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"University of Diyala","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63ab227e40970732a0a8e047","63ab227e40970732a0a8e045"]},{"id":"61b1f7682467f0304b97dec3","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"University of Baghdad","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63ab227e40970732a0a8e046"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Design and kinematic investigation of an actuated prosthetic ankle during walking","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"Eastern-European Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-4061","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"3937afea-5395-4435-850d-06bbeb29d2c9"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-31","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63ab227e40970732a0a8e044","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63ab227e40970732a0a8e045","63ab227e40970732a0a8e046","63ab227e40970732a0a8e047"]},"issue":"7 (119)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Due to the varied needs of persons who have lost a lower limb in their everyday lives, ankle-foot prosthetic technology is continually evolving. Numerous prosthetic ankles have been created in recent years to restore the ankle function of lower limb amputees. Most ankle foot prostheses, on the other hand, are passive, such as the solid ankle cushion heel and the energy storage and release foot (ESAR). The solid ankle foot can only provide steady vertical support during ambulation; however, the ESAR foot can store energy and gradually release it throughout human walking periods, hence increasing the walking pace of amputees. The aim of this work is to describe the design and manufacture of an actuated ankle-foot prosthesis. The main benefit of powered ankles is that they are capable of mimicking natural stride, particularly in steep or uneven terrain conditions. The primary objective is to establish two degrees of freedom of ankle rotation in two planes, plantar flexion and dorsiflexion in the sagittal plane, besides inversion and eversion in the frontal plane. As software can improve the gait stability, an automatic modifiable transmission arrangement was prepared for delivering the current design motions in the sagittal plane based on empirical collected biomechanical data related to passive prosthetic normal gait circumstances. However, the ankle rolling in the frontal plane was guided mechanically by means of mono leaf spring. The majority of the ankle mechanical components are made of 7075-T6 aluminum alloy and are integrated onto ESAR carbon fiber laminated foot. For a unilateral above-knee amputee, the ankle function at self-selected walking was assessed, achieving maximum results of 10° inversion, 10° eversion, 12° plantar flexion and 18° dorsiflexion ankle angles. Also, the patient gait experiment in a normal cadence showed an improvement in plantar flexion behavior for the powered ankle in contrast with the passive ankle"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058523487","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ab1d7740970732a0a8b476","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"5","number":"7 (119)","doi":null,"documentHash":"35363c3e-d779-439f-bb58-995a4b875c2b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"5","pagesFromTo":"68-75","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/265736/262420","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63ab227e40970732a0a8e047","name":"Mohammed S.","lastName":"Saleh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"451ca8a3-36ba-4c6b-b99f-1690e6c9ed1a"},{"objectId":"63ab227e40970732a0a8e046","name":"Ahmed Abdul Hussein","lastName":"Ali","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f7c0277d-b2ac-4857-aeea-cfffb27c696e"},{"objectId":"63ab227e40970732a0a8e045","name":"Mohammed Ismael","lastName":"Hameed","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4d24b00c-7941-4b37-b289-94b55a24cc87"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.265736"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["phyllotaxis","auxin","vascular system","shoot apical meristem","organogenesis","polar auxin transport (PAT)","PIN proteins"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922e878c28a047391413","5e70922e878c28a0473912f7"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Organ Patterning at the Shoot Apical Meristem (SAM): The Potential Role of the Vascular System","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454798b1","mniswId":"19204","title":"Symmetry","doi":null,"issn":"2073-8994","eissn":"2073-8994","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"ec1f2ba6-629f-4b47-80a8-79406b798877"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63f496594097075e45ce1c52","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922e878c28a0473912f7","5e70922e878c28a047391413"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Auxin, which is transported in the outermost cell layer, is one of the major players involved in plant organ initiation and positioning at the shoot apical meristem (SAM).

Different internal signals have been proposed; however, their nature and transport route have not been precisely determined. Therefore, in this mini-review, we aimed to summarize the current knowledge regarding the auxin-dependent regulation of organ positioning at the SAM and to discuss the vascular system as a potential route for internal signals. In addition, as regular organ patterning is a universal phenomenon, we focus on the role of the vasculature in this process in the major lineages of land plants, i.e., bryophytes, lycophytes, ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058523488","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63d7a2a24097074c74280f1b","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"bb2fae1d-2a1d-41ad-84d8-79174bf8dadd"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/15/2/364/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70922e878c28a047391413","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Gola","uuid":"D44AAC9054ED254B1216BEF258E72A7AC6F1F602850582F95B28C006876CFFE72CC1D92652ED6A9E6382F202C4836A858A78C9AFB64764C3B2B4822BFD40DF45","orcidId":"0000-0002-4111-6785","documentHash":"6416f2c5-35a8-4c80-8ce1-799c85b5303c"},{"objectId":"5e70922e878c28a0473912f7","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Banasiak","uuid":"678F22B515C72D9BAC6FBB8FA21BFC359A754623F58BC85DAA05DD807026E30ABDD499670587ED49CEC9D297E6E0543C00E8034489EF1C98D55F6C47510F69D3","orcidId":"0000-0003-4293-8948","documentHash":"4fee44d4-590b-464e-bc1a-1861c368c505"}],"doi":"10.3390/sym15020364"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A new species of the genus Aulobia Kethley (Acariformes: Syringophilidae) parasitizing Daphoenositta chrysoptera (Passeriformes: Neosittidae) in Australia","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476d97","mniswId":"50","title":"Acarologia","doi":null,"issn":"0044-586X","eissn":"2107-7207","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ad9d2787-de06-4e76-a389-bf2274edadf4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-12","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6405d25a409707703558b2a1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ef878c28a04739f78c","6405d25a409707703558b2a2","5e7092ef878c28a04739f803"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>The small passerine family Neosittidae has never been checked under the presence of ectoparasitic mites of the family Syringophilidae (Acariformes: Prostigmata).

A specialized pilot line was used for the tests, and after cleaning, the waste was melted and then were continuously cast in the form of rods and hollow rods. The cleaning efficiency was assessed, and the manufactured semi-finished products were subjected to tests, including the assessment of the chemical and mechanical homogeneity and the structure of the test batch of the semi-finished casting products in terms of the possibility of manufacturing products meeting the requirements of technical specifications. The obtained results, both in terms of a stable chemical composition, homogeneous and reproducible mechanical properties, fully compliant with the specifications for fittings bronzes (CC499K), as well

The results show that the analyzed reviews make frequent use of general cinematic terms and more specific lexis denoting the different types and (sub)genres of cinematic productions represented by the reviewed films. Other salient lexical features include a high concentration of referential but low concentration of stance bundles, though attitudinal items, particularly evaluation adjectives, significantly enrich the lexical inventory of the reviews.

As the international space sector continues to boom, accessible space weather products, tools and education are increasingly important to ensure that space actors (both old and new) are equipped with the knowledge of how space weather influences their activities and applications. At RMIT University, the initiative was taken to develop a Space Weather Prediction Laboratory exercise for students as part of its new offering of a Bachelor’s Degree in Space Science in 2020. This new Space Weather Prediction Lab exercise is offered as part of an undergraduate course on “Space Exploration”, which has a diverse student in-take, including students with no background in physics; a key detail in the design of the Lab. The aims of the Space Weather Prediction Lab were to: (1) provide a short and intense introduction to the near-Earth space environment and its impact on various human technologies; (2) give students “hands-on” training in data analysis, interpretation and communication; and (3) create an immersive space science experience for students that encourages learning, scientific transparency and teamwork. The format of the lab that was developed can be easily scaled in difficulty to suit the students’ technical level, either by including more/less space weather datasets in the analysis or by analyzing more/less complicated space weather events. The details of the Space Weather Prediction Lab developed and taught at RMIT in 2020, in both face-to-face and online formats, are presented."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058523504","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.swsc-journal.org/articles/swsc/pdf/2022/01/swsc210070.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eadfe040970762632b694d","name":"Ian D.","lastName":"Peake","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9a48abbe-cc03-43d7-9f97-582b4e7804ff"},{"objectId":"65eadfe040970762632b694c","name":"Tamitha","lastName":"Skov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"25c3d438-cfb0-4005-a953-58adf2739815"},{"objectId":"65eadfe040970762632b694b","name":"Julie","lastName":"Currie","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fe3342dc-3675-45ac-bedd-a34575e2438b"},{"objectId":"65eadfe040970762632b694a","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Hordyniec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ee7e03f1-9445-46e7-b44b-1891de629e8d"},{"objectId":"65eadfe040970762632b6949","name":"Suelynn","lastName":"Choy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"14e1bee4-5653-4fa6-bad2-71f9ca72eab7"},{"objectId":"65eadfe040970762632b6948","name":"Samantha Le","lastName":"May","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"82357a29-300f-4187-9527-3b1558bc1174"},{"objectId":"65eadfe040970762632b6947","name":"Murray","lastName":"Parkinson","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7c78d30a-2496-4ebe-972f-bdbcd8d8cb0b"},{"objectId":"65eadfe040970762632b6946","name":"Zahra","lastName":"Bouya","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1d5127e8-8a4f-4c46-b502-de6bece31bdf"},{"objectId":"65eadfe040970762632b6945","name":"Vasily","lastName":"Lobzin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"baba04ca-7d78-473b-8639-b82a1b677b71"},{"objectId":"65eadfe040970762632b6944","name":"Michael","lastName":"Terkildsen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c7b7d267-425f-4bf0-ad2d-50f13b4c692e"},{"objectId":"65eadfe040970762632b6943","name":"Tam","lastName":"Dao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"31be0afa-015e-4543-971d-a18a3326803f"},{"objectId":"65eadfe040970762632b6942","name":"Ronald","lastName":"Maj","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aad286ec-43c1-476b-aceb-9e87884f3727"},{"objectId":"65eadfe040970762632b6941","name":"Andoh M.","lastName":"Afful","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bfc76317-be50-42b7-8eac-38456fe2cca2"},{"objectId":"65eadfe040970762632b6940","name":"Rekha","lastName":"Raju","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bdecedc2-5f97-4c2e-87e1-b15f1a79a65e"},{"objectId":"65eadfe040970762632b693f","name":"Gail N.","lastName":"Iles","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d9749ed7-f222-4660-80ee-a8666586dd28"},{"objectId":"65eadfe040970762632b693e","name":"Brett A.","lastName":"Carter","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"05b797db-a2db-4ac2-bad9-4c8734cf86c1"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6d9a","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Hordyniec","uuid":"C0E649D7D50D0FD12998E87F368A612C58E11B290A01CB45016E1D61073243B300967A3A752FA92B75C0BE1E2BBA77DA9EE2EAFF002E98592A33B1394CE76F29","orcidId":"0000-0002-2404-3422","documentHash":"8e5f818d-5239-437a-9700-b2b73ce271c5"}],"doi":"10.1051/swsc/2022025"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["prefabricated perforated pipeline","variable flow rate","hydraulic friction factor"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"619f58742467f07d98671ee0","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63ab21fd40970732a0a8dc69","63ab21fd40970732a0a8dc6b"]},{"id":"5ec5a8eead49b340fb5582c4","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"O.

Clarification of this issue will make it possible to solve an important engineering task – to devise a reliable procedure for the hydraulic calculation of perforated pipes. The experiments were carried out on an assembled experimental bench. A steel pipeline with a perforated part of 1–3 m was investigated. Perforation holes were taken with a diameter of 3.6 and 9 mm. In the experiments, fluid flow, pressure loss, and average velocity were measured. Based on the data obtained, the values of the coefficient under study were calculated. It has been established that it is significantly larger than its values with uniform movement and is variable in length of the pipeline. Experimental dependences λcol on the value of the ratio of the velocities of the flowing jets of liquid to the average flow velocity in the corresponding section (Uh/V), as well as on the design characteristics of the channel, were obtained. It is shown that the lower value of the degree of pipe perforation corresponds to the higher values of λcol. This result can be explained by the influence of the attached flow rate on the main flow. The confirmation of this conclusion is the resulting shapes of diagrams of the average flow velocity obtained in the experiments, which differ significantly from standard diagrams with uniform motion. Obviously, additional energy is spent on the reformation of the velocities, and this causes additional head losses. Dependences were obtained for calculating the considered coefficient for prefabricated pipelines, including in the presence of transit flow rate.

paper reports selected ideas and preliminary results on\r\nNN-based learning simple numerical properties from visual data. Specifically, we use datasets of small images with single-pixel dots (one to\r\nten dots in each image) to visually estimate integers (ranging from 1\r\nto 10), to distinguish between even and odd numbers, and to identify\r\nsome other numerical properties. Small fully-connected NN’s and convolutional NN’s are used as learning architectures. The obtained results\r\nare inconclusive. First, it seems that FCNN architectures are superior\r\nto CNN’s, which are apparently hardly able to learn the abstractions\r\nof numbers. Surprisingly, such conclusions contradict results presented\r\nin a recently published paper on similar topics. Secondly, the concepts\r\nof even and odd numbers cannot be learned directly from visual examples, even by FCNN’s. We preliminarily hypothesize that basic numerical\r\nproperties can or cannot be learned by simple NN architectures depending on whether the property divides the considered set of integers into\r\nconnected subsets (e.g. 1, 2 and larger numbers) or disjointed ones (e.g.\r\neven versus odd numbers). Nevertheless, the obtained results are still\r\nconsidered preliminary, and they require further theoretical analysis and\r\nexperimental

paper proposes a simple mathematical model based on the variable fractional-order difference equation of a robot arm. The model of the described arm does not consider the impact of the movement of the mobile platform, it was assumed that all degrees of freedom would be taken away from it. The implementation of the task was divided into two stages. First, a mechanical model was developed. In order to estimate the torques of nodal propulsion motors, a description of the components of the Lagrange equation for the considered system, i.e., energy, power, and external interactions, and derivation of the equations of motion of the tested manipulator based on the Lagrange equation was made. An additional criterion was also considered in the selection of drives in the kinematic nodes of the links, which was to set the manipulator in a vertical position at a specific time. Processing the measured data of a robot arm, model parameters were selected, and the order function was chosen. The second stage was a simulation, whose results were compared with the collected data."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058523516","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63fefa6d4097077035e03c05","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"13","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"7794d04b-f96b-46a4-b9ab-375ad09b9902"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/5/3304","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67345fa1fdbe830349f27bff","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Ostalczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cc025eab-9660-4616-89c7-e28a0ad22902"},{"objectId":"5e709438878c28a0473b850a","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Duch","uuid":"D363A38032BF314CA8DFFB96F30CDFD7F0D797E692F7BF24C2765814AE4BF1CA2BE1A233B85F4AAF44C5287CB58A42FC96E409675275CCD26B799777287D45D8","orcidId":"0000-0003-0656-1215","documentHash":"137816be-3897-47ee-9826-6b66cc1f7f42"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395305","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Bąkała","uuid":"F79F5ED9BDB5C1FE8DD21B272DA84EE64B19D4EF57023DFECF1283E952A5141031D4F203E68070390033198C95DA5C1059DF2B9E4A5D21429997F5F5B48C5F4B","orcidId":"0000-0002-1081-0299","documentHash":"f2d63ca5-2542-4b5b-9b79-13095a2bc84f"}],"doi":"10.3390/app13053304"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"9783031042850","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Learning with Technologies and Technologies in Learning: Experience, Trends and Challenges in Higher Education","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":706,"publicationPlace":"Cham","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6405f91d40970761b8e3609b","editors":[{"objectId":"6405f91d40970761b8e3609e","name":"Dominik","lastName":"May","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"46284532-2580-499b-915c-71093742082e"},{"objectId":"6405f91d40970761b8e3609d","name":"Andreas","lastName":"Pester","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ea0be324-a0d7-4645-8e12-22cde84f6a70"},{"objectId":"6405f91d40970761b8e3609c","name":"Michael E.","lastName":"Auer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4f7018c9-fb7a-4e2a-9f9e-3b0c9dd4bc8f"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["6405f91d40970761b8e3609c","6405f91d40970761b8e3609d","6405f91d40970761b8e3609e"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058523518","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":"2367-3370","series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-04286-7.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-04286-7"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["focal epilepsy;","Functional Source Separation (FSS);","EEG;","transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS);","Higuchi Fractal Dimension (HFD);","Directed Transfer Function (DTF)"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","uid":"bkEpmzcrGCPt0315VKw4X4A","uuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","parentUuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de99","rootUuid":"399f9c59-9808-4097-8a56-2e137e38b932","name":"Instytut Biocybernetyki i Inżynierii Biomedycznej im.

Network identification is achieved with the Functional Source Separation (FSS) algorithm applied to electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, the neurodynamics quantified through signal complexity with the Higuchi Fractal Dimension (HFD), and functional connectivity with the Directed Transfer Function (DTF). This PoC is enhanced by the data collected before and after neuromodulation via transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS, both Real and Sham) in a single drug-resistant epileptic person. We observed that the signal complexity of the epileptogenic network, reduced in the pre-Real, pre-Sham, and post-Sham, reached the level of the rest of the brain post-Real tDCS. DTF changes post-Real tDCS were maintained after one month. The proposed approach can represent a valuable tool to enhance understanding of the relationship between brain neurodynamics characteristics, the effects of non-invasive brain stimulation, and epileptic symptoms."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058523521","journalIssue":{"objectId":"632c46704097076d6d43b0e0","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"9","doi":null,"documentHash":"b92b37eb-da9a-40a4-8704-8cc1303e729b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1179","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3425/12/9/1179/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63f5ef1f409707158a86567c","name":"Franca","lastName":"Tecchio","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b3cb3664-a963-47cb-ac09-d89c8bd9ebed"},{"objectId":"63f5ef1f409707158a86567b","name":"Giovanni","lastName":"Assenza","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"681e6e1f-fdb6-4440-9dd9-b2f4ac9b2567"},{"objectId":"63f5ef1f409707158a86567a","name":"Luca","lastName":"Paulon","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3493252c-56c9-4b76-b7cc-b953b3eb18ae"},{"objectId":"63f5ef1f409707158a865679","name":"Giovanni","lastName":"Pellegrino","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e189296a-0eb4-4745-b3a3-6025409f4b90"},{"objectId":"63f5ef1f409707158a865678","name":"Annalisa","lastName":"Pascarella","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"38d199ca-bd72-4263-90c0-99f92ae90001"},{"objectId":"63f5ef1f409707158a865677","name":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Ricci","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"08b41985-b845-4a37-953f-29810883790a"},{"objectId":"63f5ef1f409707158a865676","name":"Filippo","lastName":"Zappasodi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2832e91f-7c36-4a1a-9235-2ea082019caa"},{"objectId":"5e709276878c28a0473960f1","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Olejarczyk","uuid":"AA49507487E8180AC0DABD5167B2827C383F0FFAC24A7AE1A7805354B2301916DBCA03EA49C5857314A5C329AC3453516000A31BA090EF9939753FC39039C658","orcidId":"0000-0002-6821-350X","documentHash":"d4f70f48-55cf-4d77-9da0-82a3111a8ea0"}],"doi":"10.3390/brainsci12091179"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63f5eb26409707158a85fe9f","doi":null,"title":"Monografia

These phenomena reduce the attractiveness of the city and result in a degradation of the quality of life for its residents. In light of these phenomena, there is a clear need for intelligent management of urban space using new technologies that would be complementary to existing intelligent transportation systems. Expanding information resources obtained from mobile cameras will have a positive impact on increasing the efficiency of transportation management and use of limited space in city centers. It will also have an impact on reducing external transport costs and increasing the quality of logistics services provided in the city. The main aim of the paper is to develop a concept of a transport management system in cities using mobile vision systems mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles. The model will concern the cases of lane occupation by freight vehicles and the analysis of parking spaces in the city in order to improve their management. The results of the developed model will contribute to the automation of the parking space management process and increase the efficiency of the use of city parking space

308 chickens were used to investigate fatty acid (FA) composition and oxidative stability of broiler chicken meat following the controlled inhibition of peroxidation in feed containing a concentrated source of omega-3 fatty acids (flaxseed oil, FLO), approximately 50% omega-3. Ninety-six one-day-old chicks were randomly allocated to four dietary treatments (n = 24/group) that included rapeseed oil (RO), flaxseed oil (FLO), RO with optimised quercetin (Q) – RO_Q, or FLO with optimised Q (FLO_Q). On day 35, breast and thigh muscles were collected in order to analyse their FA profile and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Dietary treatments had no effect on weight gain or feed conversion ratio in chickens. However, dietary FLO increased the deposition of α-linolenic acid in both pectoral and thigh meat (P < 0.05), and tended to decrease the ratio of omega-6/omega-3 FA in pectoral muscles (P < 0.07). Addition of an optimised concentration of Q proved to be an efficient way of limiting lipoperoxidation in breast and thigh muscles subjected to refrigeration at 2–3 °C for either 1 or 7 days. Results were consistent with the observed inhibition of peroxidation in feed mixtures and significantly correlated with MDA levels found in feed mixtures.

This involved simulating the results of navigational measurements subject to errors (including gross errors) used to position the SV swimming along a given trajectory in the vicinity of three beacons. We showed an apparent increase in the SV positioning accuracy, from approximately 9 m of Root Mean Square (RMS) obtained by DR and GLSA methods, to approximately 2 m (RMS), achieved using GRA and EKF methods. We also showed that, by interchanging GRA and EKF methods, it is still possible to increase the positioning accuracy of the SV up to 1.14 m (RMS). However, such an interchange should occur after the experimentally determined limit of the mean error of the position coordinates estimated by the GRA method has been exceeded."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526231","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63e48e514097076b4a115bb7","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"13","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"fde8264e-b304-423a-81f7-c9d246b84141"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"2110","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/4/2110/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709241878c28a04739287d","name":"Piotr","lastName":"SZYMAK","uuid":"CB34D05F6BFC98398873A6260B1A5E2E1A60F9098FEED8BD1419EB7092EAD52698362BFC0D0B5161621D98F8FBA30FE6C9364172153431BCF82A3556DAE4EC43","orcidId":"0000-0002-4714-6192","documentHash":"56b7cb57-872a-4d3a-a6b2-46a1fd0a70cc"},{"objectId":"5e709236878c28a047391c51","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"NAUS","uuid":"496CCB388167C7C7183CEE304DB7CC7D8E33802435A5341AB7B718FB25676B1B7236056C001965698B741FC09F4C1D8BBAE75CA833B76531280D8ED0871BBF06","orcidId":"0000-0001-7379-4428","documentHash":"5ced9c94-89f2-486e-8456-dc1e58b6bb21"}],"doi":"10.3390/app13042110"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["guava","amino acids","glycine","fruit quality","yield"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398362"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Growth Performance of Guava Trees after the Exogenous Application of Amino Acids Glutamic Acid, Arginine, and Glycine","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547ed47","mniswId":"27373","title":"Horticulturae","doi":null,"issn":"2311-7524","eissn":"2311-7524","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d9822e24-c608-4514-bb91-1457594f0cb4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-25","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63f724d04097074c8dc31303","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63f724d04097074c8dc31305","63f724d04097074c8dc31306","63f724d04097074c8dc31307","5e709292878c28a047398362","63f724d04097074c8dc31308","63f724d04097074c8dc31309"]},"issue":"12","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A 2020–2021 study was performed on five-year-old guava trees to examine the influence of the foliar application of three amino acids, glycine, arginine, and glutamic acid, at a concentration of 500 or 1000 ppm. Additionally, two combinations of the three mentioned amino acids were also applied: 500 glycine + 500 arginine + 500 glutamic acid (combination 1) and 1000 glycine + 1000 arginine + 1000 glutamic acid (combination 2), and compared with a control (untreated trees). The results indicated that the application of the three amino acids, solely or in combination, was effective at increasing the shoot length, shoot diameter, and leaf chlorophyll. Additionally, the applied treatments also improved markedly the fruit set percentage, fruit yield, fruit firmness, fruit content of total soluble solids (TSS %), vitamin C (VC), and total sugars as well as the leaf mineral content (nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus) compared with untreated trees in 2020 and 2021.

Business process management is a response to, among other things, the increasing turbulence of the business environment and the individualization of customer needs and expectations. A dynamically developing and widely used model for the provision and use of IT solutions is cloud computing. Business process management using cloud computing is a solution that can help service companies face the accompanying challenges. The article presents the practical possibilities of business process management using cloud computing, the challenges and the way forward. As a first step, the article presents the potential of business process management using cloud computing in the context of enterprise needs.

In our case those were forced labourers – Poles obliged in the Third Reich to wear the “P” symbol indicating their ethnicity. Because of the nature of the topic, an interdisciplinary approach was necessary. The first part of the paper recalls briefly the history of forced labour in Germany during World War 2 as well as illustrates with some examples the everyday life difficulties of the workers. All the samples analysed in this study are taken from an anthology by Anna Kosmulska, who collected and published them twice in 1995 and 2020 (2nd revised and expanded edition). It is an interesting fact that many of the people with the “P” symbol decided to stay after the war in the region and the city where they were forced to work for Germans. The article tries to find traces of orality in the redacted text of primordially spoken testimonies. To investigate that we decided to apply the theory of five indicators of spoken language by Bartmiński and Niebrzegowska-Bartmińska as well as certain statistical analyses (including sentence length, the relation between Polish conjunction i and preposition w, FOG index). Moreover, we discuss the communication situation of the witnesses of history together with the question of the existence of discourse community within this group and analyse the keywords of their testimonies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526243","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"61–72","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.34616/ajmp.2022.15.5","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64071fcf40970770355d1af5","name":"Kacper","lastName":"Rosner-Leszczyński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1835e529-c99a-48e5-8c63-623d634723fd"},{"objectId":"5f86bb7c085dcb410a25ef15","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Bekieszczuk","uuid":"1A9F097A0008054F67476573F17AEC0B3DEAE1FA7D712610EE2241D05DF900A11F31F002BE0B0F2E44DF45A25BE976C29C06C9AB6FDF9F88FBEDDB2F109132B4","orcidId":"0000-0003-2281-3830","documentHash":"9b9386fd-ff7f-47fc-aa7a-58dee6abc006"}],"doi":"10.34616/ajmp.2022.15.5"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet

erosion, accelerated in sloped landscapes by intense cultivation (ploughing), can rapidly degrade humus-rich topsoil horizons of chernozemic soils, leading to an irreversible loss of the most valuable soil resources, in particular in areas with relict Chernozems/Phaeozems. An afforestation can effectively control erosion rates, but dense canopy forests are commonly listed among factors that support the transformation of Chernozems into Luvisols/Retisols. A comparison of the morphology and physico-chemical properties of adjacent arable and forest soils was carried out in four catenas located in the patches of relict chernozemic soils in the loess belt of south-east Poland. An analysis has evidenced that mixed broadleaf forests have generated during the 200–300-year-long period (an approximate time since afforestation of the sites under study) topsoil acidification (by approximately 1–1.5 grade compared to adjacent arable soils), base cations leaching (below 10 cmol(+) kg−1), decrease of soil organic carbon pools (by 15–35% in the soil column of 0–50 cm) and clay depletion (by ca. 4%). The subsurface Bt (argic) horizons have developed in all afforested and some of arable soil profiles. However, all studied forest soils preserved the mollic or chernic horizons and in most cases retained the same reference soil group as adjacent arable soils (Chernozem or Phaeozem). It means that even in temperate humid climate as in south-east Poland, mixed broadleaf forests, consisting of tree species known with little acidifying impact on soil, may not rapidly degrade Chernozems. The observed evidence of physicochemical and morphological transformation is apparently weaker than the reported soil destruction caused by water erosion and justifies the controlled afforestation of the relict Chernozems and Phaeozems as a means of their preservation against rapid loss."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526248","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"30","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352009422000554/pdfft?md5=20981e953bbc8953a015a9dfc181c2be&pid=1-s2.0-S2352009422000554-main.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a37de40970762633a2cd7","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Mlynek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7b1c157d-037b-4dd3-8c16-cad7760871f0"},{"objectId":"662a37de40970762633a2cd6","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Gruszka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"014d223e-8f1e-4a8f-bec7-a1acbde7cf56"},{"objectId":"662a37de40970762633a2cd5","name":"Michał","lastName":"Dudek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7dba5a41-a188-4d49-8c01-c6ed2a82bbfb"},{"objectId":"5e709360878c28a0473a8601","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Waroszewski","uuid":"1D8D7BE0C3C4C6E1F0A8D9BE9CDAFD7ABA5968B6661C3A1279786001166DD6CD451A48A4B247E754EE83DD72A5054D3E4253916C5EFE19006EA37C54BF7704B5","orcidId":"0000-0002-3064-4232","documentHash":"8db5b334-1575-4cd7-85c7-ac99a8b0f0b5"},{"objectId":"5e70920d878c28a04738f2c8","name":"Adam","lastName":"Bogacz","uuid":"446B988FB73E8E481CF0FF7934443787398BF428F690F479F4CFC834B94646602C4A66AF80A891209E2A303A13D3CB1363F4A3073CDA424A4C471423FCD3D2D8","orcidId":"0000-0001-5535-6934","documentHash":"d92d7723-2800-4fd6-9b62-dbe0bd53b1cb"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e230","name":"Beata","lastName":"Łabaz","uuid":"8406E6A1ED619554B565A604766930DBE8269EC2E70691DC4AB92928DDA2C86050D1A7E96D2CAAEDB748253E6F5AF122F49418DD379F38741F9A6B619D506E9E","orcidId":"0000-0003-0957-015X","documentHash":"21627ec9-e044-4590-bb43-01fd644e3212"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e22b","name":"Cezary","lastName":"Kabała","uuid":"C7E20E83413AAA0ED0B12CCA72BE2F7F09EB42BC4AB605BBDA5D5FC56186D9D89E2E3EE42019BD8981EDE8921BF5F9AB1658E1FE95ACCD2CEA9B9637B93DB427","orcidId":"0000-0001-9796-3716","documentHash":"0c1c9ca8-1dfa-40d3-87db-35acee1fd4e5"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.geodrs.2022.e00535"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["dziennikarz","dziennikarstwo","dziennikarz katolicki","tygodnik katolicki „niedziela”"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["  journalist","catholic journalist","journalism","catholic weekly “niedziela”"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709195878c28a04737f49e","uid":"bXY_DMagKuf8Wt0-tVB5Guw","uuid":"f39171b5-f192-4064-bc1b-c5c84006a634","parentId":"5e709195878c28a04737f49e","parentUuid":"f39171b5-f192-4064-bc1b-c5c84006a634","rootId":"5e709195878c28a04737f49e","rootUuid":"f39171b5-f192-4064-bc1b-c5c84006a634","name":"Uniwersytet Ignatianum w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e4878c28a0473b2bd8"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Wzorzec dziennikarza według przekazu tygodnika katolickiego „Niedziela”","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a273","mniswId":"200011","title":"Perspektywy Kultury","doi":null,"issn":"2081-1446","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"baa00f5f-8a23-4d08-a500-9f701f9725d9"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63f62d97409707703560db3b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093e4878c28a0473b2bd8"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;W tekście przybliżono wzorzec dziennikarza przedstawiony na łamach tygodnika katolickiego „niedziela”. celem prezentacji jest znalezienie odpowiedzi na pytania: W jaki sposób powinien wykonywać on swoją pracę? czy znajdują się objaśnienia, dzięki którym może dokładniej rozumieć dziennikarskie zadania i właściwie je realizować?

Texts published in “niedziela“ describing misconceived journalistic work and the creation of poor media coverage also served the indicated purpose. A journalist who does not understand the principles of journalistic service and rejects its values is characterized by a lack of professionalism, promotion of “celebrity journalism,” replacing service with commercialism, using false information, not pursuing the truth and bringing out the good.

The accounts of their journeys, known as libros de viajes, are a valuable source of information on the culture, ethnography, and geography of the areas they visited and a manifestation of the broad political horizons of the Castilian kings. The author of this article intends to outline the role played by these late medieval travel accounts in the history of Castile, and to discuss their impact on the interest in the Middle East and Asia among representatives of the Latin culture (christianitas latina). Ruy González de Clavijo’s travel account is particularly valuable here – his chronicle of a journey to Samarkand is one of the few testimonies of the presence of representatives of the Latin culture in the territories conquered by Timur and at his court. This article also analyses the differences between these libros de viajes and earlier texts written by, among others, Franciscan and Dominican missionaries and merchants who travelled to Central and East Asia.&lt;/div&gt;"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526260","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"20","pagesFromTo":"25-35","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://sbsp.up.krakow.pl/article/view/10100/9235","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afa39","name":"ŁUKASZ","lastName":"BURKIEWICZ","uuid":"086402A013B23FCD95E66117D3F62A83FAE3E7D482D2F066075AD4FA57DAF8A448DCEEF66EA6C7B16AC615DA9DFEFD6BB6F6FB5ED3F846685A9547B112A5ADFE","orcidId":"0000-0001-9115-0837","documentHash":"05868134-be91-4e2f-99ae-70a300f27ac2"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["knowledge","edible insects","factor analysis","cluster analysis","sustainable food","nutritional value"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709221878c28a04739049e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Investigation of the Level of Knowledge in Different Countries about Edible Insects: Cluster Segmentation","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","doi":null,"issn":"2071-1050","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"76492123-acbe-4743-a4ae-6a63f3108e24"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-27","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6407004640970770355ce34c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709221878c28a04739049e","662a39ff40970762633a3985","662a39ff40970762633a3986","662a39ff40970762633a3987","662a39ff40970762633a3988","662a39ff40970762633a3989","662a39ff40970762633a398a","662a39ff40970762633a398b","662a39ff40970762633a398c","662a39ff40970762633a398d","662a39ff40970762633a398e","662a39ff40970762633a398f","662a39ff40970762633a3990","662a39ff40970762633a3991","662a39ff40970762633a3992","662a39ff40970762633a3993","662a39ff40970762633a3994","662a39ff40970762633a3995","662a39ff40970762633a3996","662a39ff40970762633a3997"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study aimed to investigate the level of knowledge about edible insects (EIs) in a sample of people from thirteen countries (Croatia, Greece, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Mexico, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain, and Turkey). Data collection was based on a questionnaire survey applied through online tools between July and November 2021. For data analysis, techniques such as factor analysis, cluster analysis, and chi-square tests were used, with a significance level of 5%. A total of 27 items were used to measure knowledge on a five-point Likert scale. Applying factor analysis with principal components and Varimax rotation, a solution that explains about 55% of variance was obtained. This accounts for four factors that retained 22 of the 27 initial items: F1 = Sustainability (8 items), F2 = Nutrition (8 items), F3 = Production Factors (2 items), and F4 = Health Concerns (4 items). Internal consistency was evaluated through Cronbach’s alpha. The cluster analysis consisted of the application of hierarchical methods followed by k-means and produced three clusters (1—‘fearful’, 2—‘farming,’ and 3—‘ecological’ individuals). The characterisation of the clusters revealed that age did not influence cluster membership, while sex, education, country, living environment, professional area, and income all influenced the composition of the clusters. While participants from Mexico and Spain were fewer in the ‘fearful’ cluster, in those from Greece, Latvia, Lebanon, and Turkey, the situation was opposed. Participants from rural areas were mostly in cluster 2, which also included a higher percentage of participants with lower income. Participants from professional areas linked with biology, food, and nutrition were mostly in cluster 3. In this way, we concluded that the level of knowledge about EIs is highly variable according to the individual characteristics, namely that the social and cultural influences of the different countries lead to distinct levels of knowledge and interpretation of information, thus producing divergent approaches to the consumption of insects—some more reluctant and measuring possible risks. In contrast, others consider EIs a good and sustainable protein-food alternative."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526262","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/1/450","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a39ff40970762633a3997","name":"Emel","lastName":"Damarli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"67d64318-f733-42dc-9bc3-a59204add4a4"},{"objectId":"662a39ff40970762633a3996","name":"Dace","lastName":"Klava","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1d0bdb97-41d4-483e-9cc6-f3a59a98416b"},{"objectId":"662a39ff40970762633a3995","name":"Nada M.","lastName":"Boustani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4a9a26c3-837c-4bd3-ba08-401522ac782f"},{"objectId":"662a39ff40970762633a3994","name":"Monica","lastName":"Tarcea","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"66dacd58-cb4b-4e9b-a11e-e72291965a03"},{"objectId":"662a39ff40970762633a3993","name":"Elena","lastName":"Bartkiene","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"14e3c8e8-7228-4728-b9c9-36f4571253a8"},{"objectId":"662a39ff40970762633a3992","name":"Maša","lastName":"Černelič-Bizjak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f9df6a8f-aa58-4d76-81da-0bf4c6bb73a4"},{"objectId":"662a39ff40970762633a3991","name":"José M.

The enzymatic reactions of target substrates were optimized using several different immobilized preparations of lipase type B from the yeast Candida antarctica (CAL-B). The influence of crucial parameters, including the type of enzyme and alkoxy agent, as well as the nature of the organic co-solvent and time of the process on the conversion and enantioselectivity of the enzymatic kinetic resolution, is described. The optimal EKR procedure for the racemic profens consisted of a Novozym 435-STREM lipase preparation suspended in a mixture of 3 equiv of trimethyl or triethyl orthoacetate as alkoxy donor and toluene or n-hexane as co-solvent, depending on the employed racemic NSAIDs. The reported biocatalytic system provided optically active products with moderate to good enantioselectivity upon esterification lasting for 7–48 h, with most promising results in terms of enantiomeric purity of the pharmacologically active enantiomers of title APIs obtained on the analytical scale for: (S)-flurbiprofen (97% ee), (S)-ibuprofen (91% ee), (S)-ketoprofen (69% ee), and (S)-naproxen (63% ee), respectively. In turn, the employment of optimal conditions on a preparative scale enabled us to obtain the (S)-enantiomers of: flurbiprofen in 28% yield and 97% ee, ibuprofen in 45% yield and 56% ee, (S)-ketoprofen in 23% yield and 69% ee, and naproxen in 42% yield and 57% ee, respectively.

While the clinical use of taurolidine is considered, some studies with in-vivo experiments contradict this beneficial effect and even indicate advanced cancer growth. The aim of this study is to further investigate this paradox in-vivo effect by taurolidine and closely analyze the interaction of cancer cells with the surrounding environment following taurolidine exposure.\r\n\r\nMethods: HT-29 (ATCC® HTB-38™) cells were treated with taurolidine at different concentrations and oxaliplatin using an in-vitro model. Morphological changes with respect to increasing taurolidine dosage were visualized and monitored using electron microscopy. Cytotoxicity of the agents as well as extent of cellular detachment by mechanical stress was measured for each substance using a colorimetric MTS assay.\r\n\r\nResults: Both taurolidine and oxaliplatin exhibit cell toxicity on colon cancer cells. Taurolidine reshapes colon cancer cells from round into spheric cells and further induces cluster formation. When exposed to mechanical stress, taurolidine significantly enhances detachment of adherent colon carcinoma cells compared to the control (p < 0.05) and the oxaliplatin group (p < 0.05). This effect is dose dependent.\r\n\r\nConclusions: Beside its cytotoxic effects, taurolidine could also change mechanical interactions of cancer cells with their environment. Local cancer cell conglomerates could be mechanically mobilized and may cause metastatic growth further downstream. The significance of changes in cellular morphology caused by taurolidine as well as its interaction with the microenvironment must be further addressed in clinical cancer therapies. Further clinical studies are needed to evaluate both the safety and efficacy of taurolidine for the treatment of peritoneal surface malignancies.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526270","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"art.38 [8 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630c95f4097076263e7d68b","name":"Tanja","lastName":"Khosrawipour","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9f8b7505-27bf-4955-983a-2fc0ec21c9a9"},{"objectId":"6630c95f4097076263e7d68a","name":"Sven","lastName":"Stieglitz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9674e3d6-9ee1-4ebd-b5df-2d24dc84cae7"},{"objectId":"6630c95f4097076263e7d689","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Nicpon","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ba9f23ab-6ade-4e65-80b4-e2d5a09fedb4"},{"objectId":"6630c95f4097076263e7d688","name":"Maya Karine","lastName":"Labbé","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"894b0b2b-1761-4441-abd6-94b65457be29"},{"objectId":"6630c95f4097076263e7d687","name":"Pawel","lastName":"Migdal","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"699d2f15-2699-4367-b20f-c28ced75c29f"},{"objectId":"6630c95f4097076263e7d686","name":"Shiri","lastName":"Li","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e350f864-f12b-4911-876f-e81966450ae5"},{"objectId":"6630c95f4097076263e7d685","name":"Hien","lastName":"Lau","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"745f59a9-80d6-47bd-a24d-7f1d2db8b7b3"},{"objectId":"6630c95f4097076263e7d684","name":"Veria","lastName":"Khosrawipour","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a6f3e160-b388-480f-a6c8-bfee2b4eff9f"},{"objectId":"6630c95f4097076263e7d683","name":"Agata","lastName":"Mikolajczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6a5d9151-e45e-4f5f-8cfa-f6cadd3aaf9b"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1275","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Kielan","uuid":"66A8F70519AD35A1AABE24262BF5F1FCF6A4A95F4EE71BB0BD8000631850660B395E8FFE1C8F3BF5F3BE7FF8E242B536A42E9C4451D3CAE4CB3404A28FECFBF3","orcidId":"0000-0001-6116-6504","documentHash":"b8fdb2e4-5973-4cd0-91af-840e847aa8bf"}],"doi":"10.1186/s40360-022-00572-8"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pigs","Multikraft","mortality","pork","cholesterol","elements"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a54a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Effect of Dietary Supplementation of Finishers with Herbal Probiotics, Ascorbic Acid and Allicin on the Cost and Quality Characteristics of Pork","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d1","mniswId":"675","title":"Agriculture (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2077-0472","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"fb8db9b6-d4d7-498a-b26c-2119c1ad43da"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-07","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64070a1740970770355d0e05","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a54a"]},"issue":"8","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study analyzed the effect of finishing diet supplementation with herbal probiotic preparation, ascorbic acid, and allicin on mortality rates of pigs, and longissimus lumborum (LL) and semimembranosus (SM) muscle quality, including the levels of cholesterol, macroelements and microelements. The experiment was carried out on 3614 hybrid pigs (equal share of gilts and barrows), of the offspring of PIC410 boars and DanBred sows (Landrace-Yorkshire), divided into two groups. The experimental group of pigs received Fermented Herbs Extract (Multikraft, Austria) enriched with probiotics (S. cerevisiae, L. casei, L. plantarum) in addition to ascorbic acid (E300) and allicin during the finishing period (95 days), while the control group was fed a typical finishing diet containing levels of antibiotics consistent with those used in commercial pig production. Our results showed a positive effect of supplementation with herbal probiotics, allicin and ascorbic acid in lowering finishing pig mortality and increasing pork quality as evidenced by higher pH (40 min post mortem in the SM muscle; 24 h and 48 h in the LL muscle), lower thaw loss, higher dry matter and intramuscular fat (IMF), and higher yellowness (b*) and chroma (C*) while maintaining similar carcass lean/fat content. However, results showed no effect of the supplements on the levels of cholesterol, macroelements, and microelements in the LL muscle, except for Mn, whose concentration was higher in the control group. Compared to barrows, the carcasses of gilts were characterized by a greater share of lean meat and lower backfat thickness, with similar physicochemical and functional characteristics of meat. The results also showed interactions between the groups of pigs (control and supplementation) and their sex in shaping L* and the content of ash, potassium and phosphorus in the muscles. In summary, from the point of view of production economics, the use of the analyzed supplements in the finishing feed and through fogging resulted in better health (no need for the use of antibiotics) and lower mortality of pigs, which ultimately resulted in better financial results. In addition, the use of these additives in pig fattening had a beneficial effect on meat quality."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526272","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/12/8/1173/htm","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a54a","name":"Artur","lastName":"Rybarczyk","uuid":"13E462E5D7A28D0FB6FD1CDBD62FB20FFBCD19D013F535B79C66EE347E329D18035BD81B842295B03218E5D0A9B0F717712C441BB50AD7D90E3C556770ACE1D8","orcidId":"0000-0002-5963-8418","documentHash":"a5832bf0-70e3-4601-a40a-2e6af04c2cb0"}],"doi":"10.3390/agriculture12081173"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Environmental law","Human rights","Irregular migration","Migration law"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de24","uid":"bk8UqEe0F8JQF-eB0VLAY0w","uuid":"41ade527-eee8-4133-87f6-f9acbecc3acf","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de24","parentUuid":"41ade527-eee8-4133-87f6-f9acbecc3acf","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de24","rootUuid":"41ade527-eee8-4133-87f6-f9acbecc3acf","name":"Uniwersytet Zielonogórski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709233878c28a047391965"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","uid":"bGA_QwQGoDNg-6MMEBxlWNQ","uuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","parentUuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","rootUuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","name":"Akademia Marynarki Wojennej im.

Three constructive and five chronological phases were distinguished in the Bronze Age life of the barrow. The sequence of the Bronze Age features was additionally sustained by 19 radiocarbon dates, for which a Bayesian model was created. The first constructive and chronological phase dated back to 3104–2922 cal. BC (with an even earlier possible dating for one of the features, 3321–3016 cal. BC) and is related to three inhumation burials in a semi-supine position, with the head to the east, as well as scattered bones of a male individual. Three small barrow fills were piled above the three graves. The second constructive and chronological phase dated back to 2911–2892 cal. BC and is related to two graves that present all the characteristics of the Early Pit-Grave Culture. Feature 17 yielded three stone anthropomorphic stelae as well. The second barrow fill was constructed above these two graves. The third constructive and chronological phase dated back to 2881–2808 cal. BC and is related to two more features that could mark the end of the Early Pit-Grave period. Above them, the last barrow fill was piled and thus, the barrow reached its modern dimensions. Two Late Pit-Grave Culture graves were dug in the central part of that fill. They mark the fourth chronological Bronze Age phase dating back to 2681–2506 cal. BC. The fifth phase dated back to 1736–1623 cal. BC and is related to three contracted burials dug in the southern sector of the barrow. The Malomirovo sequence is the largest set of radiocarbon dates from a Bronze Age barrow in Upper Thrace. The combination of stratigraphic evidence and radiocarbon dates makes it a good starting point for further chronological and morphological studies of the Early and Middle Bronze Age mortuary practices in the region."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526287","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63f61242409707158a89d014","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"16","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"1fc33fde-6303-4596-8ab2-cbc1c5735676"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"207-240","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://publications.naim.bg/index.php/stprae/article/view/300/225","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63f61242409707158a89d015","name":"Stefan","lastName":"Alexandrov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9f0e6feb-7030-404f-8477-7e14ad45954f"},{"objectId":"5e70943b878c28a0473b88c0","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Włodarczak","uuid":"15EA29CAE2E74B84E4E468BAA02111B85657A1D7335B598C3F9FC9D6C540D17636C1CAB357E38B353E9F5CCDDB4E5212F675B3D0B6910A7E79ED96CA53709B90","orcidId":"0000-0003-0359-7386","documentHash":"8c0d1e20-aa73-4099-901d-402c21ab0ae5"}],"doi":"10.53250/stprae16.207-240"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df1a","uid":"bo-gzHUCaPNoq216Hhf4uRQ","uuid":"04d8f337-6a41-4c73-b0ee-a3f1a9293995","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Matematyki, Informatyki i Mechaniki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709358878c28a0473a7bf0","63f89871409707099272878d","63f89871409707099272878e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Some remarks on a mathematical model of COVID-19 pandemic with health care capacity","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa83c9aff2974850cd30","mniswId":"29302","title":"Mathematica Applicanda","doi":null,"issn":"1730-2668","eissn":"2299-4009","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"a99dd140-0f0c-4ac4-bcf5-5e42b9632d36"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63f89871409707099272878b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709358878c28a0473a7bf0","63f89871409707099272878d","63f89871409707099272878e"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058526289","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63f89871409707099272878c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"50","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"c681cba4-2cc6-43a8-8e7d-6b81b59fbd32"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"50","pagesFromTo":"23-42","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.14708/ma.v50i1.7113","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63f89871409707099272878e","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kowalewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"987ca7e8-9b7f-4529-8d62-6af14c192c78"},{"objectId":"63f89871409707099272878d","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Krawczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9b0a1eaf-6cad-4995-9df6-431b0661ae4c"},{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7bf0","name":"Marek","lastName":"Bodnar","uuid":"1ADF877830F4F308E65DB87C82C4AD665D47FF0CD394B4B0F8367FE8CD943D5078DBB011EC6C90A75170BE4D31D78972B659CAB1CA80D1CF526450E0EBD88227","orcidId":"0000-0001-5571-2476","documentHash":"89377953-4555-45a4-819b-e81419c1dcd7"}],"doi":"10.14708/ma.v50i1.7113"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["condylar hyperplasia","unilateral condylar hyperplasia","condylectomy","dental treatment"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

This form of mandibular asymmetry (MA) is one of the less common but still known pathologies that requires detailed surgical and orthodontic planning and treatment. Since this pathology is mostly related to a high number of individual dental, bone, and overgrowth factors, until now the treatment methods were individually driven. It seems that the scope of surgical intervention is greatly dependent on the degree of bone overgrowth and the occurrence of asymmetry. Many treatment modalities and possible surgical perspectives are known, yet, so far, no adequate detailed guidelines are known. This detailed review of this type of mandibular asymmetry will focus on diagnostics and treatment plans and outcomes. The following paper underlines the authors’ own clinical experiences in MA and UCH treatment, which are compared with the literature review. The authors intend to investigate what has changed in the treatment and diagnostics of one-sided mandibular condyle and bone overgrowth."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526290","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"art.1839 [25

transfusions are mainly given to intensive care patients; therefore, additional complications that could arise from storage lesions in preserved blood should be avoided. It has been shown that human stored red blood cells are subject to changes that are considered to be a number of interdependent processes involving metabolic disarrangement and oxidative stress. The aim of our study was to determine alterations in selected hematological and biochemical parameters and to assess whether and when oxidative stress is a significant phenomenon in stored dog CPDA-1 whole blood. Ten ½ unit bags of whole blood donated from dogs and preserved with CPDA-1 (anticoagulant containing citrate, phosphate, dextrose and adenine) were stored for 5 weeks. Each week, a 9 ml sample was drawn aseptically to measure hematological parameters, selected metabolites, free hemoglobin content, osmotic fragility, antioxidant enzyme activity, total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde concentration and protein carbonyl content.\r\n\r\nThe results revealed an MCV decrease in the first week of storage and then a gradual increase; osmotic fragility decreased at that time and remained low throughout the study period. Leukodepletion became significant in the fourth week of storage. The free hemoglobin concentration continuously increased, with the greatest changes observed in the last two weeks of storage. The total antioxidant capacity changed in a reverse manner. Superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities decreased from week 0 to week 3, and catalase activity tended to decrease over time. The highest malondialdehyde concentrations in blood supernatant were measured in the first week of storage, and the carbonyl concentration increased after 35 days.\r\n\r\nHematological changes and oxidative stress are already present in the first week of storage, resulting in depletion of the antioxidant system and subsequent accumulation of oxidation products as well as erythrocyte hemolysis, which are most pronounced at the end of the storage period."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526294","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12917-022-03353-x.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a3d2240970762633a527e","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Walski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2ddb28f4-1fd6-446d-a89f-18be317ab76d"},{"objectId":"662a3d2240970762633a527d","name":"Eliza","lastName":"Wajman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"62ff4074-b7c4-4bc6-bbf5-7c45ef5997e7"},{"objectId":"5e709447878c28a0473b9981","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Bujok","uuid":"56DD78DDA00A056AF58993E4FA885DB90E29089FDC862F3590347464BDA8DEA85EE18779ACC24A66979C1BA7C5BE3BF6FCBF6FAC98E9EDBD916CEE7A449FC6DE","orcidId":"0000-0003-1630-3893","documentHash":"7c851521-8043-469e-af15-05dc4b7edd93"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a04739961d","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Trochanowska-Pauk","uuid":"7C54DED948F72A537577EBDDEB39929345BF6AB2843580D123C13DFA04EE567F55E9BA4598725411003D0261656D6F2B25473D8D2F1776B88158562FC3814C85","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"900e01aa-4f2e-4c59-bd20-34fd8519c3e5"}],"doi":"10.1186/s12917-022-03353-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63f8a9ef4097070992742662","doi":null,"title":"Banganarti

prevalence of obesity, diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and related metabolic disorders has been steadily increasing in the past few decades. Apart from the establishment of caloric restrictions in combination with improved physical activity, there are no effective pharmacological treatments for most metabolic disorders. Many scientific-studies have described various beneficial effects of probiotics in regulating metabolism but others questioned their effectiveness and safety. Postbiotics are defined as preparation of inanimate microorganisms, and/or their components, which determine their safety of use and confers a health benefit to the host. Additionally, unlike probiotics postbiotics do not require stringent production/storage conditions. Recently, many lines of evidence demonstrated that postbiotics may be beneficial in metabolic disorders management via several potential effects including anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, immunomodulatory, anti-carcinogenic, antioxidant, antihypertensive, anti-proliferative, and hypocholesterolaemia properties that enhance both the immune system and intestinal barrier functions by acting directly on specific tissues of the intestinal epithelium, but also on various organs or tissues. In view of the many reports that demonstrated the high biological activity and safety of postbiotics, we summarized in the present review the current findings reporting the beneficial effects of various probiotics derivatives for the management of metabolic disorders and related alterations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526299","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"153","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332222005273","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a2772409707626339ce81","name":"Yasmina","lastName":"Bourebaba","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4124e221-7fe2-40db-bcb4-5cbef23a905f"},{"objectId":"61e785b87523406748fb8694","name":"LYNDA","lastName":"BOUREBABA","uuid":"E9E482563FE63E31FD25D3D5B3F1FE97F8C784FB74495DAFBEE514285948D7708ABC57D70A7A7210E8AB66B1FA91DAC4CF304A8A8A5BB6233A578F342B73A0C1","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"963e7a14-47c1-4f88-ba64-cc93c7c9718d"},{"objectId":"602f9be49543c7410626f682","name":"Malwina","lastName":"Mularczyk","uuid":"5144D17724771F33080F54F9A1B0C2802518F9139120BCFB6EC3D0136EFC666C6554E5114824F93A877C3185E285A8F9A8C9F725023DDF84525E6113F5C3990E","orcidId":"0000-0001-8189-9545","documentHash":"a4fa34dd-fb26-4f62-8062-9fff72784ecc"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e29a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Marycz","uuid":"232BD10216D5623A2C97AEE2B23109CFB6C3A3BD5B79AA43203A222A1A37A575D9EBD9FFFDABB7F4C32C3CDC7BA67C6A7DE4A8F0D86DC6A5DF0F1CF93573FCD0","orcidId":"0000-0003-3676-796X","documentHash":"927d7659-0c17-40c1-bed6-9f2cf8d61940"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.biopha.2022.113138"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["α-ketoglutaric acid biosynthesis","Yarrowia lipolytica","glycerol","rapeseed oil","culture conditions optimization"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Enhancement of α-Ketoglutaric Acid Production by Yarrowia lipolytica Grown on Mixed Renewable Carbon Sources through Adjustment of Culture Conditions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477568","mniswId":"3333","title":"Catalysts","doi":null,"issn":"2073-4344","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"467b91d9-8d0c-4cfd-ab42-eccbc898d26d"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-22","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6406f70b40970770355cbc98","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093be878c28a0473b01a7","5e7091fc878c28a04738e25d","5e709264878c28a047394d52","65e876cc40970762631491ec"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"α-Ketoglutaric acid (KGA) is a valuable compound with a wide range of applications, e.g., in the cosmetics, pharmaceutical, chemical and food industries. The present study aimed to enhance the efficiency of KGA production by Yarrowia lipolytica CBS146773 from renewable carbon sources. In the investigation, various factors that may potentially affect KGA biosynthesis were examined in bioreactor cultures performed on a simple medium containing glycerol (20 g/L) and fed with four portions of a substrate mixture (15 + 15 g/L of glycerol and rapeseed oil). It was found that the process may be stimulated by regulation of the medium pH and aeration, application of selected neutralizing agents, supplementation with thiamine and addition of sorbitan monolaurate, whereas presence of biotin and iron ions had no positive effect on KGA biosynthesis. Adjustment of the parameters improved the process efficiency and allowed 82.4 g/L of KGA to be obtained, corresponding to productivity of 0.57 g/L h and yield of 0.59 g/g. In addition, the production of KGA was characterized by a low level (≤6.3 g/L) of by-products, i.e., citric and pyruvic acids.

In particular, E. coli colonizes and infects the gastrointestinal tract via type 1 fimbriae (T1F). Here, the major zymogen granule membrane glycoprotein 2 (GP2) acts as a host cell receptor. GP2 is also secreted by the pancreas and various mucous glands, interacting with luminal type 1 fimbriae-positive E. coli. It is unknown whether GP2 isoforms demonstrate specific E. coli pathotype binding. In this study, we investigated interactions of human, porcine, and bovine EPEC and ETEC, as well as commensal E. coli isolates with human, porcine, and bovine GP2. We first defined pathotype- and host-associated FimH variants. Second, we could prove that GP2 isoforms bound to FimH variants to various degrees. However, the GP2-FimH interactions did not seem to be influenced by the host specificity of E. coli. In contrast, soluble GP2 affected ETEC infection and phagocytosis rates of macrophages. Preincubation of the ETEC pathotype with GP2 reduced the infection of cell lines. Furthermore, preincubation of E. coli with GP2 improved the phagocytosis rate of macrophages. Our findings suggest that GP2 plays a role in the defense against E. coli infection and in the corresponding host immune response."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526304","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"88","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.asm.org/doi/epub/10.1128/aem.02279-21","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a3e3f40970762633a5e08","name":"Peter","lastName":"Schierack","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"18553125-1e0c-4a25-b05b-2aa78d469f66"},{"objectId":"662a3e3f40970762633a5e07","name":"Dirk","lastName":"Roggenbuck","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f8f25ff5-4364-4b24-94f4-5098234b87b0"},{"objectId":"662a3e3f40970762633a5e06","name":"Veronika","lastName":"Tchesnokova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3e948fa4-eb3e-43ad-bf1a-b4116b5f7a10"},{"objectId":"662a3e3f40970762633a5e05","name":"Aamir","lastName":"Ali","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f93a15a3-d667-4aea-bedd-8a2aca28b486"},{"objectId":"662a3e3f40970762633a5e04","name":"Rolf","lastName":"Bauerfeind","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"605037e1-6d55-4c39-a7bc-78f723ad9d10"},{"objectId":"662a3e3f40970762633a5e03","name":"Stefan","lastName":"Rodiger","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"edd828f6-7763-40ce-86c8-232cb2e755e1"},{"objectId":"662a3e3f40970762633a5e02","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Chilimoniuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c2dd7095-5c3d-4517-8cbb-0c5439b25cab"},{"objectId":"662a3e3f40970762633a5e01","name":"Christin","lastName":"Bartliz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c21da211-3abc-4882-9a7f-b22a3812a4b9"},{"objectId":"5e7094ce878c28a0473c42ad","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Kolenda","uuid":"4FB1F8C62605B9D7E891EAFFF712A1FD1180B5845FCA0AD9200977E1BFC8A92ECDE4F1F0D2250FD2C2B85F03B94AC99BC937A55C8E1731321EC865B7DF4190CE","orcidId":"0000-0002-8145-579X","documentHash":"ba7d6e6b-e081-42f3-8b8f-2f10f6bf1b8e"},{"objectId":"5e709262878c28a047394ce4","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Grzymajło","uuid":"3838EF64B4309D51B7CF0C267513B6839CE14FD78B282DE1604E4A32C826947736673354692E5B9FB719B74042E6C24B8235975AC56ABFA85BCDC24552E722A9","orcidId":"0000-0002-1163-0679","documentHash":"d48f0577-afc8-4689-b6da-2672919937f7"}],"doi":"10.1128/aem.02279-21"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Agro-industrial byproduct","Valorization","Bioactive compounds","Biological properties","Thermal exposure"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602f61e29543c7410626f3ed","662a3a7040970762633a3d5d","5e709221878c28a04739049e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Antioxidant activities and polyphenolic identification by UPLC-MS/MS of autoclaved brewers’ spent grain","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d21","mniswId":"13782","title":"LWT - Food Science and Technology","doi":null,"issn":"0023-6438","eissn":"1096-1127","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"2b15abc5-a709-45ca-b3d4-a75f134aed8e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-05-31","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6407016240970770355ce93c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602f61e29543c7410626f3ed","5e709221878c28a04739049e","662a3a7040970762633a3d5d","662a3a7040970762633a3d5e","662a3a7040970762633a3d5f","662a3a7040970762633a3d60","662a3a7040970762633a3d61"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Autoclave treatment (AT) modified the dietary fiber composition of brewers' spent grain (BSG), impacting its techno-processing properties. However, its impact on antioxidant properties and stability of polyphenolic compounds remain unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of AT on several antioxidant activities and polyphenolic composition. The results showed that AT increased ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity), ABTS (2,2′-Azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), and FRAP (ferric-reducing antioxidant power) value upto 7 folds compared to the untreated BSG. The lower temperature degraded the amount of flavan-3-ols and phenolic acids. However, AT at 110 °C and 130 °C upgraded the phenolic acids upto 4 and 11 folds respectively.

The present work deals with the green synthesis and characterization of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using Elaeagnus umbellata (fruit) and the evaluation of its antibacterial, antioxidant, and phytotoxic activities. For the synthesis of AgNPs, fruit extract was treated with a 4 mM AgNO3 solution at room temperature, and a color change was observed. In UV-Visible spectroscopy, an absorption peak formation at 456 nm was the sign that AgNPs were present in the reaction solution. Scanning electron microscopy and physicochemical X-ray diffraction were used to characterize AgNPs, which revealed that they were crystalline, spherical, and had an average size of 11.94 ± 7.325 nm. The synthesized AgNPs showed excellent antibacterial activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae (14 mm), Staphylococcus aureus (13.5 mm), Proteus mirabilis (13 mm), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5 mm), as well as considerable antioxidant activity against DPPH with 69% inhibition at an IC50 value of 43.38 µg/mL. AgNPs also exhibited a concentration-dependent effect on rice plants. Root and shoot length were found to be positively impacted at all concentrations, i.e., 12.5 µg/mL, 25 µg/mL, 50 µg/mL, and 100 µg/mL. Among these concentrations, the 50 µg/mL concentration of AgNPs was found to be most effective. The plant biomass decreased at higher AgNP exposure levels (i.e., 100 µg/mL), whereas 50 µg/mL caused a significant increase in plant biomass as compared to the control. This study provides an eco-friendly method for the synthesis of AgNPs which can be used for their antibacterial and antioxidant activities and also as growth promoters of crop plants."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526307","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/18/5847","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e82dc0409707626313bab8","name":"Jose Manuel","lastName":"Pérez de la Lastra ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"925ce6b7-f2a0-4785-a10d-c721d51e2515"},{"objectId":"65e82dc0409707626313bab7","name":"Huma","lastName":"Arshad","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b44673c3-4b12-4dcc-a176-7f68f0f1b9ee"},{"objectId":"65e82dc0409707626313bab6","name":"Samiullah","lastName":"Khan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1ffbdd98-8782-4ca4-8f69-51ef73f6f6fd"},{"objectId":"65e82dc0409707626313bab5","name":"Zakia","lastName":"Binish","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"46f5cd2b-008b-4da1-8eda-5c627a4e256e"},{"objectId":"65e82dc0409707626313bab4","name":"Ghazala","lastName":"Mustafa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f269a099-72d3-4905-b553-b81840f5fcb4"},{"objectId":"65e82dc0409707626313bab3","name":"Ansar","lastName":"Mehmood","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"de9d528c-095b-4022-996d-8ebd50d3c327"},{"objectId":"65e82dc0409707626313bab2","name":"Muhammad Shoaib","lastName":"Amjad","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c02c5f93-0440-4b13-b709-daffb3dac4fc"},{"objectId":"65e82dc0409707626313bab1","name":"Hafsa","lastName":"Zulfiqar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6ad09a2a-0d10-4e60-9f0c-f76fc9e0472d"},{"objectId":"5e709231878c28a0473916a6","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Proćków","uuid":"70701C5C678163514436375EF8CAD6D3DB2B353579CDC817CDB9CDC66060DA03F8247EF622FD5202713335D60FD7F634D7DE07E31CA1363A9333A985C3EC803F","orcidId":"0000-0003-4100-3438","documentHash":"3f63635c-e25d-4333-ba43-89dbe7f84a86"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules27185847"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63f9c185409707479ab47349","doi":null,"title":"Systemy wspomagania zarządzania.

A 2 year old female German Shepherd dog, with a level of progesterone suggestive of the periovulatory period (5.97 ng/mL), received a single subcutaneous injection of meloxicam (0.2 mg/kg body weight). In this female, subsequent evaluation to detect the optimal time for mating revealed a strong decrease in P4 (2.77 ng/mL), although it increased to 13.98 ng/mL within the following three days. The same female conceived and delivered a litter of the same size as in a subsequent cycle where meloxicam was not administered. The use of NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and particularly meloxicam, as a COX-2 inhibitor that influences the production of prostaglandins has been reported as being potentially harmful for ovulation and pregnancy in various species, including humans. In dogs, the secretion of prostaglandin E (PGE) is thought to be important for ovulation and the formation of the corpora lutea, the only source of P4, which is required for pregnancy maintenance. Although previous case reports have indicated an influence of meloxicam administration on CL function in domestic dogs, here, the decreased progesterone level observed directly after a single dose of meloxicam was only temporary, with no negative impact on fertility. Based on our observations, further studies related to the influence of the timing of meloxicam administration on ovarian cycle advancement, as well as the influence of duration of treatment, dosage, and route of administration on progesterone levels, as an indicator of CL function, are required."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526313","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/12/5/655/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a3de540970762633a5a77","name":"Oliwia","lastName":"Uchańska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1102e131-06b8-42e5-853c-24c9cde3565d"},{"objectId":"662a3de540970762633a5a76","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Szpaczek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0005ee0d-d4d1-412c-b552-8fff635e1cd4"},{"objectId":"5e709236878c28a047391c2a","name":"Michał","lastName":"Dzięcioł","uuid":"BD1DC0104A928D8CE2BE73CA65407CE3F8B253356593219928336DF37FB1061DAD8E62407232B7D1475C8B1B9259A53BE8A6537AB2530E9B48999F8B7019B885","orcidId":"0000-0002-5063-4306","documentHash":"9b068c8a-f0b0-4b8c-b1f8-ef3263a50f3f"},{"objectId":"5e709236878c28a047391bac","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Niżański","uuid":"97F0DD63A6372913B43AC87F04E2E499D30C5440D494533BF3C45495DDB5FDE76E6376D5C05AD2F2FD6EF36ABC77E1B325B21C7D8638E9AF9B007D9CF3174EBB","orcidId":"0000-0003-1056-0784","documentHash":"f9b28beb-caf8-4ded-a228-55b8ec682ed1"}],"doi":"10.3390/ani12050655"},{"mainLanguageName":"francuski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"fra","keywords":["apprentissage/enseignement de langues étrangères","philologie française","théorie de complexité","système complexe et dynamique","conditions initiales"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["foreign language learning/teaching","French department","complexity theory","complex and dynamic system","initial conditions"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922e878c28a04739142b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"L’enseignement/apprentissage des langues étrangères sous l’éclairage de la théorie des systèmes complexes et dynamiques.

Das Phänomen der Intermedialität wird aus der Perspektive der Komponenten, Beziehungen und Funktionen im Text erklärt, weil diese drei Aspekte auf synthetische Weise die Entstehung und pragmatische Manifestation der Intermedialität zeigen können. Einzelne Beispiele stammen aus dem Juni und Juli 2021 und wurden in Warschau, Berlin und Luxemburg fotografiert"},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<strong>Intermedial Components, Relations and Functions in Public Urban Texts / </strong>Contemporary texts in public space offer different forms and functions. Regulative, commercial, transgressive and last but not least pandemic texts use multimodal means in the composition of text forms and for the transfer of corresponding information, offers, bids or bans. The spectrum of use is truly extensive. Against this background, the article asks about intermediality in urban texts such as posters and notices, because intermedial relations – mainly known from audiovisual and hypertextual contexts – are efficient strategies of textual effect. The phenomenon of intermediality is explained from the perspective of components, relationships and functions in the text because these three kinds of manifestation can synthetically show the emergence and pragmatic manifestation of intermediality. Individual examples are from June and July 2021 and were photographed in Warsaw, Berlin and Luxembourg."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526316","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22, 2022 (II)","pagesFromTo":"195-207","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.23817/lingtreff.22-13","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70922f878c28a047391646","name":"Roman","lastName":"Opiłowski","uuid":"7E955C4B6120C77E636F4D1F4F77E6B09BFC1EE0B427BCB333F3501A25449FCCD3A46E7556D321DA5277A88720AE7E4E703862F04F148AA0CE3FD7042EB46F7F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0104-7527","documentHash":"b86075c1-d5d5-43e8-8a23-088a18c259e4"}],"doi":"10.23817/lingtreff.22-13"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63f867d840970709926f4697","doi":null,"title":"Lekarz i duchowny na prowincji = Lěkař a duchovní v provincii","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"9788366536647","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"http://katalog.bu.ujd.edu.pl/cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?bib=248682","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"c2dde3a8-b5c6-47da-a1b6-91ddac092910","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb8ed","mniswId":"58800","name":"Uniwersytet Humanistyczno-Przyrodniczy im.

The issue of Big Data in the context of the functioning of contemporary cities was also discussed. Empirical research was carried out using an online survey among participants who are employees of the IT industry.\nFindings: The conducted research constitutes the first step in assessing the relations between modern cities and their users and creators. Employees of organizations dealing with Big Data technology are familiar with the basic assumptions of the smart city concept. However, a problematic issue consists in identifying the impact of this concept on the life and immediate environment of the research participants.\nResearch limitations/implications: The main research limitation consists in the number of analysed surveys. In the case of more feedback, the research sample could be even more reliable, which in turn can lead to extensive conclusions.\nSocial implications: Publishing the article may contribute to raising the awareness of Big Data developers concerning their contribution to building and developing smart solutions.\nOriginality/value: The contribution of the research to determine how smart cities impact their users and creators.

Polyhydroxyalkanoates are synthesized in bacteria in response to stress conditions. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoates (mcl-PHA) in transgenic flax Linum usitatissimum L. on plant growth, physiology and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Flax is a valuable crop plant cultivated in a temperate climate. The subjects of this study were flax plants obtained via overexpression of the medium-chain-length polyhydroxyalkanoate (mcl-PHA) synthase gene from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Modified flax plants grown in salt stress conditions showed higher biomass in comparison to wild-type plants. Salt stress did not cause the degradation of chlorophylls and carotenoids in transgenic flax plants in comparison to wild-type plants. The tested engineered plants also showed twofold higher resistance to diseases caused by Fusarium oxysporum, the main flax pathogen. Synthesis of mcl-PHA influenced amino acids profile, thus reduced the contents of glutamate and slightly elevated proline and arginine level were determined especially in a selected line (#11), exhibiting the highest mcl-PHA level and the highest measured resistance to pathogenic fungi and salinity. Performed biochemical analyses did not indicate the statistically important changes in the level of metabolites with antioxidant properties as flavonoids and phenolic compounds. Finally, synthesis of mcl-PHAs, and accompanying enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging ability caused improvement of salt tolerance and fungal resistance in genetically modified flax plants. Because soil salinization remains a real problem in many areas of the world and Fusarium is the main pathogen for flax, the analyzed flax plants with overexpression of mcl-PHA synthase have high potential for agriculture, especially from an economic point of view."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526339","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"151","pagesFromTo":"123-132","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11240-022-02337-x.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a278f409707626339cf63","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Rymowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7f45c8b2-091c-42bf-9436-8fa5b93d6013"},{"objectId":"5e709415878c28a0473b5fa4","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Wróbel-Kwiatkowska","uuid":"BC7DEAA945DD4AB38E75057FFC725B7CC1890D3209FFCE3A6CBEBCD894EB07E286B4CF83FFA4BBF97D7A555EF09A16CC21BC23268FFC01F358F3D27235D2FB91","orcidId":"0000-0002-9511-1381","documentHash":"43dca44d-845b-442a-96d3-1fea1089b60f"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e1f7","name":"Maja","lastName":"Słupczyńska","uuid":"B5510F21F7D2A81B2A95B1758A86FEBCE8FAEE93CE5604AB8001EC6C9B2A211AF6FA05C50F0FA6839387F43CB0AC56C303523D3BB3D8EF08F3BD1613D701398F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8941-3079","documentHash":"119d57e1-f9a1-4d60-8ed3-7e897a0bfab0"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11240-022-02337-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["leaf rust","regression model","Triticum astivum L.","yield loss","disease forecast"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398362"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Stepwise Regression Models-Based Prediction for Leaf Rust Severity and Yield Loss in Wheat","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","doi":null,"issn":"2071-1050","eissn":"2071-1050","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"46882d20-8996-4dde-bd15-7d5f8ecc797a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-26","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63f6145a409707158a8a8935","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63f6145a409707158a8a8936","63f6145a409707158a8a8937","63f6145a409707158a8a8938","63f6145a409707158a8a8939","63f6145a409707158a8a893a","63f6145a409707158a8a893b","63f6145a409707158a8a893c","63f6145a409707158a8a893d","63f6145a409707158a8a893e","63f6145a409707158a8a893f","5e709292878c28a047398362"]},"issue":"21","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Leaf rust is a devastating disease in wheat crop. The disease forecasting models can facilitate the economic and effective use of fungicides and assist in limiting crop yield losses. In this study, six wheat cultivars were screened against leaf rust at two locations, during three consecutive growing seasons. Subsequently, the stepwise regression analysis was employed to analyze the correlation of six epidemiological variables (minimum temperature, maximum temperature, minimum relative humidity, maximum relative humidity, rainfall and wind speed) with disease severity and yield loss (%). Disease predictive models were developed for each cultivar for final leaf rust severity and yield loss prediction. Principally, all epidemiological variables indicated a positive association with leaf rust severity and yield loss (%) except minimum relative humidity. The effectiveness of disease predictive models was estimated using coefficient of determination (R2) values for all models. Then, these predictive models were validated to forecast disease severity and yield loss at another location in Faisalabad. The R2 values of all disease predictive models for each of the tested cultivars were high, evincing that our regression models could be effectively employed to predict leaf rust disease severity and anticipated yield loss. The validation results explained 99% variability, suggesting a highly accurate prediction of the two variables (leaf rust severity and yield loss). The models developed in this research can be used by wheat farmers to forecast disease epidemics and to make disease management decisions accordingly."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058526344","journalIssue":{"objectId":"636258bf4097072c44ab8bbb","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"21","doi":null,"documentHash":"53001c2a-58c5-4bba-88d8-497eb2d77551"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"13893","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/21/13893/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63f6145a409707158a8a893f","name":"Iqra","lastName":"Mubeen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0529962a-de1b-4084-8029-905066b6f504"},{"objectId":"63f6145a409707158a8a893e","name":"Walid F.
