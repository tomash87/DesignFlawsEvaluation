The enzyme property to DET is depending on its capability to electron transfer from enzymatically reduced built-in native cofactor (flavin mononucleotide, flavin adenine dinucleotide, pyrroloquinoline quinone, or heme) to a conductive surface directly for single cofactor enzymes or through a native structural electron acceptor (heme or copper-containing prosthetic groups) for multicofactor enzymes. Thus, there are two possibilities to use such type enzymes: to find a natural source of the enzyme with these properties; or to construct the recombinant chimeric analogs using the gene-engineering techniques. The modern molecular genetics opens the possibility to be independent of million-year natural evolution and engineer the specific enzymes for scientific and technological needs. This brief review is focused mostly on the recent publications on application of DET-capable engineered enzymes for the third-generation electrochemical biosensors. © 2021 Elsevier B.V."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159255","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"31","pagesFromTo":"100856","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2451910321001708?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"628217334097077bd403f389","name":"Evgeny","lastName":"Katz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"429cac59-3eae-492f-a53e-57c1a2739321"},{"objectId":"628217334097077bd403f387","name":"Oleh","lastName":"Smutok","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9967-3445","documentHash":"becf9c1e-73d3-4554-ba47-604cfab16405"},{"objectId":"5ebed49b752340254fc3fefc","name":"Taras","lastName":"Kavetskyy","uuid":"B6D879F79DFBABFE4B3FA6AF0DB3CEBE4570173E5933F54995BBF2408596D30EFB502464B7EAC41494FAEFE9D73D28C51A677600AE33EA8690CDA82B6C17B27D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f011af58-cdb3-46f1-ab06-58258996e2c9"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.coelec.2021.100856"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["podchloryn sodu","atopowe zapalenie skóry","mikroflora bakteryjna"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sodium hypochlorite","atopic dermatitis","bacterial microflora"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709307878c28a0473a1638"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Zastosowanie podchlorynu sodu w leczeniu wspomagającym atopowego zapalenia skóry","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"64f04bfacf9a7471b0ea4141","mniswId":"201740","title":"Dermatologia Praktyczna","doi":null,"issn":"2080-1157","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"ed82b59a-2c56-49e2-989e-2e3c6de30e6d"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"628218234097077bd4040170","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["628218234097077bd4040172","5e709307878c28a0473a1638"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Wstęp: Atopowe zapalenie skóry (AZS) jest przewlekłą, zapalną chorobą skóry o wieloczynnikowej etiologii, rozpoznawaną zarówno u dzieci, jak i u dorosłych. Oprócz stosowanych powszechnie schematów terapeutycznych, nadal poszukuje się nowych form terapii mających działanie wspomagające w leczeniu tej jednostki chorobowej. Na uwagę w tym względzie zasługuje zastosowanie kąpieli w rozcieńczonym podchlorynie sodu.\nCel pracy: Ocena wpływu systematycznych kąpieli w podchlorynie sodu na nasilenie AZS oraz kolonizację skóry przez gronkowca złocistego.\nMateriał i metody: Do badania zakwalifikowano 27 pacjentów z AZS, w przypadku których oprócz standardowej terapii do leczenia dołączono kąpiele w rozcieńczonym podchlorynie sodu. U każdego pacjenta w momencie włączenia do badania i po 6 tygodniach oceniono nasilenie choroby za pomocą skal SCORAD (SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis) i EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index) oraz intensywność odczuwanego świądu za pomocą numerycznej skali szacunkowej (Numerical Rating Scale – NRS), a także pobrano wymaz ze skóry celem wykonania badania mikrobiologicznego z identyfikacją patogenu i ocenę półilościową wyizolowanych szczepów.\nWyniki: U pacjentów stosujących kąpiele w rozcieńczonym podchlorynie sodu uzyskano poprawę stanu skóry: SCORAD przed leczeniem 51,1 ± 18,8 punktów vs. SCORAD po leczeniu 32,3 ± 15,4 punktów (p < 0,001) (poprawa % SCORAD 33,5 ± 25,9%), EASI przed 18,0 ± 16,1 punktów vs. EASI po 8,8 ± 8,3 punktów (p < 0,001) (poprawa % EASI 42,0 ± 32,9%) oraz redukcję świądu skóry: NRS przed 6,1 ± 2,4 punktów vs. NRS po 4,1 ± 2,1 punktów (p < 0,001).\nNie potwierdzono natomiast związku stosowanej terapii z eradykacją Staphyloccocus aureus.\nWnioski: Zastosowanie antyseptycznych kąpieli z zastosowaniem podchlorynu sodu przyczyniło się do poprawy stanu klinicznego pacjentów oraz redukcji świądu skóry, przy zachowaniu bezpieczeństwa i dobrej tolerancji takiego postępowania leczniczego.

In addition to the commonly used therapeutic regimens, new forms of therapy are still being searched to provide a supportive care of this disease. Thus, the use of a bath in diluted sodium hypochlorite deserves particular attention.\nAim of the study: To evaluate the effect of systematic baths in sodium hypochlorite on the severity of AD and skin colonization by Staphylococcus aureus.\nMaterial and methods: 27 patients with active AD were enrolled in the study. In addition to standard therapy, baths in diluted sodium hypochlorite were added. The severity of the disease was assessed at the time of enrollment and after 6 weeks of treatment in each patient using the SCORAD (SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis) and EASI (Eczema Area and Severity Index) scales, as well as the intensity of itching using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). In addition, skin smear with pathogen identification and semi-quantitative evaluation of the isolated strains was done as well.\nResults: Patients taking baths in diluted sodium hypochlorite showed significant improvement of skin lesions: SCORAD before treatment was 51.1 ± 18.8 points vs. post-treatment 32.3 ± 15.4 points (p < 0.001) (% SCORAD improvement: 33.5 ± 25.9%), EASI before 18.0 ± 16.1 points vs. EASI after treatment 8.8 ± 8.3 points (p < 0.001) (% EASI improvement: 42.0 ± 32.9%) and reduction of pruritus: NRS before 6.1 ± 2.4 points vs. NRS after therapy 4.1 ± 2.1 points (p < 0.001). However, the relationship between the hypochlorite baths and the eradication of Staphyloccocus aureus was not confirmed.\nConclusions: The use of antiseptic baths with sodium hypochlorite improved the clinical condition of patients and reduced itching of the skin, while maintaining safety and good tolerance of such treatment. No effect of hypochlorite baths on the reduction of the number of St. aureus was observed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159257","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-4","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"The use of sodium hypochlorite in the adjunctive therapy of atopic dermatitis"}],"publicUri":"https://przegladpediatryczny.pl/magazine/shownumber/467","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"628218234097077bd4040172","name":"Klaudia","lastName":"Tutka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bfce1cac-1cd1-4085-8002-c40f2edd952e"},{"objectId":"5e709307878c28a0473a1638","name":"Adam","lastName":"Reich","uuid":"6EBE672E1D68F00D88DBC40596DE0274BCFA4B8684B1807C792E43C6CAB0C92B954C81C77FC8A75B377A0F645DC582DC19CCA4436727BEE6AEF9CE5374B4FD0F","orcidId":"0000-0002-5573-1754","documentHash":"500e1620-edb2-4d31-ae7b-e5a62e00e45f"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":[" młodzież ","postawy ","prekariat"," przekonania ","województwo mazowieckie "]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["youth ","posture ","precariat ","beliefs ","masovian district"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-66470-30-9","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3d","uid":"b2eiZUbb85g0FOaTA2KZtOw","uuid":"c7c10a2a-f381-4dc2-8511-53400ceb4a90","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3d","parentUuid":"c7c10a2a-f381-4dc2-8511-53400ceb4a90","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3d","rootUuid":"c7c10a2a-f381-4dc2-8511-53400ceb4a90","name":"Szkoła Główna Handlowa w Warszawie","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709265878c28a0473950cd"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Niepewność, czyli normalność? : studia społeczno-ekonomiczne nad młodymi pracownikami sprekaryzowanymi.

The results of our study proved that CA, GA3 and HA improved the shoot length, shoot thickness, leaf area and leaf chlorophyll of pear as compared with the control. Moreover, they also positively increased the fruit set percentage and final yield of ‘Le Conte’ pear. The fruit weight, size and firmness were also improved under the influence of aforementioned treatments. The fruit soluble solids, total sugars, leaf nitrogen, leaf phosphorus and leaf potassium of pear were also enhanced as compared with the control. Additionally, spraying of GA3 at 150 ppm, as well as, HA at 5 and 4% were the superior treatments and showed the most significant impact on plant growth, yield, fruit quality and leaf mineral content of pear.

We posit that the different legal forms allow for different risk-coping mechanisms. We incorporate analysis of variance (ANOVA) on data obtained via a survey distributed among households running a business in Poland, a country where the pandemic threatens poverty-reducing growth. We confirm that between the groups of households running a business in various legal forms, there are statistically significant differences regarding the impact of COVID-19.

The paper aims at analyzing the possibilities of using Big Data Analytics in healthcare. The research is based on a critical analysis of the literature, as well as the presentation of selected results of direct research on the use of Big Data Analytics in medical facilities. The direct research was carried out based on research questionnaire and conducted on a sample of 217 medical facilities in Poland. Literature studies have shown that the use of Big Data Analytics can bring many benefits to medical facilities, while direct research has shown that medical facilities in Poland are moving towards data-based healthcare because they use structured and unstructured data, reach for analytics in the administrative, business and clinical area. The research positively confirmed that medical facilities are working on both structural data and unstructured data. The following kinds and sources of data can be distinguished: from databases, transaction data, unstructured content of emails and documents, data from devices and sensors. However, the use of data from social media is lower as in their activity they reach for analytics, not only in the administrative and business but also in the clinical area. It clearly shows that the decisions made in medical facilities are highly data-driven.

Dough kneading is the most important technological operation in the production of bakery products. When organoleptically assessing the consistency of the dough, it is difficult to accurately determine its rheological properties while maintaining the mass of water and its intensity at a constant level of the mass of the kneaded dough, considering the processed flour. However, our proposed procedure can solve these problems. According to the results obtained, it was experimentally found that the nature of changes in the specific intensity of dough kneading, which contributed to obtaining the best quality bread at a kneading body rotational speed of 150 rpm, is optimal. The dough kneading intensity leads to a reduction in the kneading time from 290 s at nm=60 rpm to 90 s at nm=240 rpm. The optimal duration of dough kneading  was 124 s.\n\nThe results make it possible to determine the water absorption capacity of flour in the production of bakery products, considering its baking properties and dough recipe, and, accordingly, the optimal moisture content of the dough"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159281","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62daef3840970752a1f3baf8","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"3","number":"11 (117)","doi":null,"documentHash":"0e6a2313-d5c7-45e0-b5f8-4ea607f28970"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"3","pagesFromTo":"31-38","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/257323/256875","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62daf07540970752a1f3bebb","name":"Azret","lastName":"Shingissov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0726-8232","documentHash":"36ada2d9-3f44-4539-a639-1aae485492df"},{"objectId":"62daf07540970752a1f3beba","name":"Saltanat","lastName":"Mussayeva","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1430-9768","documentHash":"c8e9ff72-1449-49f6-9303-afc9e1be574a"},{"objectId":"62daf07540970752a1f3beb9","name":"Gulmira","lastName":"Yessirkep","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2350-1871","documentHash":"d1ee6b33-a0bd-4272-ba68-ec969c7f073f"},{"objectId":"62daf07540970752a1f3beb8","name":"Alimzhan","lastName":"Imanbayev","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4443-265X","documentHash":"ce5474de-d895-4a7d-88b2-57b79e3a8435"},{"objectId":"62daf07540970752a1f3beb7","name":"Elvira","lastName":"Mailybayeva","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6322-4496","documentHash":"3b603d36-52c1-483e-87b5-5499715a0dcb"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.257323"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Children with psoriasis and COVID-19: factors associated with an unfavourable COVID-19 course, and the impact of infection on disease progression (Chi-PsoCov registry)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478b26","mniswId":"12892","title":"Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology","doi":null,"issn":"0926-9959","eissn":"1468-3083","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"fbfae60e-4144-4be2-bc95-fcd8a3d81abd"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62df8f2d4097075e7c9138bb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6595350c4097076c14900ba0","6595350c4097076c14900ba1","6595350c4097076c14900ba2","6595350c4097076c14900ba3","6595350c4097076c14900ba4","5e7092de878c28a04739e7a3","6595350c4097076c14900ba5","6595350c4097076c14900ba6","6595350c4097076c14900ba7","6595350c4097076c14900ba8","6595350c4097076c14900ba9","6595350c4097076c14900baa","6595350c4097076c14900bab","6595350c4097076c14900bac","6595350c4097076c14900bad","6595350c4097076c14900bae","6595350c4097076c14900baf","6595350c4097076c14900bb0","6595350c4097076c14900bb1","6595350c4097076c14900bb2","6595350c4097076c14900bb3","6595350c4097076c14900bb4","6595350c4097076c14900bb5","6595350c4097076c14900bb6","6595350c4097076c14900bb7","6595350c4097076c14900bb8","6595350c4097076c14900bb9","6595350c4097076c14900bba","6595350c4097076c14900bbb","6595350c4097076c14900bbc","6595350c4097076c14900bbd","6595350c4097076c14900bbe","6595350c4097076c14900bbf","6595350c4097076c14900bc0","6595350c4097076c14900bc1"]},"issue":"11","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background\r\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has raised questions regarding the management of chronic skin diseases, especially in patients on systemic treatments. Data concerning the use of biologics in adults with psoriasis are reassuring, but data specific to children are missing. Moreover, COVID-19 could impact the course of psoriasis in children.\r\n\r\nObjectives\r\nThe aim of this study was therefore to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the psoriasis of children, and the severity of the infection in relation to systemic treatments.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nWe set up an international registry of paediatric psoriasis patients. Children were included if they were under 18 years of age, had a history of psoriasis, or developed it within 1 month of COVID-19 and had COVID-19 with or without symptoms.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nOne hundred and twenty episodes of COVID-19 in 117 children (mean age: 12.4 years) were reported. The main clinical form of psoriasis was plaque type (69.4%). Most children were without systemic treatment (54.2%); 33 (28.3%) were on biologic therapies, and 24 (20%) on non-biologic systemic drugs. COVID-19 was confirmed in 106 children (88.3%) and 3 children had two COVID-19 infections each. COVID-19 was symptomatic for 75 children (62.5%) with a mean duration of 6.5 days, significantly longer for children on non-biologic systemic treatments (P = 0.02) and without systemic treatment (P = 0.006) when compared with children on biologics. The six children who required hospitalization were more frequently under non-biologic systemic treatment when compared with the other children (P = 0.01), and particularly under methotrexate (P = 0.03). After COVID-19, the psoriasis worsened in 17 cases (15.2%). Nine children (8%) developed a psoriasis in the month following COVID-19, mainly a guttate form (P = 0.01).\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nBiologics appear to be safe with no increased risk of severe form of COVID-19 in children with psoriasis. COVID-19 was responsible for the development of psoriasis or the worsening of a known psoriasis for some children."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159285","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"36","pagesFromTo":"2076-2086","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jdv.18361","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6595350c4097076c14900bc1","name":"E.","lastName":"Mahe","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b71af472-d865-451d-b3c7-92b9e1a8b80c"},{"objectId":"6595350c4097076c14900bc0","name":"H.","lastName":"Bachelez","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"42171598-5440-439a-ab8e-f40bf0b1f9a4"},{"objectId":"6595350c4097076c14900bbf","name":"C.","lastName":"Flohr","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"81708105-6bb9-419c-8329-b9535a7a935a"},{"objectId":"6595350c4097076c14900bbe","name":"C.H.","lastName":"Smith","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b4b3ce71-c2f8-44b6-a9d2-a72240894b5a"},{"objectId":"6595350c4097076c14900bbd","name":"S.K.","lastName":"Mahil","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c2026f60-b0c8-44f8-ac3e-3bf0f317f3d9"},{"objectId":"6595350c4097076c14900bbc","name":"E.","lastName":"Sonkoly","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fc7e1263-b15a-4c6d-a1aa-1277a4197f5d"},{"objectId":"6595350c4097076c14900bbb","name":"J.M.P.A.","lastName":"van

The components of medium-speed marine engines fueled with distillation and residual fuels were investigated. Digital images of new and used injector nozzles without deposits and with random deposits formed after natural operation on marine ships, respectively, were taken. Macro and microscopy images of external surfaces were taken in a shadowless tent and were illuminated with low-temperature lamps. The characteristic surfaces of the injector nozzles were virtually separated from the white background. The amount and quality of the resulting deposits on individual injector nozzles was determined by means of a global analysis of the blackening degree of gray images and the share of basic RGB (red, green, blue) colors. Basic central statistical measures were applied to assess the deposits of the investigated injector nozzles, and models of wear were developed. There have been archived photographs of the distinguished surfaces of various types of bodies and needles of injector nozzles and results of images analysis performed. This method is an innovative, nondestructive diagnostic technique for the characterization of deposits in internal combustion engines with the use of symptoms expressed in numerical form. Digital images were analyzed with basic central statistical measures, which were calculated from a sample of random pixel variables."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159287","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62d91e9b40970776cd0ad57b","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"fa4455b3-5bcf-484c-ad01-1faf76e03092"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"04-15-02-0010","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sae.org/publications/technical-papers/content/04-15-02-0010/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a047397297","name":"JAN","lastName":"MONIETA","uuid":"5126CD6588EC51E96B1493D017947160A0937C6B4EC70C8F68E8206045627308F6C6407B4F63AB006B0B7E5470275189A0785A0CF022D45F1C643E8E323F3BBF","orcidId":"0000-0003-2992-5800","documentHash":"51e85aa9-9cbd-422f-9a89-b61a94515f35"}],"doi":"10.4271/04-15-02-0010"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet

Classroom Practices and Participation contributes to a better understanding of plurilingual education in Catalonia by providing a description of the interactional resources mobilised by learners as social actors.<br />This volume is a collection of studies that show interactions containing plurilingual and multimodal sequences that illustrate moments of potential acquisition of aspects of language use. Analysing data collected through ethnographic fieldwork, the studies explore interactions in primary, secondary, and tertiary milieus as well as non-formal settings and examine how participants organise their interaction, their ways of participating, and the resources they mobilise for them. The linguistic policies of the educational settings studied establish the use of a given language but contain samples of plurilingual practices in which languages like Arabic, Catalan, English, French, Greek, Mandarin, Punjabi, Riffian Berber, Spanish and Urdu come into play. The chapters explore the links between these practices and the construction of participation in the ongoing interaction.<br />Although focused on language education in Catalonia, results can be transferred to classrooms worldwide which host plurilingual learners. Thus, the volume is an excellent resource for teachers and researchers interested in plurilingual education and can be used as a reference book in doctoral studies and teacher training programmes in this research

The presented attempt of the prospective approach to the phenomena and processes which may result from the transformation of the hard coal mining in Poland is aimed at better understanding of the role which may be fulfilled in the future by the local self-government in the area of which the operating or disused mines and mining enterprises are located.

The SDCM and EGNOS corrections were applied for two GPS code measurements on L1 frequency: C1C and C1W. The approach is based mainly on the constrained least squares adjustment, but for the horizontal and vertical coordinates, the Kalman Filter was applied in order to reduce pseudo-range noises. It allows for obtaining a higher autonomous accuracy of GPS/(SDCM+EGNOS) positioning than when using only the GPS/EGNOS or GPS/SDCM system. The final dual-redundant solution, in which two SBAS systems were used (EGNOS+SDCM) and two GPS pseudo-ranges (C1C+C1W) were present, yielded RMS errors of 0.11 m for the horizontal coordinates and 0.25 m for the vertical coordinates. Moreover, the accuracy analysis in the developed mathematical model for the determined 3D coordinates with simultaneous use of EGNOS and SDCM systems proved to be much more reliable than using only a single EGNOS or SDCM system. The presented approach can be used not only for precise navigation, but also for some geoscience applications and remote sensing where the reliable accuracy of autonomous GPS positioning is required."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159314","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62d8fff240970776cd094ac3","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"13","doi":null,"documentHash":"2712129f-7771-4153-9d4b-650b42cc9603"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"3152","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/13/3152/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709392878c28a0473ad091","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Krasuski","uuid":"E02DFF6ECAD7C971D02A801D49C09DA9B4224002D3F790476E1F025331F1AE26556F3F24337E6449D926BEF800AB28D2FC3EA5F9C4B851D143183D47367A9D24","orcidId":"0000-0001-9821-4450","documentHash":"d6d3c536-1936-45dc-8cc6-9715d96d01e7"},{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fd5c","name":"Mieczysław","lastName":"Bakuła","uuid":"64D932F305FA7594C14AAB457AF85E74D8CC3A758130A70317931ACAE510CAEA9176FD4C4C54709FE147E99290DF931A436B52A3637E23116D509BD6DD4E21EE","orcidId":"0000-0002-7180-8483","documentHash":"ff74a0a4-93d6-46b1-83c0-989664e8b74e"},{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fd43","name":"Karol","lastName":"Dawidowicz","uuid":"BA5AE598D2379EEFFA2E9E777BC139E68FB1CB29D959B7C8C1888F62A95AFC9DDFDC9CCE33D5F9AD5355B5B1688578588371F23B7383A940E8F9C11AA634E411","orcidId":"0000-0002-8837-700X","documentHash":"0e1799ca-4648-462a-9882-cb55fd429832"}],"doi":"10.3390/rs14133152"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sustainable energy consumption","adolescents with ASD","parenting attitudes","household finance","household budget"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","uid":"bLoLgWizTVEIn0ZQBwSDx-Q","uuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","parentUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","rootUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","name":"Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092da878c28a04739e216"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Parental Attitudes and Awareness of Sustainable Energy Consumption in the Opinion of Young People with Autistic-Spectrum Disorder (ASD); Implications for the Family Budget","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"ENERGIES","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1073","eissn":"1996-1073","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"a7f84d5f-371d-47eb-9ee1-0e47f7541f70"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62da66ca40970752a1f0b66e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092da878c28a04739e216","62da66ca40970752a1f0b671","62da66ca40970752a1f0b672"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Energy efficiency through energy saving is a key trend in the modern world. Analyses have been conducted by scientists in different fields on various target groups that influence sustainable energy consumption. The aim of the research presented in this article is to determine the association between parental attitudes and awareness of sustainable energy consumption in the perception of young people with ASD (13–17 years old). This was a pilot study. The diagnostic-survey method was used, along with The Scale of Parental Attitudes by M. Plopa and an authored survey questionnaire. Deliberate random sampling was applied. A statistical analysis showed a relationship between the acceptance attitude of both parents and the autonomy attitude of one parent—the father—and awareness of sustainable energy consumption among young people with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In addition, a critical literature review confirmed the necessity of combining energy awareness and financial awareness, as each aspect, in terms of energy savings, reflects the financial situation of the household and influences the household budget. This is extremely important in the case of vulnerable groups such as households with a person with a disability (e.g., children with ASD). This research is interdisciplinary and covers important scientific fields such as pedagogy, psychology, and economics."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159316","journalIssue":{"objectId":"621679e52467f04ac0dc71a7","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"42b00240-cbb1-44e9-b565-eef7bd2d61c4"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"nr art. 1730, 12s.","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/5/1730/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62da66ca40970752a1f0b672","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Plutecka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"644aac0b-8731-4cd2-90e2-1068483420eb"},{"objectId":"62da66ca40970752a1f0b671","name":"Anna","lastName":"Gagat-Matuła","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9349-5924","documentHash":"4063f908-5b60-48ce-ae73-636f508c98d7"},{"objectId":"5e7092da878c28a04739e216","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Frączek","uuid":"FDA5D01AF7EA679189FE0B27AE82486B3A591C4EFE61BCCFBADFC944DD653B21B6C6EF1571FB9EE96172E854AEB2B8F23A7028A8903452884A1BECF50E2C49E0","orcidId":"0000-0003-0031-7801","documentHash":"014f9ce4-4f2f-416e-a835-3fa9b7d38745"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15051730"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"9783631847862","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec3","uid":"b_9NiJIcGgZWXtEWJE8jQqA","uuid":"4169b1a2-272f-4d09-958d-267440f449a1","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec3","parentUuid":"4169b1a2-272f-4d09-958d-267440f449a1","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec3","rootUuid":"4169b1a2-272f-4d09-958d-267440f449a1","name":"Instytut Slawistyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ba878c28a0473c29eb","5e7092d6878c28a04739dcd5"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Breaking the Frame.

Macroalgal cultivation is a promising circular economy solution to achieve nutrient reduction and food security. However, the location of production hotspots is not well known. In this paper the production potential of macroalgae of high commercial value was predicted across the Baltic Sea region. In addition, the nutrient limitation within and adjacent to macroalgal farms was investigated to suggest optimal site-specific configuration of farms. The production potential of Saccharina latissima was largely driven by salinity and the highest production yields are expected in the westernmost Baltic Sea areas where salinity is >23. The direct and interactive effects of light availability, temperature, salinity and nutrient concentrations regulated the predicted changes in the production of Ulva intestinalis and Fucus vesiculosus. The western and southern Baltic Sea exhibited the highest farming potential for these species, with promising areas also in the eastern Baltic Sea. Macroalgal farming did not induce significant nutrient limitation. The expected spatial propagation of nutrient limitation caused by macroalgal farming was less than 100–250 m. Higher propagation distances were found in areas of low nutrient and low water exchange (e.g. offshore areas in the Baltic Proper) and smaller distances in areas of high nutrient and high water exchange (e.g. western Baltic Sea and Gulf of Riga). The generated maps provide the most sought-after input to support blue growth initiatives that foster the sustainable development of macroalgal cultivation and reduction of in situ nutrient loads in

These cultivars were grown in two winter seasons: 2018/2019 and 2019/2020 at the experimental farm Fac. of Agric., Suez Canal Univ., Ismailia, Egypt, under two watering regimes: normal (100%) and stress (50% FC) conditions. Six agronomic traits and five tolerance indices, namely stress tolerance (TOL), mean productivity (MP), geometric mean productivity (GMP), yield stability index (YSI), and drought susceptibility index (DSI), were used to evaluate the impact of drought stress. The results reflected Giza 171, Misr 2, and Giza 168 as precious germplasm for breeding of high-yielding drought-tolerant wheat. A highly significant positive correlation was recorded between yield under normal and stress conditions on the one hand and each of MP and GMP on the other hand. In addition, YSI appeared engaged in a highly significant positive correlation with yield under drought conditions only. TOL and DSI appeared insignificantly correlated with yield. Therefore, MP and GMP were reflected as the first runners among indices suitable to distinguish the high-yielding cultivars under drought conditions. At the molecular level, five primers of Start Codon Targeted (SCoT) markers were able to resolve and characterize the studied cultivars, which reflected SCoT as a potent gene-targeting molecular marker, able to characterize and resolve genetic diversity in wheat at the cultivar level using few primers. Therefore, SCoT is a time-efficient molecular marker, and it can efficiently replace indices in characterization of drought-tolerant genotypes with a high confidence level and reasonable cost.

Physical exercise is a well-established strategy to improve the mood of healthy and depressed individuals. Increasing evidence suggests that exercise might also improve emotional reactivity in healthy adults by increasing or decreasing brain responses to positive or negative stimuli, respectively. It is unknown, however, if exercise could also benefit emotional reactivity in depressed individuals. We investigated the effects of a single aerobic exercise session on mood and emotional reactivity in 24 depressed and 24 matched healthy young adults. Self-reported mood and neural reactivity to emotional pictures (indexed by the EEG late positive potential, LPP) were assessed before and after two experimental protocols: exercise (36 min of moderate-intensity exercise at 75% of maximal heart rate) and seated rest condition (36 min). In the healthy control group, exercise improved self-reported mood and neural emotional reactivity (increasing LPP to positive pictures). In the depressed group, exercise improved self-reported mood; however, it did not affect neural emotional reactivity. Additional analyses performed on both groups revealed that exercise-induced changes in emotional reactivity are associated with the severity of depressive symptoms: the effectiveness of exercise in improving emotional reactivity decreases with the severity of depressive symptoms. Overall, the study further strengthens the claim of a beneficial role of exercise on mood and emotional reactivity. It also suggests that a single aerobic exercise session might have a limited influence on neural emotional reactivity in depressed individuals."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159327","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"60","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/302150","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6556ce6c40970749a869e50a","name":"Junghofer","lastName":"Markus","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8bd37229-aeaf-440e-94c8-2ed73333bad7"},{"objectId":"62de5cd740970762378d6f2e","name":"Markus","lastName":"Junghofer","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8532-2986","documentHash":"8e57ab0c-b128-4b0c-a1a1-cebf4781d3e1"},{"objectId":"62de5cd740970762378d6f2d","name":"Miroslaw","lastName":"Wyczesany","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f3ea1e9d-45a2-4fd0-8425-720291b2baa5"},{"objectId":"62de5cd740970762378d6f2b","name":"Tomasz S.","lastName":"Ligeza","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2420-7204","documentHash":"7913ffd2-c3d4-4fef-98db-a75ad38dcb2b"},{"objectId":"5e70932c878c28a0473a44ec","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Ligęza","uuid":"265C56E69CA6635A99EE1516EEE35F6A10AAE37835AFF0115DBD88705B63D6182FC7E7CA0E249A2458096482A97A1348CDA3ABCD41E3F098128F3F567BD31B8F","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b50aaa84-2b19-45f4-b571-21254387fe8e"},{"objectId":"5e709316878c28a0473a2a4d","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Wyczesany","uuid":"202E5C7C18C91856C1B5EAB4BFF20CF344BD698DE18BD422EFB34FE76FEE6DBFDD02291AA78775A553617F3AA3A4AA743562BB2A2660BD4D47D387E80699540C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2909ebdf-021e-45e1-a3f6-a4956b1df3bd"},{"objectId":"5e70923e878c28a0473924b9","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"MACIEJCZYK","uuid":"E0A224080BCD7374AFB4F40DD8BF9AD7C9DC00CD3E19C1265BF98D64BCB4FD7A191CF96A4DD7A69EE6F156B6910BBB8AEAF01078C880E9C103DA0327E011F6F9","orcidId":"0000-0002-9505-4081","documentHash":"bbf43f67-2f2c-42e7-8b1c-b0e1d582a980"}],"doi":"10.1111/psyp.14137"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091be878c28a0473873ea","uid":"bYQKxifulEuEJLcUdbBIzPA","uuid":"61768707-7dd1-4777-87bb-ee42bb9201f9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Katedra Biochemii i Toksykologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63c7af614097076d26ffead8","5e7093c6878c28a0473b0980","5e709225878c28a047390ac6"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Effect pf fermented rapeseed meal as a feed component on the redox and immune system of pregnant sows and their offspring","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547705d","mniswId":"1208","title":"Annals of Animal Science","doi":null,"issn":"1642-3402","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e9d5cce1-c361-423f-b07d-f938aa6a284b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-04-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62d7d8d04097075e7c009aff","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709225878c28a047390ac6","5e7093c6878c28a0473b0980","63c7af614097076d26ffead8"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the study was to assess the effect of dried fermented rapeseed meal (FRSM) in diets for sows on blood redox and immunological parameters, taking into account the physiological period (pregnancy or lactation) and age (primiparous vs multiparous sows). The experiment also aimed to determine how FRSM administered to pregnant sows, affects the antioxidant and immune systems of piglets. The animals were divided into 4 groups of 15 animals each. Control groups of primiparous (CG) and multiparous sows (cs) received a standard diet for pregnant or lactating sows. Experimental groups of primiparous (Eg) and multiparous sows (Es) received feed with a 4% share of FRSM in place of soybean meal up to day 100 of gestation, 9% share of FRSM from day 100 of gestation to day 7 of lactation, and then again 4% share of FRSM until the end of lactation. in the blood plasma of pregnant sows fed diet with frsm addition, higher frap value and vitamin C, uric acid (ua), immunoglobulin igg content, lymphocytes (lym) count and a lower content of malondialdehyde (mda), lipid hydroperoxides (looh), immunoglobulin igm was noted than in the blood plasma of control sows. Both primiparous and multiparous lactation sows whose feed included frsm had higher catalase (cat) activity, higher frap, vitamin C, immunoglobulin igg and il-6 content, and lower ua content than the control sows. Piglets born to sows fed diet with FRSM addition had significantly higher FRAP values, vitamin C, IgG, and IL-6 content and white blood cells (wBc) count and lower mda and ua content in the blood plasma than piglets born to  sows  from  control  group.  Multiparous  sows  compared  to  primiparous  sows  had  higher  cat  activity,  and  higher  vitamin C,  looh,  creatinine  (crEat),  and  igm  content.  Elevated  frap,  and crEat levels and reduced mda content were also observed in the plasma of the multiparous sows  compared  to  primiparous  sows  during  lactation.  Multiparous  lactation  sows  compared  to  primiparous sows had lower wBc count, and igg and igm content. Piglets born to multiparous sows  had  higher  frap  values,  looh  content  and  IgA  content,  while  lower  mda  content  compared to piglets born to primiparous sows. The inclusion of dried fermented rapeseed meal in feed for sows significantly stimulates antioxidant processes in primiparous and multiparous sows and in their piglets. The inclusion of dried fermented rapeseed meal in the diet of sows stimulates anti-oxidant processes in primiparous and multiparous sows and in their piglets. This is responsible for stimulation of the immune system (increased LYM counts and IgG  titres in the blood plasma). The improved antioxidant status in the plasma suggests that dried fermented rapeseed meal stimulated the immune system of pregnant and lactating sows and their newborn offspring."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159332","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"201-219","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://sciendo.com/article/10.2478/aoas-2021-0034","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63c7af614097076d26ffead8","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Kiesz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8ce30215-18fd-4350-952d-35f52a75848c"},{"objectId":"5e7093c6878c28a0473b0980","name":"Anna","lastName":"Stępniowska","uuid":"20B97CF551353409DDDB390F14EF99535022CCF3B9867EC979D4B5CD2FEC03C90E484AD3FA96D590080F65350B4D2869B5926E5FB809C162ED208DDF8226B7E5","orcidId":"0000-0003-2424-8935","documentHash":"f160d32b-278f-4b64-84fa-4798fa78d909"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a047390ac6","name":"Anna","lastName":"Czech","uuid":"66AFEBE34A215F792E4BF9DA4F50E7C4F7DF36C2A969B753167696922ECCC2C7FA736EFB37323E61D169D24DDC617F33184567E9BBC202E41A560078CE8A2D21","orcidId":"0000-0003-4142-2608","documentHash":"b85c8033-f20d-4b2f-948e-e153a65147bc"}],"doi":"10.2478/aoas-2021-0034"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb8","uid":"b7PvUaY5TWchofSOMfDP_aQ","uuid":"e4059d4a-c713-487c-aeb1-a2f4e0ff4e87","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb8","parentUuid":"e4059d4a-c713-487c-aeb1-a2f4e0ff4e87","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb8","rootUuid":"e4059d4a-c713-487c-aeb1-a2f4e0ff4e87","name":"Instytut

research aims to empirically verify the role and importance of global news stations on an international scale, analyse multicultural audience reactions to media reports, and identify the most frequently shared COVID-19 information based on hard data (webometric indicators and data from social media). The author tries to answer the question how global media coverage shaped during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and what made the information more shareable online during this period? The presented study combines different methodological approaches. First, the quantitative method focuses on collecting a massive volume of data (news from websites, website traffic data such as website visitors, monthly visitor traffic, the length of time spent on the website or the number of views), analysis of digital audiences (engagement on social media profiles and level of news shareability), and quantitative and qualitative content analysis of selected news. Results show visible differences and similarities between audience reactions of CNN International (USA), BBC World (Great Britain), Deutsche Welle (Germany), RT (Russia), France24 (France), EuroNews (France/Europe), and Al-Jazeera (Qatar)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159433","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"93-104","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003232049-10/7news-shareability-analysis-bart%C5%82omiej-%C5%82%C3%B3dzki?context=ubx&refId=689b9c48-5440-47e7-aaa7-37911eb5be92","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092f1878c28a04739fa6a","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Łódzki","uuid":"FD6625B53C07F28EF6B292115306CE2DE0C14693F027233508D1FA96191808D187A5E83B5E855491D0D833404A95F24E1CE31E0A4D4E28C252560E67CB45308F","orcidId":"0000-0003-3526-6485","documentHash":"7a97eef8-9ef3-4530-b8a8-504aae2706cd"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Cognitive Factors in Elite Handball: Do Players’ Positions Determine their Cognitive Processes?","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478780","mniswId":"11362","title":"Journal of Human Kinetics","doi":null,"issn":"1640-5544","eissn":"1899-7562","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"81e00711-0dad-40dd-b75e-2b463bd99f5d"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6282235a4097077bd404b874","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709331878c28a0473a4a87","5e7094a8878c28a0473c12b8","5e709333878c28a0473a4c02","5e70925b878c28a0473944ed","5e709248878c28a047392f18"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058159435","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"82","pagesFromTo":"213-221","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/hukin-2022-0063","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c12b8","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Wrześniewski","uuid":"B24128F200C28B0F9BB0A4AF3BE947CEF074B1B3F4EAD052F2451BB0769FC2B2D83C0C597C28B52B93286633E7C01E2C9BDE391DF9CC56574EA8DD8C383343F1","orcidId":"0000-0003-3443-5638","documentHash":"45774c6b-8586-4a81-a939-9f46e16109c7"},{"objectId":"5e709333878c28a0473a4c02","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Siekańska","uuid":"D95A59E0CA830AD47D451FD720397690B385E5A97D99FF2003D4DDBB3CCF5B135BF73AF16E04B3DD5B010513C2EDC20D42E91940E902762A555F743FD166C263","orcidId":"0000-0003-2044-1164","documentHash":"fc888f0f-f264-4f25-953e-bdf33429c187"},{"objectId":"5e709331878c28a0473a4a87","name":"JAN","lastName":"BLECHARZ","uuid":"46A0D88C91F0722A55283C3EAF84863C77960216FA433B0E9E7C4953EEEBEF66A10854E535D726D16DFDF1895744490B33997E9DF9C952E073A70DFAD4B08FC4","orcidId":"0000-0003-4065-8782","documentHash":"b5e7cc1f-b042-4b3e-8f85-2eb76a5d58fa"},{"objectId":"5e70925b878c28a0473944ed","name":"TADEUSZ","lastName":"AMBROŻY","uuid":"B4D2982C5A50E6C95A7D48137E743EA9E41C3361F3700C705F2A5B5C0301AFC0040F75003E0EC8CB8DC072B632C844CD81D06BBA332C53666E658B5AE9046341","orcidId":"0000-0001-7361-9478","documentHash":"05ff181a-e409-44f0-bd9e-0210d7d6fef7"},{"objectId":"5e709248878c28a047392f18","name":"Michał","lastName":"Spieszny","uuid":"C88B291BD66A7A8FB6D3F52FD809F8AA8D86A629C398E8C4F48DB6717CFF4F6F6483E71B9EDE5971C1B68C3DBD491D849F7E18038CDC71F0C6AFF0CCA5AF340B","orcidId":"0000-0002-9934-6911","documentHash":"625309f1-ee31-4c1a-9de7-27465516a837"}],"doi":"10.2478/hukin-2022-0063"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["kodeks wykroczeń","nowelizacje","prawo"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["code of offenses","amendments","law"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62baabb3409707490d79e6ea","doi":null,"title":"Prawo wykroczeń.

The study included 139 patients with an initial Gleason score of 7 (3+4 or 4+3) i.e., Grade Group 2-3 (GG2-GG3) treated between 2008 and 2013. The clinical outcome was assessed with respect to biochemical control (BC) and biochemical disease-free survival (bDFS). After re-evaluation, the majority of patients (96 patients – 69%) were up-graded from GG2-3. Finally, there were 4 patients (3%) with grade GG1, 12 patients (9%) – GG2, 27 patients (19%) – GG3, 51 patients (37%) – GG4 and 45 patients (32%) – GG5. In 42 patients (30%) a cribriform pattern was observed. Among the analyzed factors only the GGs were important for BC (p = 0.011) and the cribriform pattern was of borderline significance (p = 0.06). The 5-year biochemical control was 100% in GG1-3 and 84% in GG4-5. The 5-year biochemical control was 81% and 93%, if cribriform or no cribriform pattern was detected, respectively. In conclusion, re-evaluation and verification of pathology specimens in accordance with contemporary rules upgraded the Gleason score in the majority of patients.

Zn-Al layered double hydroxides intercalated with anionic food dyes are promising pigments. The best sources of dyes for intercalation are natural ones. The most promising are spices. Natural dyes from spices are often biologically active substances. The parameters of samples of Zn-Al (Zn:Al=3:1) hydroxides intercalated with natural food dyes, synthesized in the medium of aqueous tinctures of saffron and safflower, were studied. The crystal structure of the samples was studied by X-ray phase analysis; color characteristics were studied by spectroscopy and calculation of parameters in the CIE L*a*b system.\n\nThe possibility of synthesizing Zn-Al colored layered double hydroxides intercalated with natural dyes in the medium of saffron and safflower tinctures was shown. X-ray phase analysis showed that both pigment samples were layered double hydroxides with the α-Zn(OH)2 structure. For the pigment intercalated with saffron dye, the phenomenon of partial decomposition of Zn-Al LDH to ZnO during synthesis was revealed. The color characteristics of the samples were studied. Zn-Al LDH pigment synthesized in a saffron tincture had a bright yellow color determined by intercalated saffron carotenoids (crocin and crocetin). It was suggested that safflower dye flavonoids were partially hydrolyzed (red ones - cartamine and cartamidine, and yellow - Safflor Yellow A), which led to the formation of a dark orange-brown color of the sample. The prospects of using Zn-Al LDH intercalated with saffron food dyes as a cosmetic pigment were shown"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159449","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62db95c74097072b2a7b5939","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"3","number":"12

absorb dioxins from the environment through water and contact with sediments but the main source is food. These contaminants also enter the human body with food, including through the consumption of fish. This study presents the dioxin and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations in 145 samples of four fish species (herring, sprat, sea trout, salmon) caught in the southern Baltic Sea. The study results permit assessing whether the efforts made in recent years to reduce dioxin and PCB emissions into the environment have translated into decreases in concentrations of these pollutants in Baltic Sea fishes and whether these raw fish materials meet food law requirements. The safest fish species with regard to dioxins were designated, as were those of which consumption should be limited. The influence of fish age (length) and weight on dioxin and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyl (dl-PCB) concentrations was investigated.

support and decision making systems find increasingly more applications in various modes of transport. In this connection, criteria of movement safety assessment must be established for manned, unmanned, and autonomous vehicles, bearing in mind the specifics of each transport mode. Distance is one of the basic criteria. In sea transport these include the closest point of approach and ship’s domain understood as an area that should remain free of other objects. The authors examine the relationship between the declared domain and the actually maintained effective domain in a restricted area. They define the coefficient describing this relationship for different ship’s relative bearings in the form of a mathematical function. The formulated relationship allows determining an effective passing distance based on the declared, i.e., assumed passing distance. The determined relationship also enables identification of the declarative domain based on the effective one. These relationships may be used in decision support systems of manned ships, in remote ship control centres and decision-making systems of autonomous ships for the assessment of ship movement safety, planning collision avoidance manoeuvres and generation of safe trajectories."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159463","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62556eec2467f052bcab125d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"13308194-f933-416b-8a24-b0075ae39a0b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/metrics?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0265681","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972d3","name":"MIROSŁAW","lastName":"WIELGOSZ","uuid":"D5DA71FE039FE94ADA12D6EB4673C88AB2AE064C97C33707C84AA841621BDC4A78872E9977E9FFD0B8AADC0C74EE6201C6C2B505BEA3A8FE500A1E1F77FC64B1","orcidId":"0000-0002-3113-5018","documentHash":"24582178-134c-426d-95e6-5429e07183ce"},{"objectId":"5e709239878c28a047391eb9","name":"ZBIGNIEW","lastName":"PIETRZYKOWSKI","uuid":"37FE929D552E69A08EBBED960118B5211697D3E05B3D5FA0E7E9503EAABDC758AAA61ECD44DD0E372653E6821D06CB9A98D2C93969D4DF01EFADC690A989CCAE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2116-9513","documentHash":"b771a43f-bd27-4c7c-aee2-36ee27a88afe"}],"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0265681"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Scirtiformia","Calvarium","Calvariopsis","biogeography","water beetles"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709231878c28a0473916db"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Calvariomorphus—a new genus of marsh beetles (Coleoptera: Scirtidae) with remarkable elytral excitators","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479b53","mniswId":"20563","title":"Zootaxa","doi":null,"issn":"1175-5326","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f5d28097-0095-4a2f-bf8d-8a5134ccde22"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"628227d74097070cd347e024","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709231878c28a0473916db","628227d74097070cd347e026"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A new genus of marsh beetles (Coleoptera: Scirtidae: Scirtinae) from Southeast Asia is described to accommodate Contacyphon peterseni (Klausnitzer, 1973) from Bismarck Archipelago and three newly described species: Calvariomorphus malayanus sp. nov.

During\nthis time, the virus structure, action, short- and long-term effects of the infection were discovered, and\ntreatments were developed. This epidemic undoubtedly affected people's lives, but increasing attention is also\nbeing paid to the effects of the epidemic on the environment. Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items\nfor Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines, a global scoping review of peer-reviewed information\nhas been conducted on the use of over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the treatment of\nsymptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infections and their positive and negative effects on the human body, the effects of\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on aquatic organisms, and their adverse effects on non-target\norganisms. The literature from 1998 to 2021 was analysed using the Scopus®, Web of Science™ (WoS) and\nGoogle Scholar databases. As non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs place a heavy burden on the environment,\nall reports of the presence of these drugs in the environment during the pandemic period have been thoroughly\nanalysed. Of the 70 peer-reviewed records within the scope, only 14% (n = 10) focussed on the analysis of non-\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs concentrations in wastewater and surface waters during the pandemic period.\nThe percentage of these works indicates that it is still an open topic, and this issue should be supplemented with\nfurther reports in which the results obtained during the pandemic, which has been going on for several years,\nwill be published. The authors hope this review will inspire scientists to investigate the problem of non-\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the environment to protect them for the next generation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159475","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"834","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972202410X?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62d7e6f3409707188caab8d9","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Guzik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b7b32031-8395-4945-b3b6-7e8f3d24e631"},{"objectId":"5e7092eb878c28a04739f3de","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Guzik","uuid":"0D94734CE134720A235519E96CD2E74DFA590022F15E7F2309D756E74A787A731CD64C5D786B5A2F899E4242804A90A287A944D4818C78F7F3C3540B77DC9D50","orcidId":"0000-0001-6349-3808","documentHash":"42131059-b1c8-46a1-a266-c60663de92fb"},{"objectId":"5e7092eb878c28a04739f388","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Wojcieszyńska","uuid":"359B748443D81566A70305EE935B4008BA14CF9D8C7FBD7B6DF364C6B8047CDF396D0438C9BE9A814AC815EA5810FBD3DAD91239403F4EA3F5BDA24EA291B0FA","orcidId":"0000-0002-6681-0992","documentHash":"d533ecfb-8790-4e20-9f11-eab5361715e7"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155317"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62de91ad4097075e7c88b15c","doi":"10.1515/9783110755138","title":"Zukunft der Sprache - Zukunft der Nation?

The current longitudinal study investigated the relationship between phonological short-term memory, WM capacity, and the development of L2 grammar knowledge over the period of two years. This report is\r\npart of an ongoing larger-scale study including the components of reading, writing, and speaking.\r\nParticipants were 107 Year 1, 2, and 3 Polish university students majoring in English as an L2.

Fipronil is a kind of pesticide that is widely used in agriculture, thus this trial was conducted to evaluate the effect of fipronil on growth related parameters (final body weight, feed intake, weight gain, feed conversion ratio, specific growth rate, and protein efficiency ratio), hematology related parameters (RBCs, WBCs, hemoglobin, packed cell volume, and deferential leukocytic count), biochemistry related parameters (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total protein, albumin, urea, and creatinine), histopathology of liver, intestine, gills, and spleen, and gene expression of antioxidants, stress, inflammatory, apoptotic, and related to junction proteins genes as SOD and GPx, COX II, TNF-α, Casp-3, and Claudin-3, respectively, in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Four hundred and five Nile tilapia fish were distributed in a glass aquarium into nine groups according to the Spirulina and S. cerevisiae supplemented diets, with or without fipronil contaminated water. The classified groups are control, Sc: S. cerevisiae (4 g/Kg diet), Sp: Spirulina (1 g/100 g diet), Fb1: 0.0021 mg fipronil/L, ScFb1: S. cerevisiae (4 g/Kg diet) with 0.0021 mg fipronil/L, SpFb1: Spirulina (1 g/100 g diet) with 0.0021 mg fipronil/L, Fb2: 0.0042 mg fipronil/L, ScFb2: S. cerevisiae (4 g/Kg diet) with 0.0042 mg fipronil/L, and SpFb2: Spirulina (1 g/100 g diet) with 0.0042 mg fipronil/L. The results of the present investigation indicated the negative effect of fipronil on the growth performance parameters of Nile tilapia, which was confirmed by the results of hematology, biochemistry, and histopathology. In addition, the results of gene expression of antioxidants, stress, inflammatory, and apoptotic genes indicate the genotoxicity of fipronil.

This retrospective, single-center study aimed to analyze bloodstream infections in patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the Military Institute of Medicine, Poland. Data from the years 2007-2019 were analyzed. When the infection was suspected, blood samples were drawn and analyzed microbiologically. When bacterial growth was observed, an antimicrobial susceptibility/resistance analysis was performed. Among 12,619 analyzed samples, 1,509 were positive, and 1,557 pathogens were isolated. In 278/1,509 of the positive cases, a central line catheter infection was confirmed. Gram-negative bacteria were the most frequently (770/1,557) isolated, including Acinetobacter baumannii (312/770), Klebsiella pneumoniae (165/770; 67/165 were the isolates that expressed extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), 5/165 isolates produced the New Delhi metallo-β-lactamases (NDM), 4/165 isolates expressed Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), and 1/165 isolate produced OXA48 carbapenemase), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (111/770; 2/111 isolates produced metallo-β-lactamase (MBL), and Escherichia coli (69/770; 11/69 - ESBL). Most Gram-positive pathogens were staphylococci (545/733), mainly coagulase-negative (368/545). Among 545 isolates of the staphylococci, 58 represented methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Fungi were isolated from 3.5% of samples. All isolated MRSA and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS) strains were susceptible to vancomycin, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolates - to isoxazolyl penicillins, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) - to linezolid and tigecycline. However, colistin was the only therapeutic option in some infections caused by A. baumannii and KPC-producing K. pneumoniae. P. aeruginosa was still susceptible to cefepime and ceftazidime. Echinocandins were effective therapeutics in the treatment of fungal infections."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159489","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62da8a9140970752a1f1f909","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"71","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"cd5aac98-f86b-403c-aabc-939cf98fddc0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"71","pagesFromTo":"263-277","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.33073/pjm-2022-025","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62da8a9140970752a1f1f906","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Woźniak-kosek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"43b833e3-1f97-456e-81ee-dc8b73e11916"},{"objectId":"62da8a9140970752a1f1f905","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Rybicki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a7980ecc-e604-4e88-aa3f-78ee2e9414da"},{"objectId":"62da8a9140970752a1f1f904","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Guzek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"82397fe3-2e3a-4248-bbb3-bc57a2c56d47"},{"objectId":"5e7094c1878c28a0473c3328","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Tomaszewski","uuid":"C7EC90662AB7B8A172276DA2530ECA61E4F65B6125273B509E0DF80F82D39E4C7311854429113AC6B8C7699FDDDB3AB276CD71CBB872503D3935E65E4A3AAF7E","orcidId":"0000-0002-6589-1460","documentHash":"5a1b6f5b-dd7a-40d6-9de3-f472b06506ca"}],"doi":"10.33073/pjm-2022-025"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mathematical modeling","fertilizer processing","nitrogen preservation","non-waste technology","organic fertilizer"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"62dae48840970752a1f3a85a","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Azerbaijan State Agricultural University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62dae48840970752a1f3a85f","62dae48840970752a1f3a85e","62dae48840970752a1f3a85d"]},{"id":"62dae48840970752a1f3a859","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Azerbaijan State University of Economics (UNEC)","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62dae48840970752a1f3a85c"]},{"id":"61e6d8f92467f030e8c394a9","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"University of Technology of Azerbaijan (UTECA)","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62dae48840970752a1f3a85b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Utilization of poultry droppings in terms of non-waste technology","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"Eastern-European Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-4061","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"3937afea-5395-4435-850d-06bbeb29d2c9"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62dae48840970752a1f3a857","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62dae48840970752a1f3a85b","62dae48840970752a1f3a85c","62dae48840970752a1f3a85d","62dae48840970752a1f3a85e","62dae48840970752a1f3a85f"]},"issue":"10 (117)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The processing of poultry droppings under anaerobic conditions, in special hermetic reactors – methane tanks is considered to be the most promising technology in terms of efficiency in agrochemical, environmental, and energy fields. Organic fertilizer in the methane tank is in the form of concentrated liquid, purified from disease causatives and weed seeds. It is easily absorbed by fermented plant mass and contains macro and micronutrients, amino acids and phytohormones that stimulate the development of the plant. The rare utilization of such facilities is explained by the lack of funds for their purchase. On the other hand, it is assumed that biogas is not a dominant factor in terms of economic efficiency, and organic fertilizer is also important. In this respect, the utilization of poultry droppings has also gained practical relevance.\n\nThe paper covers the discussion of the feasibility of utilizing poultry droppings as a non-waste technology. The methodological approach is based on the evaluation of more rational technological projects. In logical modeling, the rules drawn up by highly qualified specialists are used. The rules determine how to act in a certain situation. Such rules are considered favorable for non-skilled performers. The results of the studies have allowed analyzing the dynamics of nitrogen preservation depending on the utilization technology of poultry droppings and impact factors. Based on a mathematical model, a computer methodology for research on improving the energy efficiency of a poultry farm has been developed.

The paper aims to investigate the contribution of intellectual capital to banks' competitive and financial performance. METHODOLOGY: The paper uses data retrieved from a research survey. The questionnaire on IC contribution to banks' competitive performance was applied to executive managers of retail banks operating in the Polish banking market. The data collected for the assessment of financial performance were retrieved from banks' annual reports and referred to each year from 2012 to 2019. The data were analyzed by Principal Axis Factor Analysis (PAF) and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). FINDINGS: The results revealed that banks' competitive and financial performance depends on both the intellectual capital and environmental factors. The relation between financial performance and intellectual capital is positively mediated by competitive performance, and environmental factors can affect the strength of this relationship. The findings show that applying the resource-based theory might not be sufficient to gain a competitive advantage and sustainable market position in the case of banks. IMPLICATIONS: The results develop IC knowledge and prove the necessity to conduct systematic research on their importance for creating value for customers and gaining competitive advantage. They also provide direction for banks' decision-makers concerning factors that should be taken into account to create competitive advantage, market performance, and efficiency. The Polish banking market has transformed from undeveloped and non-competitive into a developed and competitive one during the last few decades. Thus, the results also have implications for other companies operating in transition markets as their competitiveness depends on understanding which factors should be the foundation for their market strategy and their competitiveness and efficiency to become a developed one. ORIGINALITY AND VALUE: The majority of the IC research concentrate on developed countries, and very little is known about developing and transition countries that were successful on their journey. Most of the research has focused on identifying and measuring IC components and the relationship between them. Usually, the research presents the state of the art and it is based on financial reports. However, the extent to which IC impacts competitive and financial performance in banking markets has been relatively rare. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first study to examine empirically the relationship between intellectual capital, environment, competitive performance, and efficiency in a transformed banking market in Europe, which analyses the IC contribution over a few years' perspectives."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159494","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b44a0c4097070c593bc09e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"18","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"e7117160-5440-4e6c-8f70-098df486a1b9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"105-136","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.7341/20221824","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709405878c28a0473b508a","name":"Monika","lastName":"Klimontowicz","uuid":"77CDD10CFEFF73714B88AB767DCBAF345CE64CF99B402398A8F51ED2573448003C2EC76845596265F35225343840553BB1D947CA6621C53A561A5A31DCBF032D","orcidId":"0000-0001-9215-1938","documentHash":"bdce9aa2-de6b-4842-bee1-d3393efe7daf"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473affe9","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Majewska","uuid":"620BCAC22D76BBF0EEAB83ACF503F66B2769599A53C48EFD77A9ECF99233009EA367344B76274EEBC96821D68E7834D44C96189E9D7CE4B10B6501E87E635BD6","orcidId":"0000-0001-7633-2608","documentHash":"21963af5-df2d-47d3-913a-8d0a4b3534a7"}],"doi":"10.7341/20221824"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","uid":"bhdVW0TkXv39ZSgac65mGnw","uuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","parentUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","rootUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","name":"Uniwersytet Komisji Edukacji Narodowej w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092c5878c28a04739c5d9"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Algebraic properties of Levi graphs associated with curve arrangements","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d0b0","mniswId":"17251","title":"Research in the Mathematical Sciences","doi":null,"issn":"2197-9847","eissn":"2197-9847","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"5868a005-6e77-4ea3-9af9-4a8f65f7367c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62da8bb940970752a1f20dc2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62da8bb940970752a1f20dc4","5e7092c5878c28a04739c5d9"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the present paper, we study algebraic properties of edge ideals associated with plane curve arrangements via their Levi graphs.

But the developers of the network face difficulties in the drone communication system associated with the need to take into consideration unpredictable weather conditions and terrain, as well as the short life of the drone's batteries. Therefore, the object of this study is the process of managing UAV traffic through the use of gNB-IoT in 5G.\n\nThe possibility of using a mobile UAV repeater during traffic management using radio resources (RR), radio access network (RAN), the infrastructure with broadcasting tools and dynamic connection using MU-MIMO modulation is shown. The use of these tools makes it possible to connect the drone to the wired base network from the provider and then restore the radio frequency signal and broadcast to another coverage area where this subscriber does not have network coverage, use the channel quality indicator (CQI) representation as a QoE function.\n\nUndoubtedly, traffic management is the process of obtaining information about traffic control from one endpoint to another, which confirms the reliability and management of data transmission. Meanwhile, drone traffic management can be used to reduce time delays and remove network interference by relying on Internet of Things programs that use NB-5G technology. The UAV's traffic management improvement process uses a proposed algorithm to generate dynamic flow data management to enhance traffic processing of flow control in the IoT"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159500","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62dacfe440970752a1f34e31","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"3","number":"9 (117)","doi":null,"documentHash":"4c593f37-c1af-403c-935f-451ebefd05c3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"3","pagesFromTo":"53-59","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/260084/256883","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62dad8ff40970752a1f3845a","name":"Oleksandr","lastName":"Nikitchyn","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7256-433X","documentHash":"c4a8dd46-ffa0-40a7-94f9-b8e0e231c13f"},{"objectId":"62dad8ff40970752a1f38459","name":"Yurii","lastName":"Khlaponin","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9287-0817","documentHash":"9a257ffb-3e56-40a9-9591-1f304d0eda63"},{"objectId":"62dad8ff40970752a1f38458","name":"Haidar Mahmood","lastName":"Jawad","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5130-9177","documentHash":"b231dd7a-eaad-4dad-a8b2-cd46b05e2bc3"},{"objectId":"62dad8ff40970752a1f38457","name":"Aqeel Mahmood","lastName":"Jawad Abu-Alshaeer","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-1671-7607","documentHash":"32f69669-7e8d-4734-9a72-1d421a234242"},{"objectId":"62dad8ff40970752a1f38456","name":"Nameer Hashim","lastName":"Qasim","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7283-0594","documentHash":"9c4cf6f5-6943-4f1e-b3ba-174df637d5e3"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.260084"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62de722240970762378ea28b","doi":null,"title":"Wybrane aspekty bezpieczeństwa pozamilitarnego : zagrożenia, wyzwania, koncepcje","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-7193-871-9","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://wydawnictwo.pcz.pl/book/223/bezpieczenstwo-pozamilitarne-w-xx-i-xxi-wieku-zagrozenia-wyzwania-koncepcje","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"6a4764b9-620a-4370-a4e8-798a00b585c4","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb892","mniswId":"47700","name":"Politechnika Częstochowska","documentHash":"8192b262-5605-47c7-a362-817d1478d004"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","uid":"bhdVW0TkXv39ZSgac65mGnw","uuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","parentUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","rootUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","name":"Uniwersytet Komisji Edukacji Narodowej w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709261878c28a047394a28"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Bezpieczeństwo służb specjalnych : wybrane aspekty","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62de731440970762378eb1de","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709261878c28a047394a28"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058159502","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"207-218","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394a28","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Żebrowski","uuid":"37360674FC67A8D2216589226E7AAE7D5425B4EA14BB200CEE937768DCF127BDB1E20F83F044CC5B972928F391D525A8B7C5983A7CC296BBCA70B000C49AC3B5","orcidId":"0000-0002-2779-9444","documentHash":"b884be1a-7660-4f55-b1ab-72e06a61103f"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["“texts for theatre”","new Polish drama","anthologizing"," anthology"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de47","uid":"b9NOtn1zRuLii9te8l8urZA","uuid":"c2e40008-ad66-4712-8be8-e06fa7235fd2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de47","parentUuid":"c2e40008-ad66-4712-8be8-e06fa7235fd2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de47","rootUuid":"c2e40008-ad66-4712-8be8-e06fa7235fd2","name":"Uniwersytet Pomorski w Słupsku","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70934d878c28a0473a6c80"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Od antologii do antologizowania.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the intergenerational changes in the age of menarche of girls living in rural and urban communities in the industrial region of Poland using samples from two different centuries and to determine the relationship between family structure (two-parent and single-parent) and sexual maturation of the girls in both environments. Methods: The study included 3643 rural and urban girls aged 7–16 from southwestern Poland (Copper Basin). The research was cross-sectional in each environment around 2000 and 2010, and it was carried out twice. Two types of family structure were taken into account: two-parent and single-parent families. The median age of menarche and odds ratio (OR) of menarche depending on the place of residence and family structure were calculated. The status quo method was used when assessing the age of menarche. Results: In both groups, the age of menarche significantly decreased during the decade. The median age of menarche in the urban girls was lower compared with their rural peers, but a significant difference was found only during the second examination (a decade after the first examination). There were no significant changes in menarche during the decade regarding family structure (neither in girls from two-parent families nor those from single-parent families), except in rural girls from two-parent families. Comparing the median age of menarche of girls from two-parent families with girls from single-parent families (urban and rural) showed lower median values in the girls from two-parent families, but no differences were significant. Conclusions: The acceleration of the maturation rate over the last decade has been observed among both rural and urban girls. Environmental differences in maturation rates between rural and urban girls increased over the course of the decade, and the difference between the rural and urban girls’ age of menarche was statistically significant in the second examination (around 2010).The living conditions related to family structure did not significantly affect the timing of menarche."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159529","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62d7f017409707188cab0812","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"19","number":"14","doi":null,"documentHash":"3d591602-29df-42c9-8d5c-c0c8728b11af"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"art. 8692, s. 1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/14/8692/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047394fec","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Domaradzki","uuid":"CEAC11E0295750434309ABE0B6D490373768A5109983A617965CC2E373E7267D43D78A93E57DA4914835CCB737A7A7471A8BDD2F7A5A313B8C0074A0ECA3C4A5","orcidId":"0000-0001-8057-3033","documentHash":"31b3d6c1-c09c-4f26-8399-6d6ff4fcf145"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047394fb2","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kołodziej","uuid":"BBE54274911FF95AFAF7E39B260239D113467B0F3A225F1FF6DB4C3A9D042E53C1EF57953988DB5EA40E64434EB3D8F396F03AE5AC0AD8CF12DA75AF50BB0548","orcidId":"0000-0002-9714-0274","documentHash":"9ffae513-de3a-4c4d-893b-24c0042e931c"},{"objectId":"5e709239878c28a047391ec7","name":"Teresa","lastName":"Sławińska-Ochla","uuid":"228D66F1D5BF0DDD39CE9DFC4538286F9186B3F74D1B40804CC6656BA1CE03F7604AE14D10CDA919B804D9EE78FE9C00E04E823F9BBDCCF7E2FCD8B390DD50C9","orcidId":"0000-0002-7217-5868","documentHash":"48da325c-0e88-46f3-8ec2-9382bfab2fb6"},{"objectId":"5e709235878c28a047391a8b","name":"Zofia","lastName":"Ignasiak","uuid":"01A8A9E154EF044C870833B4C4D98E6E70E542D2DF622688ADE1D768291A08E07BD91CD3E95530FE4D74A3A48CBA9F464AAC360392A3DD3F66C844E89C57BB68","orcidId":"0000-0001-8656-9107","documentHash":"53280f89-4cf3-4d68-a887-d97abd69c544"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19148692"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["air quality","monitoring","sea ports","environmental management","sustainable port"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709425878c28a0473b71e9","5e709295878c28a04739878d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Green measures for sustainable sea ports: A case study of the sea port in Gdynia","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d53878c28514547a6e6","mniswId":"18270","title":"Scientific Journals of the Maritime University of Szczecin-Zeszyty Naukowe Akademii Morskiej w Szczecinie","doi":null,"issn":"1733-8670","eissn":"2392-0378","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"fdb820fa-cedd-41fe-95cd-b3a078aeeee6"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-31","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62d7efed409707188cab0094","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709425878c28a0473b71e9","5e709295878c28a04739878d"]},"issue":"141","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this article is to present the results of research on solutions that can be implemented by the Gdynia Sea Port to allow it to obtain the title of a Green Port.

The article focuses on solutions for the Gdynia Sea Port, which, despite the implementation of many pro-ecological initiatives, does not have the official title of a Green Port. Seaports serve many modes of transport, but they are currently dominated by road transport. The activities of seaports located in urban agglomerations significantly contribute to the emission of air pollutants, noise, congestion, and other factors, which directly affect the health and quality of life of its inhabitants. The research process involved a critical literature analysis, the method of deduction, and a structured interview with representatives of the seaport in Gdynia.

On the other hand, the Reliable Communication Network Design (RCND) is a popular optimization problem used for maximizing network reliability. In addition, finding an accurate calculation of RCND explains the problem of NP-hard problem. To this end, literature studies suggested various metaheuristic algorithms that have been used as approximation methods to find the best solution to this problem. Some of these algorithms belong to the Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) category, such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs), and some belong to the Swarm Intelligence Algorithms (SIAs) category, such as Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). However, to the best of our knowledge, the Ant Colony System (ACS) algorithm, which is considered an updated version of ACO, has not yet been used to design reliability-constrained communication network topologies. Therefore, this study aims to apply the updated version of the ACS algorithm for solving RCND in small, medium, and large networks. The proposed algorithm was benchmarked against present state-of-the-art techniques that address this challenge. The research findings show that the proposed algorithm is an optimal solution for a fully connected small network size (n=6, 7, 8, and 9) and it has been achieved as an optimal solution for all not fully connected sets (n=14, 16, and 20).

The study covered the lifetime productivity of 289 sows of the Puławska breed used in 2016–2021 in five farms located in the Lublin region. The program covered the sows for the protection of genetic resources of the Puławska pigs breed. The longevity of the sows was assessed on the basis  of  the  average  number  of  litters  obtained  during  their  use.  The  prolificacy  and  fertility  of \r\nsows,  the  length  of  the  farrowing  interval,  and  the  frequency  of  farrowing  were  used  to  estimate sows’ use value in subsequent litters.

(TST), despite its good properties, may be harmful to the human organism and the environment. Therefore, monitoring biological fluids and environmental samples is important. An electrochemically pretreated screen-printed carbon sensor modified with Pb nanoparticles (pSPCE/PbNPs) was successfully prepared and used for the determination of TST. The surface morphology and electrochemical properties of unmodified and modified sensors were characterized by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Selective determinations of TST at the pSPCE/PbNPs were carried out by differential pulse adsorptive stripping voltammetry (DPAdSV, EPb dep.and TST acc. of −1.1 V, t Pb dep.and TST acc. of 120 s, ΔEA of 50 mV, ν of 175 mV s−1, and tm of 5 ms) in a solution containing 0.075 mol L−1 acetate buffer of pH = 4.6 ± 0.1, and 7.5 × 10−5 mol L−1 Pb(NO3)2. The analytical signal obtained at the potential around −1.42 V (vs. silver pseudo-reference electrode) is related to the reduction process of TST adsorbed onto the electrode surface. The use of pSPCE/PbNPs allows obtaining a very low limit of TST detection (2.2 × 10−12 mol L−1) and wide linear ranges of the calibration graph (1.0 × 10−11–1.0 × 10−10, 1.0 × 10−10–2.0 × 10−9, and 2.0 × 10−9–2.0 × 10−8 mol L−1). The pSPCE/PbNPs were successfully applied for the determination of TST in reference material of human urine and wastewater purified in a sewage treatment plant without preliminary preparation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159541","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/14/4948","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"659fc1f04097076c144aaa0f","name":"Ireneusz","lastName":"Sowa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ad515104-dae2-419b-b5a5-c8cbb971fe01"},{"objectId":"659fc1f04097076c144aaa0e","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Wójciak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1ccda9bd-eb5d-4835-898e-7855464503b6"},{"objectId":"659fc1f04097076c144aaa0d","name":"Jędrzej","lastName":"Kozak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f46a0186-0005-4652-8103-cd8f4a81f7fb"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a009d","name":"Marek","lastName":"Rotko","uuid":"7CEDAB8AD935DB74AEA37C28399C77821CEBE2AF1F7D55818AB23248E52BB857BA0EA539510BA4F58B1B11AD7951F4DA4DD5AC99556F27A199654DBC9CB0F27E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9598-2155","documentHash":"dd7dc031-97c5-4c63-8c95-b4b06584cf83"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a008e","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Tyszczuk-Rotko","uuid":"BED485B869169D502A26CDC22E6F443BA58B6C32EA129C584323C871FFD95DF14D896762AF6C28581F76447343D007ACEEB3575F1610F3CE96CE7CFA10EC2189","orcidId":"0000-0001-5893-5309","documentHash":"10d84098-1328-403c-bb18-f5d8561a8a49"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15144948"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sliced pumpkin","pumpkin's slice shape","culinary quality of cupcake","smell and taste of cupcake"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"62cacd0d4097071cdd63cec6","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Ustymivka Experimental Station of Plant Production of Plant Production Institute nd. a.

A change in the culinary quality of the cupcake depending on the amount of sliced pumpkin has been established. It was found that the cupcake's surface color and crumb depended on the amount of fresh sliced pumpkin. The shape of the slice did not change these cupcake parameters. The color of the surface of the cupcake with the addition of 5‒25 % of the sliced pumpkin was at the level of control – light yellow. When adding 30‒40 % ‒ yellow; 45‒50 % ‒ dark yellow. The cupcake's crumb color with the addition of 5‒10 % of sliced pumpkin and without it was light yellow. Adding 15‒35 % of sliced pumpkin provided for a yellow color of the crumb. With the addition of 40‒50 % of sliced pumpkin, the color was orange. The use of fresh sliced pumpkin in the amount of 25 % reliably reduces the smell and taste of the consumer evaluation of the cupcake. At the same time, the level of smell and taste was good (7 points). It should be noted that when adding 20 % fresh sliced pumpkin, the smell and taste of pumpkin in the cupcake was weak – 7 points.\n\nSocial studies have been conducted and the main criteria for cupcake buyers have been established. It was found that cupcakes are in high demand and have the prospect of being enriched with pumpkin. Among the respondents, the new product had a high probability of buying. Its price is less important in this case. It was proven that its chemical composition and culinary quality are of greatest importance when choosing a cupcake.\n\nIn the technology of cupcake production, it is necessary to add 20‒25 % of fresh sliced pumpkin of various shapes relative to the mass of the dough.

It aims to collect 40 times more e+e− collision data compared with its predecessor Belle experiment. The Belle II pixel detector (PXD) is based on the Depleted P-channel Field Effect Transistor (DEPFET) technology. The PXD plays an important role in the tracking and vertexing of the Belle II detector. Its two layers are arranged at radii of 14 mm and 22 mm around the interaction point. The sensors are thinned down to 75 μm to minimize multiple scattering, and each module has interconnects and ASICs integrated on the sensor with silicon frames for mechanical support. PXD showed good performance during data taking. It also faces several operational challenges due to the high background level from the SuperKEKB accelerator, such as the damage from beam loss events, the drift in the HV working point due to

to Europe is not a new phenomenon, but its roots date back to the 1960s and 1970s, when, primarily for economic reasons – the lack of sufficient workforce – the Old Continent opened up to immigrants from outside. This article is a geopolitical polemic showing the complex and controversial issue of the regression of security in the global dimension, with an emphasis on international and transnational issues, pointing to the ongoing transformation of the existing political, social, axiological, and cultural order into new complex configurations, somewhat abstracting from tradition and the existing cultural code. The main intention and purpose of this paper are to present the complex problem of the specificity of security in the European and community dimension, pointing to the processes and phenomena changing the architecture of the world order, taking into account the international, transnational and migration

Decreased synthesis of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) related to hyperinsulinemia is one of the disturbances characteristic of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Hyperinsulinemia is a compensatory mechanism for liver insulin resistance (IR); thus, SHBG may be considered as a surrogate marker of liver IR. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the prediction of IR and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) based on SHBG levels in women with PCOS. Methods. This analysis included data retrieved from medical records of 854 patients with PCOS hospitalized in the Gynecological Endocrinology Clinic from 2012 to 2019. Data including anthropometric parameters, fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and SHBG levels were analyzed. BMI and HOMA-IR were calculated with standard formulas. Results. IFG and IR assessed based on HOMA-IR values > 2.0 were found in 19.5% and 47.8% of the study group, respectively. Empirical optimal cutoff values for SHBG levels were ≤41.5 nmol/L typical for IR (AUC 0.711, sensitivity 61.1%, specificity 71.6%, positive predictive value (PPV) 70.7%, and negative predictive value (NPV) 62.1%). The probability of insulin resistance occurrence for SHBG concentration 26.1 nmol/L (the lower normal range) was 61.6% (95% CI: 57.4%–65.8%). The SHBG concentration of 36.4 nmol/L and 8.1 nmol/L was related to a 10% and 20% probability of IFG, respectively. Conclusion. In conclusion, this is the first study estimating the probability of liver IR and IFG occurrence based on SHBG levels in women with PCOS. Despite the low sensitivity, SHBG level below 42 nmol/L should cause closer monitoring for the fatty liver and prediabetes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159562","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eee3a740970749973dd52c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2022","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"a7f1697f-ddc1-45a9-85d1-1692de1723ac"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2022","pagesFromTo":"p.1-6","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ije/2022/6498768/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"656d254f40970749a85eebc9","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Markuszewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bbff5309-df3d-49a0-927e-51a621aa0451"},{"objectId":"656d254f40970749a85eebc7","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Biernacka-Bartnik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"83e02a14-4c27-40d9-96bc-7a7b02ca809d"},{"objectId":"5e70931d878c28a0473a304f","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Chudek","uuid":"EC8C6B5424D2DBEAF3E54CF9FE22FF7603C3C26CE509713F3AE3C79A38F4C792549D34F2668BD375D00226846DB878ABEE1737B8CAD85E7C0C040D9E9ECD7323","orcidId":"0000-0002-6367-7794","documentHash":"d6345fbc-47c6-452a-b765-1c19a274237e"},{"objectId":"5e70931b878c28a0473a2f20","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Madej","uuid":"68F658E752362F231B885E9590A3FCEE3FFCFCA844FB40C4F0CF17EB25EB910CAA0C67A9BC26141CFFDDF5F69675CCD040706BB26901BB817CCEA308EBCA07D2","orcidId":"0000-0002-6447-1667","documentHash":"c78d5848-434a-4a53-b46a-f7322a4c0a1a"},{"objectId":"5e709319878c28a0473a2db6","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kocełak","uuid":"0B426EEAE38DF9BED67A59BDAB8FD96A9027EB93426A86FB6B73304C77F4DC0930FF20912086819F06C71F8592ED187A4A803F07F7F703AF0809BD502009F3B7","orcidId":"0000-0001-8135-8482","documentHash":"146f24a6-0144-4514-a35c-7bb30cbf1f06"},{"objectId":"5e709319878c28a0473a2da4","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Olszanecka-Glinianowicz","uuid":"F433AA7D568EC4FF338D36622BA2FB042715389CB001FA509A25D93B6C245F10D9B3BA03DAF7D0EBCD5FC017B925AF589B9A6B2222D1B8B2D762F35DF13E8567","orcidId":"0000-0001-5632-5590","documentHash":"0ceab693-32b0-46aa-9cc0-d08ba1c8cdcb"},{"objectId":"5e7092d8878c28a04739df45","name":"Monika","lastName":"Puzianowska-Kuźnicka","uuid":"11D9DB5B15FBBEC623AC84A2C729C5FC9D79BFAB69EA22AEF87CCE5CFF634F57BD4FD830BDE696B0F4DA325CD96D559F3816751003B8F88DBE621E4B61AFE861","orcidId":"0000-0001-5295-3848","documentHash":"b563ef37-0f1d-432e-9bd3-38f8d92f26a8"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d4ff","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Choręza","uuid":"3BC9662A0A15D155E3EBD3745D2D1943FE2CC077BE850DD90217A5084907748F79801015C7381F0B47EF7E6DA4F07CD8C2DF7B3630ACBEB296BFC18BED44B532","orcidId":"0000-0002-1745-4821","documentHash":"5ffee37c-37cd-4598-a5c8-7ce4a8d8998a"},{"objectId":"5e7092cd878c28a04739d0af","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Owczarek","uuid":"7D429F46DB176B35BE4DACD2E44E8E609C4CF042733E5980125ED7202153E37F9ACFE1AF7271F7498BC11A9DE67EF848FEAF974BA88A5B30E7949897625B12C3","orcidId":"0000-0003-1179-6932","documentHash":"779593c0-8226-4377-bb8c-ec61cd53e67f"}],"doi":"10.1155/2022/6498768"},{"mainLanguageName":"portugalski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62d104c94097073a4bc475c3","doi":null,"title":"Fuera de lugar: Cuerpos (in)tangibles en las culturas minorizadas de la Península Ibérica.

The point of departure for the study was a collection of selected tweets generated by two influencers on Polish Twitter – Rafał Ziemkiewicz and Roman Giertych. Those posts pertained to two events: the failure of the Czajka sewage treatment plant in Warsaw and the discussion around the “Women’s Strike”, that is mass protests on the streets of Polish cities after the Constitutional Tribunal announced its ruling on eugenic abortion. The analysis aimed to trace the reactions and ways of expressing ethical judgements towards the mockery and derision provoked by the two influencers towards their political opponents. The theoretical part focuses on, among others, Aristotle’s theory of the negative characteristics of the comic object and Thomas Hobbes’s superiority theory which holds that the subject’s humour experience is superior to the object of that experience.<br />The study of tweets and retweets, which also contained the non-verbal means of expression showed two types of reactions among the followers. One type is of continuing-modifying character, usually expressed by the amplification and hyperbolisation of provocation whereas the other one is critical, directed against the author of the initial tweet and consisting in rejecting provocation or changing the object of laughter.</p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159575","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"97-111","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70922e878c28a0473913fd","name":"Bogumił","lastName":"Gasek","uuid":"41C3254AF1E9B27D9DE3CD408F1274459E15F30F495ABDFBA95984FBDDDFE4C54D5A105A71DA9DDE8785E6D65D398811B6510EB2C84E8C2FBFE1B9F8390438DF","orcidId":"0000-0002-9213-0181","documentHash":"c826d425-2195-4334-9b1a-f1827ac7d3f0"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["rhodium(III)","platinum group metals (PGM)","PGM nanoparticles","palladium(II)","platinum(IV)","ruthenium(III)"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a7878c28a0473ae777","5e70934d878c28a0473a6dc1","5f8e8b03085dcb424e4c187a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Studies on the Formation of Catalytically Active PGM Nanoparticles from Model Solutions as a Basis for the Recycling of Spent Catalysts","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":null,"issn":"1420-3049","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"85ea3d3d-2670-4384-98ee-1b5b44edab21"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-08","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62d934fd4097075e7c0937b9","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70934d878c28a0473a6dc1","5e7093a7878c28a0473ae777","5f8e8b03085dcb424e4c187a"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058159576","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61dd666d2467f047f3aa78cd","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"27","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"5058151f-2e91-4692-83ee-1450ca325c38"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"390-1 -

For condensing juice-containing vapors in functionally closed media, plate coil liquid coolers with Peltier elements are used. At the temperature of the heating surfaces of 180 °C, the cold side of the Peltier element provides a coolant temperature of up to 10 °C. The proposed solution could improve the competitiveness of the device, which is explained by the established technical and operational indicators.\n\nThe improved device over 300 s provides a temperature in the center of a product of 90 °C, and on surface layers ‒ 130 °C, which characterizes the culinary readiness of meat products. When making samples conventionally, the surface layer warms up to 120 °C, and the central layer – to 72 °C, at the temperature of the contact surface of 160 °C over 180 s with crust formation. In addition, the difference between the opposite layers of the control sample is 85 °C, which confirms the uneven heating during frying in the conventional way, which is explained by the need to use auxiliary operations for turning the product. The heating time to operating temperature was reduced by 88.6 %, specific heat consumption was decreased by 43.0, and productivity by 14.8 %, with full culinary readiness of products, compared with the conventional device.\n\nThe increase in the resource efficiency of the apparatus for frying meat products was confirmed, which is achieved by the implementation of the proposed design and hardware solutions to ensure the competitiveness of the apparatus that will make it possible to prepare original meat products"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159592","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62daef3840970752a1f3baf8","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"3","number":"11 (117)","doi":null,"documentHash":"0e6a2313-d5c7-45e0-b5f8-4ea607f28970"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"3","pagesFromTo":"69-76","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/259433/256885","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62daf86d40970752a1f3e704","name":"Eldar","lastName":"Ibaiev","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3090-3553","documentHash":"66ccc2b7-22f7-4e2a-95d1-7267986f73af"},{"objectId":"62daf86d40970752a1f3e703","name":"Oksana","lastName":"Skoromna","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-1332-5579","documentHash":"9637611d-4bd6-466d-85d6-51044a84468a"},{"objectId":"62daf86d40970752a1f3e702","name":"Mariana","lastName":"Bondar","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8154-0612","documentHash":"d7725545-b866-4ef8-aded-c184704da159"},{"objectId":"62daf86d40970752a1f3e701","name":"Alla","lastName":"Kainash","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2830-2580","documentHash":"6e49e286-6978-4b85-ad16-895568cff512"},{"objectId":"62daf86d40970752a1f3e700","name":"Nina","lastName":"Budnyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2176-0650","documentHash":"653b07db-5a75-4c72-9c74-b3a8542133d6"},{"objectId":"62daf86d40970752a1f3e6ff","name":"Valeriy","lastName":"Mikhaylov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4335-1751","documentHash":"b97bd0ef-a01c-45c5-9223-7fc4ac61591f"},{"objectId":"62daf86d40970752a1f3e6fe","name":"Bogdan","lastName":"Liashenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7228-8814","documentHash":"84bf7b0b-4cbb-4301-a9e9-671c76d1b101"},{"objectId":"62daf86d40970752a1f3e6fd","name":"Aleksey","lastName":"Zagorulko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-1186-3832","documentHash":"38029b8f-c65a-456a-99ff-ce2c32bfcb82"},{"objectId":"62daf86d40970752a1f3e6fc","name":"Andrii","lastName":"Zahorulko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7768-6571","documentHash":"5eab3053-548c-4a2f-bb32-72fc4092d370"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.259433"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Renewable energy sources","Natural resources volatility","Quantile regression method","Frequency domain causality test"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","uid":"bLoLgWizTVEIn0ZQBwSDx-Q","uuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","parentUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","rootUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","name":"Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61a054b87523402fabdf7cb2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"What drives investment in renewable energy resources?

An increase in investment in renewable energy in the development goals are turn out to be the main concern of countries. This study examines the elements that influence the investment in renewable energy sources, as well as the importance of each aspect in case of China for the period of 1990–2020. We use Bayer-Hanck cointegration and Quantile Regression method to estimate the long run coefficients. To check the causal relationship among variables, this study employs Frequency Domain Causality (FDC) test. The results show that natural resource volatility is negatively related with investment in renewable energy. However, economic performance, technological innovation and energy efficiency have positive impact on investment in renewable energy. From results of quantile regression, it is inferred that as long as the effect of economic performance on investment in renewable energy loses trace of significance, the negative effect of natural resource volatility attains stronger statistical evidence. It implies that the positive impact of economic performance and negative impact of natural resource volatility on IRE changes its significance after a certain threshold level is achieved. There is evidence of uni-directional causality from GDP, TNR, TI and ENEF to IRE in all three runs. The findings of this study have important implications that can also be used by international organizations and other stakeholders in developing policies to improve the environment through renewable energies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159598","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62da925f40970752a1f24e25","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"77","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"980ee176-10cf-43a7-80b8-54e2df829735"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"77","pagesFromTo":"nr art. 102712, 17s.","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S030142072200160X?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62da925f40970752a1f24e23","name":"Hazar","lastName":"Dördüncü","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cf647846-404c-4bc6-8df9-0830dcfcfd2f"},{"objectId":"62da925f40970752a1f24e21","name":"Ahmad Haseeb","lastName":"Payab","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c61b9c34-ea57-422e-a5ea-4171280242b4"},{"objectId":"62da925f40970752a1f24e20","name":"Wang","lastName":"Yangjie","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"64fc670c-8115-46b0-a721-f2d51f34afa7"},{"objectId":"62da925f40970752a1f24e1f","name":"Riazullah","lastName":"Shinwari","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f22be353-20fd-4baa-be28-4ced14febe60"},{"objectId":"61a054b87523402fabdf7cb2","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Kubiczek","uuid":"9EB21E38825C1C7BB67D91679344F041D8C48C2A93D44AF3251ACD72D95BE5CE1213554D3F84E3C0958BA95A4992F0F5251CE33254C28E1E09A847DC9B824383","orcidId":"0000-0003-4599-4814","documentHash":"03b198d5-df2d-4e19-9666-6f1db8e287f9"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.resourpol.2022.102712"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["traffic engineering","simulation","network nodes","prioritization"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f2878c28a04739fc58","5f81749f085dcb410a25ecbd"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Simulation studies of the impact of traffic prioritization mechanisms on the traffic efficiency of multi-service network nodes","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":{"objectId":"62bcc62d4097070fda699f3f","doi":null,"title":"Proceedings of the 39th International Business Information Management Association (IBIMA), 30-31 May 2022, Granada, Spain","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-0-9998551-9-5","ismn":null,"issn":"2767-9640","url":"https://ibima.org/conference/39th-ibima-conference/#ffs-tabbed-15","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"a38cf55d-0bb8-4fe3-b9c2-3768307017a9","publisher":null,"openAccess":null},"_version":4,"objectId":"62de6e234097075e7c88ae24","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c28771574186e","mniswId":"862","startDate":null,"endDate":null,"fullName":"International Business Information Management","shortName":"IBIMA","city":null,"country":null,"website":null,"isEdition":false,"documentHash":"6029aca7-ff4d-42fd-9ba3-6932a546725d"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f2878c28a04739fc58","5f81749f085dcb410a25ecbd"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper is devoted to the study of the impact of traffic prioritization mechanisms on the efficiency of multiservice network nodes.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in bioelectrical activity of the lower limb muscles activity in claudicating patients over a 12-week period of supervised treadmill training and to verify the hypothesis as to which muscles of lower limbs are activated by training treatment—the proximal, as compensatory mechanism, or the distal, which are the most ischemic. Methods: The study comprised 45 patients aged 60–70 years (height 168.8 ± 6.8 cm, weight 78.9 ± 9.2 kg) with PAD and unilateral intermittent claudication (Fontaine stage IIa/IIb), who participated in a 12-week supervised treadmill training program. Surface electromyography (sEMG) of the gastrocnemius lateralis (GaL), gastrocnemius medialis (GaM), tibialis anterior (TA), biceps femoris (BF), rectus femoris (RF) and gluteus medius (GM) muscles in the claudicated leg were continuously measured during the treadmill test. The average mean amplitude and mean amplitude range of the sEMG signal were analyzed. Results: During the treadmill test, after 12 weeks of training, the average mean amplitude of the GM (105 ± 43 vs. 74 ± 38%, p = 0.000008, ES = 0.76), BF (41 ± 22 vs. 33 ± 12%, p = 0.006, ES = 0.45) and GaM (134 ± 50 vs. 114 ± 30%, p = 0.007, ES = 0.48) muscles was significantly lower compared with baseline. The mean amplitude range was significantly decreased after 12 weeks of training in the GM (229 ± 64 vs. 181 ± 62%, p = 0.008, ES = 0.77) and BF (110 ± 69 vs. 84 ± 31%, p = 0.0002, ES = 0.48) muscles. After 12 weeks of training, the mean amplitude range of the TA muscle was significantly higher compared with baseline (104 ± 46 vs. 131 ± 53%, p = 0.001, ES = 0.54), but without significant changes in the average mean amplitude value. The most favorable changes, suggesting the lowest muscle fatigue and the highest walking capacity, were found in patients with the longest walking time. Conclusions: The obtained results may suggest that after 12 weeks of treadmill training, beneficial changes occurred in both the proximal and distal muscles. Therefore, greater foot plantar flexion and stronger push-off as well as greater hip extension may be considered the main mechanisms of observed gait pattern improvement. It may also be suggested that the therapy of gait alterations in patients with PAD should be focused not only on calf muscle pump improvement, but also on proximal hip extensor strengthening."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159611","journalIssue":{"objectId":"621f6e4a2467f0747983227a","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"11","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"795ea6d2-d14d-41c0-b2e2-390d1a92d073"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/11/5/1302","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"658f16004097076c145d8144","name":"Anna","lastName":"Mika","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ae6fcf5e-3b1d-4c87-b7da-1cb90307ddb3"},{"objectId":"658f16004097076c145d8143","name":"Anita","lastName":"Kulik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d47319d5-c0f0-4a50-8b59-c28ef45df595"},{"objectId":"658f16004097076c145d8142","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Mika","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d00e4b42-b21a-4711-b7e9-97ee47e6c0a7"},{"objectId":"5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f63","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Oleksy","uuid":"D2EE678DA6F41EF7B1D53C6E024AB8473A27C18E7E451EB1718E98CB6C1060024D0A5E63D36B42D61A656AC1459E60BE13E9DD9E0507D59F7594AE4939734B3C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0589-0554","documentHash":"964e962b-b723-4760-874c-5f5662db8723"}],"doi":"10.3390/jcm11051302"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"9781350181700","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"The Bloomsbury Handbook of Lexicography","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":512,"publicationPlace":"London","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62d925dd4097075e7c093387","editors":[{"objectId":"62d925dd4097075e7c093388","name":"Howard","lastName":"Jackson","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"63c70c1b-12de-47ee-b0a0-1a3ac4caaf93"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["62d925dd4097075e7c093388"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A definitive guide to the long tradition of lexicography, this handbook is a rigorous and systematic overview of the field and its recent developments.

However, AD prevention is possible by administering the correct inhibitors with food. The aim of this study was to examine 19 types of honey in terms of their contents of cholinesterase inhibitors. The inhibition of AChE and BChE relative to the respective honey samples was evaluated using Ellman’s colorimetric method, including the “false-positive” effect. The highest potential for AChE inhibition was observed in the case of thyme honey (21.17% inhibition), while goldenrod\r\nhoney showed the highest capacity for BChE inhibition (33.89%).

recent years, increasing attention has been paid to the durability of building materials, including those based on cementitious binders. Important aspects of durability include the increase of the strength of the cement matrix and enhancement of material resistance to external factors. The use of nanoadditives may be a way to meet these expectations. In the present study, zinc, titanium and copper oxides, used in single and binary systems (to better the effect of their performance), were applied as additives in cement mortars. In the first part of this work, an extensive physicochemical analysis of oxides was carried out, and in the second, their application ranges in cement mortars were determined. The subsequent analyses were employed in determining the physicochemical properties of pristine oxides: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), measurement of the particle size distribution, as well as zeta potential measurement depending on the pH values. Influence on selected physicomechanical parameters of the cement matrix and resistance to the action of selected Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi were also examined. Our work indicated that all nanoadditives worsened the mechanical parameters of mortars during the first 3 days of hardening, while after 28 days, an improvement was achieved for zinc and titanium(IV) oxides. Binary systems and copper(II) oxide deteriorated in strength parameters throughout the test period. In contrast, copper(II) oxide showed the best antibacterial activity among all the tested oxide systems. Based on the inhibitory effect of the studied compounds, the following order of microbial susceptibility to inhibition of growth on cement mortars was established (from the most susceptible, to the most resistant): E. coli < S. aureus < C. albicans < B. cereus = P. aeruginosa < P. putida."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159625","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e1cce32467f00328313fea","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"6feccc50-4f6d-4a2d-a4de-8b8445857aea"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"661-1 - 661-23","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/2/661","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"60c324bc9543c72336543eba","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Jędrzejczak","uuid":"B708687E4BA7E32F1242838609FFD8829DEE6BBB79F9E3A89970BB64EFE9B99CCB1D50CF111583BF3CC700F2D7205608FB6ABC053DDE7087B9FF1523BFA4A989","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b27a6f2d-3e1c-4124-8434-3bbbdabefb46"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba006","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Ławniczak","uuid":"B638A60637C93FC3C1374A2C68BE74FF67149D3AF6DCE7957A2D856E0AFEC0B46CF6FAC61C062C51AD2EDAF670475C3673CC405497E4B7DBB766FDCF219B49CD","orcidId":"0000-0002-9177-142X","documentHash":"e8170783-49d5-4ed9-bcd8-43ce0383bcaf"},{"objectId":"5e709437878c28a0473b83ae","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Klapiszewski","uuid":"F483EF2A304AC61454FB785ECA57C72DBCC8FE4DA78AE212E921FF82F6BE6CE04C44E258C0F010CACCA141F99FF5A89356FDFC4F51B49EBD1C11BFBCC8DBB63E","orcidId":"0000-0001-6055-2606","documentHash":"063b176f-91d0-4095-9186-9e7b36ba5bfd"},{"objectId":"5e7093a5878c28a0473ae711","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Ślosarczyk","uuid":"48AAB51600658CAEAC0450B25ABD654E6FDB6B15890CC207D09F9B8BEA2763DC858560C3F7F704FF67A7183DD8830FAFA71054CD3AEAEEEA4C9E2E71648FE139","orcidId":"0000-0002-4051-911X","documentHash":"bd16c989-f2df-4549-9fcd-85aaafb2c7ea"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15020661"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mental health","mental health survillance","e-Learning in the Training of Seafarers","Maritime Education and Training (MET)"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397251"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Mental Health Surveillance Tools for Sea Workers","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d53878c28514547a614","mniswId":"19718","title":"TransNav - The International Journal on Marine Navigation and Safety of Sea Transportation","doi":null,"issn":"2083-6473","eissn":"2083-6481","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"ad4c92c6-41a5-43b8-ad64-4541e166e300"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62de70ad40970762378e97cb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397251","62de70ad40970762378e97ce","62de70ad40970762378e97cf","62de70ad40970762378e97d0","62de70ad40970762378e97d1","62de70ad40970762378e97d2"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article presents the results of the works of the PROMETHEAS project, which focuses on the mental health of sea workers.

However, the liquidity of stock on the market is its essential characteristic. The inflow of information in highly liquid markets allows for the maintenance of high information efficiency. The COVID-19 pandemic affected many aspects related to stock markets, including their liquidity. The impact of the pandemic is so multidimensional that there are still areas that need to be investigated. One of them is the intraday liquidity patterns on the stock markets. Therefore, the present paper aims to verify the existence of intraday liquidity patterns on the Warsaw Stock Exchange in three periods: before, during and after the panic caused by the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results confirmed the existence of a U-shaped intraday distribution of the number of transactions and their trading. This outcome highlights the importance of the first and last minutes of a trading session. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the domination of WSE transactions of small individual investors who feared the loss of value of their assets, selling them on the stock exchange. In the pandemic, the average percentage change between transactions increased."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159632","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62de6aab40970762378e17b4","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"10","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"92ed57ce-3ce5-4e9f-acfc-8fa74481a6a7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"nr art. 13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7072/10/1/13/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62de6aab40970762378e17b2","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Tuszkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f8270af0-5d10-476c-9a51-f7fc7efa59b2"},{"objectId":"61a054b87523402fabdf7cb2","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Kubiczek","uuid":"9EB21E38825C1C7BB67D91679344F041D8C48C2A93D44AF3251ACD72D95BE5CE1213554D3F84E3C0958BA95A4992F0F5251CE33254C28E1E09A847DC9B824383","orcidId":"0000-0003-4599-4814","documentHash":"03b198d5-df2d-4e19-9666-6f1db8e287f9"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijfs10010013"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","uid":"bUD9SiLi4D9CSv6IIg7PEOg","uuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","parentUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","rootUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","name":"Państwowy Instytut Geologiczny -

The model is formulated by means of the segment method and it takes into account large displacements, bending, and torsional and longitudinal flexibilities. Hydrodynamic forces, internal fluid flow, sea currents, and ship motion are also considered. Validation of the model in the range of statics and dynamics of the riser is carried out by comparing our own results with those available in the literature obtained by different methods and from experimental measurements. The optimization problem of moving a riser in re-entry subject to sea current is formulated and solved. The task is to choose a trajectory of a surface vessel such that, regardless of the sea current, the bottom end of the riser is placed as close as possible to the defined position, within a given period of time and with minimizing the energy of the system after the maneuver. The results of optimization calculations show how the direction of the sea current influences the choice of the trajectory of the base."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159636","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"62820c664097077bd4023731","mniswId":null,"startDate":"2021-02-16","endDate":"2021-02-19","fullName":"Second International Nonlinear Dynamics Conference","shortName":"NODYCON'2021","city":"Rzym","country":"IT","website":"https://nodycon.org/2021/","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"981eb007-e492-499b-a350-2c23ea50bef1"},"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"287-298","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-81166-2_26","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709203878c28a04738ea29","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Wojciech","uuid":"7CFB9CFA2FA66F68837D534AEDBD481C56DEEC9355A63EAFEDC493B33688EFE25F1FB96731D7FCA579BA2388F84639810A098763BD88CCAC23BBA3E76AF66CAA","orcidId":"0000-0001-7924-1779","documentHash":"c9d17eb7-81e0-41c1-a7e7-5a7e61ca3769"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e332","name":"Lucyna","lastName":"Brzozowska","uuid":"1FED897597940693BF49F0D04150E9950E15C0B825208B138B2D564B5EB3FE39C98B6C67F4E8B9F8F94E5C5201B9DD0631ECBA90BB3C405E5923CFF007A1818A","orcidId":"0000-0003-0169-4975","documentHash":"0e66f250-590f-46f3-8072-aaadcbeef49f"},{"objectId":"5e7091f7878c28a04738dc6c","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Adamiec-Wójcik","uuid":"CA37AFF828610B3714F323FC262D9F1CF64DDF667FA801DC05A612B6F9E6208CB54CF28DABBD866ADC92688F7226E2A10B176BB29EC6339D17B381FF8BAEAFD6","orcidId":"0000-0003-4916-1887","documentHash":"7d6719d7-e77f-41f6-95f4-3410953ea623"}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-81166-2_26"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Relationship Between Home Caregivers and Caregivers Employed at Selected Institutions Providing Assistance to Seniors with Their Care Recipients Suffering from Dementia","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a3db","mniswId":"25906","title":"Rehabilitacja Medyczna","doi":null,"issn":"1427-9622","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"97fde98a-c08e-4577-9d2e-a3d766da9256"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"628228704097077bd405f54b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65558cb840e3ff4ef3f81864","5e709237878c28a047391d5f"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058159638","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"26","pagesFromTo":"31-37","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"pol","title":"Relacje opiekunów domowych i opiekunów zatrudnionych w wybranych placówkach świadczących pomoc seniorom z ich podopiecznymi cierpiącymi na demencję"}],"publicUri":"https://rehmed.pl/resources/html/article/details?id=227310","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65558cb840e3ff4ef3f81864","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Malczewska","uuid":"248D90CC6DFF38FB7DA6434D192D0987DFC43695B8E97221F9F3461303CE50C182CAD8EDCDCC18BB58FA59C3EB966CBA3F5193CC8751AA2CC387D5E2BBDAB426","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dfc283db-a664-40ce-b0a8-46a629efc5ba"},{"objectId":"5e709237878c28a047391d5f","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Janus","uuid":"BE0282DE05539D6E3A4CD45A5D4388E04C31B15571D2BD91FF7FC92132E8834B6EEE48288AF1E7B907D5CD7FE4D6CF3BD032879DBDE3D4C1A01AA9C67C8F4141","orcidId":"0000-0002-2627-1103","documentHash":"f48d34e8-c410-4c5e-9de6-5657d48421af"}],"doi":"10.5604/01.3001.0015.7038"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Central heavy-ion collision","Charged-particle multiplicity","Trigger efficiency"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","uid":"bdkLR6wGCrp59lwUjwb_dMA","uuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","parentUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","rootUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","name":"Instytut Fizyki Jądrowej im.

The MTD is designed to measure the charged-particle multiplicity in HICs to provide a trigger signal that can be used to select high-multiplicity events induced by central collisions. The MTD consists of two side-walls segmented into 30 plastic scintillation paddles, each equipped with a multi-pixel photon counter. A custom board with EASIROC front-end ASIC is used as readout electronics. A multiplicity logic signal is generated by an on-board FPGA that processes the discriminated signals from EASIROCs. The overall latency of the whole detector system for outputting the trigger is less than 100 ns, including 52 ns of electronics latency for processing the signals. During the measurement of reactions at an incident energy of 270 MeV/nucleon, the minimum multiplicity threshold of the MTD was set to 4, where the overall trigger efficiency was obtained to be about 39 % for inclusive nuclear reactions. A simulation study with a numerical calculation of HICs found that the central collisions of impact parameters of less than 4 fm can be triggered with a high efficiency of more than 95 % by the experimental trigger condition."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058159640","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1039","pagesFromTo":"167010","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168900222004387","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62da925b4097075e7c11e004","name":"H.","lastName":"Sakurai","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1c849390-2798-4c47-8454-b1181a574447"},{"objectId":"62da925b4097075e7c11e003","name":"Y.","lastName":"Zhang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"45ffc985-0246-4575-a9d1-0cb4bcd74f82"},{"objectId":"62da925b4097075e7c11e002","name":"N.","lastName":"Nakatsuka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6fe708f8-b90f-420b-83fe-5d581fbefbe3"},{"objectId":"62da925b4097075e7c11e001","name":"M.","lastName":"Kurata-Nishimura","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"778d801d-2957-4251-9f93-2f4e7b900a74"},{"objectId":"62da925b4097075e7c11e000","name":"G.","lastName":"Jhang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fb37f6c6-0865-4558-b0b3-96c2c187e394"},{"objectId":"62da925b4097075e7c11dfff","name":"J.W.","lastName":"Lee","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"028179bb-675f-4fee-a15b-de434e6505bb"},{"objectId":"62da925b4097075e7c11dffe","name":"J.","lastName":"Estee","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"393aa515-53a6-4566-834d-3d7813f324c9"},{"objectId":"62da925b4097075e7c11dffd","name":"C.Y.","lastName":"Tsang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"37dc84b1-d3db-4685-b46e-3448ce1554e8"},{"objectId":"62da925b4097075e7c11dffc","name":"W.G.","lastName":"Lynch","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"015e3404-becc-4db3-8af0-0a2888ba108c"},{"objectId":"62da925b4097075e7c11dffb","name":"M.B.","lastName":"Tsang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d84f218d-273d-40cc-aeef-4213d2a3b351"},{"objectId":"62da925b4097075e7c11dffa","name":"G.","lastName":"Cerizza","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"96f74024-2679-45fc-b711-3321cf2a0a76"},{"objectId":"62da925b4097075e7c11dff9","name":"J.","lastName":"Barney","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c902b6e7-20b9-4f48-8c16-322bbbf36b5d"},{"objectId":"62da925b4097075e7c11dff8","name":"C.","lastName":"Santamaria","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"312a3bde-f57a-40f6-81f1-a56e74536771"},{"objectId":"62da925b4097075e7c11dff7","name":"D.","lastName":"Suzuki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b0237ea6-c2eb-4c1b-9510-f8e4d4cbd985"},{"objectId":"62da925b4097075e7c11dff6","name":"T.","lastName":"Shiozaki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"18e6e231-265c-4168-b859-ab25ea5c8427"},{"objectId":"62da925b4097075e7c11dff5","name":"R.","lastName":"Wangd","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c6ce22a6-bc52-4e3a-85cb-7fca741ffb16"},{"objectId":"62da925b4097075e7c11dff4","name":"K.","lastName":"Miwa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d72cfda5-f0c3-4309-bd73-fa018b44e259"},{"objectId":"62da925b4097075e7c11dff3","name":"T.","lastName":"Murakami","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2fa76de6-adfd-48ec-ab30-2cf6965b7484"},{"objectId":"62da925b4097075e7c11dff2","name":"M.","lastName":"Kaneko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"df40d8a2-3394-418c-971b-8710053edcf9"},{"objectId":"62da925b4097075e7c11dff1","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Lasko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f1f213f4-5656-40c4-9dc6-ef72eed8cbd9"},{"objectId":"62da925b4097075e7c11dff0","name":"T","lastName":"Isobe","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ce9e5fcd-2795-4660-9521-2de853cb6db4"},{"objectId":"5e7092cf878c28a04739d28f","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Pawłowski","uuid":"F017370EAB8A1D5637956CC446AB6892A5FF981F49C82D29CB00C0993997268E5C53B307A4C49EBEA62F70315465A563EBEE09A0B2AB5CE6DBC8A4FE71B07221","orcidId":"0000-0003-2150-8404","documentHash":"d18c6a39-d3dc-468f-82f0-b039bf4af73d"},{"objectId":"5e7092cf878c28a04739d27e","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Łukasik","uuid":"B2F17291784000BB301AD4BDB40654CFC94F54D2B27CD6CFF475500D2DC7E429D97031F3EE344A81AB9DBA86F328B82E68C9B86C583C279371D5D061AE9A6ECD","orcidId":"0000-0001-7169-399X","documentHash":"d93498f7-254d-49b6-a4b4-c077a22740bc"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.nima.2022.167010"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA1ODE1OTY0MA=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
