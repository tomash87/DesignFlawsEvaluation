It is not always possible to perform an accurate measurement of the body weight of horses using horse weighbridges, and therefore, new body weight formulas based on biometric measurements are required. The objective of this study is to develop and validate models for estimating body weight in Icelandic foals using machine learning methods. The study was conducted using 312 data records of body measurements on 24 Icelandic foals (12 colts and 12 fillies) from birth to 404 days of age. The best performing model was the polynomial model that included features such as heart girth, body circumference and cannon bone circumference. The mean percentage error for this model was 4.1% based on cross-validation and 3.8% for a holdout dataset. The body weight of Icelandic foals can also be estimated using a less complex model taking a single trait defined as the square of heart girth multiplied by body circumference. The mean percentage error for this model was up to 5% both for the training and the holdout datasets. The study results suggest that machine learning methods can be considered a useful tool for designing models for the estimation of body weight in horses."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124163","journalIssue":{"objectId":"628368e740970702b881d501","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"10","doi":null,"documentHash":"c02dabd4-1673-425a-ac9a-dc310a472fb6"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/12/10/1234/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62947d624097070db8339e18","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Satoła","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d6d031df-fbf7-44ac-a08b-a934e5ce5711"},{"objectId":"62947d624097070db8339e17","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Petrych","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c6eac298-f030-480b-ac1d-4560ccf2539f"},{"objectId":"5e709307878c28a0473a1824","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Satoła","uuid":"F8CFC5AF6AD38AC78A125672F41399F455B42B2C9AC0759786248C160B0268E50A1E1A9DB99EFE68D929E690C761089C9C2F1C2F0458320BBC173AAC3A7E77CA","orcidId":"0000-0002-6609-4404","documentHash":"1a72dc50-910c-4c10-abca-e3257d517186"},{"objectId":"5e709307878c28a0473a180a","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Łuszczyński","uuid":"221AA35557BA6EB85DCA05A01C099E75DEFD9845E9FFF7826B04C8147B444B5329D4ACB8DD0DA53149CBFEA177A4F6F354AFA9E264D5D372EFCFE9B4DDF11D63","orcidId":"0000-0002-6083-4686","documentHash":"d2737a45-447e-42a4-9f07-b0539abc9e72"}],"doi":"10.3390/ani12101234"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["milking machine","vacuum system","milk-air mixture","milk discharge speed","vacuummetric pressure"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5f99d94c2467f06b5e42422f","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Sumy National Agrarian University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6294a8ce4097070db835ec08","6294a8ce4097070db835ec07","6294a8ce4097070db835ec06","6294a8ce4097070db835ec09"]},{"id":"61bb08a82467f00d3448e54f","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"National Scientific Center «Institute of Experimental and Clinical Veterinary Medicine»","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6294a8ce4097070db835ec05"]},{"id":"61eacce52467f06f09e4edce","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"State Biotechnological University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6294a8ce4097070db835ec04","6294a8ce4097070db835ec02"]},{"id":"61ae2b552467f00bc8cce46a","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Dnipro State Agrarian and Economic University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6294a8ce4097070db835ec03","6294a8ce4097070db835ec01"]},{"id":"5e7091c8878c28a047389432","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF LIFE AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES OF UKRAINE","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6294a8ce4097070db835ec0a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Establishing an interconnection between the technical and technological parameters of milking equipment based on the movement of a milk-air mixture in a milking machine","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6294a8ce4097070db835ebfb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6294a8ce4097070db835ec01","6294a8ce4097070db835ec02","6294a8ce4097070db835ec03","6294a8ce4097070db835ec04","6294a8ce4097070db835ec05","6294a8ce4097070db835ec06","6294a8ce4097070db835ec07","6294a8ce4097070db835ec08","6294a8ce4097070db835ec09","6294a8ce4097070db835ec0a"]},"issue":"1 (116)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Machine milking is one of the main technological processes in the dairy industry whose efficiency level largely affects cattle breeding in general. The key role, in this case, belongs to milking equipment. The design and use of technical means of milking are associated with certain difficulties related to the imperfection of milk discharge. Therefore, the current study is due to the need to investigate the process of moving the milk mixture in a milking machine.\n\nA physical-mathematical model of the process of moving the two-phase milk-air mixture along the milk-conducting line of a milking machine has been built. The mathematical model relates the value of the fluctuating of vacuummetric pressure ΔP, the rate of milk discharge QM, the pulse rate ζ, and the value of working vacuummetric pressure P. It was found that in the milk-conducting system with the upper milk pipeline there is a large fluctuation of vacuummetric pressure ΔP=1.02–4.69 kPa, which exceeds the regulated value (2.5 kPa). In a milk-conducting system with a lower milk pipeline, the vacuummetric pressure fluctuation is ΔP=0.59–1.84 kPa.\n\nThe patterns of change in the value of working pressure P and the frequency of pulsations ζ in the milking machines of simultaneous and pair action depending on the rate of milk discharge from the udder have been determined.\n\nIt is established that the maximum deviation of the value of fluctuation of vacuummetric pressure ΔP between the experimental and theoretical data within a predefined range of factors is 0.81 kPa. The correlation coefficient is 0.92, which indicates the adequacy of the constructed models.

However, their concentration is affected by many factors depending on the plant material, hydrothermal treatment methods and digestion in the gastrointestinal tract. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of hydrothermal treatment on the antioxidant activity, concentration and profile of polyphenols of Brassica oleracea var. gemmifera in an in vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion model. The study showed a significant effect of the type of hydrothermal treatment on total polyphenol concentration, polyphenolic acid profile, flavonoid content and antioxidant activity. Traditional boiling in water was the least effective type of hydrothermal treatment with respect to bioactive components of Brussels sprouts. Sous-vide was the most effective hydrothermal treatment in terms of retention of polyphenolic compounds and high antioxidant activity, thus providing a better alternative to steam cooking. Using an in vitro model, a significant difference was demonstrated between the concentration of bioavailable polyphenolic compounds and the polyphenol content of the plant material before digestion. The influence of the type of hydrothermal treatment used on the concentration of bioavailable polyphenolic compounds was maintained in relation to material not subjected to in vitro digestion (except for antioxidant activity)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124207","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6246b4672467f0368b894387","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"11","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"fef864db-6e13-4e78-9261-2108abffd5a0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/11/3/446/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602e244d9543c7410626ed2b","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Doniec","uuid":"1D7DD8A62268A4786CC2B6104C732D2BFDC591C27747F4F5DD2CDE7A6F73FDD1D12562349C8345DFE0D08E930BB70DDE2AE11C5EBEA2AD96EEAD4CC47C6124BA","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"526fc9db-0ff5-4aba-9ac8-9df4e8b88f92"},{"objectId":"5e70930c878c28a0473a1c72","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Dziadek","uuid":"518315703C3BC1C2FB82596D811602E0CCD9F29DF3F65077F20EC71EB90418558D8D2D6C495D1D69EB5F5630EB82D24C4F1C624702DDD96E7EEED44758C84099","orcidId":"0000-0002-8830-8151","documentHash":"14c0b6be-2796-4722-b5db-40a8989bd818"},{"objectId":"5e709309878c28a0473a193e","name":"Adam","lastName":"Florkiewicz","uuid":"12DDD7302A4AE87C463A0328B587E1CD686886AE5B6CDFBB891FB42C9AC7874B2483F705C201F1DBBA63DA4E242F7ED1CC8710ACC3A1D81272A93A078D8AE55B","orcidId":"0000-0001-7922-3167","documentHash":"e60d3d45-ff07-45b9-bc42-6431d49ebe97"},{"objectId":"5e709256878c28a047393e8f","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Filipiak-Florkiewicz","uuid":"01FCA2266C8D9CE1555AE551741BCE2F84A838A1086145DCC52EAC8C911EE5E122F6AD11CBA6A23ACA1CB8A50355568E96B6F4B4A31BCBEE6DC92A49F4C36665","orcidId":"0000-0001-6896-1762","documentHash":"2a32c42a-20f9-4fc6-9792-310330958a2a"}],"doi":"10.3390/antiox11030446"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Mark Zuckerberg","high-tech","przedsiębiorczość"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Mark Zuckerberg","high tech","entrepreneurship"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de09","uid":"bFitDBcx4YvxolIt7JKxDiw","uuid":"29483405-4eba-4db1-b6c9-321ff370bdf9","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de09","parentUuid":"29483405-4eba-4db1-b6c9-321ff370bdf9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de09","rootUuid":"29483405-4eba-4db1-b6c9-321ff370bdf9","name":"Uniwersytet WSB Merito w Gdańsku","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924b878c28a04739325d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Mark Zuckerberg: a portrait of successful high-tech Entrepreneur","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"6227659b2467f06c1765ad3c","mniswId":null,"title":"International Journal of Advanced Multidisciplinary Research and Studies","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2583-049X","websiteLink":"http://www.multiresearchjournal.com/index.php","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"8fd7827f-c876-4d02-95e1-87391721e556"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"FEBRUARY","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6229caaf2467f024e7ca6980","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924b878c28a04739325d"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Mark Zuckerberg, who changed the way the world communicates and brought people closer together.

Although there are many views and ways of looking at the \nreasons for Facebook's success, we would like to mention only a few issues related to the success of Mark's management method."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124215","journalIssue":{"objectId":"668689d1fdbe836e432b9a39","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"eb731bda-dffe-4dad-9347-c4ad36fdce21"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"29-34","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.multiresearchjournal.com/arclist.php?list=2022.2.2&id=122","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a04739325d","name":"Bogdan","lastName":"Nogalski","uuid":"0948176BA9B4ED0D4E2A0A37470301FF8F01FD91CDE597F3E9171438F6FAE30884CD16DD130F7782C24FE493B83439555DFB1E65B32342E70A48D1B4B192D2CE","orcidId":"0000-0003-0262-8355","documentHash":"05361677-ccda-4c46-bcf8-4fa7a5c67b60"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Influence of Cr ion implantation on physical properties of CuO thin films","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","doi":null,"issn":"1422-0067","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"850accc5-0c0e-4f6c-9a84-eaa108a84f20"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62907201409707780b016feb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602decb99543c7410626e83f","5e70922c878c28a047391190","5e709472878c28a0473bd43c","5e70920b878c28a04738f004","673d9934fdbe832d85e1a717","673d9934fdbe832d85e1a718","673d9934fdbe832d85e1a719"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058124216","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/9/4541","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"673d9934fdbe832d85e1a719","name":"Marta","lastName":"Marszałek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"655c87e3-71c9-4cf9-85ed-f392bcea47b4"},{"objectId":"673d9934fdbe832d85e1a718","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Perzanowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"67a2bee5-8fcc-4d8c-b5a4-865d206b8f43"},{"objectId":"673d9934fdbe832d85e1a717","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Mitura-Nowak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6ce70e1d-6f7d-4cb9-b73c-8cf11f875806"},{"objectId":"602decb99543c7410626e83f","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Ungeheuer","uuid":"C9252012771BEE0C24C4096EF3DD15046F2AE4FAD0039F112A8BE8476238043F91EE6007EF8FAF7863D8AAEC6637189574BAE663AB10D53B13630B4903D49EE4","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"83da70a5-9a64-467f-a7f5-6323c79ec4ec"},{"objectId":"5e709472878c28a0473bd43c","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Jeleń","uuid":"1956FA2A1345E9961216FE825BE5D82104A2656DC044D9A5803EB38B045F1E23AF3111EF6C88892466F0D7064813F4D3E1DD6C6F71D582FE162E5BBBB033FA33","orcidId":"0000-0003-2905-6078","documentHash":"e27d043c-5c3e-4df5-a84c-188546649f69"},{"objectId":"5e70922c878c28a047391190","name":"Konstanty","lastName":"Marszałek","uuid":"FE6BBE213A1EAE9BC511120158461CECB21832B2C89926E25F54C58131DA3FEBE0A7DB60DC8A7E63CE3B19C81DF04533540B0726263261F99DA7BF0ACEC9AF55","orcidId":"0000-0002-0564-5743","documentHash":"59c4312c-af0d-4c32-9c05-a9449a1623e7"},{"objectId":"5e70920b878c28a04738f004","name":"MACIEJ","lastName":"SITARZ","uuid":"E60E988B98CB0B099089E37EA326DCABA32B8C3F44573E32258C609DC3A45E56A606DFC9AB59B28FCD22CD98A9EC876CC606BF8F17CCE68D213B499033180F66","orcidId":"0000-0002-8339-2710","documentHash":"f725bb64-5a08-47b4-8f9e-3e5c406524ce"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms23094541"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["choroby układu sercowo-naczyniowego","ARNI (angiotensin receptor-nephrilysin inhibitor)","niewydolność serca","niewydolność serca z obniżoną frakcją wyrzutową lewej komory"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"608135d42467f0276870e0c9","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Instytut Nauk o Sporcie, Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The growth rate of safflower and the characteristics of the extracted oil are highly dependent on external temperature and moisture. At low temperatures, for example, the growth of safflower is significantly inhibited. With an increase in temperature and the length of daylight, the central stem begins to branch while growing faster. Flowering is mainly affected by the length of daylight. The period from the end of flowering to maturity is typically 28‒30 days. However, the total ripening period of the crop depends on the variety, location, sowing time, and agro-climatic cultivating conditions. The need for water increases significantly during the flowering period of safflower, which ultimately affects the indicators of the fatty acid composition and yield. At the same time, safflower is sensitive to moisture in terms of disease. In case of excess water, it is subject to root rot. In addition, frequent rains and high humidity after ripening can provoke the germination of seeds on the head. Hence, it follows that in order to obtain a high yield with the specified characteristics of the fatty acid composition of safflower oil, it is necessary to take into consideration the quantitative indicators of moisture and its seasonality, as well as the temperature regime during the growing season.\n\nThe study was conducted using arid or semi-arid, sharply continental Central Asia with its hot summers and cold winters as an example. The dependence of the physicochemical parameters of plant-derived oils on agroclimatic indicators has been established.

Because it is a developing branch of research, some review articles have been recently published describing different aspects of the area. However, none of them has investigated research trends based on an essentially quantitative perspective. Thus, this chapter aims to present a systematic review and a bibliometric analysis of papers concerning the complementarity of VRES. Two scientific databases were searched, and 81 relevant papers were selected out of the 751 initially retrieved. The results contemplate information about the development of the research field, answering questions related to the contribution of the papers, the VRES used, the temporal availability of data and the studied regions.

existing research suggests that personality plays an important role in explaining compulsive buying behavior, there is still potential space to diagnose the theoretical mediational mechanisms underlying these effects or the extent to which these relationships vary across different consumer demographic groups. Indeed, the role of specific personality traits on hedonistic shopping experiences and compulsive buying still awaits an in-depth examination and clarification. Thus, the present research contributes to existing knowledge by: (1) examining hedonistic shopping experiences (HSE) as a mediating mechanism on compulsive buying (CB); and (2) investigating the role of gender as a moderating variable. Using a sample of 363 adults and data derived from the US market, we confirmed the role of hedonistic shopping experiences, a central trait, in mediating the effects of cardinal traits (i.e., neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, conscientiousness and agreeableness), on compulsive buying, a surface trait. Specifically, neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience exerted a more indirect and positive influence on compulsive buying, while conscientiousness and agreeableness showed a stronger direct and negative relationship with hedonistic shopping experiences and compulsive buying. In addition, neuroticism, extraversion, and openness to experience were a stronger driver of compulsive buying for women than for men, while conscientiousness and agreeableness jointly decreased the importance of hedonistic shopping experiences, and more strongly inhibited compulsive buying for women than for men. The research findings offer important theoretical, public policy and marketing implications."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124247","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"64","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698921003684","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6409b00f40970770356c1d44","name":"Richard J.","lastName":"Harnish","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aafb2723-d6e9-4f4f-b357-47ce027b037b"},{"objectId":"6409b00f40970770356c1d43","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kukar-Kinney","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e3f1b69b-ef05-48c3-8d40-af04462ffa84"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393a8c","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Tarka","uuid":"B3C51DB05D3C3B9E3C8ED5BEE22659331DE3AC10FF1F726AD1E3722DAEC038F9B453EB72B5B5EC7BA16428231622ED1453EAEA68B32341639A963AE94C5514BC","orcidId":"0000-0002-3178-7366","documentHash":"e7c26eda-9056-43df-ae92-96e1a0508353"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jretconser.2021.102802"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"61dc1b312467f07650c3694d","doi":"10.24917/9788380847118","title":"Wybrane zagadnienia z glotto- i translodydaktyki. 3","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-8084-711-8","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"http://www.wydawnictwoup.pl/938/-Wybrane-zagadnienia-z-glotto--i-translodydaktyki--t-3.html","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"1b57e5e7-3dc1-4f88-a208-3c177eba8d87","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb8ff","mniswId":"60600","name":"Uniwersytet Pedagogiczny im.

Search of the Ainard Office\n\nThe paper is an attempt to reach the original structure of the Divine Office for St. Catherine\nof Alexandria. It is known from historical sources that such an office was composed by the\nBenedictine monk Ainard of the Monastery of St. Trinity in Rouen after 1030. Unfortunately,\nwe are not sure what it looked like at that time.

Then, the impact of\r\nthat treatment on the precision of the selected elements for modeling a watershed was assessed. The\r\nsimplification comprised a reduction in resolution, with the use of statistical resampling methods,\r\nnamely giving an average, modal, median, minimum, maximum, or the closest value to the pixels.\r\nThis process was carried out in a wide range of pixel sizes, increasing by 50% each time (from 1 m to\r\n1.5, 2.3, 3.4, 5.1, 7.6, 11, 17, 26, 38, 58, and 86 m, respectively). The precision of the obtained DEMs\r\nand the precision of the delineation of boundaries of the watershed and watercourses were assessed.\r\nWith the systematic reduction in the resolution of a DEM, its precision systematically decreased.\r\nThe changes in the precision of determining the watercourses and boundaries of a watershed were\r\nirregular, ranging from being very small, to mild, to significant. A method of giving the minimum\r\nvalue, that was simple with regard to computing, was singled out.

The reasons for this include various factors, such as poor access to internet facilities, a lack of funds, the cost of smartphones, amongst others. This study investigates the level of awareness of South African rural higher institution students (SARHISs) on M-learning using smartphones. A quantitative method was adopted for the study. Convenience sampling was used to select the institution and the 75 respondents who took part in the study. Data were collected by means of a questionnaire, entitled “Smartphone questionnaire (SQ)”. The collected data were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), Version 25. The findings of the study show that the adoption of M-learning using smartphones by the respondents who are students from the South African Rural Higher Institution (SARHIS) is moderate – a little above the average. Based on the study, it is recommended, that students’ awareness should be raised and that M-learning should be supported given the recent transition from onsite to online teaching and learning

becomes important in electricity markets as the generation mix diversifies, especially when the system's storage capacity is not enough to smooth the time natural variability of the primary source or when there occur control or dispatch problems. Unfortunately, a formal and standard definition of complementarity between energy sources is not available up to date. Consequently, authors have often, tacitly or explicitly, adopted the idea that complementarity is a synonym of “anticorrelation”, or negative correlation. Most authors that measure complementarity by anticorrelation use the Pearson's correlation coefficient to assess anticorrelation, while some use Spearman's and a few use Kendall's correlation coefficients. In a recent chapter, we argue that a complementarity metric should measure the uniformity of the sum of all available resources, and correlation coefficients fail to do that. Later on in this chapter, the measure of regularity will be precisely defined by means of the mathematical concept of total variation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124278","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"121-141","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323855273000030","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6290eb35409707780b06d657","name":"Andrés","lastName":"Ochoa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3df5d0f3-1ec7-425b-9f3b-58210aed3307"},{"objectId":"6290eb35409707780b06d656","name":"Oscar","lastName":"Mesa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a0e33cae-3e27-4b9e-9f32-f2493bf124c3"},{"objectId":"6290eb35409707780b06d655","name":"Diana","lastName":"Cantor","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6711a506-43a4-4aa3-91d4-a3ff28bdb87b"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Germanium alloys","Intelligent systems","Monte Carlo methods"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","uid":"bdkLR6wGCrp59lwUjwb_dMA","uuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","parentUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","rootUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","name":"Instytut Fizyki Jądrowej im.

In the course of the experiment, a beam momentum (13A - 150A GeV/c) and system size (p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb) scan is performed. Local proton density fluctuations in transverse momentum space represent an order parameter of the chiral phase transition and are expected to scale according to a universal power-law in the vicinity of the CP. They can be probed through an intermittency analysis of the proton second scaled factorial moments (SSFMs) in transverse momentum space. Previous such analyses [1] revealed power-law behavior in NA49 Si+Si collisions at 158A GeV/c, the fitted power-law exponent being consistent with the theoretically expected critical value, within errors. Probes of NA61/SHINE systems at the maximum SPS energy revealed no intermittency effect in Be+Be, whereas Ar+Sc analysis is inconclusive due to large uncertainties. The analysis has recently been extended to Pb+Pb collision data at lower energies. We present a summary of the current status of NA61/SHINE intermittency analysis, and review novel techniques developed and employed to subtract non-critical background and estimate statistical and systematic uncertainties. Additionally, we use Monte Carlo simulations to assess the statistical significance of the observed intermittency effect."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124320","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"EPS-HEP2021","pagesFromTo":"276","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pos.sissa.it/398/276","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094b3878c28a0473c1e87","name":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Davis","uuid":"A8C39228D4A20CE94F01AAC0612F4BE811CBB3A724896784AF3926EF128E7F129F6D92BABAF70942F8A4D2A306651E0792260AF2355D71E7812DBEF9FEAA4D8C","orcidId":"0000-0003-3047-6854","documentHash":"e84262eb-e744-4f4b-82f9-c2fafccc4077"}],"doi":"10.22323/1.398.0276"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Bezkręgowce","Biomasa","Ekosystemy leśne","Europa","Lasy borealne","Fauna glebowa","Makrofauna","Różnorodność gatunkowa"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","uid":"bz_6XXECFL3_CFkpms5BsDQ","uuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","parentUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","rootUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","name":"Uniwersytet w Siedlcach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709294878c28a04739850f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Changes in Biomass and Diversity of Soil Macrofauna along a Climatic Gradient in European Boreal Forests","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d59878c28514547c3d4","mniswId":"8403","title":"Insects","doi":null,"issn":"2075-4450","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"a669b1b7-7d5d-49b6-8602-e780e07d9fb2"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-14","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61e6aa562467f030e8be0bcb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61e6aa562467f030e8be0bcd","61e6aa562467f030e8be0bcf","61e6aa562467f030e8be0bd7","61e6aa562467f030e8be0bd9","61e6aa562467f030e8be0bda","61e6aa562467f030e8be0bdb","61e6aa562467f030e8be0bdd","61e6aa562467f030e8be0bdf","61e6aa562467f030e8be0be4","61e6aa562467f030e8be0be5","61e6aa562467f030e8be0be6","5e709294878c28a04739850f","61e6aa562467f030e8be0be8","61e6aa562467f030e8be0be9","61e6aa562467f030e8be0bea","61e6aa562467f030e8be0beb"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Latitudinal gradients allow insights into the factors that shape ecosystem structure and delimit ecosystem processes, particularly climate. We asked whether the biomass and diversity of soil macrofauna in boreal forests change systematically along a latitudinal gradient spanning from 60◦N to 69◦N. Invertebrates (3697 individuals) were extracted from 400 soil samples (20 ×20 cm, 30 cm depth) collected at ten sites in 2015–2016 and then weighed and identified. We discovered 265 species living in soil and on the soil surface; their average density was 0.486 g d·w·m−2. The species-level diversity decreased from low to high latitudes. The biomass of soil macrofauna showed no latitudinal changes in early summer but decreased towards the north in late summer. This variation among study sites was associated with the decrease in mean annual temperature by ca 5 ◦C and with variation in fine root biomass. The biomass of herbivores and fungivores decreased towards the north, whereas the biomass of detritivores and predators showed no significant latitudinal changes. This variation in latitudinal biomass patterns among the soil macrofauna feeding guilds suggests that these guildsmay respond differently to climate change, with poorly understood consequences for ecosystem structure and functions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124329","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e6aa562467f030e8be0bed","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"782af0ac-99ab-4032-82e6-ae07ca87d100"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/13/1/94/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61e6aa562467f030e8be0beb","name":"Elena

It invoked, among other things, the idea of the European Green Deal. The most current issues related to the pandemic reality were addressed. The themes and changes highlighted are based on data from available reports and statistical analyses.\nFindings: By the time the pandemic broke out, the sustainability goals had been achieved gradually. But the pandemic has forced policymakers to think long-term. The conditions for transition to the green economy, i.e. the green transition, have also become crucial. In many countries, including Poland, the need for better achievement of social goals in addition to\neconomic or environmental ones has become apparent. Further work is needed to achieve the sustainable development goals.\nResearch limitations/implications: The text refers to a limited number of studies. The problems presented in the paper still need to be empirically confirmed in relation to a greater number of examples, which should result in the publication of subsequent studies. It will also be necessary to fully diagnose the post-pandemic situation and retrace the threads taken up."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124350","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62946c854097070db832e8ea","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"156","doi":"","documentHash":"c66e91b3-bae8-4f04-a2c1-47c9c48ca720"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"117-125","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://managementpapers.polsl.pl/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Chojnacka.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70928c878c28a047397beb","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Chojnacka","uuid":"71C20EE543A8A4F337562AA539DC9B79D6EDBA12DBDD708973DE9D27F29A452CA11D3808F142BB6A19AB09F2BFD08F14E83977F2B6517675AF7E40E637D87C83","orcidId":"0000-0002-8135-0867","documentHash":"cab3817c-d4c3-47a1-b3bb-dde50853847f"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Chemia analityczna","Proces analityczny","Procedura pomiarowa","Precyzja pomiarów","Dokładność pomiarów","Selektywność i interferencje","Walidacja procedury pomiarowej","Analiza powierzchni","Analiza przepływowa","Techniki sprzężone","Czujniki chemiczne","Niepewność pomiarów"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":"9788301219369","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709355878c28a0473a7667","5e709353878c28a0473a7579"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Współczesna chemia analityczna","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":224,"publicationPlace":"Warszawa","translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62283f2d2467f0086c9b4a08","editors":[{"objectId":"5e70942b878c28a0473b7822","name":"Adriana","lastName":"Palińska-Saadi","uuid":"C1FE2EB74F51C41CE7A2137302C99E79DE3125FF34CB58158A13C039AD41937C9390A12A9E0FEC7AF3B8CEA01D3BF9DCAAD18D115E88267D02C0AA8ADA057A8D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0a713da4-da2c-456e-b7cb-2776f4820b45"},{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7a28","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Wagner","uuid":"01A6E9AF22A7A876485009F570912C769E2E920601451A65C63963060036005AE7D82C3F44EB8AA9FB404DF83C918EF4A5C153E5A7A791DC6A0F83B99E40CB20","orcidId":"0000-0002-5398-6438","documentHash":"a0efaf71-870e-4517-821f-44d3724803b6"},{"objectId":"5e709355878c28a0473a7667","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Pyrzyńska","uuid":"784FA308237260BCAFEA5E987AA7C4624297FCE348DB5F39173490BA1A4CBAD7975D9B34FA1EC11DDC0D90C01F9E6F0B75CAE0EEA3F3D352B2FF2BC24087FB05","orcidId":"0000-0002-1089-8577","documentHash":"ce27e3d2-cd2f-4683-bda5-a43c759e3a8a"},{"objectId":"5e709353878c28a0473a7579","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Maj-Żurawska","uuid":"07C6224A76687507685C3D0F5BDFD37A6422F716ADA23E76A873FFBD0208C49A55D85D905889961B42621A82643C01D771BA462DE458F25F19ABBCB828580EC4","orcidId":"0000-0003-2734-3321","documentHash":"451a24ec-a76e-43a9-8eea-1d68c3396858"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["5e709353878c28a0473a7579","5e709355878c28a0473a7667","5e709358878c28a0473a7a28","5e70942b878c28a0473b7822"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Chemia analityczna to dziedzina leżąca u podstaw praktyki analitycznej, uprawianej na potrzeby badań naukowych, przemysłu, medycyny, ochrony środowiska i wielu innych obszarów działalności człowieka. Książka Profesora Adama Hulanickiego odbiega od tradycyjnych podręczników chemii analitycznej, gdyż nie zawiera systematycznego przeglądu metod analizy chemicznej oraz ich podstaw teoretycznych. Jest to spojrzenie naukowca i doświadczonego analityka na współczesne kierunki rozwoju chemii analitycznej, które determinują dalsze zmiany w tej dziedzinie. Drugie, rozszerzone wydanie, powstałe po 20 latach, uzupełnione przez specjalistów w poszczególnych dziedzinach, często uczniów Profesora Hulanickiego, pokazuje rzeczywisty rozwój tych kierunków w tym czasie. Autorzy omawiają pojęcia, które są podstawą współczesnej wiedzy o analizie chemicznej i są niezbędne dla każdego, kto zajmuje się teorią tej dyscypliny i jej zastosowaniami.

Three phase transitions on heating were reported: glass softening (∼329 K), cold-crystallization (∼389 K) and melting (∼463 K). XRD results and evaluation of DSC data using Adam-Gibbs model extended to the glassy state revealed, that the amorphous sample of CBZ remains physically stable for 8 h at room temperature (i.e. about 30 K below glass transition temperature). Isothermal XRD measurements showed that amorphous CBZ is prone to rapid nucleation even about 50 K below the glass transition, but crystal growth is considerably slowed down in such conditions. Fragility parameter m was calculated and quench-cooled CBZ was identified as moderately fragile glass. FT-IR measurements coupled with moving-window two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy proved that changes in vibrational dynamics accompanied all phase transitions. Considerable strengthening of hydrogen bonding was observed during cold crystallization."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124357","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"707","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/288039","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64cd27714097077ac1dbffac","name":"Piotr M.","lastName":"Zieliński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"785678cc-fb51-4a70-abd7-49a636d4f76e"},{"objectId":"618353b97523400564d81fb2","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Dołęga","uuid":"EB2FB4B19D5F93AE7A4EF8F4A7529FC420F350E38F134C97F7B99C132AB812C15D99C70B1535B4B3A4277EF3F36CEF5DFD7EAF51402FC5FB0FD753C3FD71D3C5","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f543e348-46ab-4a09-aff1-dcdd498f2ab7"},{"objectId":"5e70932d878c28a0473a46e7","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Deptuch","uuid":"166D5155BD56A6C2A215A5F70D83344F48317C089588A7F0B15B00F71764A5B93E1A5D7019079C58DD171651A783F4A80DCA6413382A56C2A9F6BE4F9892607D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7451-5563","documentHash":"011abbc7-477c-4189-aba8-363067b2485f"},{"objectId":"5e709316878c28a0473a2973","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Baran","uuid":"8773C6805C24B37BC0D4562BC824878FFF23761120B91D7B2242FEAFCC14B585E511D84BA4EE367EAC2263A3CE9402F0CA78BD33859844E18ADE0418988F5372","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"29007d57-31bf-4a11-88aa-389926cb1e55"},{"objectId":"5e7092cf878c28a04739d261","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Juszyńska-Gałązka","uuid":"4F7A4118E9A5D685AC1C1A2D8276CE16D2B4A7BCAAA830FB97252F20527039BB7820591E8D1FC780FDFA71A04154E8C84F7AD2637BE4D6CC60076456D6228B37","orcidId":"0000-0002-3964-0721","documentHash":"0e8a9d71-8976-48cb-82c5-125eebcdd0fd"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.tca.2021.179100"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Marine renewable energy","Complementarity","Wave energy","Offshore wind","Floating PV","Baltic Sea"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6290e650409707780b06c7b6","doi":null,"title":"Complementarity of Variable Renewable Energy Sources","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-0-323-85527-3","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780323855273/complementarity-of-variable-renewable-energy-sources#book-info","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"77e6b3a1-7d61-4476-84a5-9d5f13d904fb","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb7dc","mniswId":"22600","name":"Elsevier","documentHash":"159aa552-a0f4-4616-8a63-8488cd70979f"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","uid":"bFhiVYWupXf-L0BTdpdX5dg","uuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","parentUuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","rootUuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","name":"Instytut Meteorologii i Gospodarki Wodnej - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f5878c28a0473c7dca","5ffd6d7d085dcb6be6b60b91"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Complementarity and application of renewable energy sources in the marine environment","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6290f6cc409707780b07087f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6290f6cc409707780b070881","5e70938d878c28a0473ac971","5ffd6d7d085dcb6be6b60b91","5e7094f5878c28a0473c7dca"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Today marine renewables represent the smallest part of the renewable energy market.

The surface of the heat exchange of the device was increased by heating the stirrer with FREhRT; secondary energy (30....85 °C) was used by converting it by Peltier elements for the autonomous operation of superchargers for cooling the engine compartment. The proposed solution will lead to an increase in the efficiency of the device, which is explained by a decrease in its specific metal consumption through the use of FREhRT.\n\nA reduction in the duration of heating (75 °C) a marshmallow formulation mixture was experimentally established: in the examined model, 530 s, compared with the analog, 645 s. That confirmed the reduction in heating time to the set temperature by 21.7 % compared to the MT-250 basic design. The calculations have established a decrease, by 13 %, in the specific energy consumption for heating the volume of a unit of product when using the improved structure, 205.7 kJ/kg, when using the basic one ‒ 232.1 kJ/kg. The increase in the efficiency of the proposed structure is explained by a decrease in the specific metal consumption of the device from 474 kg/m2 in the base apparatus to 273 kg/m2 in the improved one.\n\nThe study results confirm the increase in the resource efficiency of the improved tempering machine, which is achieved by eliminating the steam jacket; increasing the heat exchange surface by heating the stirrer. The heat transfer by FREhRT simplifies the operational performance of the temperature stabilization system in a working tank.

From a methodological point of view, Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods proved their usability in the sustainability evaluation domain. Nevertheless, the process of building a model in the classical MCDA paradigm is based on a single set of input data. Therefore, it may lead to oversimplification, especially in the domain of sustainability. Moreover, in addition to the current assessment, it is also important to know the dynamics of sustainability change over time. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative sustainability assessment method that integrates the MCDA approach with the variability of the alternatives’ performance measurement called Data vARIability Assessment Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (the DARIA-TOPSIS method). This method was used to assess sustainable cities and communities in 26 European countries. Time-based analyses conducted using the DARIA-TOPSIS method for aggregated data (countries), individual sustainability dimensions, and alternatives proved our new approach’s usefulness, suitability, and effectiveness in sustainable cities and society domain."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124380","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65083a6e40970739aadc1cc6","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"83","number":"","doi":null,"documentHash":"b46fb723-529c-4d6f-b0b0-85eb6821c05b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-24","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670722002487?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6661a26b4097074fa1bcdcf8","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Sałabun","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7f687a59-2776-434a-9b30-2c94db34ea92"},{"objectId":"6661a26b4097074fa1bcdcf7","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ziemba","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"944e00b5-8a07-4e06-b6a3-78f5ce1a1761"},{"objectId":"60c2fcdf9543c72336543443","name":"ALEKSANDRA","lastName":"BĄCZKIEWICZ","uuid":"7C5EF35A83FB0B95BE7C73D4DD39FC09B232BF7875A042E9DAE1867124B3E2692EC5A0D952E4F422040F8BD3F14D9A5FB1A8F0C0EF546DBEB12732EBE8493D67","orcidId":"0000-0003-4249-8364","documentHash":"fdd4c0dc-64a4-4920-a2d3-0eed8cb7ee48"},{"objectId":"5e7092cf878c28a04739d23c","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Wątróbski","uuid":"DE71D9D7B6930A0EDF11BB077274A9611A210F760E762B094DE0FBD5213D6B73F604F44BF84B9BDF97086D819EBF5BCA16DF7BFDF6BFA62AB0F995FBBF2B6F76","orcidId":"0000-0002-4415-9414","documentHash":"5b1c7c75-f8da-4d56-82bf-f7891ae57b58"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.scs.2022.103926"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Nanoparticles","photocatalysis","water and wastewater disinfection"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debe","uid":"b0wQuhcVyL-cE8jATY9xI9g","uuid":"f42a8e3b-c36b-40b0-8cd8-653e97eb8406","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debe","parentUuid":"f42a8e3b-c36b-40b0-8cd8-653e97eb8406","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debe","rootUuid":"f42a8e3b-c36b-40b0-8cd8-653e97eb8406","name":"Instytut Podstaw Inżynierii Środowiska Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709220878c28a04739037e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Nanoparticles for water disinfection by photocatalysis: A review","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477198","mniswId":"1668","title":"Archives of Environmental Protection","doi":null,"issn":"2083-4772","eissn":"2083-4810","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"420f3201-1098-4463-9dcc-fb1bd0d33409"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"MARCH","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62286d982467f0086c9be8fd","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709220878c28a04739037e"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Photocatalysis is an efficient and ecological method of water and wastewater disinfection. During the process, various microorganisms are deactivated, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, for example Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumonia, and so on, fungi like Aspergillus niger, Fusarium graminearum, algea (Tetraselmis suecica, Amphidinium carterae, and so on) and viruses. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is the most commonly used material due to its price and high oxidation efficiency; it is easy to modify using both physical and chemical methods, what allows for its wide use in industrial scale. Intensive research on novel photocatalysts (e.g. ZnO and carbon based photocatalysis like graphene, carbon nanotube, carbon nitride and others) has been carried out. The future development of nano-disinfection containing metal/metal oxides and carbon based nanoparticles should focus on: \n- improving disinfection efficiency through different manufacturing strategies, \n- proper clarification and understanding of the role and mechanism of interaction of the nano-material with the microorganisms, \n- progress in scaling up the production of commercial nano-photocatalysts, \n- determination of the extent of environmental release of nano-photocatalysts and their toxicity."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124384","journalIssue":{"objectId":"649c21ef4097071cb9093069","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"48","doi":"","documentHash":"d4f9b140-df04-47d9-a685-10157de94a80"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"48","pagesFromTo":"3-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709220878c28a04739037e","name":"Michał","lastName":"Bodzek","uuid":"25899F6B91C9249BB1DCA4EC957B35FFE2FC9ED908AE3E000DDE1C60B1E3F4E2A7599CC43F8756E9FD0BF41F6EB13F222C0CC1E71F55E95E8653BBF61B871892","orcidId":"0000-0001-9534-7426","documentHash":"4dfbda0c-4b41-410d-8fed-809fb6ceefb2"}],"doi":"10.24425/aep.2022.140541"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet

hogweeds, mainly the Sosnowsky’s hogweed Heracleum sosnowskyi and the giant\nhogweed Heracleum mantegazzianum, create one of the most problematic plant invasions in the world.\nDue to their large size (weeds reaching 4–5 m in height), they seem to be herbaceous plants that\ncan threaten birds living in forest stands. This research quantified the structure and diversity of the\nforest birds’ community in forests with varying areas of invasive hogweeds located in south-eastern\nPoland. Changes in the accompanying non-forest birds’ community were also assessed. The study\naddressed the following questions: 1. How does the invaded area correlate with the abundance\nof forest birds? 2. How do communities and species respond to invaded vegetation? 3. How do\nthe invading plants affect the various types of diversity of forest and non-forest birds? It turned\nout that both surveyed bird communities had a lower alpha diversity in invaded sites. Only forest\nbirds, not able to change their location easily, formed a unique community (i.e., had a higher beta\ndiversity) near invaders. Forest birds showed unchanged functional diversity based on the relative\nbird abundance and their connection, or lack of it, with the forest development phases. The effect\nof hogweeds on the abundance of forest birds was more negative in severely invaded areas with\nanthropogenic habitats. Non-forest birds showed higher species loss near the invasion, constant\nbeta diversity and decreased functional diversity. This study is important as the forest is a climax\ncommunity in the temperate zone, and unused open areas become spontaneously overgrown with\nyoung forests. Weeds disseminating after crop abandonment can highly and commonly affect forest\nand non-forest bird communities co-occurring in this type of overgrowing area."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124413","journalIssue":{"objectId":"628de1514097077624499f4a","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"96df8378-abee-4b0b-8693-a4eb600926fa"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-23","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/14/3/229/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70946f878c28a0473bcf1d","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Grzędzicka","uuid":"701CA287F5ACC1A6C3EA9E40321256A4B838F9DC43B16AE3E1A486DFBAAFC5752ECA0A8489670CB98032B3EEACB0AD9DE6379E2998CD4FCE74BE48DD01152E5D","orcidId":"0000-0002-3954-4895","documentHash":"6bbc8675-c44b-4b83-93bd-f5ab51928315"}],"doi":"10.3390/d14030229"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["TRANSGENIC-MOUSE MODEL","RESTRICTED PRECURSORS","NEUROPROTECTION","REPLACEMENT","SURVIVAL"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec8","uid":"bFhJlSgNLVQOBOA0xxvzVfg","uuid":"e37107d0-a2ea-47b0-abe0-847a23a43089","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec8","parentUuid":"e37107d0-a2ea-47b0-abe0-847a23a43089","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec8","rootUuid":"e37107d0-a2ea-47b0-abe0-847a23a43089","name":"Instytut Genetyki Człowieka Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d0878c28a04739d3a4","5e709381878c28a0473ab6ba"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9e","uid":"b4-9zzGvUfyUhirAhWcr-QA","uuid":"eb155ad0-f9cf-4c26-b470-4c6501ea0a66","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9e","parentUuid":"eb155ad0-f9cf-4c26-b470-4c6501ea0a66","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9e","rootUuid":"eb155ad0-f9cf-4c26-b470-4c6501ea0a66","name":"Instytut Chemii Bioorganicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709337878c28a0473a5266"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Murine glial progenitor cells transplantation and synthetic PreImplantation Factor (sPIF) reduces inflammation and early motor impairment in ALS mice","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":null,"issn":"2045-2322","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"MARCH","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"622882b72467f0086c9ca708","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709381878c28a0473ab6ba","622882b82467f0086c9ca70c","622882b82467f0086c9ca70d","622882b82467f0086c9ca70e","5e7092d0878c28a04739d3a4","5e709337878c28a0473a5266"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive motor neuronal disorder characterized by neuronal degeneration and currently no effective cure is available to stop or delay the disease from progression. Transplantation of murine glial-restricted precursors (mGRPs) is an attractive strategy to modulate ALS development and advancements such as the use of immune modulators could potentially extend graft survival and function. Using a well-established ALS transgenic mouse model (SOD1G93A), we tested mGRPs in combination with the immune modulators synthetic PreImplantation Factor (sPIF), Tacrolimus (Tac), and Costimulatory Blockade (CB). We report that transplantation of mGRPs into the cisterna magna did not result in increased mice survival. The addition of immunomodulatory regimes again did not increase mice lifespan but improved motor functions and sPIF was superior compared to other immune modulators.

The predictors of the network were sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS), the upper ocean mixed-layer depth (MLD), and chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a), and as a target, we used 2 853 pCO2W data points from the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas. We built an FFNN based on three major datasets that differed in the Chl-a concentration data used to choose the best model to reproduce the spatial distribution and temporal variability of pCO2W. Using all physical–biological components improved estimates of the pCO2W and decreased the biases, even though Chl-a values in many grid cells were interpolated values. General features of pCO2W distribution were reproduced with very good accuracy, but the network underestimated pCO2W in the winter and overestimated pCO2W values in the summer. The results show that the model that contains interpolating Chl-a concentration, SST, SSS, and MLD as a target to predict the spatiotemporal distribution of pCO2W in the sea surface gives the best results and best-fitting network to the observational data. The calculation of monthly drivers of the estimated pCO2W change within continental shelf areas of the EAS confirms the major impact of not only the biological effects to the pCO2W distribution and Air-Sea CO2 flux in the EAS, but also the strong impact of the upper ocean mixing. A strong seasonal correlation between predictor and pCO2W seen earlier in the North Atlantic is clearly a yearly correlation in the EAS. The five-year monthly mean CO2 flux distribution shows that all continental shelf areas of the Arctic Ocean were net CO2 sinks. Strong monthly CO2 influx to the Arctic Ocean through the Greenland and Barents Seas (>12 gC m−2 day−1) occurred in the fall and winter, when the pCO2W level at the sea surface was high (>360 µatm) and the strongest wind speed (>12 ms−1) was present."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124428","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61eeb19c2467f0689144f088","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"620da02c-2abd-4e51-a024-ce5fe723fa25"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"312","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/2/312/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709489878c28a0473bf377","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Makuch","uuid":"85FD817EC7A87F03F838855336B25207286B8767235FEC849DD4568444510725B2225280529810C7754A21DDEE8BCA4353F3BD29A41F34EEFEA5967457C303A7","orcidId":"0000-0001-9132-1990","documentHash":"311369bd-713f-4e50-ad69-8c04ac3dcea3"},{"objectId":"5e709489878c28a0473bf343","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kitowska","uuid":"127771033B5E4A478D132F5BC3AE4A318687B0AEEFFF97603D14800DC684380C5CE781B5CB907274578B2A0AD625E2A2C718A4A7D20D073386DD44509E9A6D0A","orcidId":"0000-0002-2421-034X","documentHash":"edfe1b13-c623-40bb-b9c5-089956d44b86"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac1a4","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Markuszewski","uuid":"0014105502B25E9A2BA9F3C5F0DDFB201E300286645007F34F9BF1734051EE556B442316548E3AD68FE389CF9B7EAB5AEE3A3D2175A5C349563039874A4736EB","orcidId":"0000-0003-1160-6318","documentHash":"8b99a50a-c43a-445c-9075-c50ccb381d72"},{"objectId":"5e709328878c28a0473a3cea","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Niedźwiecka","uuid":"96EC04B8E66D2520DD94DDC0266EC593CAB2E2ED1B7D13402AA2A7BC78A2BAE04282011C99450492E8236CA258FC9B98AC7641502ABE387E28023D29D57A7CBD","orcidId":"0000-0003-1315-5231","documentHash":"dd80c8e3-4e20-4a35-92fe-c12bcf91c6cb"}],"doi":"10.3390/rs14020312"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cancer cells","cytotoxicity","Apoptosis","pyrazolo[4","3-e]tetrazolo[1","5-b][1","2","4]triazine","sulfonamides"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df62","uid":"bsq32O8WjxMhkpQii6EvcZw","uuid":"6700d816-d124-4a54-9d44-4f1b7f01494b","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de19","parentUuid":"5011bcd5-dfb1-41ed-84b0-5bd51ce0832c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de19","rootUuid":"5011bcd5-dfb1-41ed-84b0-5bd51ce0832c","name":"Wydział Biologii i Ochrony Środowiska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["603f4c9e9543c711bc6ea307","5e709373878c28a0473a9f41","5e709450878c28a0473ba459"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Preparation of Novel Pyrazolo [4,3-e]tetrazolo[1,5-b][1,2,4]triazine Sulfonamides and Their Experimental and Computational Biological Studies","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","doi":null,"issn":"1422-0067","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"850accc5-0c0e-4f6c-9a84-eaa108a84f20"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6294aab04097070db835f882","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["603f4c9e9543c711bc6ea307","5e709450878c28a0473ba459","5e709373878c28a0473a9f41","656db42240970749a862f5cc","656db42240970749a862f5cd","656db42240970749a862f5ce","656db42240970749a862f5cf"]},"issue":"11","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Pyrazolo[4,3-e]tetrazolo[1,5-b][1,2,4]triazine sulfonamides constitute a novel class of heterocyclic compounds with broad biological activity, including anticancer properties.

Our findings point out that these sulfonamide derivatives may constitute a source of new anticancer drugs after optimization."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124431","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"1-33","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/11/5892","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"656db42240970749a862f5cf","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Mojzych","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"23187fd2-2ac2-46d5-bebe-860f5d07ffde"},{"objectId":"656db42240970749a862f5ce","name":"Karol","lastName":"Bukowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b69c1556-6cf4-4c5b-9d2d-3c68f2e369cf"},{"objectId":"656db42240970749a862f5cd","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szymanowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8e021633-da28-4274-bc95-fc5cd16f422d"},{"objectId":"656db42240970749a862f5cc","name":"Somdutt","lastName":"Mujwar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5fd0b0f2-ca0e-4fc0-9282-172165af5775"},{"objectId":"603f4c9e9543c711bc6ea307","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Kciuk","uuid":"C9008C8174F475A81E39F6378E7E05D68E9355D95A7A6164B859475748B4F588654BB3D1FD302A5AA3DE838625A78D739A224615EC58D5FD10701D9F2E0845F3","orcidId":"0000-0002-8616-3825","documentHash":"e6d82116-21f3-4a9b-83d8-ee8b36e36c1f"},{"objectId":"5e709450878c28a0473ba459","name":"Beata","lastName":"Marciniak","uuid":"06A6E81211DC3EA8D063E3746E46D96AA2BB29A983E872BC76C8725F70F74BB4C0EA73FFBC2C2E0A922797EB22C3AF1BF962F072F603AF822847655288D5683B","orcidId":"0000-0001-8109-6478","documentHash":"389745b3-4369-43c2-80c6-5ed2328624b0"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473a9f41","name":"Renata","lastName":"Kontek","uuid":"FC7B05B917D4DF0D81B4C5A2D479ED245FCC6BA0BFCDFB8A3F4C2A480DB741EC5C1AA4EB7452D9C308D23B9118D2B225F44D0610D88543E1E613D9256674F6BD","orcidId":"0000-0003-2859-9839","documentHash":"ff4df584-af27-4758-a2d5-592dee31969d"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms23115892"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CO2 photoreduction; Fermi level; heterojunctions; photoelectrodes; reduced graphene oxide; solar energy conversion"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935b878c28a0473a7e22"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df15","uid":"bR42jPDMRkKGHv60Y9Q25kQ","uuid":"9b699ae6-6e42-406f-ab02-2d5c171b6c86","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Fizyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ab878c28a0473aeccc"]},{"id":"5e709193878c28a04737f082","uid":"b9SXTF1Zzo_eiHN0JX9AfyA","uuid":"951ff117-fef4-4ad2-81fa-149f6095a5a7","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Centrum Nowych Technologii UW","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093eb878c28a0473b34b7","5e709359878c28a0473a7d65"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Influence of Fermi-Level Engineering in Multi-Interface CuO/Cu2O||rGO||h-WO3||rGO|| Photoelectrodes on Photoelectrochemical CO2 Reduction","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477ab8","mniswId":"5696","title":"Energy Technology","doi":null,"issn":"2194-4288","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"1ea09d2a-eb75-4289-9817-02dd19973b41"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"628e04dd40970776244bf3f9","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093eb878c28a0473b34b7","628e04dd40970776244bf3fb","628e04dd40970776244bf3fc","5e70935b878c28a0473a7e22","5e7093ab878c28a0473aeccc","5e709359878c28a0473a7d65"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Heterojunction engineering enables more versatile and higher performance systems than single components. In parallel with heterojunction engineering, defect engineering has emerged as a means of tailoring the optoelectronic properties of photoelectrodes. However, constructing effective and stable hybrid semiconductor heterojunctions is a challenging task under the strict requirements of band alignment, vacancy characteristics, and interface properties. Herein, the photoelectrochemical (PEC) reduction of CO2 to methanol is augmented by a novel approach explored by modeling the Fermi level in a multi-interface architecture. The excellent PEC CO2 reduction activity is attributed to the formation of a high-performance, energetically aligned multi-interface system of CuO/Cu2O||rGO|h-WO3|rGO (rGO = reduced graphene oxide layer). The overall performance of this hybrid, system strongly depends on the number of oxygen groups in rGO and the structural properties of rGO. Therefore, to construct an effective PEC system, numerous postsynthetic treatments are explored for their practicality and usefulness. The results reported herein clearly show that the best performance toward the CO2 photoreduction currents of 3 mA/cm2 at 0.00.1 V versus reversable hydrogen electrode (more than double that of the CuO/Cu2O system) has been reached for the semiconductor architecture containing two layers of rGO."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124449","journalIssue":{"objectId":"628e04dd40970776244bf401","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"6becc484-0fd0-4c81-9b18-38531ea4ad7b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"2100999","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ente.202100999","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"628e04dd40970776244bf3fc","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Stobiński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"287198c3-e58c-4abd-983f-c125c9d9914e"},{"objectId":"628e04dd40970776244bf3fb","name":"Artur","lastName":"Małolepszy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bc6cca63-7207-4a56-830c-0206d0a05fee"},{"objectId":"5e7093eb878c28a0473b34b7","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Bieńkowski","uuid":"4A6C52F3E8B4FC04398FDD412E38D7E4200364324714AB4CAB37894F7B79B52DDA5318CD1BFA72B91B1BD1EE3BE4F35AFFEDEE15A5C8A439031BEA42DAD5D750","orcidId":"0000-0001-6077-5607","documentHash":"7a95090c-dabf-4822-bbc8-892ac111e60b"},{"objectId":"5e7093ab878c28a0473aeccc","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Wróbel","uuid":"4C5357AD84D0C166355C58D5DB7F65858C60A5B81895FDB3FFC96B71BD494D185EFD9DCC6D46B50D7CE0E6F04F91EABA3D668E46821EED10DC2AE408E6D2B044","orcidId":"0000-0003-1975-2117","documentHash":"e7423a6c-5003-4ccf-beb9-75c8598a2f57"},{"objectId":"5e70935b878c28a0473a7e22","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Strawski","uuid":"DC51FFD2EB652095A17095D334308E26F05E7B25407CA5EAD48005F0882D08E5C1D84FF4ABECB9AD4FFF6188DEF1BB290EC2E888353E04B24380C0BD14964014","orcidId":"0000-0002-8253-0878","documentHash":"a9f6906c-a6ca-4beb-a7da-dc89a67e3fea"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7d65","name":"Renata","lastName":"Solarska","uuid":"F39EECF96CF14E09C88C7A662590A01B6E18A11FBC42EB5464F18706A6F00E5433B621B6D201FDDE34E118DA0C2BE89DB673A3BB3A7A81F6ECFADEB3914615C1","orcidId":"0000-0002-4811-1143","documentHash":"e765405d-9a53-4037-9f86-881ebd7d872d"}],"doi":"10.1002/ente.202100999"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["philosophical optimism","Kollár","Chalupka","philosophy of historical progress","Herder"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["625635a87523402df0a0ac73"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Philosophical Optimism and Philosophy of Historical Progress in Slovak Lutheran Ethics in the First Half of the 19th Century","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b176","mniswId":"14912","title":"Neue Zeitschrift fur Systematische Theologie und Religionsphilosophie","doi":null,"issn":"0028-3517","eissn":"1612-9520","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"3893383f-597a-41c0-996c-2d5202a33692"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"628f3aff409707500aaa9bd3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["625635a87523402df0a0ac73"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The author studies the form of philosophical optimism in Slovak Lutheran ethics in the first half of the 19th century in the views of Ján Kollár and Ján Chalupka.

In order to study the functional state of blood microcirculation the method of laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) was used.\n\nResults. Determination of the age dynamics of the tissue blood flow in subjects aged 17-21 years showed that the parameter of microcirculation in the subjects increased from minimal values at 17 years to maximal values at 21 years. In the female subjects, the value of the microcirculation parameter was higher at 17 years than in the male subjects, while the maximum perfusion value for girls was at 19 years and at 20 years in the male subjects. Assessment of the regulatory devices showed that the amplitude value of low-frequency oscillations in females fell at the age of 19 years and in males at 20 years. The maximal amplitude index of vasomotor oscillations was registered at the age of 19 years both for boys and girls. The amplitude of vasomotor oscillations in the high-frequency range varied in both girls and boys. Three types of LDF-grams were identified among the young adolescents: aperiodic LDF-grams, which correspond to normoemic type of microcirculation, monotonous low amplitude LDF-grams, which correspond to hypooemic type of microcirculation, sinusoidal LDF-grams, which correspond to hyperemic type of microcirculation.\n\nConclusions.

A tendency to progression of scoliosis and the failure of many methods of conservative treatment have prompted the search for new methods that would stop and correct deformations. One of them is the FED method, used in the conservative treatment of idiopathic scolioses, in which all scoliotic curves are corrected. The aim of this study was a comparative analysis of the effectiveness of idiopathic scoliosis treatment with the FED and FITS methods. (2) Methods: The study included 60 randomly selected girls, aged 11 to 15 years, treated with the FED and FITS methods. They were diagnosed with idiopathic scoliosis grade II according to Cobb and double-curve scoliosis type I and II according to King–Moe classification. The results of the therapy were assessed with the use of the Bunnell scoliometer. The examinations were performed before the start of the therapy—on the first day of the child’s stay—and 3 weeks after the therapy. The angle of trunk rotation and the sum of two rotations were assessed using a scoliometer. (3) Results: The performed statistical analysis demonstrated significant changes in the examined parameters in both therapeutic groups. (4) Conclusions: 1. The obtained results indicate that the FED therapy may prove to be an effective method of treating idiopathic scoliosis; however, it requires further research in a larger group of patients; 2. both methods significantly improved trunk rotation in primary and secondary scoliosis, but after using summing parameters (SDR parameter), the FED method appeared to be statistically more effective"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124483","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/1/65/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6228823c2467f0086c9ca5cf","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Koszela","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3629-7523","documentHash":"351c6f4a-eb8b-42ed-b757-1dcfcbd5eb45"},{"objectId":"6228823c2467f0086c9ca5ce","name":"Sandra","lastName":"Trzcińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f81f09fc-47e8-4b83-963f-41184a68dacf"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d3c6","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kuszewski","uuid":"2A3A8F8A05CFB2E815FEE37AE87A03BBE69499EAACC8604E89902BACC039F65E130CACD357E5F4A5A5856F2AD72E2160BA91406225FEF4A2391F19B845D9DCB1","orcidId":"0000-0002-9569-6017","documentHash":"37836d8f-de9d-4265-a765-f24cea6e9816"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19010065"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["wheat flour","gluten","pumpkin","pumpkin puree","vitamins","minerals","dough","bread"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61b1d1732467f0304b89905b","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Azerbaijan State University of Economics","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6294d1bf4097070db837a161","6294d1bf4097070db837a160","6294d1bf4097070db837a15e","6294d1bf4097070db837a15f"]},{"id":"61e6d8f92467f030e8c394a9","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"University of Technology of Azerbaijan (UTECA)","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6294d1bf4097070db837a162"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Increasıng the bıologıcal value of bread through the applıcatıon of pumpkın puree","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6294d1bf4097070db837a15b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6294d1bf4097070db837a15e","6294d1bf4097070db837a15f","6294d1bf4097070db837a160","6294d1bf4097070db837a161","6294d1bf4097070db837a162"]},"issue":"11 (116)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Some vegetables are indispensable for the production of a wide range of bread products, because of their chemical composition. One of the factors hindering their widespread use in the bakery is the insufficient study of their functional properties in the mentioned technological areas. The main goal of the study was a complex analysis of the food value, mineral and vitamin compositions of raw materials and bread with additives, on the example of pumpkin variety «Perekhvatka 69». This is necessary to further substantiate the development of technology for the production of new types of bakery products, expanding the range of products and satisfying various consumer preferences. The nature of changes in nutrients, mineral and vitamin compositions in the technological process has been studied, which makes it possible to determine the proportion of reduction in their content. Based on this, it is possible to adjust the content of nutrients, mineral and vitamin compositions before and after the technological process of processing raw materials and making bread with additives. It has been found that the introduction of pumpkin puree has practically no effect on the amount of washed gluten. However, at a dosage of pumpkin puree from 5 to 25 %, the compression strain of raw gluten increases from 68.5 to 94.7 units instrument. This makes it possible to regulate the desired final properties of bread and the deformation of gluten in the dough"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124486","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6294b38f4097070db83653d3","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"11 (116)","doi":"","documentHash":"b26c593f-33e3-4616-a6ae-56fd8d7feeeb"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"58–68","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/view/254090/252923","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6294d1bf4097070db837a162","name":"Ilhama","lastName":"Kazimova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3857-9575","documentHash":"5a701e8e-5cec-4e86-a4c4-595bc2836731"},{"objectId":"6294d1bf4097070db837a161","name":"Sevda","lastName":"Gurbanova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-1983-5166","documentHash":"c9fefff5-b6bd-4b65-b3a2-cd88f60c5fac"},{"objectId":"6294d1bf4097070db837a160","name":"Afet","lastName":"Gasimova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9814-4488","documentHash":"36bd89e3-dbbd-4256-9c2a-2b970421a857"},{"objectId":"6294d1bf4097070db837a15f","name":"Shakir","lastName":"Aliyev","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9192-7826","documentHash":"bcfde587-d9ae-4e99-af8a-2b4022af1c5a"},{"objectId":"6294d1bf4097070db837a15e","name":"Eldaniz","lastName":"Bayramov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0798-253X","documentHash":"1fdd9af3-4c08-4252-968c-b3c242fec79a"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.254090"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Efficiency","Radiation damage","Signal to noise ratio","Silicon","Silicon detectors"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","uid":"bdkLR6wGCrp59lwUjwb_dMA","uuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","parentUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","rootUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","name":"Instytut Fizyki Jądrowej im.

The SVD is one of the two vertex subdetectors within Belle II. Since the start of data taking in 2019 at the Super-KEKB collider (KEK, Japan), which has the highest peak-luminosity ever recorded, the SVD is operated reliably and with high efficiency, despite exposure to harsh beam background. Measurements using data show that the SVD has both high signal-to-noise ratio and hit efficiency, as well precise spatial resolution. Further these properties are stable over time. Recently the simulation has been tuned, using data, to improve the agrement between data and MC for cluster properties. The good hit-time resolution can be exploited to further improve the robustness against the higher levels of background expected as the instantaneous luminosity increases in the next years of running.

Energy, water, and food are basic human needs and are threatened by megatrends such as climate change and population growth. Renewable energies play an important role in the energywater nexus because their water footprint, except for hydropower and bioenergy, is extremely low as compared to conventional fossil-based energy systems, especially for solar power and wind power conversion systems. Solar power and wind power systems reduce pressure on water resources by allowing for better water management, especially when it comes to conflicts between water for energy versus water for food. Renewable energies also represent a key pathway for combating climate change. This chapter introduces the concept of the waterfoodenergy nexus and its complex interrelationships and gives particular attention to renewable energies. Subsequently, several waterfoodenergy nexus aspects related to applications of renewable energies are investigated more deeply, with reference to practical examples. Particular attention will be given to floating photovoltaic systems, photovoltaic water-pumping systems, and agrivoltaics. The chapter concludes with the competition of land for energy versus land for food and on the role of the nexus in renewable-based wastewater systems"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124509","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"571-614","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323855273000108","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6290f7ea409707780b070c38","name":"Pietro","lastName":"Elia Campana","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"94049459-6f3c-478f-b50e-abc062fd0292"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["ubezpieczenia","popyt","wydatki gospodarstw domowych"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["insurance","demand","welfare functions","household expenditures"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3d","uid":"b2eiZUbb85g0FOaTA2KZtOw","uuid":"c7c10a2a-f381-4dc2-8511-53400ceb4a90","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3d","parentUuid":"c7c10a2a-f381-4dc2-8511-53400ceb4a90","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3d","rootUuid":"c7c10a2a-f381-4dc2-8511-53400ceb4a90","name":"Szkoła Główna Handlowa w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602b4f349543c7410626dc2e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Application of reduced social welfare functions for estimating household insurance expenditures in Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d53878c28514547a656","mniswId":"496849","title":"Insurance Review","doi":null,"issn":"0137-7264","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"8cb29987-b3a6-483e-b1d7-3e44f8a04fdc"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_ND","releaseDate":"2022-06-19","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6294e4f04097070db8385131","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602b4f349543c7410626dc2e"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Due to the role of insurance in economy, the factors determining the demand for insurance (e.g. income) have been the subject of many studies. On the other hand, income inequalities significantly affect many purchasing decisions and the perception of income among individuals. The aim of this study is to verify the relationship between social welfare and insurance expenditure. This verification was carried out on the basis of data on various socio-economic groups in Poland by using reduced social welfare functions such as: the Sen Index, Kakwani Index, Dagum indexes and the ‘naïve’ welfare function (income). As part of the research, a linear regression was applied between the dependent variable (average monthly expenses on insurance per 1 person in households by socio-economic groups) and the explanatory variable (reduced welfare functions) for a given social group. Reduced social welfare functions was determined on the basis of the average monthly disposable income per capita in households and the Gini coefficient for this group. Social welfare in the form of reduced welfare functions turned out to be a statistically better predictor of insurance expenditure than the income itself for social groups with relatively small income disparities (low Gini coefficient). For the group of farmers in Poland, where the income disproportions were statistically the largest, income turned out to be a better predictor."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124510","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ca91794097071a96474a61","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"8f25d2d3-f50d-4fe3-8881-8e376138284c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://piu.org.pl/wydawnictwo/wiadomosci-ubezpieczeniowe-1-2022/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602b4f349543c7410626dc2e","name":"Norbert","lastName":"Duczkowski","uuid":"87A2C4AE5E87429D24727E979286D9D2C7F815E3E98FDDE0C11A5B6309627ACE5CC3DD76720119257B93325B9775AA2B2ACFA649DF3A7CD8BEC7A6D5C63FE4CA","orcidId":"0000-0003-4543-2678","documentHash":"89e44cc0-ea2f-498d-bf62-9b774be9ae2b"}],"doi":"10.33995/wu2022.1.5"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["seawater","membrane","desalination","reverse osmosis","copper","boron","lithium"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737e9d9","uid":"bnin_CfrOxQK6XxaYJytRhg","uuid":"3178cdc9-4bfd-44e5-a0dc-d37b30326a58","parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9d9","parentUuid":"3178cdc9-4bfd-44e5-a0dc-d37b30326a58","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9d9","rootUuid":"3178cdc9-4bfd-44e5-a0dc-d37b30326a58","name":"Instytut Gospodarki Surowcami Mineralnymi i Energią Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709297878c28a047398a08","5e7092ef878c28a04739f85d"]},{"id":"5fc0f8742467f02fc364f352","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"AGH Akademia Górniczo-Hutnicza im.

The paper presents an assessment of reverse osmosis SW30 membranes for simultaneous removal of boron, copper, and lithium from two high-mineralized water. The experiments conducted allowed to gain removal up to the following values (retention coefficients): boron (30% and 8%), copper (89% and 69%), and lithium (39% and 8%), in permeates. Despite the quite promising removal ratios gained for copper and lithium, the value of reduction of mineralization, boron, and some of the major ions was insufficient and their concentration values exceeded the parametric value introduced in the mentioned Directive. In concentrates with these three parameters, negligible increases in concentrations were observed. The research work carried out provided that the treatment of high-mineralized water with increased content of microelements with the use of a one-step reverse osmosis system is not an effective enough solution. Due to the unsatisfactory boron removal and mineralization reduction being gained, further studies should be carried out to improve the efficiency of removal of these components, for example, the use of a multistage desalination process or secondary treatment."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124512","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"245","pagesFromTo":"1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.deswater.com/DWT_abstracts/vol_245/245_2022_1.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092ef878c28a04739f85d","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Tomaszewska","uuid":"1C9DA9CD452BB5D509C21CB7DF9FCCC73FE5105BC08D21CB45B372A72B16DF2F6ECF7158199CA4F56DEB5BCEEE1379DAAABD8D6F1910264435D478C4D96247F7","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f36d0c4b-fbb3-414f-950c-86691f63d123"},{"objectId":"5e709297878c28a047398a08","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Tyszer","uuid":"99A019195C9656A3D36253ACFF1FECB61FF5BCC8C8A15203D5313F2BA5C387427E0E42027DC7EDF29E0F5A8BFBC212BE6A6FFAF52A0460020975E42B5544E591","orcidId":"0000-0002-4456-2828","documentHash":"e9fa60e3-0299-4c83-a2e1-665a7251e15f"},{"objectId":"5e709220878c28a04739037e","name":"Michał","lastName":"Bodzek","uuid":"25899F6B91C9249BB1DCA4EC957B35FFE2FC9ED908AE3E000DDE1C60B1E3F4E2A7599CC43F8756E9FD0BF41F6EB13F222C0CC1E71F55E95E8653BBF61B871892","orcidId":"0000-0001-9534-7426","documentHash":"4dfbda0c-4b41-410d-8fed-809fb6ceefb2"}],"doi":"10.5004/dwt.20222.27877"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["COVID-19","kryzys ekonomiczny","polityka gospodarcza","finanse publiczne","państwo","zrównoważony rozwój","globalizacja","finansowanie gmin","mieszkania"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-8211-103-3","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Gospodarka w cieniu pandemii COVID-19","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":173,"publicationPlace":"Poznań","translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"PUBLISHER_WEBSITE","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-06-08","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6229c2792467f01c212f5de6","editors":[{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a0473938e3","name":"Sławomira","lastName":"Kańduła","uuid":"75EE2E77D92299CD7DDDF2DE0DD8B48509DB36B81F9BE0A953156BB5408C03D9A53F3E78666FD7BEDF26D3699A1A04351D31986ED18AB2C87B9A07AF35842172","orcidId":"0000-0002-1419-5844","documentHash":"c400718a-5a4c-40b2-a626-f5a77bd86f9c"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a0473938a8","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Przybylska","uuid":"CE9D876EB0A82E1B5BF6C55EE5415C63FD9C73EAD0971715F0A365D63B617A633A88DDA2D1AE699FB4785EB951BAD240C2B7DD7112459EA618739F7896F38933","orcidId":"0000-0002-2514-1518","documentHash":"d4bef435-8e25-4aee-8e23-bd009d42fbea"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["5e70924f878c28a0473938e3","5e70924f878c28a0473938a8"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058124518","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb8ea","mniswId":"58500","name":"Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Poznaniu","documentHash":"a860e639-06c8-4c3f-9951-db4a63c2c41c"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://wydawnictwo.ue.poznan.pl/book.html?isbn=978-83-8211-103-3#spistresci","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":"10.18559/978-83-8211-104-0"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047390fd9","5e70922b878c28a047390f70"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Meat and Bone Meal and the Energy Balance of Winter Oilseed Rape -

Static load tests have been performed under identical conditions and stresses, but the layer sequence was changed. The Ansys workbench ACP-pre is utilized to analyze the data. Various deformations were found as a result of this. There are values of 14.265 and 0.1335 for the smallest z-direction deformation and for the overall strain in the composite 3 examples. Boundary conditions have been confirmed with 1,500 N as a resultant force with the static condition. The simulation results have been analyzed as a static condition. Four materials have been employed in different order to be investigated and these materials are Sisal, Pineapple, Jute, and Kenaf. The numerical results have been undertaken using the static structure of Ansys 16.1 Version tool. Geometry has been modeled and meshed using Ansys workbench. The model has been verified using convergence test. As the output, total deformation and von Mises stresses were investigated and explained accordingly. Numerical results stated that the maximum deformation due applied load was at the Z-axis. The maximum total deformation value is 1.254 mm and the minimum is 2.5 mm. Furthermore, von Mises stresses of the entire body have been calculated. The numerical results have shown the maximum result due to 1,500 N is 1.1 mPa.

To this purpose, a qualitative research study was carried out with members of the ‘Gracje’ dance group. The study used Jürgen Habermas’s theory of communicative action as its theoretical underpinnings. The focus was on the models of action and validity claims expressed in language (narrative). In this theoretical framework, dancing activity has been shown as promoting not only physical health and mental wellbeing but also social involvement. Our study has found that, in and through dance, the older adults primarily realised their claims to pleasure, attractiveness, health and emancipation. This has considerably improved their bodily capacity and increased their self-esteem. However, what the older adults themselves find most important is that the realisation of these claims beneficially affects their interactions in family and neighbourly communities and facilitates their engagement in volunteer activities, helping people at risk of exclusion due to age and/or disability."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124550","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/10/6318","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709450878c28a0473ba411","name":"AGNIESZKA","lastName":"ZYGMONT","uuid":"0944D20A232456241E464C3C0986F1384FB7F5107B32900E54BB9125A50CD336B48FC7FAB2E3A233D1672DB898CCC88E4AB4C2F2FF7447628831C487DBC5E952","orcidId":"0000-0002-9725-6103","documentHash":"75ba94ab-15a6-4bff-a785-4ff8067e57b2"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394b76","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Pezdek","uuid":"C824FD99E41B293DCDF21D66B0AA248BB6560FA1B0D0A38E2328C976F6761C095A93E0EC6585E6260F41DC86F3C0D8FD756DEAAF1A4DFC7EDCAA575FF3F0A9BC","orcidId":"0000-0003-1750-5999","documentHash":"0e6f24c4-970e-4b68-a406-2b749a34986e"},{"objectId":"5e70922e878c28a0473913b1","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Doliński","uuid":"9424C1C9DA31C0BFAF3DD6EA69E36A09CB66BA3D067353EB3896DF2FB68559E5F22F97231B810A872FE033913830CDE78C91042DE15A9358D18A1A10ACAD4E56","orcidId":"0000-0002-2091-0031","documentHash":"40b4c4b9-b661-4e59-b5e3-d0657fe43aeb"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19106318"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fractional calculus","Caputo derivative","generalized Fourier law","fractional thermoelasticity","stress intensity factor","Laplace transform","Hankel transform","Fourier cosine transform","Mittag-Leffler function"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","uid":"bHvub0W7DW61k4FKLYJQ3Zw","uuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","parentUuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","rootUuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Długosza w Częstochowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c8878c28a0473c3a66","5e709240878c28a0473926a3","5e709240878c28a04739262b","5e7092ea878c28a04739f190"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","uid":"bnV99khMVeG3t9dh4evZESg","uuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","parentUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","rootUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","name":"Politechnika Koszalińska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b1878c28a04739ae75"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"An External Circular Crack in an Infinite Solid under Axisymmetric Heat Flux Loading in the Framework of Fractional Thermoelasticity","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477ae1","mniswId":"5774","title":"Entropy","doi":null,"issn":"1099-4300","eissn":null,"websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy/","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"638eb9ba-50e2-4e43-b715-ac1566328498"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61e818772467f05e29679192","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709240878c28a04739262b","5e7094c8878c28a0473c3a66","5e709240878c28a0473926a3","5e7092ea878c28a04739f190","5e7092b1878c28a04739ae75"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In a real solid there are different types of defects.

Literature sources related to the methods of synthesis of substituted acyl thioureas and acyl thiosemicarbazides were systematized and analyzed. The main approaches for the formation of these compounds are revealed: stepwise formation from carboxylic acids, through acyl chlorides and acyl isothiocyanates followed by nucleophilic addition of amines or hydrazides of carboxylic acids (\"one-pot synthesis\"), nucleophilic addition of amines or hydrazides of carboxylic acids directly to acyl isothiocyanates and parallel microwave synthesis using acyl isothiocyanates and amines as reagents. The possibility of their use as ligands for the formation of complex compounds with transition metal ions was discussed. In the review biological activity of these structures, namely antimicrobial, fungicidal, antitumor, antiviral, antifungal and other activities was detailazed.\n\nConclusions. The basic approaches to the synthesis of substituted acylthuoureas and acyl thiosemicarbazides which include the application of carboxylic acids, their derivatives (acyl halides and isothiocyanates) and N-nucleophiles as initial compounds were discussed. It was shown that aforementioned class of the compounds reveals the versatile biological activity and are promising for further structural modification aimed to the search of novel drugs"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124558","journalIssue":{"objectId":"628dd7934097077624491a7d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"2(36)","doi":"","documentHash":"fdf0cabb-80c0-45af-b998-65889cd5f5e5"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"56-71","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/sr_pharm/article/download/255738/252972","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"628df80a40970776244b480a","name":"Sergiy","lastName":"Kovalenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8017-9108","documentHash":"b8a78d83-a669-433a-9848-83a1cabd9623"},{"objectId":"628df80a40970776244b4809","name":"Olena","lastName":"Kholodniak","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0518-4262","documentHash":"bbe3a8e3-68c9-4dff-a0ca-0f1632216b46"}],"doi":"10.15587/2519-4852.2022.255738"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["digital workforce","organisational performance","Road Accident Fund","Gauteng province","South Africa"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"628d2f564097074a65908ff7","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Vaal University of Technology","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["628d2f564097074a65908ff9"]},{"id":"628d2f564097074a65908ff8","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Mancosa College","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["628d2f564097074a65908ffa"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"An exploratory study into the impact of digital workforce on organisational performance at the road accident fund","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5ec007c2ad49b31ccedb5abf","mniswId":null,"title":"ScienceRise: Pedagogical Education","doi":null,"issn":"2519-4976","eissn":"2519-4984","websiteLink":"http://journals.uran.ua/sr_edu","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"b5d3c2ec-f4f4-445e-b371-83bda1950cfb"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-31","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"628d2f564097074a65908ff6","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["628d2f564097074a65908ff9","628d2f564097074a65908ffa"]},"issue":"2(47)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Digital workforce is the future for all organisations. An organisation needs to move to the direction of automation to ensure that organisational performance is improved to an optimal level. A digital workforce will ensure that there is increased data quality and validation. The automation process will reduce the time it takes for employees to process their work. Beyond automation, the ‘gig economy’ is also reshaping work arrangements in key service sectors, making the informal-formal dualism, which is common in labour markets of developing countries. The purpose of the research was to investigate the impact of digital workforce on organizational performance at the Road Accident Fund in Gauteng province. The researchers endeavour to explore and understand how the digital workforce impact organizational performance. This research was conducted via a qualitative approach with the subject of insider’s viewpoint. This study used 10 subjects as the sample size. When assessing the reasons behind the impact of digital workforce on organizational performance it was identified, that employee training should be prioritized for the digital workforce to be successful. Findings from the research highlighted that there is a lot of work to be done to ensure that employees are digitally equipped, and that the organization should invest in technologies that adapt to the digital environment. Having realized that the digital workforce does positively impact organizational performance the study submits the following recommendations: the Road Accident Fund to develop a digital workplace strategy that will clearly outline and define business objectives and technology priorities, provide employees with necessary training and communication on the benefits of the digital workforce, the Road Accident Fund should establish performance metrics to establish alignment to business and technology strategies and the Road Accident Fund in Gauteng province should establish automation capabilities"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124561","journalIssue":{"objectId":"628d2c304097074a6590861a","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"2(47)","doi":"","documentHash":"5efff722-03c9-45a1-b283-0ee2098017ec"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"4-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/sr_edu/article/download/254458/252273","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"628d2f564097074a65908ffa","name":"Gavaza Tlangelani Mirelda","lastName":"Baloyi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2dab1362-b744-4475-9e38-f93d50cf778a"},{"objectId":"628d2f564097074a65908ff9","name":"Jeremiah","lastName":"Madzimure","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6122-3975","documentHash":"6619964c-adfe-49a5-be5b-caec418b1491"}],"doi":"10.15587/2519-4984.2022.254458"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["logistic system of scientific research","metformin","dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors","SGLT2 inhibitors"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61a48c5d2467f00d7d8b34df","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Ukrainian National University of Pharmacy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["628df5a040970776244afe89","628df5a040970776244afe88","628df5a040970776244afe85","628df5a040970776244afe84","628df5a040970776244afe87","628df5a040970776244afe86"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Status and analysis of trends in the metformin -based drug development: formation of the logistic system of scientific research","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa81c9aff2974850cc6b","mniswId":"29703","title":"SCIENCERISE: PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCE","doi":null,"issn":"2519-4852","eissn":null,"websiteLink":"http://journals.uran.ua/sr_pharm","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"fa974751-179b-4d0e-90e3-97c8c7b8a4ca"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"628df5a040970776244afe82","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["628df5a040970776244afe84","628df5a040970776244afe85","628df5a040970776244afe86","628df5a040970776244afe87","628df5a040970776244afe88","628df5a040970776244afe89"]},"issue":"2(36)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the work is analysis of the current state and trends in the metformin-based drug development with the subsequent formation of the logistics system of scientific research.\n\nMaterials and methods.

Male factors contribute to infertility in approximately 50% of couples who fail to conceive. Seminal plasma consists of secretions from different accessory glands containing a mixture of various cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, which together can induce a local immune response that might impact on a male’s as well as a female’s fertility. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G expression has been suggested as an immunomodulatory molecule that influences pregnancy outcome. The HLA-G gene encodes either membrane-bound or/and soluble proteins. The aim of this study was the evaluation of HLA-G polymorphisms and their impact on soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) production. We tested the HLA-G polymorphism in three positions: rs1632947: c.-964G>A; rs1233334: c.-725G>C/T in the promoter region; rs371194629: c.∗65_∗66insATTTGTTCATGCCT in the 3′ untranslated region. We tested two cohorts of men: 663 who participated in in vitro fertilization (test material was blood or sperm), and 320 fertile controls who possessed children born after natural conception (test material was blood). Since 50% of men visiting assisted reproductive clinics have abnormal semen parameters, we wondered if men with normal sperm parameters differ from those with abnormal parameters in terms of HLA-G polymorphism and secretion of sHLA-G into semen. We found that certain rs1632947-rs1233334-rs371194629 HLA-G haplotypes and diplotypes were associated with male infertility, while others were protective. Normozoospermic men with the A-C-del haplotype and A-C-del/A-C-del diplotype secreted the most sHLA-G into semen (574.1 IU/mL and 1047.0 IU/mL, respectively), while those with the G-C-ins haplotype and G-C-ins/G-C-ins diplotype – the least (80.8 IU/mL and 75.7 IU/mL, respectively). Men with the remaining haplotypes/diplotypes secreted sHLA-G at an intermediate level. However, only in one haplotype, namely G-C-ins, did we observe strong significant differences in the concentration of sHLA-G in the semen of men with teratozoospermia compared to men with normal sperm parameters (p = 0.009). In conclusion, fertile men differ in the profile of HLA-G polymorphism from men participating in IVF. Among all HLA-G haplotypes, the most unfavorable for male fertility is the G-C-ins haplotype, which determines the secretion of the lowest concentration of the soluble HLA-G molecule. This haplotype may reduce sperm parameters."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124585","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.791399/full","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"658bece34097076c1452d4a7","name":"Michał","lastName":"Radwan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5ce34673-9337-4c41-962e-1ba8ba8a31d9"},{"objectId":"658bece34097076c1452d4a6","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Krasiński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c0c5b14e-d2ef-40a1-b266-8581388d1640"},{"objectId":"658bece34097076c1452d4a3","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Radwan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e77df6c9-2564-4e61-a682-314b2a25526c"},{"objectId":"6164f32875234017e0524997","name":"KAROLINA","lastName":"PIEKARSKA","uuid":"217DE3C527CA931DC7DC1E56364D30FB0384C8C7E77B958302E52107EE9783D9439B24668ADB1193523778557E7249790235EE42A9FFDB05382092642A724B64","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fd1d7a09-bfc0-4b2d-a100-83651e62aa35"},{"objectId":"5fdecaf6085dcb71a319c15f","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Tarnowska","uuid":"72627C9DB32380F640F2466929F37D465E91DD90C16226DB4D30C0E8BD35C67CE04FB2D085B5F683025D1FB54894D9DE2439EFB95E967D5D3CB8D0F29C1D512A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"69e32842-14d4-4431-8d2a-fd7f4ff835a8"},{"objectId":"5e7092e3878c28a04739ec2e","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Wilczyński","uuid":"C294094E93841F2E9D409915D88369A5D6A9D068FAAE97078CAA91DA13D131C1E78F58B701720DBA392ADCE2106236F11CED3BB7A0B7E8AC52E84017C0646738","orcidId":"0000-0002-2072-6533","documentHash":"3dfd96c6-2251-4cdc-878a-ee0ff630c868"},{"objectId":"5e7092e2878c28a04739ea38","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Malinowski","uuid":"8723981BA450340EBBE40E6CBA86D7F1FCE770F207342961959B89AB70B736BBEE1BA54B60C816BA29E45855535C5C6EB7661499FD39497BF5585A8F04093537","orcidId":"0000-0002-3129-1504","documentHash":"b38ad99c-6cc3-445f-bdef-957dc2f9bded"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397e2d","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Wiśniewski","uuid":"489DAC5CD05DEC1FBDA3D6BC6F2E1493801C8B6FD374BEB16EC45425A63859C6558C425C61CE47B27E5762C48F153DD49056CBC89AE2B436B3D518161A85FB98","orcidId":"0000-0002-1919-2298","documentHash":"7acec92d-3d9b-4bb4-b38c-d8ac9bd46400"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397e07","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"057AE5361F47CBB51BBE9BCD6AD75C532EB231E4FC2A3F5EFE9D3CEF5033B41882197D9CFB33A85B0F1FF2667A8C17A98E8709AADE888B2CF4782F113075E85A","orcidId":"0000-0002-9127-1089","documentHash":"15bc27a7-55ee-4e2c-b646-08fd85ead078"}],"doi":"10.3389/fimmu.2021.791399"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["zarządzanie środowiskowym łańcuchem dostaw","praktyki współpracy środowiskowej","technologie tele-informatyczne","zielony łańcuch dostaw"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["environmental supply chain management","environmental collaboration practices","ICT","green supply chain"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"ICT Utilization in Supply Chain Environmental Collaboration Practices as the Moderator of Firms’ Financial Performance","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","doi":null,"issn":"2071-1050","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"76492123-acbe-4743-a4ae-6a63f3108e24"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-15","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61e6aa7a2467f00287f16345","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709408878c28a0473b51fe"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The purpose of this study is to verify whether increasing the intensity of ICT utilization\r\nin environmental collaboration practices (ECPs) in the supply chain has a positive impact on firms’\r\nfinancial performance (FP).

The disease causes yield and quality losses as a result of a decrease in photosynthesis efficiency due to the appearance of necrotic spots on the leaf surface. The development of these typical Ramularia leaf spot symptoms is thought to be linked with the release of phytotoxic secondary metabolites called rubellins in the host. However, to date, neither the biosynthetic pathways leading to the production of these metabolites nor their exact role in disease development are known. Using a combined in silico genetic and biochemistry approach, we interrogated the genome of R. collo-cygni to identify a putative rubellin biosynthetic gene cluster. Here we report the identification of a gene cluster containing homologues of genes involved in the biosynthesis of related anthraquinone metabolites in closely related fungi. A putative pathway to rubellin biosynthesis involving the genes located on the candidate cluster is also proposed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124597","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6246c4aa2467f0368b8993cf","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"23","number":"7","doi":null,"documentHash":"494b5e23-ace2-42c6-91a6-1e55ad57ee78"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"3475","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/7/3475/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"628ddd42409707762449480a","name":"Francois","lastName":"Dussart","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4774-458X","documentHash":"9ef57049-c913-4d17-82b9-20dd34a89d9f"},{"objectId":"5ebee726752340254fc4521a","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Jakubczyk","uuid":"6C511026023B9FF2E1E85C5F49962777066F634AB020855B0F76D06D29A117B97A41EA7E4F801E63DB47A421FB04655E408ED325C4BF0792E6DBB30C86F6FA75","orcidId":"0000-0003-4825-2031","documentHash":"f7f1ab5c-b570-48ea-8fcb-7f7efa5d8494"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms23073475"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["601b96b79543c74f831552b4","5e70921c878c28a0473900c3","5e709425878c28a0473b72be"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Chemical and microbiological changes on the surface of microplastic after long term exposition to different concentrations of ammonium in the environment","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","doi":null,"issn":"0048-9697","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"536a2e2c-aae7-4edb-84d0-5d817a2d0285"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"628e347340970776244e0710","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["601b96b79543c74f831552b4","5e709425878c28a0473b72be","5e70921c878c28a0473900c3"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058124607","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6246bcb82467f0368b8963b5","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"830","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"dd8d717e-83a9-405e-b961-c47422fd37a6"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"830","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0048969722018770?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"601b96b79543c74f831552b4","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Jachimowicz","uuid":"08589F2F51DC589C8144478A2BC9707879D25770D37D799CB445FD0572E0B132F3E4707E8473F2360DBA0186352448FE00380EE83FAEFA3170BE405E18302910","orcidId":"0000-0003-4409-569X","documentHash":"4b16e59d-b762-4551-92d0-b9e8940859a3"},{"objectId":"5e709425878c28a0473b72be","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Nosek","uuid":"9187C89B5DE1E6483F49AFA1DC10B7124100075FF2B56569E12330CDE81B5278C9880FDED1DFF3A2D61D0EFA6665FC5D6A3D0F159D5163014DE6BFE16E7A5188","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"587c7d56-1bbf-42ea-8cd3-07d68756105f"},{"objectId":"5e70921c878c28a0473900c3","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Cydzik-Kwiatkowska","uuid":"08ED4966C59E8C406CFD45896036933B3489A7FAAF4FB7724EC7D1B9D89604F441B7A194423D10D7654053FB10833CA2C79C1B4A925B18871CD801468480DE16","orcidId":"0000-0002-8710-8297","documentHash":"ee311874-2b54-4e1c-9d81-eb2381b568b2"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154784"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Nanoscale multilayer coatings","H+ irradiation","Density functional theory","Positron annihilation","Radiation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","uid":"bdkLR6wGCrp59lwUjwb_dMA","uuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","parentUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","rootUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","name":"Instytut Fizyki Jądrowej im.

One of the promising directions in the development of materials that are resistant to radiation damage and have improved physical and mechanical properties is the creation of nanoscale multilayer coatings (NMCs). The paper is devoted to the experimental comprehension of changes in the defect structure and mechanical properties of nanoscale multilayer coatings (NMCs) with alternating layers of Zr and Nb under irradiation. Series of Zr/Nb NMCs with different thicknesses of individual layers were fabricated by magnetron sputtering and subjected to H+ irradiation. The evolution of structure and phase states, as well as the defect state under proton irradiation, was studied using the methods of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES), and positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS). The layer-by-layer analysis of structural defects was carried out by Doppler broadening spectroscopy (DBS) using a variable-energy positron beam. To estimate the binding energy and the energy paths for the hydrogen diffusion in Zr/Nb NMCs, calculations from the first principles were used. When the thickness of individual layers is less than 25 nm, irradiation causes destruction of the interfaces, but there is no significant increase in the defect level, the S parameter (open volume defects amount) before and after irradiation is practically unchanged. After irradiation of NMC Zr/Nb with a thickness of layers 50 and 100 nm, the initial microstructure is retained, and the S parameter is significantly reduced. The GDOES data reveal the irregular H accumulation at the interface caused by significant differences in H diffusion barriers in the bulk of Zr and Nb multilayers as well as near the interface’s region."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124610","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"3332","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/9/3332/htm","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"628f5c3b409707500aad8a3f","name":"Vladimir","lastName":"Uglov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"47f88ff9-d012-40fa-9a93-38f2baf2a1cf"},{"objectId":"628f5c3b409707500aad8a3e","name":"Aleksandr","lastName":"Doroshkevich","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6510-8683","documentHash":"3e7f2373-1287-49c9-abce-1d53d3418fbb"},{"objectId":"628f5c3b409707500aad8a3c","name":"Sergei","lastName":"Ognev","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0f7cc5dd-59e9-4aec-8236-02ca95a3b194"},{"objectId":"628f5c3b409707500aad8a3b","name":"Anton","lastName":"Lomygin","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0297-0070","documentHash":"318dabbf-c1fd-4425-95bb-3201c709327a"},{"objectId":"628f5c3b409707500aad8a3a","name":"Dmitriy","lastName":"Krotkevich","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1630-8590","documentHash":"61f49c91-40fe-4b77-847f-9862d2c87e83"},{"objectId":"628f5c3b409707500aad8a39","name":"Leonid","lastName":"Svyatkin","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8544-031X","documentHash":"6460e3ff-f1f5-4b11-9267-4488063821fd"},{"objectId":"628f5c3b409707500aad8a38","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Pushilina","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"077bf1f8-c472-4a13-9cbe-ad17f6e9cfd8"},{"objectId":"628f5c3b409707500aad8a37","name":"Ekaterina","lastName":"Stepanova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4196-3191","documentHash":"18d7eeac-d951-4a8f-8643-420d09a6b86e"},{"objectId":"628f5c3a409707500aad8a36","name":"Roman","lastName":"Laptev","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-5248-2839","documentHash":"6512d00e-45a2-418c-8be5-2c54db2c6371"},{"objectId":"5e709298878c28a047398af6","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Siemek","uuid":"EB7D28D71BCF1C3E44F88D31CF8CEB0F4D580ED89DDA43F60DCCA78CC5626BF51A65320F9F139DC2E49912E60CD085AB577F55B13E8ADAC534CDC36A02F91DA8","orcidId":"0000-0001-8345-1066","documentHash":"7de10339-23b1-4dcd-a2f0-fc67617525df"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15093332"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["climate and ocean change;","sustainable development;","climate and ocean literacy;","effective knowledge communication and education;","EU4Ocean coalition"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","uid":"bay00B_u7_wv6na4otT7gZQ","uuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","parentUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deba","rootUuid":"3fae57f2-3c7e-4c20-a40b-d36335725b69","name":"Instytut Oceanologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a651c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A Blueprint for Ocean Literacy: EU4Ocean","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","doi":null,"issn":"2071-1050","eissn":"2071-1050","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"46882d20-8996-4dde-bd15-7d5f8ecc797a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-14","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"622872c62467f0086c9c078a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a651c","622872c62467f0086c9c078d","622872c62467f0086c9c078e"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, we discuss the importance of the efficient communication of science results to citizens across the world.

It was observed that there is a decrease in lipofuscin fluorescence above the age of 75 years and in the early stages of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The purpose of this study was to investigate the response of lipofuscin isolated from human RPE and lipofuscin-laden cells to visible light, and to determine whether an abundant component of lipofuscin, docosahexaenoate (DHA), can contribute to lipofuscin fluorescence upon oxidation. Exposure of lipofuscin to visible light leads to a decrease in its long-wavelength fluorescence at about 610 nm, with a concomitant increase in the short-wavelength fluorescence. The emission spectrum of photodegraded lipofuscin exhibits similarity with that of oxidized DHA. Exposure of lipofuscin-laden cells to light leads to a loss of lipofuscin granules from cells, while retaining cell viability. The spectral changes in fluorescence in lipofuscin-laden cells resemble those seen during photodegradation of isolated lipofuscin. Our results demonstrate that fluorescence emission spectra, together with quantitation of the intensity of long-wavelength fluorescence, can serve as a marker useful for lipofuscin quantification and for monitoring its oxidation, and hence useful for screening the retina for increased oxidative damage and early AMD-related changes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124622","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e579c92467f0034f10b860","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"23","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"b1078b89-a408-4c2f-8ca0-ee3b3d3a31b7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"id. 922","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/2/922/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61e6edb02467f030e8c44b15","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Różanowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e40f5353-5b67-423c-8f10-3d8a36ad3b97"},{"objectId":"5e709291878c28a0473981c2","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Różanowski","uuid":"2E67CDBFB59BDF75F1A9B1858705C1C2C5DB37E28517C49F9B7FA5CF1332783801AFD4EFFB3950195694CA2383274D916AD748CAD3B95DA32F1DC910140914F5","orcidId":"0000-0002-6362-1758","documentHash":"010c3847-2c64-4539-b1a8-cbd03f91658d"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms23020922"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["G protein-biasedμ-opioid receptor agonists","addictive behaviors","molecular modeling"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","parentUuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","rootUuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Some μ-opioid receptor agonists with G protein bias, including SR compounds, were proposed to induce diminished side effects. However, in many aspects, behavioral effects of those compounds, as well as the mechanisms underlying differences in their action, remain unexplored. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of SR-14968 and SR-17018, highly G protein-biased opioid agonists, on antinociception, motor activity and addiction-like behaviors in C57BL/6J mice. The obtained results showed that the compounds induce strong and dose-dependent antinociception. SR-14968 causes high, and SR-17018 much lower, locomotor activity. Both agonists develop reward-associated behavior and physical dependence. The compounds also cause antinociceptive tolerance, however, developing more slowly when compared to morphine. Interestingly, SR compounds, in particular SR-17018, slow down the development of antinociceptive tolerance to morphine and inhibit some symptoms of morphine withdrawal. Therefore, our results indicate that SR agonists possess rewarding and addictive properties, but can positively modulate some symptoms of morphine dependence. Next, we have compared behavioral effects of SR-compounds and PZM21 and searched for a relationship to the substantial differences in molecular interactions that these compounds form with the µ-opioid receptor."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124625","journalIssue":{"objectId":"622a092b2467f024e7cc7628","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"3723d39a-192e-4ea1-a10d-8a976a9425d5"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"55","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/14/1/55/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"622a08d12467f024e7cc7510","name":"Łucja","lastName":"Kudła","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7767772d-ea23-435d-bcee-5035a7108a30"},{"objectId":"622a08d12467f024e7cc750d","name":"Łucja","lastName":"Wiktorowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f87aabfe-269e-47b4-9b01-8d43e2c0bfde"},{"objectId":"5e7094d6878c28a0473c4ef9","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Bojarski","uuid":"75FF0070CEF615B971556934EFE57031B3C5EAE1F8D9D09D81135AA1C3DB987778F8B529C452B528AA9DBD73D436B2D667E8733DAB866A7BFD97A0505802CE96","orcidId":"0000-0003-1417-6333","documentHash":"56984a71-79b9-43cd-ba94-dd05049dada6"},{"objectId":"5e7094d4878c28a0473c4dbf","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Bugno","uuid":"4554489CE6B41F11D21A3136D97B3F5697EE1801C5D8967FDBF836F460A9E8F0E7B31CA69E787C4AF75131932524255D49D4055F02FFAA423B5F888265A0BED8","orcidId":"0000-0003-3741-674X","documentHash":"3251dd6c-6a4c-4cf6-bc88-4bed8fbf9368"},{"objectId":"5e709328878c28a0473a3cde","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Szumiec","uuid":"B3F198ECE1E1CF9567D3949163BC995A5614650BC5FE279230A6B77D414ABE28A7F847F77B24107709C06DDE87C6E5A20037B263174FCF7B55C9ABD6144D19AB","orcidId":"0000-0001-8962-1273","documentHash":"fcaa9ffa-ce6e-4eae-a8a5-dae20915254a"},{"objectId":"5e709325878c28a0473a3a30","name":"Sabina","lastName":"Podlewska","uuid":"824C20FDB2B1CBB364147E80CEC50D39B3E0763EE794464F5CEA27D8929429C0732786EAD0AC4EF7B814D475FDC1CEFF9F32EA1998557C6929649D710DA6CF98","orcidId":"0000-0002-2891-5603","documentHash":"5bb586ca-58d9-4c82-9587-a2e2f8efd4da"},{"objectId":"5e709312878c28a0473a2450","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Przewłocki","uuid":"A7F008213E824DB889EC7373C76D51BFF7CA319D30FDF2179E4286AF023C39D6B4DC2A08FC8B8A24E05543297DD8D0F2DF25E067B0B334F57AC65A270A9274CC","orcidId":"0000-0003-4606-1629","documentHash":"d7775f55-f886-44ce-a7dd-e8df1e359871"}],"doi":"10.3390/pharmaceutics14010055"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Blume–Emery–Griffiths model","pair approximation method","Magnetic properties","magnetocaloric effect (MCE)","first-order phase transitions"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Blume–Emery–Griffiths model for a magnetic bilayer.

For such cases the magnetization, quadrupolar moment and magnetic entropy, as well as the isothermal entropy change and the adiabatic temperature change during demagnetization process are calculated. It is shown that in the vicinity of the temperature corresponding to the 1st order phase transitions the adiabatic demagnetization is not possible. Instead, the demagnetization process with the smallest entropy production is proposed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124636","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"549","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304885321011653","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709366878c28a0473a8d30","name":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Balcerzak","uuid":"3BEF651FE74950A21193EB94E0DF3AC4A93D8990ED31FCC6C1C93019B365C0483ADC16300598E1A2181C60DD325187C18931E4F9CAAB290EF11D3469C49B7851","orcidId":"0000-0001-7267-992X","documentHash":"23aed1a5-44f9-4737-be60-250443e72f39"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jmmm.2021.168968"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["acute general cooling","sodium diclofenac","etoricoxib","darbufelone mesylate","kidneys","liver","heart","cold stress"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61a48c5d2467f00d7d8b34df","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Ukrainian National University of Pharmacy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["628df75240970776244b4117","628df75240970776244b4116","628df75240970776244b4119","628df75240970776244b4118","628df75240970776244b411a"]},{"id":"5e7091d6878c28a04738c1e3","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"V.

The results of the previous studies have demonstrated the pronounced frigoprotective properties of certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, primarily diclofenac sodium, etoricoxib, darbufelone mesylate, under the conditions of acute general cooling.\n\nThe aim of the study: to investigate the effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with various mechanisms of action on the course of the stress reaction, the functional state of the kidneys, liver, and heart using the model of acute general cooling.\n\nMaterials and Methods: The experiment was carried out using 35 outbreed male rats weighing 256±5 g. The studied drugs were administered intragastrically 30 minutes before cold injury modelling: diclofenac sodium at a dose of 7 mg/kg, etoricoxib at a dose of 5 mg/kg, darbufelone mesylate at a dose of 20 mg/kg. Acute general cooling was induced by exposure at –18 °C for 2 hours. The efficacy of the studied drugs was evaluated by the values as follows: the body temperature (measured rectally), the course of a stress reaction according to the criteria of “the stress triad”, the functional state of the kidney and liver according to the changes in the blood serum biochemical parameters, the functional state of the heart according to the electrocardiogram.\n\nResults: It was found that etoricoxib and darbufelone mesylate, and especially diclofenac sodium, demonstrate frigoprotective properties, reducing the severity of hypothermia, have stress-protective activity and a beneficial effect on the functional state of the kidneys. All investigated non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs prevent a decrease in myocardial contractility (by the effect on the systolic index) and lengthening of the QT interval caused by acute cold injury. Diclofenac sodium, unlike etoricoxib and darbufelone mesylate, does not enhance the effect of acute general cooling on intraventricular conduction. Under acute exposure to cold, no significant changes in the functional state of the liver were observed, including the groups receiving the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines.\n\nConclusions: The prophylactic administration of the arachidonic acid cascade inhibitors, especially the non-selective COX-2 inhibitor diclofenac sodium, reduces the severity of the stress response, contributes to the maintenance of the renal and cardiac function. There are no significant changes in the functional state of the liver under conditions of the experiment"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124653","journalIssue":{"objectId":"628dd7934097077624491a7d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"2(36)","doi":"","documentHash":"fdf0cabb-80c0-45af-b998-65889cd5f5e5"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"46-55","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/sr_pharm/article/download/255797/252971","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"628df75240970776244b411b","name":"Denys","lastName":"Oklei","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-9509-3630","documentHash":"1eabadcc-137a-45a5-a80e-082fc7c3e773"},{"objectId":"628df75240970776244b411a","name":"Tetiana","lastName":"Yudkevych","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6173-2780","documentHash":"fc6442b6-7acf-49f1-b869-f4e740e5c2d9"},{"objectId":"628df75240970776244b4119","name":"Olga","lastName":"Tovchiga","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2038-4761","documentHash":"80d927c6-8404-4ee3-af01-9c4de9adb354"},{"objectId":"628df75240970776244b4118","name":"Olesia","lastName":"Kudina","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8080-2286","documentHash":"64197e74-07a7-4858-9302-c4d1e965950b"},{"objectId":"628df75240970776244b4117","name":"Olga","lastName":"Koiro","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6190-4041","documentHash":"97a1b8af-7710-4b53-bcfb-459a180c1f8d"},{"objectId":"628df75240970776244b4116","name":"Sergiy","lastName":"Shtrygol’","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7257-9048","documentHash":"e09b18f9-888f-4a5b-aa09-af8d92a308ab"}],"doi":"10.15587/2519-4852.2022.255797"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["university","non-formal education","sustainable development","the climate change","waste management","biodiversity"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61a0db0e2467f0113354d68e","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Poltava V.

The \"Third mission\" of universities - education outside the classroom - is an actively developing movement in advanced countries, providing individuals with opportunities for self-development, self-realization, gaining new knowledge and practical experience. Understanding the \"third\" mission is an important component of success, as the social activities significantly increase the competitiveness of educational institutions in the educational services market. At this difficult time, when Ukrainian educational institutions are recovering from the Cowid-19 pandemic and Russian troops are deliberately destroying key civilian infrastructure, educators are gaining a unique opportunity to test new ways of transmitting knowledge, skills and attitudes. Non-formal education has an opportunity to implement multidisciplinary knowledge and skills directly in communities, shaping this way the values of a democratic society. This publication aims at assessing the achievements of the Carpathian School educational project and discussing ways to further develop multidisciplinary programs in response to the social demands of local communities.\n\nThe issues of non-formal education are extremely important for Ukraine, especially in martial law, when uncertainty in the formation of the social consciousness of citizens is exacerbated by global political, economic and environmental challenges.\n\nThe case study of the International Carpathian School gives the practice of organizing non-formal education. The Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv together with partner universities, NGOs and National Nature Parks, organized the School on the border of Ivano-Frankivsk and Chernivtsi regions, in the centre of the Hutsul land. The existing network of universities, strengthened by public organizations, government and business institutions, has good prospects for establishing educational programs to support sustainable development (SD) in the Carpathian region.

The study’s results were used to improve the technology and determine the levels of application of plant-derived extracts with antioxidant properties in the production of boiled sausages. The effect of plant extracts with antioxidant properties on oxidative processes in boiled sausages has been investigated. Camel meat contains phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium. This meat has a large content of vitamins A, B1, B2, C, and E. In terms of protein content (15.1 %), camel is inferior to beef; in terms of fat (11.5 %), it is inferior to other types of meat. However, camel meat is rich in vitamins and trace elements. In addition, the composition of camel meat contains phosphorus, 216‒234 mg, which is higher than that of beef.\n\nThe disadvantage of boiled camel sausages is a short shelf life. Therefore, it was decided to add plant-based supplements with antioxidant properties. In addition, to ensure minimal lipolytic changes and changes in lipid oxidation in meat, the rational concentration of added antioxidants was determined. Using the response surface methodology, a three-level factor plan was constructed for two variables – the concentration of ginger root powder and sea buckthorn powder. The minimum acid number was manifested at 0.018 % of ginger root powder and 0.035 % of sea buckthorn powder. The minimum peroxide number was obtained at 0.028 % of the L-root of ginger and 0.010 % of the powder of sea buckthorn; the minimum TBARS was detected at 0.030 % of the powder of ginger root and 0.050 % of the powder of sea buckthorn. The concentration of ginger root powder with optimal resistance to oxidation and lipolysis is proposed.

The analysis conducted by using of structural equation modelling showed that task resources are associated with the three basic psychological needs more strongly than two other kinds of resources and that that both leadership and interpersonal resources were related to the satisfaction and frustration of all the needs to the same extent. The results are discussed in the paradigm of the Conservative of Resources and the Self Determination theories."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124670","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"Nr artykułu: 6302","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/10/6302/htm","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a0b","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Najmiec","uuid":"92486154B99F0E2BD1718CBFD6211A806C4A6683A18757938D6217ACE6B22EB4D50335283BB69A720ADC41AB14D60C74104D306726037F2D3F133CE74B4459EA","orcidId":"0000-0002-7712-4488","documentHash":"bd2c085e-9ac3-4854-8c14-46ce1e4b2b20"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af8a5","name":"Monika","lastName":"Prusik","uuid":"7E0A7F4B02BB15098224ECAC00B219CE5B49B95AC3B361D38884C10F882ED60E920BAA4D37A374E3905C6ECD1CFBE713AD3485E01600952BB15622412CDFABD4","orcidId":"0000-0001-8552-9920","documentHash":"7c0aab40-70d0-41b4-8080-dc0a137c8841"},{"objectId":"5e709350878c28a0473a70fd","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Kapica","uuid":"2F4B7EDEDE6B54C2E385CBF991209B5DE6BEBD456996635F3D18B2D472D65DA171BA11E0732636C5D912CE662EF44C4029256C800217A587A88CCDAECAADFC36","orcidId":"0000-0001-7423-0608","documentHash":"79d9988b-59b6-4e0d-9118-56b65e62bcff"},{"objectId":"5e70932f878c28a0473a4866","name":"Michał","lastName":"Szulawski","uuid":"2F8278A1AA166EF6315DF7159FE436F9A09213D9062072E31321B10A4AEAF68E680D9D067532001D99934559C81862C96E7464CE5D5AFA856DE43A636DA32E43","orcidId":"0000-0001-8489-327X","documentHash":"52f04a1b-bc0c-4c61-b3b5-7efc7db37155"},{"objectId":"5e70923e878c28a047392503","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Baka","uuid":"17AF449183B54CDF1AAFF8A5033E5008A78E204B1886FF1984FEB2BB66F1E530C0C963FCE1D3DF8BC099E9D756754E7C8174DC0E23E0C02756C4647995BD3463","orcidId":"0000-0003-1173-9874","documentHash":"821eb9a5-10db-4ea5-a34e-70f87acceb2e"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19106302"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hydrgen","ethanol","catalyst"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A Promising Cobalt Catalyst for Hydrogen Production","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477568","mniswId":"3333","title":"Catalysts","doi":null,"issn":"2073-4344","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"467b91d9-8d0c-4cfd-ab42-eccbc898d26d"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6228800a2467f0086c9c52c1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709327878c28a0473a3c35","5e7093af878c28a0473af265","5e709327878c28a0473a3c1e","5e7092a5878c28a047399ce1"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this work, a metal cobalt catalyst was synthesized, and its activity in the hydrogen production process was tested.

The two grass–legume mixtures, consisting of Dactylis glomerata, Festulolium braunii and Trifolium pratense or Medicago x varia and grass mixture—Dactylis glomerata, Festulolium braunii and Lolium perenne, were sown on arable land. Silicon foliar and mineral NPK fertilization was applied in three variants: NPK (non-Si-fertilized), NPK+Si (Herbagreen), NPK+Si (Optysil). Changes in the botanical composition in the sward of mixtures during the study period were influenced by the competitiveness of individual plants and weather conditions, whereas the effect of foliar fertilization with silicon was only slightly marked. The nutritional value of individual species of grasses and legumes varied over the years and also depended on the application of silicon. The greatest content of crude protein (CP), irrespective of the species and variant of silicon fertilization, was noticed in years with no drought. Our research confirmed the beneficial effect of silicon fertilization, independent of weather conditions, on the CP content and on the reduction of crude fibre (CF), neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) in plants, especially when Herbagreen was applied. The nutritional value of the mixtures under applied silicon fertilization depended on botanical composition. In the conditions of low rainfall, a large share of F. braunii and an approximately 20% contribution of T. pratense resulted in a higher content of CP.

In particular, the relationship between efficiency and environmental balance under the policy support for small-scale family farms has not been widely established. Answering this question is important because small-scale farms are the basis for the functioning of agricultural sectors in many regions of the world. Such a situation takes place also in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), which, apart from some exceptions (e.g. the Czech Republic), are characterised by a fragmented agrarian structure. Hence, the article is an attempt to identify the connection between the economic and ecological performance of small-scale farming in five countries. As three countries under study belong to the European Union's agricultural support system and two are outside this system, the next target is to check whether farms in countries covered by the CAP showcase higher economic and environmental indicators. The study was based on surveys conducted in small-scale farms in Poland (710 farms), Lithuania (1000), Romania (900), Serbia and Moldova (550). To find the results, data envelopment analysis (DEA), single-factor analysis of variance (the ANOVA method) and linear ordering methods were used. Two main conclusions were drawn: First, regardless of the support system (EU vs. national), the researched farms are characterised by relatively low technical efficiency and relatively high environmental sustainability. Thus, it can be concluded that they are rather weak economically but environmentally friendly. Second, there are no statistically significant differences in the environmental balance and technical efficiency for farms in EU countries (Poland, Lithuania and Romania) and non-EU countries (Serbia and Moldova), despite the fact that the latter obtained significantly lower agricultural support."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124683","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"89","pagesFromTo":"235-247","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743016721003600?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709469878c28a0473bc7ea","name":"Marta","lastName":"Guth","uuid":"0AF454709C9C3866E8B083CD498A909569E45AA432F1EEFB4D2AD1B4E8A50C71DC3746EB1567E75D7F62FA13E94E68F9AFAC4AEE77CC2ADF973609E84AA30F5B","orcidId":"0000-0001-9332-1193","documentHash":"2fff21c6-e66b-4aa3-8bb4-78de536ffa5a"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473afeee","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Smędzik-Ambroży","uuid":"03894FE9E19BFBBE8323183E839A69C26BA42D6C12543E35250392BD387487596CA9327DE2B607001DD6429F1060165453BE30887E54B0E91AF722EA8C74176B","orcidId":"0000-0001-5228-2263","documentHash":"922abe5a-8bc4-41fd-b73d-b42e35e5ee5c"},{"objectId":"5e709245878c28a047392cf6","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Stępień","uuid":"3474945B3C5F405E2A0973289C602E8E4BEDA7DC9D53C9A8F6E90484AA7D435D4F31A650BEFEA7DC3452CD9A4B0B637EB1E5778570A8774E1746E9E53038DAA2","orcidId":"0000-0001-9475-8418","documentHash":"3623994a-3f67-44cb-abdb-cae0b4d3323c"},{"objectId":"5e709239878c28a047391f59","name":"Anna","lastName":"Matuszczak","uuid":"BC406944DA2F0495DD90D41B2233D7DE163E643FFB290F0525527B628C87480F793F1B2E63DB177C596B971D8D254936109BCBB8645D9267116A2C8B0CEB8D3F","orcidId":"0000-0002-5045-5447","documentHash":"cdfc0baf-fba8-44a2-abaf-3e93132809a0"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jrurstud.2021.11.026"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika

is one of the most abundant post-transcriptional modifications in RNA. We have previously shown that the FF99-derived parameters for pseudouridine and some of its naturally occurring derivatives in the AMBER distribution either alone or in combination with the revised gamma torsion parameters (parmbsc0) failed to reproduce their conformational characteristics observed experimentally (Deb et al. in J Chem Inf Model 54:1129-1142, 2014; Deb et al. in J Comput Chem 37:1576-1588, 2016; Dutta et al. in J Chem Inf Model 60:4995-5002, 2020). However, the application of the recommended bsc0 correction did lead to an improvement in the description not only of the distribution in the gamma torsional space but also of the sugar pucker distributions. In an earlier study, we examined the transferability of the revised glycosidic torsion parameters (chi(IDRP)) for psi to its derivatives. We noticed that although these parameters in combination with the AMBER FF99-derived parameters and the revised gamma torsional parameters resulted in conformational properties of these residues that were in better agreement with experimental observations, the sugar pucker distributions were still not reproduced accurately. Here we report a new set of partial atomic charges for pseudouridine, 1-methylpseudouridine, 3-methylpseudouridine and 2 '-O-methylpseudouridine and a new set of glycosidic torsional parameters (chi(ND)) based on chosen glycosidic torsional profiles that most closely corresponded to the NMR data for conformational propensities and studied their effect on the conformational distributions using REMD simulations at the individual nucleoside level. We have also studied the effect of the choice of water model on the conformational characteristics of these modified nucleosides. Our observations suggest that the current revised set of parameters and partial atomic charges describe the sugar pucker distributions for these residues more accurately and that the choice of a suitable water model is important for the accurate description of their conformational properties. We have further validated the revised sets of parameters by studying the effect of substitution of uridine with pseudouridine within single stranded RNA oligonucleotides on their conformational and hydration characteristics."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124704","journalIssue":{"objectId":"628df05640970776244a8879","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"36","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"cbd77bcb-ae7a-451d-8bea-52d5fe755d0a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"36","pagesFromTo":"205-224","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10822-022-00447-4.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"628df05640970776244a8876","name":"Ansuman","lastName":"Lahiri","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7398-4114","documentHash":"c5818e6a-6b40-4070-80d4-e058fba0066e"},{"objectId":"628df05640970776244a8875","name":"Indrajit","lastName":"Deb","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2722-582X","documentHash":"fddf98df-3514-4f75-8249-3d65033a929d"},{"objectId":"628df05640970776244a8874","name":"Nivedita","lastName":"Dutta","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8371-9007","documentHash":"c5c76380-deda-4e26-8261-b08af8d410fc"},{"objectId":"5e709495878c28a0473bfe89","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Sarzyńska","uuid":"8CC007A24EF3E1ED39AA215EE783B2933B814941DB10666AA93F80F70268B70A2E399E9CA4B44E093C9A5836D386B4690B2BFC3564F8B372B53985502A325401","orcidId":"0000-0002-0500-2238","documentHash":"8aa35ba4-1b24-46fc-8e5e-44e0e39ca73e"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10822-022-00447-4"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["TMJ","ankylosis","3DVSP","maxillofacial","reconstructive","surgery","cranio-maxillo-facial"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093e7878c28a0473b2fce"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Protocol for Multi-Stage Treatment of Temporomandibular Joint Ankylosis in Children and Adolescents","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c754","mniswId":"10517","title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2077-0383","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"11fb906d-8d54-4e42-be05-fb426fe7219b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-14","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62288f8c2467f0086c9d0490","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["662a4e4c40970762633a7aab","662a4e4c40970762633a7aac","662a4e4c40970762633a7aad","662a4e4c40970762633a7aae","662a4e4c40970762633a7aaf","662a4e4c40970762633a7ab0","662a4e4c40970762633a7ab1","5e7093e7878c28a0473b2fce","662a4e4c40970762633a7ab2","662a4e4c40970762633a7ab3"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Treatment of temporomandibular ankylosis is challenging and frequently leads to re-ankylosis, relapse, dangerous complications and, in turn, the need for multiple operations. In this article, we present a protocol for the treatment of ankylosis of the temporomandibular joints that assumes earlier intervention with the assistance of 3D virtual surgical planning (3DVSP) and custom biomaterials for better and safer surgical outcomes. Thirty-three patients were treated due to either uni- or bilateral temporomandibular ankylosis. Twenty individuals received temporomandibular prosthesis, whereas seventeen required simultaneous 3D virtual surgical/planned orthognathic surgery as the final correction of the malocclusion. All patients exhibited statistically significant improvements in mouth opening (from 1.21 ± 0.74 cm to 3.77 ± 0.46 cm) and increased physiological functioning of the mandible. Gap arthroplasty and aggressive rehabilitation prior to temporomandibular prosthesis (TMJP) placement were preferred over costochondral autografts. The use of 3DVSP and custom biomaterials enables more precise, efficient and safe procedures to be performed in the paediatric and adolescent population requiring treatment for temporomandibular ankylosis."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124706","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/11/2/428/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a4e4c40970762633a7ab3","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Myśliwiec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dea075de-fa55-4277-b804-4c906dc73d8b"},{"objectId":"662a4e4c40970762633a7ab2","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Roman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"10a99e2c-24e3-4591-aac8-cbdc71fe5625"},{"objectId":"662a4e4c40970762633a7ab1","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Kozakiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dbc7eb00-60d8-40f3-a6df-34019856ba47"},{"objectId":"662a4e4c40970762633a7ab0","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Szymor","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1d1198b7-7c92-4e5f-a466-713ffb0a53a9"},{"objectId":"662a4e4c40970762633a7aaf","name":"Jan","lastName":"Woś","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ac60d11b-9cbe-46fb-90bd-f15ebc7a4470"},{"objectId":"662a4e4c40970762633a7aae","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Dowgierd","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d9ac82eb-a230-4758-985c-00a15ec93988"},{"objectId":"662a4e4c40970762633a7aad","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kulesa-Mrowiecka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"85abaa85-eaae-4d3c-bb6f-819cfe31ecea"},{"objectId":"662a4e4c40970762633a7aac","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Pokrowiecki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6bfdb9d0-7db3-42c9-a57a-7066af72366a"},{"objectId":"662a4e4c40970762633a7aab","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Dowgierd","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9b397c89-7b0a-4e7f-bf0f-473b0818d36d"},{"objectId":"5e7093e7878c28a0473b2fce","name":"Anna","lastName":"Lipowicz","uuid":"92812D336C7097797F3426AE0B5C748BBE6C5742126726F14010B3D7A0D844530C89F1CAB4A3D1A298CB7A439950DCC84F1AF19B515983A940D992AFC909E9A2","orcidId":"0000-0002-9182-6953","documentHash":"4634821d-603c-48b8-a54e-d0d33777d414"}],"doi":"10.3390/jcm11020428"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Enzymy antyoksydacyjne","Kogutnica wiązowa (Colopha compressa)","Stres biotyczny","Torebnica wiązowa (Tetraneura ulmi)","Wiąz górski (Ulmus glabra Huds)"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","uid":"bz_6XXECFL3_CFkpms5BsDQ","uuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","parentUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","rootUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","name":"Uniwersytet w Siedlcach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709294878c28a04739851a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Variation of Selected Physiological Parameters in Elm Leaves (Ulmus glabra Huds.)

Because the trophic relationship of aphids and their galls shows that throughout the gall formation aphids can elicit multiple physiological regulations, we evaluated the changes of hydrogen peroxide content (H2O2), cytoplasmic membrane condition, expressed as electrolyte leakage (EL) and concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), as well as, the activity of catalase (CAT), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in gall tissues, as well as, in damaged and undamaged parts of galled leaves. All aphid species increased EL from gall tissues and significantly upregulated APX activity in galls and galled leaves. Alterations in H2O2 and TBARS concentrations, as well as GPX and CAT activities, were aphid- and tissue-dependent. The development of pseudo- and closed galls on elm leaves did not have a clear effect on the direction and intensity of the host plant's physiological response. The different modes of changes in H2O2, TBARS, CAT and GPX were found in true galls of C. compressa and T. ulmi. Generally, physiological alterations in new plant tissues were quite different compared to other tissues and could be considered beneficial to galling aphids."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124762","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e7d6632467f05e2961f3fe","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"11","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"d3f788bd-8bc4-46da-a86f-64fc6aa76c38"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/11/3/244","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709294878c28a04739851a","name":"Hubert","lastName":"Sytykiewicz","uuid":"1501D2206FDEA5EB4D52280DD843E0AB93C0C25801C8E53F9002EBA795466EC0E99E2D093E30991C1AC43F9A2226CFEAF1CB5E7007099C1DC013E7316E9C19AF","orcidId":"0000-0002-6540-0561","documentHash":"bfb34491-f2c4-41f2-9b4f-4159bba71653"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a0473909da","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Rubinowska","uuid":"549A916885044A0822AB474FED05E309D391C9A7671A69EA6D558072D5824641EE76445ADB35B1D80B267969B1C5F42F6B21BE9DE6E00B6A3A9DDCC6336E9B6C","orcidId":"0000-0002-8962-3452","documentHash":"2a932445-e88d-4d4b-bf23-79392bb6bac8"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390953","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Kot","uuid":"3B3891237FA9F86DB9FDEAFCA5638EE5DEF8C4DC2A3A14084B3E103B9BB2238E5776B6F6616799BBE40385F12106E0E4139400E5DA5542A5B8CC8640C620F555","orcidId":"0000-0002-9441-1139","documentHash":"d7a8e3f1-43da-486d-93a8-e763f5d243fe"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390943","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kmieć","uuid":"1B8D6FC0A5347DE0A64D279F60D338F3E317A171A3A606935E20CF014A664D1D7CBFCFDC4EEB1A68D0444EFD4955E5AFFDA9CE0ADE47A4FBEA5AC33AEFF0B639","orcidId":"0000-0003-2272-4512","documentHash":"72da6fa0-4444-44d6-8a65-a0eb8236f7f5"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a04739090a","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Górska-Drabik","uuid":"4DBD44ECDF03A2FC7C8A3C7C9EBDCAED5B2137F8DD64E8CA93185D364FFC1E40DE8E267FAB9F2B38CF982B7D4BABAF6A84AA1372F2D483C4D146AD69AE842736","orcidId":"0000-0001-9721-6796","documentHash":"8b296b63-f53d-4880-bf0f-1c661571da2c"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390906","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Golan","uuid":"DD1628E38CECD312D9EE1F78929C2A81E7F6089461607C7C64078C8B0115AF7B5EEA29E9354F8CC9D3F1E8C990A5FB2B737852BA13D4C5FC74111E405D8115EC","orcidId":"0000-0001-8425-9340","documentHash":"8edc752f-487e-4df0-bc26-9e62d2f265b0"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["imidazoles","aurones","triazoles","MTT","ADME","QSAR","DFT"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091ce878c28a04738a902","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in Kyiv.","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["628cc4994097074a658d10e9","628cc49a4097074a658d10ea"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The cytotoxic effect of some synthetic nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds on cultures of tumour and normal cells and the calculation of their ADME, QSAR, and DFT pharmacological properties","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"61f39d812467f061bc0cb388","mniswId":null,"title":"ScienceRise: Biological Science","doi":null,"issn":"2519-8017","eissn":"2519-8025","websiteLink":"http://journals.uran.ua/sr_bio","metadataSource":"USER","editor":null,"documentHash":"fcf533f0-dc27-433d-98ab-5d5438c80a53"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-07","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"628cc4994097074a658d10e7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["628cc4994097074a658d10e9","628cc49a4097074a658d10ea"]},"issue":"1(30)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The cytotoxic effect of several synthetic nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds on cultures of tumour and normal cells and the calculation of their ADME, QSAR, and DFT pharmacological properties\n\nThe aim. The purpose of our work was to investigate the cytotoxic influence of some synthetic nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, namely imidazole, aurones, and triazole on the culture of tumour cells of melanoma mouse B16, human glioma U251 and normal HEK293 and their ADME, QSAR, and DFT pharmacological properties calculation.\n\nMaterials and methods. The estimation of cell viability in the conditions of influence of the investigated drugs was carried out by MTT. ADME data screening was performed by the SWISSADME server. QSAR calculations were performed on Way2Drug servers (cancerogenicity was predicted with ROSC-Pred, metabolism – with RA, side effects of drugs were investigated using AdverPred server, LD50 were predicted with Gusar software). The calculation of the functional density (DFT) was carried out using B3LYP and the functional of the exchange-correlation with the base set of 6-31 G (D, P) in the MMFF94 force field in the Avogadro program.\n\nThe results. It was found that compounds 1 and 2 are toxic for normal cells HEK293, compounds 3, 4, 6 and 7 are low-toxic, and 5 does not inhibit cell growth at all. Our study has demonstrated that in the case of tumour cell line U251 compounds 2, 3 and 7 are non-toxic in general, and substances 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7 have significant toxicity. In a case of cancer cell line B16, compounds 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 are toxic, and compound 7 is cytotoxic at any concentration. The test compounds (1–7) possess drug-like properties. All compounds meet Lipinski’s “rule of five” criteria. The BOILED-Egg model demonstrates that compound 3 may penetrate blood-brain barrier, all compounds except 1 can be absorbed in the intestine, 2 and 5 can be cleaved in the gastrointestinal tract and 3, 4, 6, and 7 have resistance to digestive enzymes. The analysis of metabolism showed that these compounds can mainly be metabolized by mechanisms of N- and O-glucuronidation and C-oxidation. The obtained data indicate that the smallest toxic effect is achieved with intravenously introduced compounds, and the largest toxicity is achieved with oral administration for compounds 3, 4, 5 and 6. The compounds 1 and 3 are completely noncarcinogenic, the other compounds can affect thyroid glands and hematopoietic system. This result requires further research when introduced into practical application. DFT calculations have shown that all investigated compounds are stable and reactive.\n\nConclusions. Differences in the sensitivity of cell lines and dose-dependent effects of compounds detected during the study should be considered when calculating the optimal working concentrations of drugs. The results of the study are necessary to understand toxic effects on the cell lines B16, HEK293, and U251 and their further use for preclinical studies"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058124810","journalIssue":{"objectId":"628cb9f84097074a658c8670","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"1(30)","doi":"","documentHash":"c18db52e-97ce-401d-bfad-58b1b6318f80"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"26-37","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/sr_bio/article/download/256113/253345","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"628cc49a4097074a658d10ea","name":"Sergiy","lastName":"Yarmoluk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2e8bb6ed-abe5-4fea-95fa-6743ec29e1ad"},{"objectId":"628cc4994097074a658d10e9","name":"Vasyl","lastName":"Vdovin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"488d96b8-1281-4a7c-8d52-739db9b1ce2c"}],"doi":"10.15587/2519-8025.2022.256113"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918c878c28a04737e08c","uid":"bbip_kWUjcRWwim80LuSB4g","uuid":"92447067-30f0-4cec-82d0-68fd4d6f1c81","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","parentUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","rootUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","name":"Wydział Inżynierii Produkcji i Energetyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709306878c28a0473a154e","5e7093b3878c28a0473af66d","5e709428878c28a0473b744f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Effect of constant electric field stimulation of suspensions of selected microorganisms on geometric structure of cells","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a366","mniswId":"16681","title":"Przegląd Elektrotechniczny","doi":null,"issn":"0033-2097","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e0e94260-eb57-4929-9e8b-deee993cb9a0"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62946c164097070db832e61d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709306878c28a0473a154e","5e709428878c28a0473b744f","5e7093b3878c28a0473af66d"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058124815","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62946c164097070db832e623","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"98","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"ddba57dc-4e97-4b80-a168-7634760d3239"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"148-151","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://sigma-not.pl/publikacja-137357-2022-5.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709428878c28a0473b744f","name":"Anna","lastName":"Miernik","uuid":"31DCDF33BEC81675AB62F5DC7FCDC33AB27B639B130BE88074D7AEDAAEDB30C9DEF995F8BB1AB24F59CDBAC8810279788ED57D6BB338661DDFEC2904ADA5ED45","orcidId":"0000-0003-0394-9185","documentHash":"577f8cd9-6780-42f0-bce8-e6bb0c254d83"},{"objectId":"5e7093b3878c28a0473af66d","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Dróżdż","uuid":"262785E5DFF78FDD9E649849AC85A3C6A11C143E6644F7372F9E7801D7DF0433324741787A0038B541E288F2CE45392FD8372573EB1E24DE05FCAE139D5FF86F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6624-9798","documentHash":"00c6a644-f797-4cae-9d6c-f0cbc51d1d15"},{"objectId":"5e709306878c28a0473a154e","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Kiełbasa","uuid":"57DB77AC3D14BADFEE4F770BFBDDD191E2E2873FB2B76BD2B616CF5DC51D80A49229F9243267009DB36E847D0E00FEC3B1F6B50856D3FB6742775A6CAE384A9B","orcidId":"0000-0003-0249-8626","documentHash":"f5cabdba-c7ad-4c30-847b-88fab6fd508f"}],"doi":"10.15199/48.2022.05.27"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA1ODEyNDgxNQ=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
