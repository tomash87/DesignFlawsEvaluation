For this post-hoc analysis of the ML approach for determining the OASI location, data was utilized from a clinical study that enrolled 152 women post-vaginal delivery with varying degrees of perineal injuries or no such injuries. Both endoanal ultrasound (EUS), as the reference method, and impedance spectroscopy were performed. ML classification was also performed.

The research focuses on enhancing hydrolysis efficiency and reducing environmental impact. Ultrasound treatment significantly accelerated hydrolysis by creating cavitation, which increases local pressure and temperature, leading to faster reaction rates. The optimal condition was a 30-minute treatment at 90 ◦C with 6 M hydrochloric acid. The 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl\nchloride derivatization was best performed at pH 9.0 using borate buffer, ethanol as the organic solvent, and a 5-minute derivatization time with a 5 mM concentration. The method’s analytical performance, validated\naccording to FDA guidelines, showed excellent selectivity, specificity, linearity (r2 > 0.999), accuracy (recovery between 80–118 %), and precision (RSD<10.9). The analysis of 15 plant-based proteins revealed distinct amino\nacid profiles. Compared to traditional acid hydrolysis methods, the ultrasound-assisted approach demonstrated no significant difference in results (p-value > 0.05), confirming its reliability. The optimized ultrasound-assisted\nmethod is a reliable and efficient alternative for amino acid analysis, offering significant cost and time savings while maintaining high analytical performance.

Congenital heart defects may be an important contributing factor. Standard autopsy often fails to provide a comprehensive and accurate diagnosis on very small hearts. This study was carried out on five French bulldog puppies all presenting with advanced hydrops fetalis and four diagnosed with pulmonary hypoplasia at autopsy. The body weight of the dogs ranged from 142 to 687 g and the heart with lungs weighed from 4.5 to 23.6 g. The hearts and pulmonary vessels were filled with barium contrast, and micro-CT scans of the physiologically connected heart and lungs were performed. In all five puppies, we confirmed congenital heart defects including: Puppy #1. Perimembranous ventricular septal defect and aortic dextroposition; Puppy #2. Interrupted aortic arch with aortic valve dysplasia and aortic stenosis; Puppy #3. Tricuspid valve dysplasia and bicuspid pulmonary trunk valve; Puppy #4. Aortic stenosis and ventricular septal defect; Puppy #5. Tricuspid valve dysplasia. Additionally, four puppies had pulmonary vascular hypoplasia. Contrast-enhanced micro-CT can provide highly accurate diagnosis of complex congenital heart and lung defects.

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) affects wild and farmed cervids. The increasing number of cases in Europe, the resistance of prions to external conditions, and the persistence period threaten not only wild cervid populations but also the economy. The possible zoonotic potential of CWD is of growing concern. CWD is a relevant issue as far as the idea of “one health” is concerned, which is a fundamental principle of European veterinary law. Methods of legal text analysis and interpretation are used for this comparative legal study. Research reveals that countries struggling to tackle CWD employ different normative approaches to the problem and use different control and eradication schemes. The results of this study indicate that it is reasonable to issue uniform regulations in the European Union at the common, rather than national, level. The European legislation should creatively draw on the experience of North American countries that have been struggling with the discussed disease for a long time."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664749","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/14/14/2027","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682508f9fdbe83139258fe03","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Dzikowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b0e01c8f-9a78-4421-82fc-fac9dd94c0fd"},{"objectId":"682508f9fdbe83139258fe02","name":"Michał","lastName":"Mierkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a521d7c6-4b32-45a7-8530-7121087f90e7"},{"objectId":"5e70923a878c28a0473920fd","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Anusz","uuid":"C2290DBF040655729BB9E82B4AC0CFB47A8594E727421542EEA851E6036C6EAA68166496E51F380C690DB781F854939E1AA8F2DDD7319CAEFCE97D5F01A8C4C3","orcidId":"0000-0002-8116-8491","documentHash":"06bf0f26-e53b-48d2-8622-98609890f265"}],"doi":"10.3390/ani14142027"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Sterols","Plant-based camembert analog","Microbial lipids","Fatty acids","Waste oil","Yarrowia lipolytica"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d5878c28a0473b19c8","6825082dfdbe83139258f9c5","5e709428878c28a0473b74ab","6825082dfdbe83139258f9c6","6825082dfdbe83139258f9c3","5e70923b878c28a0473921d8"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Yeast lipids as a sustainable source of nutrients in dairy products analogs","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c172","mniswId":"6690","title":"Food Bioscience","doi":null,"issn":"2212-4292","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"52993b5d-0b8e-4c6e-ae7b-6e118135c6f4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6825082dfdbe83139258f9c2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6825082dfdbe83139258f9c3","6825082dfdbe83139258f9c4","6825082dfdbe83139258f9c5","6825082dfdbe83139258f9c6","5e7093d5878c28a0473b19c8","5e70923b878c28a0473921d8","5e709428878c28a0473b74ab"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The main objective of the study was to develop a concept for the use of oleaginous Yarrowia lipolytica biomass\nand single-cell oil (SCO) as vegan food components.

Confocal microscopy analysis of the biomass and detailed analysis of the\ncomposition of fatty acids, sterols, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the extracted lipids were\nconducted. The choice of substrates allowed to obtain SCO from post-frying rapeseed oil medium with the\ndesired yield (3.27 g/L), composition (UFA - 93.34%), and high oxidative stability (Τmax-204.94 min, 120 ◦C,\nisothermal conditions). The content of hexane as an extraction solvent was also evaluated, which also complied\nwith European Union requirements (0.0007 mg/kg).

In this work, we aimed to provide new information on changes occurring in tomato interacting with the beneficial fungus Beauveria bassiana. The tomato leaf proteome revealed perturbed molecular pathways during the establishment of the plant–fungus relationship. In the early stages of colonization (5–7 d), proteins related to defense responses to the fungus were down-regulated and proteins related to calcium transport were up-regulated. At later time points (12–19 d after colonization), up-regulation of molecular pathways linked to protein/amino acid turnover and to biosynthesis of energy compounds suggests beneficial interaction enhancing plant growth and development. At the later stage, the profile of leaf hormones and related compounds was also investigated, highlighting up-regulation of those related to plant growth and defense. Finally, B. bassiana colonization was found to improve plant resistance to Botrytis cinerea, impacting plant oxidative damage. Overall, our findings further expand current knowledge on the possible mechanisms underlying the beneficial role of B. bassiana in tomato plants."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664758","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6824bfb4fdbe836c41bcef67","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"74","number":"14","doi":null,"documentHash":"dea22b5a-8528-4541-9b1a-a499358db373"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"74","pagesFromTo":"4225-4243","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/jxb/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/jxb/erad148/50422363/erad148.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6824bfb4fdbe836c41bcef74","name":"Carla","lastName":"Caruso","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"19f2e035-9c3a-497e-9248-b8edb8c095ba"},{"objectId":"6824bfb4fdbe836c41bcef73","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Loreto","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"79737283-5f5b-46a1-b53e-e34f3e0a259d"},{"objectId":"6824bfb4fdbe836c41bcef72","name":"Marcello","lastName":"Ceci","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f4c9590c-3fc9-4030-8277-6ba29dd6d427"},{"objectId":"6824bfb4fdbe836c41bcef71","name":"Assunta","lastName":"Russo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6ad4e2ef-bc09-4928-b8d6-907fe8f70211"},{"objectId":"6824bfb4fdbe836c41bcef70","name":"Maurilia M","lastName":"Monti","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9743809a-bbcb-4ced-ad72-5a0d858127b3"},{"objectId":"6824bfb4fdbe836c41bcef6f","name":"Michelina","lastName":"Ruocco","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4dbb414f-a965-433c-916d-54b38346d678"},{"objectId":"6824bfb4fdbe836c41bcef6e","name":"Eduard","lastName":"Sabidó","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d2d4e869-3966-43f8-bb96-837fcd873f94"},{"objectId":"6824bfb4fdbe836c41bcef6d","name":"Julia","lastName":"Morales-Sanfrutos","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3bcde19b-8509-485a-be68-0af3503ba1af"},{"objectId":"6824bfb4fdbe836c41bcef6c","name":"Elisabetta","lastName":"Bizzarri","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b77f9261-f6c3-4cfe-93f5-073c8280f3b9"},{"objectId":"6824bfb4fdbe836c41bcef6b","name":"Alberto","lastName":"Pascale","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c54bf1c6-cbf3-4512-8f74-2b9155815a0a"},{"objectId":"6824bfb4fdbe836c41bcef6a","name":"Laura","lastName":"Bertini","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9cbeedf8-2850-4703-a2d9-ca2f700bd6c6"},{"objectId":"6824bfb4fdbe836c41bcef69","name":"Gaia Salvatore","lastName":"Falconieri","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"726114a7-89a6-4540-bf41-9eaa53502591"},{"objectId":"6824bfb4fdbe836c41bcef68","name":"Silvia","lastName":"Proietti","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"335391a8-8de6-48c6-9c1e-31e1a7b7db25"},{"objectId":"5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d8d","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Dziurka","uuid":"F896B30C172E4F7755870B94A25337DF78357B53DA86ECF7AE228A21E2A3F3EC87A81DAF92BD85AD8CDBC8E9DCD48CBF5B0BFC04EFCAF8C00ABCEEB3DFDF3E6E","orcidId":"0000-0003-4749-0935","documentHash":"8cd7c356-878b-4c90-8a89-e3e6ea36cc8d"}],"doi":"10.1093/jxb/erad148"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Embryogenesis · Phytohormones · Amino acids · Phenolic acids · Polyamines · Avena sativa L."]}],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","parentUuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","rootUuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Since large haploid oat embryos convert into plants more easily, the aim of our research was to investigate anatomical and metabolic differences between large (≥ 1.5 mm) and small (< 1.5 mm) haploid embryos of hulled ‘Krezus’ and hulless ‘Akt’ oat cultivars. Anatomical sections of the embryos were compared with the profile of phytohormones, amino acids, phenolic acids, polyamines, and sugars determined by HPLC. We noticed that the development rate of haploid oat embryos depends on the genotype, as 21-day-old ‘Krezus’ embryos were characterized by a more advanced anatomical structure compared to ‘Akt’ embryos. We have shown that small ‘Krezus’ embryos accumulate significant amounts of active phytohormones: auxins, cytokinins, gibberellins, as well as amino acids: tryptophan, phenylalanine, methionine; phenolic acids: cinnamic, ferulic, sinapinic, chlorogenic, and polyamines: spermidine and spermine. These metabolites, remaining closely interdependent, guarantee the embryo’s further growth and development."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664761","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6808a1d9fdbe832e346d977e","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"57e31df2-d52f-4473-9149-00686f230783"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00344-025-11694-8.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6824ab34fdbe836c41bc0bdc","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Muszyńska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0ac1910b-6ac8-412d-8cd1-7d20181ebb2b"},{"objectId":"6824ab34fdbe836c41bc0bdb","name":"Angelika","lastName":"Noga-Szyrszeń","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3e67064a-87c5-4f90-96c5-f8d40db2b093"},{"objectId":"6824ab34fdbe836c41bc0bda","name":"Michał","lastName":"Dziurka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1d1c6485-db62-4bc6-90e4-1c826314f71c"},{"objectId":"5f77f167085dcb410a25e8bb","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Laskoś","uuid":"16EB6DA31ABFD596E0D2D220AAA9AF3F36366CF5B0D8757017B4CF30FCE283A60B9AAF4EE3390830E65171E4D068B9F299B714C30D0A5C926C739FBD5D836709","orcidId":"0000-0001-9128-5467","documentHash":"baa3f58c-e14d-4378-aab4-0adf6829467c"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5c6c","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Warchoł","uuid":"96C50C213364C636F181AB8D51BAF7D54BC1844F8C0FE66B80B47E5B3D24280420727B45E1BF0E2DC6316BDF1E9053073F82A99FB17A766EFBCA0E94D412D94C","orcidId":"0000-0003-3606-4869","documentHash":"89ecd230-5148-4dc5-9fc4-5f70e200b5b4"},{"objectId":"5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d8d","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Dziurka","uuid":"F896B30C172E4F7755870B94A25337DF78357B53DA86ECF7AE228A21E2A3F3EC87A81DAF92BD85AD8CDBC8E9DCD48CBF5B0BFC04EFCAF8C00ABCEEB3DFDF3E6E","orcidId":"0000-0003-4749-0935","documentHash":"8cd7c356-878b-4c90-8a89-e3e6ea36cc8d"},{"objectId":"5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b89","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Skrzypek","uuid":"2FE6570FB916481FBD044405F2F659DBD3CFD39CE5F5A9F626C29557456B32924CA0ED373B92CD28276E256FB0040FC5C21EA384A09D6E8E4E05326289602963","orcidId":"0000-0003-3185-495X","documentHash":"206abb88-1f5d-4c30-b89f-cb14abfd9bd1"},{"objectId":"5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b84","name":"Ilona","lastName":"Czyczyło-Mysza","uuid":"E6E2B66A49A03DD35444BA1226B8680933CFAEC563749F6BB5388291798F60CCA4F363FA1F64A20F686A6FA8DE2FCC792D0D0D6DDDD207CEDC29852EB51A34A6","orcidId":"0000-0002-9586-9272","documentHash":"6936c869-2877-42f7-b4de-7d8855addd4c"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00344-025-11694-8"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["affordance","cognitive ecology","ecological psychology","indicator of action","indicator of value","methodological individualism","orientation in the environment","tendency of the organism"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6f","uid":"brPo86c_tekewx-XjU9GBlA","uuid":"01ff2083-eedf-4ae4-b240-4fcb4903fd75","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Filozofii i Socjologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f87f545085dcb410a25efd0"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","uid":"bpBenp-xOEUyWFZisxulIDw","uuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","parentUuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","rootUuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","name":"Uniwersytet Kardynała Stefana Wyszyńskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a2878c28a0473999de"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Orientation in the environment like perceiving affordances?

The theoretical frame for our study is cognitive ecology, a research tradition characteristic of various studies of cognition, including contemporary ones. This allows us to show that, despite differences in the backgrounds and methodologies of these researchers, Lewicki can be considered one of the pioneers of contemporary ecological trends in cognitive science, although his influence has not been as widespread as that of Gibson. Our analysis proceeds in several steps. We begin with an overview of the biographies, backgrounds, and interests of the two researchers, as well as a brief introduction to cognitive ecology and related terms. Next, we discuss action/value indicators theory and affordances theory. We then compare Lewicki’s and Gibson’s approaches in more detail in terms of their use of similar research heuristics.

The rod-like particles of CaDMP crystallized from water in a monoclinic space group P21/c, and contained Ca[O2P(OCH3)2]2 polymeric chains consisting of the octahedrally coordinated Ca2+ ions bridged by the tridentate dimethylphosphate ligands. The variable temperature powder X-ray diffraction measurements showed that this structure undergoes anisotropic thermal expansion upon heating, with no polymorphic transitions occurring up to 190 °C. Thermolysis of CaDMP began around 260 °C leading to the formation of calcium condensed phosphates and volatile oxophosphorus species. A detailed differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis, combined with a fitting of the experimental data to the Avrami or Liu–Mo kinetic models, revealed that CaDMP accelerates isothermal and non-isothermal crystallization of isotactic polypropylene (iPP). DSC and wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements confirmed the presence of α-iPP and β-iPP crystal domains in the systems loaded with CaDMP particles. The crystallographic analysis indicated that β-iPP polymorph formed via epitaxial crystallization on the surface of CaDMP crystals. Mechanical tests proved that the CaDMP-containing composites exhibited better ductility and impact strength than neat iPP."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664765","journalIssue":{"objectId":"677fc7b7fdbe831a91d64526","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"41689a60-19d6-4a7b-b2cc-eed6fe48f85b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-99757-4#article-info","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6824887efdbe836c41b90574","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Florjańczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8359ced5-60d5-45fa-a1f8-e0991a36a785"},{"objectId":"6824887efdbe836c41b90573","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Ostrowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"269c853e-2748-424d-b3bb-24d2874557b1"},{"objectId":"6824887efdbe836c41b90572","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Dranka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f01c52eb-f66a-4662-acbf-6522a3daba21"},{"objectId":"6824887efdbe836c41b90571","name":"Beata","lastName":"Sacher-Majewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9ccc5f18-c592-4264-8670-01bc7b2f35e2"},{"objectId":"6824887efdbe836c41b90570","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Czaja","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2bb9a65b-3d32-41e9-9262-6610bc9d6822"},{"objectId":"6824887efdbe836c41b9056f","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Kullas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0200c047-9303-4065-bee1-18574bde826e"},{"objectId":"6824887efdbe836c41b9056e","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Dębowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d5981fc9-de76-4d62-925a-17b9bd1f1e5e"},{"objectId":"5e7091f7878c28a04738dca1","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Bączek","uuid":"9E3483443D26DF3FC3C47BEF04B16127DD14063D01A70E11A62C365D4F3A2F9CB14DF1FF5A580B058D6387761927C90C6242FEE868BCF3D4E79BF708FB6CAC23","orcidId":"0000-0002-6079-2973","documentHash":"a953c5bd-de69-4b8b-b2ec-09bdbfafd693"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-025-99757-4"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"deu","keywords":["Oberschlesien","Region","Industrialisierung","zivilisatorische Errungenschaften","kulturelle Tradition","lokale Kulturen"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Upper Silesia","region","industrialisation","civilisational achievements","cultural traditions","local cultures"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"68189e6afdbe8375b17f8ddf","doi":null,"title":"Silesia Superior.

Generally, a number of plant species are capable of acquiring tolerance to frost after exposure to cold (in the cold-acclimation/cold-hardening process). In the last few decades, there have been more and more frequent periods of higher temperatures—warm periods that, e.g., break down the process of cold acclimation. This generates deacclimation, which could stimulate growth and lower frost tolerance in plants. Generally, deacclimation causes the reversal of changes induced by cold acclimation (i.e., in concentration of sugars, accumulation of protective proteins, or hormonal homeostasis). Unlike cold acclimation, the phenomenon of deacclimation has been less studied. The aim of this article was (1) to briefly describe the problem of deacclimation, with more attention being paid to its significance for economically important winter crop species, (2) to review and characterize the physiological-biochemical changes that are induced in plants by deacclimation, and (3) to discuss the possibilities of detecting deacclimation earlier in order to counteract its effects on crops."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664768","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65e1d18c4097073bbafc7344","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"d8e118a8-f4a6-404f-868e-393c311a744a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"419","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/14/3/419/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"634f612b752340623bbe65b6","name":"Julia","lastName":"Stachurska","uuid":"D7B67B968A9C73741D7A2881EEC65822F6FF86C9772B743CA7C1F521CEA5771C3BD25FEDC5909E46ABF3DF34D284B4C6F59654ED8A445FC3C945541FA324E05F","orcidId":"0009-0000-1778-9413","documentHash":"c9f4fe43-1e05-471c-a4b6-d239630209f1"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af1f7","name":"Anna","lastName":"Janeczko","uuid":"A703E1F8883D2BBAAA3650FAEBE0E2C5F8A98125E1069E381115C950E0BFF681058B5A0AB2DD6998E5D342E0C16EA294AF015892B6CD41044D3BE6C59446DBA6","orcidId":"0000-0001-6584-3250","documentHash":"19df622b-6efe-423c-bc99-fe31a63965ac"}],"doi":"10.3390/agronomy14030419"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Herodotus","Etymologiae","Isidore of Seville","Europe","geography","ancient sources"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","uid":"bc8mEkzUvIyODmqQ0WYOUYA","uuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Uniwersytet Marii Curie-Skłodowskiej w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6039c3759543c711bc6e9ca5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Europe in the Tripartite Division of the Earth: Herodotean Image of the World in the Etymologiae by Isidore of Seville","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa83c9aff2974850cd7b","mniswId":"483169","title":"Quaestiones Medii Aevi Novae","doi":null,"issn":"1427-4418","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"c9e436a7-b37d-4fa9-ac96-294c1393d0be"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"MAY","releaseDateYear":2025,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"68250905fdbe836c41be8565","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6039c3759543c711bc6e9ca5"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Ancient authors depicted continents with varying degrees of detail and interest. Europe wasoften viewed as the embodiment of the civilized world, yet its portrayal was ambivalent,serving as a contrast to the more mysterious regions of Asia and Africa.

Isidore’s portrayal of Europe aligns withtraditional geographical views that trace the reader back to Herodotus’ image of the worldand other ancient Greek and Roman influences, emphasising Europe’s role as a familiarand easily recognisable part of the world. Despite centuries that passed between Herodo-tus and Isidore, the perspective of the 7th -century scholar did not innovate on the existing tripartite division, as such changes would have disrupted the long-standing geographical and political consensus. Instead, Isidore adapts these ancient frameworks, infusing them with Christian perspectives while maintaining the established order.

The coherency between impact on both of them, especially in therms of content, determines the results in improvement of these attitudes towards more prohealthy nutrition. Therefore, a nutritional education programme in primary schools, addressed to both pupils and parents, is necesary. The aim of this study is to identify the opinions of primary school teachers on nutrition education in relation to primary school pupils’ knowledge and its sources of the principles of proper nutrition.\nMaterial and methods:\nIn 2022–2023, qualitative research was conducted among primary school teachers (n=112; 25 FGIs group) using the FGI method. The focus group meetings were tape-recorded and transcribed. A written report was generated based on the independent evaluation of two staff members.\nResults:\nTeachers mentioned several barriers to making changes in educational programmes in terms of introducing nutritional content, such as: necessity of extra time and money needed to purchase materials for practical exercises, lack of interest and skills in cooking, and insufficient knowledge about the health properties of food. Participants of group discussions shared ideas about programme content and delivery. Three teachers’ profiles were identified in their approach to nutrition education of primary school pupils: ‘engaged’, ‘skeptical’ and ‘indifferent’.\nConclusions:\nOn the basis of the FGIs survey, it was concluded that the level of pupils’ food and nutritional knowledge needs improvement, and that there is a need for a unified nutrition education programmeme in all schools on all educational levels, focused on the cooperation of teachers and pupils’ parents."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664775","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"31","pagesFromTo":"371-381","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.aaem.pl/Is-nutritional-education-in-primary-schools-needed-in-the-light-of-teachers-diagnosis,186511,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68250826fdbe83139258f98b","name":"Jadwiga","lastName":"Hamułka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"90d61405-f75a-4710-9919-77b15ab3507d"},{"objectId":"68250826fdbe83139258f98a","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Czarniecka-Skubina","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"57cf9d5d-d355-42ed-8055-5560aebe93c6"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a047392258","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Gutkowska","uuid":"952594336B19CCEF7F48DF8964F052EEE4759BCBD7CB0A0022B397A025FB67BEFC1A5260E7104F0C2EB7C0D0B1CDDFB99F923C2C6C51ADCDC6E6D154A781DFA9","orcidId":"0000-0002-0873-8478","documentHash":"6ddfba88-2969-47c8-8172-8a9176f34c98"}],"doi":"10.26444/aaem/186511"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Road traffic safety","awareness","need","pedestrian","behavior"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a0473971fc","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c5e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Behavior and awareness of road traffic hazards among pedestrians in Poland under 18 and over 65 years of age","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a06d","mniswId":"488292","title":"Journal of Modern Science","doi":null,"issn":"1734-2031","eissn":"2391-789X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"19e0ea2d-340a-4085-a97d-1d5d90465c85"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2024-06-27","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"68250287fdbe83139258e847","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a0473971fc","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c5e"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objectives:\nExamining similarities and differences in road behavior and knowledge about selected aspects of road safety in two different age groups of pedestrians, i.e. people under 18 and over 65 years of age.\nMaterial and methods:\nThe analysis is based on a study conducted using a survey questionnaire in the period December 20, 2022 - June 1, 2023. 625 people took part in the study, 268 people under 18 and 357 people over 65.\nResults:\nResearch shows that both groups tend to engage in dangerous behaviors. Young people are more likely to cross the road in unauthorized places and to cross pedestrian crossings without traffic lights, using mobile phones and headphones. Older people are less likely to wear reflective elements. Awareness of selected threats in both age groups is low.\nConclusions:\nThe research shows that both young and older people do not always behave safely on the road. People under 18 are more often responsible for dangerous behavior at pedestrian crossings. Another important problem is the lack of proper knowledge about the threats to which pedestrians are exposed and the lack of awareness of dangerous situations. In this study, most respondents were not aware of the dangers posed, partly due to their inappropriate behavior. Most questions regarding possible threats were answered incorrectly almost every time by over half of respondents in both age groups. None of the surveyed groups has an advantage regarding road traffic hazards. People under 18 more often correctly answered questions about priority at a pedestrian crossing and the driver's reaction time to the appearance of a live obstacle. People over 65 more often indicated the correct answer regarding the braking distance and the distance covered by a driver traveling at a speed of 50 km/h."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664777","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"56","pagesFromTo":"416-436","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.jomswsge.com/Behavior-and-awareness-of-road-traffic-hazards-among-pedestrians-in-Poland-under,188729,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c5e","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Michalski","uuid":"04699A9E9A1EFEB04B3EB9800266C2CF7A1829828A9B5968EC4D1172734A613E89D28D2BF1EDE54F59043779C39894239B2A43D4A43C44BC43A7383E3D898339","orcidId":"0000-0001-6997-352X","documentHash":"4591f28a-f5f5-4c7f-a032-9757a45ef1fa"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a0473971fc","name":"Teresa","lastName":"Gądek-Hawlena","uuid":"B881EF7CE8C6B50C83949900D98FEB713EF90FF4283175FBE5E223C9924190F21F03D26A6160FDE96731E346B373D6F33C1A2F24FB4D0FD311B7ABAFF4991C71","orcidId":"0000-0003-4350-1246","documentHash":"05a66985-4e44-48e1-9a4c-09116e9fd68e"}],"doi":"10.13166/jms/188729"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c5e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Job Complexity and Rational and Intuitive Decision-Making","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"682502b4fdbe83139258e9af","mniswId":null,"title":"CoSIM Journal","doi":null,"issn":"2943-9019","eissn":null,"websiteLink":"https://institutfuerdienstleistungen.com/en/journal/","metadataSource":"USER","editor":null,"documentHash":"3959910e-3d5b-4fdf-b108-068d3dd76f65"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-11-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"68250646fdbe83139258f591","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c5e","68250646fdbe83139258f592"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747261664778","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"287-296","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384797387_Conference_Proceeding_of_7th_international_online_Conference_on_contemporary_Studies_in_Management_CoSiM_2023_-_CoSiM_Journal_No_3_-_Special_Issue_on_Intuition_ISSN_2943-9019","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68250646fdbe83139258f592","name":"Markus","lastName":"Launer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0bc1d196-6cfe-42ef-8665-81eaa4e99cb6"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c5e","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Michalski","uuid":"04699A9E9A1EFEB04B3EB9800266C2CF7A1829828A9B5968EC4D1172734A613E89D28D2BF1EDE54F59043779C39894239B2A43D4A43C44BC43A7383E3D898339","orcidId":"0000-0001-6997-352X","documentHash":"4591f28a-f5f5-4c7f-a032-9757a45ef1fa"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["induction","Joule heating","photocatalysi","plasma","microwave","dry reforming of methane"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","uid":"bIJt_NDqzpR2rNcRdakaG3g","uuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","parentUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","rootUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","name":"Politechnika Warszawska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ea878c28a0473b32a0","5e7091ff878c28a04738e476","635c90287523405a7dcc9357"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Electrifying the dry reforming of methane.

This study investigates the dynamics of soil erosion across agricultural lands in Poland at monthly scale using the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model. The study utilizes the Global Rainfall Erosivity Dataset (GLOREDA), which provides the most up-to-date and highest resolution rainfall erosivity (R) values, derived from 10-min resolution rainfall records. Additionally, satellite imagery spanning 2003 to 2023 was leveraged to estimate the cover-management (C) factor, capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of vegetation cover and agricultural practices. Results reveal significant spatio-temporal variations in soil erosion rates, with peak erosion occurring during the summer months following crop harvesting, despite not aligning precisely with peak rainfall erosivity. The lowest erosion rates are observed during the winter seasons, attributed to minimal rainfall erosivity. The findings highlight the critical role of agricultural practices, particularly the timing of crop harvesting and temporary exposure of bare soil, in driving soil erosion dynamics in Poland's agricultural landscapes. Specifically, the average annual soil loss for agricultural areas in Poland was determined to be 0.27 t ha−1 yr−1, with peak monthly soil erosion rates reaching up to 0.08 t ha−1 yr−1 in August. Total monthly soil loss from agricultural lands in Poland was estimated to be approximately 4.87 Mt. annually, with 68 % of the total annual soil loss occurring during the summer months. This study contributes valuable insights into understanding and managing soil erosion risks in agricultural systems, aiding in the development of targeted soil conservation strategies and sustainable land management practices."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664781","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"39","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352009424001111","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092bc878c28a04739bb1d","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Marcinkowski","uuid":"12AFB029D222A32E02F345C525BCEB27BCE0D28FE090E81F16DC635B135024732AFFC71F8AA40A59EF811108D2C85A11750EAE28DCEF7EDB8210E8F03C2A9202","orcidId":"0000-0002-6000-9758","documentHash":"0f48beb6-356a-477b-9eff-065ec8561482"},{"objectId":"5e709257878c28a047394163","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Szporak-Wasilewska","uuid":"5C2FA27E6E1F6D1CF9C534A020FD1F2C1C91165D1184528BA95A3D4E9D3D4B070E691384CD731AACF85F0CA419202D67C1926A7CE2F046899C8566F7EC5A656F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8012-0894","documentHash":"7b7740e7-4e5f-4093-aaa5-f8d02025b6fb"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.geodrs.2024.e00864"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Nutrient Solution","Artificial light","Chlorophyll Fluorescence","Floating Raft Systems"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709259878c28a0473941bf"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The roles of light in a plant factory: photosynthesis efficiency and gas exchange parameters of lettuce as a function of light spectra","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"682504c6fdbe83139258f017","mniswId":null,"title":"Greenhouse Plant Production Journal","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"3041-914X","websiteLink":"https://gppj.araku.ac.ir/","metadataSource":"USER","editor":null,"documentHash":"e7ac7f1c-5f69-4b01-b01b-f61be09bfa45"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2024-03-11","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682504c6fdbe83139258f016","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["682504c6fdbe83139258f019","5e709259878c28a0473941bf","682504c6fdbe83139258f01a","682504c6fdbe83139258f01b"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Artificial light source is one of the most important factors for high quality and quantity vegetable production in a plant factory. Aiming to investigate the role of light spectra on growth, chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthesis and stomata parameters in lettuce plants grown in a plant factory, a factorial experiment was conducted based on a completely randomized design with two lettuce cultivars (Lollo Rossa and Lollo Bionda) and four spectra LED illumination red (656 nm), red/blue (3:1) (656 nm), blue (450 nm) and white (449 nm). The results showed that the combination of red and blue LED light had the greatest effect on stomatal conductance (gs), number of stomata, length and width of stomata in both lettuce cultivars. Also the maximum substomatal CO2 concentration (Ci) was observed in both lettuce cultivars when they were treated with red LED light. The results also showed that the maximum CO2 assimilation rate (PN) was observed in Rossa variety under white LED and in Bionda cultivar under blue LED light. Contrary to the results related to some of photosynthetic parameters, the highest values of vegetative traits (plant height, dry and fresh mass of shoots and roots, leaf number and leaf area) of plants were observed in the treatment of red and blue light combination. It is concluded that plant growth, chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics, photosynthetic and stomatal properties can be affected by different spectra and cultivars of lettuce, so that the choice of proper lighting is a fundamental requirement for the cultivation of this plant."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664783","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"1-26","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://gppj.araku.ac.ir/article_711869.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682504c6fdbe83139258f01b","name":"Khalil","lastName":"Malekzadeh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"95e496da-64f1-487b-8fd3-0354bbf8aa81"},{"objectId":"682504c6fdbe83139258f01a","name":"Mohsen","lastName":"Hamidpour","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6122b8cd-4d96-4af3-9eb2-d12fab0b18e8"},{"objectId":"682504c6fdbe83139258f019","name":"Hamidreza","lastName":"Soufi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d53ce6b0-f439-45df-b74c-61a3f64b420e"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941bf","name":"Mohamed","lastName":"Kalaji","uuid":"E980832F46BD43DEC3B7BE0AF6953EFF6EFA2450F0F24597D0811CF571F4A5B08DE7D49F0E697901B7A39E422A74CF9108BC2BF9E4A67F966407BBFE73E43426","orcidId":"0000-0002-3833-4917","documentHash":"63337622-ec27-4520-9587-1f4a884fc748"}],"doi":"10.61186/gppj.1.1.1"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["methane pyrolysis","catalytic decomposition of methane","carbon-coated iron catalyst","coking","TGA"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","uid":"bIJt_NDqzpR2rNcRdakaG3g","uuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","parentUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","rootUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","name":"Politechnika Warszawska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ea878c28a0473b32a0","5e7091ff878c28a04738e476","634626a97523402e34117646","635c90287523405a7dcc9357","5e7091ff878c28a04738e462"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Towards microwave-assisted methane pyrolysis.

Although the technology has its undoubted advantages, the cost of producing hydrogen with MP is still higher than that using Steam Methane Reforming (SMR). Remote and contactless catalyst heating by microwaves can significantly intensify methane pyrolysis and reduce these costs. One of the catalysts that can be utilized in the microwave-assisted MP is the Fe/C catalyst. The current work presents a reference study of the MP kinetics on the dedicated Fe/C catalyst under conventional (non-microwave) heating. The kinetic data determined in this work are necessary for appropriate modelling and design of the microwave-assisted MP reactor. Experiments were carried out using thermogravimetric analysis coupled with gas chromatography. The reaction order with respect to methane and the activation energy were found to be 0.6, and 71 kJ/mol, respectively. The effects of CO2 concentration and temperature on the regeneration of the catalyst were also demonstrated."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664786","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"203","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0255270124002162?dgcid=rss_sd_all","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682497bbfdbe83139258c73c","name":"David","lastName":"Farrusseng","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5ead0ff6-1b07-4a22-a44d-b8be1c77cb07"},{"objectId":"682497bbfdbe83139258c73b","name":"Valentin","lastName":"L'hospital","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"98ee4e40-c605-4749-879f-33a37195c242"},{"objectId":"635c90287523405a7dcc9357","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Stankiewicz","uuid":"AB99B97E84567EF7E4DBE524BF83F9B4057916D64D2B67619C4B1C5112139C3E8E3EA87B52BA3D9C1DE2067C3D4E6163FE98A9A9D69711FFC7F8CCFEA6C75A37","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f15cb0a6-6a28-4ff7-999f-f0bcf8d4508e"},{"objectId":"634626a97523402e34117646","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Murgrabia","uuid":"F28188C60CEA42F9F173B7843AE87D9DCA3E8F82355F0C77FD849A74ED4E13C8178EAA0B398A958EFA08F0BFB15E7FB28423DD3AA786E7A83FAE3498AF9AC01F","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2f33707a-a1e1-4b6f-9b36-170bfdd0ed9d"},{"objectId":"5e7093ea878c28a0473b32a0","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kotkowski","uuid":"74A0105526186153E086192DCB35E3CC62768631347BD1881403F714E7957F4F333C1B6930C4F0AC8DDF87D69ED48DA144BACF29B87F543B4E106C59A3924BA7","orcidId":"0000-0002-6018-0600","documentHash":"b25607cf-cf4b-4569-b982-ba9945ff7f13"},{"objectId":"5e7091ff878c28a04738e476","name":"Robert","lastName":"Cherbański","uuid":"A6C5FFD8FD1210CDA9BBD085DCB1EF70230685639A055237F8ECF0BABD5E32BBD1EA356A4CB3B8B5717C9E7CAC9CBDBD4EAFC63B3B8BDD66D49C92F095AF0B11","orcidId":"0000-0003-2649-7361","documentHash":"1bdd4dbd-a6b9-4b98-88a3-eddc723cd5cd"},{"objectId":"5e7091ff878c28a04738e462","name":"Eugeniusz","lastName":"Molga","uuid":"D0361810C8F565FF5A7B7225C2282306C8C38863B418E496BEE4BF207E8DE55C0301838E70687C0884CAD2F4D74B3BCB868767EC555056881C1DB3E0FCE5FE66","orcidId":"0000-0002-4788-3117","documentHash":"4440571d-78c1-4541-bd8d-570add5d89df"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.cep.2024.109878"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["polyphenols","pomace","response surface methodology","ultrasound-assisted extraction","by-products"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709386878c28a0473abeba","682507befdbe83139258f790","5e70923b878c28a0473921fc","5e70941c878c28a0473b66d0","682507befdbe83139258f78f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Response Surface Methodology for Optimization of Ultrasound-Assisted Antioxidants Extraction from Blackberry, Chokeberry and Raspberry Pomaces","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547e776","mniswId":"25607","title":"Plants","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2223-7747","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9b5e2d0-7e4e-4b87-9cc1-37b3d46db596"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-04-17","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682507befdbe83139258f78e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["682507befdbe83139258f78f","5e709386878c28a0473abeba","682507befdbe83139258f790","5e70941c878c28a0473b66d0","5e70923b878c28a0473921fc"]},"issue":"8","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"An investigation of the ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) of polyphenol-rich aqueous extracts from blackberry, chokeberry and raspberry pomaces was carried out.

Leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. ‘Lisboa’) is taken as the model crop for the evaluation of alternative substrates. The closed hydroponic system ebb and flow with growing in pots was used for the experiment. The parameters of the nutrient solution were EC 1.5–2 mS and pH 6–7. Biological parameters, content of nitrates, plant stress indicators, antioxidant activity (AA) as % scavenging of DPPH (AA), glutathione (GSH), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), total phenol content (TPC) and the content of chosen elements in the drain from substrates were evaluated. According to the biomass production of lettuce, the substrates can be ranked from the lowest as follows: sheep wool < wood fibre < mineral wool < perlite < coco peat. The levels of GSH and APX did not affect AA. The TPC showed the greatest effect on AA and the stress response in general. The nitrate content ranged between 426 and 686 mg · kg–1 of fresh mass. Instead of mineral wool and perlite, coco fibre could be a promising alternative organic substrate for lettuce production in the ebb and flow hydroponics system.

Cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease (CHD), are currently positioned among the leading causes of mortality globally. Risk factors of CHD include, among others, hypercholesterolemia and elevations in systemic inflammation. Functional foods enriched with compounds showing cholesterol-lowering effects are considered one among various dietary and lifestyle intervention strategies to tackle this problem. A CHD-preventive effect of dietary plant sterols has been broadly discussed, not only due to their ability to reduce blood cholesterol level, but also to their proven anti-inflammatory potential. Palm oil is one of the most widely consumed edible oils in the world. Despite its widespread use, especially in Asian countries, no study has been conducted using palm oil as a vehicle for plant sterols. Methods: The aim of the placebo-controlled double-blinded trial presented here was, therefore, to evaluate the effect of palm oil enriched with plant sterols, used as a cooking oil, on lipid profile and systemic inflammation marker in 100 adult hyperlipidemic residents of Bogor, Indonesia. Results: The study has shown a significant reduction in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol level in study subjects consuming plant sterol-enriched palm oil as a replacement for usual palm oil for cooking, with no similar effect on CRP levels. Conclusions: The study suggests that, along with a healthy diet and lifestyle promotion, incorporating plant sterols in palm oil used for cooking may be an effective strategy to reduce cardiovascular risks in hyperlipidemic individuals.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664795","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/19/3370","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6825083efdbe83139258fa35","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Średnicka-Tober","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"24019e8f-dde2-4220-8d29-c38b7ed6f922"},{"objectId":"6825083efdbe83139258fa34","name":"Nuri","lastName":"Andarwulan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"abc5c226-0149-4528-9453-5829339e3a27"},{"objectId":"6825083efdbe83139258fa33","name":"Drajat","lastName":"Martianto","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"298b2dee-2c71-4ecc-9fdf-3c1e8a460966"},{"objectId":"6825083efdbe83139258fa32","name":"Mira","lastName":"Dewi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a440367a-9118-47fe-bbc0-51ac03fa4d1b"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a047392235","name":"Renata","lastName":"Kazimierczak","uuid":"EC0CFAC95A3DD34002BCC0349D8E57AB9ABEFA63379EC6123DAA960FEDF1E10A7D34AAD9E2783C3BF4F67FB1D9F4E26906E9B1D28472E832F9D4280020C88E5F","orcidId":"0000-0002-4334-6672","documentHash":"be084188-9fb5-4a4e-8cda-013948d935b1"}],"doi":"10.3390/nu16193370"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"67e54eb1fdbe831b59a692db","doi":null,"title":"Trust

present a full space-time numerical solution of the advection-diffusion equation using a continuous Galerkin finite element method on conforming meshes. The Galerkin/least-square method is employed to ensure stability of the discrete variational problem. In the full space-time formulation, time is considered another dimension, and the time derivative is interpreted as an additional advection term of the field variable. We derive a priori error estimates and illustrate spatio-temporal convergence with several numerical examples. We also derive a posteriori error estimates, which coupled with adaptive space-time mesh refinement provide efficient and accurate solutions. The accuracy of the space-time solutions is illustrated by comparing against analytical solutions as well as against numerical solutions using a conventional time-marching algorithm."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664800","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.185","pagesFromTo":"brak","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898122125000793","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68246c9cfdbe836c41b6f6dd","name":"Baskar","lastName":"GANAPATHYSUBRAMANIAN","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"98c9dabd-9eb1-418d-94b3-2312f4baf446"},{"objectId":"68246c9cfdbe836c41b6f6dc","name":"Anupam","lastName":"SHARMA","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3bc5cb0b-89fa-4b41-8936-5399656d45db"},{"objectId":"68246c9cfdbe836c41b6f6db","name":"Kumar","lastName":"SAURABH","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"07768f58-7368-419e-9486-2ec360daaf04"},{"objectId":"68246c9cfdbe836c41b6f6da","name":"Biswajit","lastName":"KHARA","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"790b88fc-8e7c-424d-9405-b966db227192"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e70c","name":"Robert","lastName":"Dyja","uuid":"A3163A74E24C8B67A9825623ADA078C5F350E0002C2F52AEA44828D9B58046048895D1AB3C2AD67D588E7BD998E91E4114943C3759851D2B437026B7EF60F57B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6941-4728","documentHash":"e99440af-e85b-429f-ac18-1ffcb72c8d0b"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.camwa.2025.02.020"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"67322194fdbe8303494373b4","doi":null,"title":"Monografia.

of the important abiotic stresses in the arid and semi-arid world, including Iran, is soil and water salinity that reduces crop yield. Determination of damage amount of salinity stress to crops such as wheat is also essential. Since chlorophyll fluorescence analysis has become an important tool in fundamental and applied research in the field of plant physiology and agronomy, this experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of salinity on chlorophyll fluorescence of 240 wheat genotypes at three levels of salinity (0, 9, 12 dS.m-1) in greenhouse conditions. After 21 days of salinity stress, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and related transients (Fo, Fv, Fm, Fv/Fm, Vj, PI, Fv/Fo, and ABS/RC) and the photosynthetic pigments were measured. All photosynthetic pigments decreased after salinity stress, and this decrease was significant in susceptible genotypes. Salinity also significantly reduced the quantum yield of photosystem II (Ø PSII) and the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) and significantly increased the ABS/RC, Fo, and Vj parameters in susceptible genotypes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664807","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"3","pagesFromTo":"67-84","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://jwr.uok.ac.ir/article_62172.html?lang=en","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682504b3fdbe83139258ef78","name":"Mitra","lastName":"Jabbari","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8e22b8d0-66c9-438d-b321-410ed817d69c"},{"objectId":"682504b3fdbe83139258ef77","name":"Baratali","lastName":"Fakheri","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"70c84aa4-7d99-4db8-93b2-513a9bc7d69a"},{"objectId":"682504b3fdbe83139258ef76","name":"Nafiseh","lastName":"Mahdinezhad","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"44b04af9-fc1a-48ed-92ee-a2813905535d"},{"objectId":"682504b3fdbe83139258ef75","name":"Saber","lastName":"Golkari","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e78e79b9-1ee8-43d8-a855-667da21cf87e"},{"objectId":"682504b3fdbe83139258ef74","name":"Mahmood","lastName":"Solouki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b79a4156-3d46-4723-861a-3a3798dbc027"},{"objectId":"682504b3fdbe83139258ef73","name":"Ameneh","lastName":"Ghasemi Masarmi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5741210a-39f3-4158-9223-23231fbf325a"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941bf","name":"Mohamed","lastName":"Kalaji","uuid":"E980832F46BD43DEC3B7BE0AF6953EFF6EFA2450F0F24597D0811CF571F4A5B08DE7D49F0E697901B7A39E422A74CF9108BC2BF9E4A67F966407BBFE73E43426","orcidId":"0000-0002-3833-4917","documentHash":"63337622-ec27-4520-9587-1f4a884fc748"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-80-7509-962-4","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Public recreation and landscape protection – with environment hand in hand?

study investigates lignocellulosic biocomposites’ physicochemical properties and strength parameters with varying thermoplastic content. Biocomposites were prepared using wood (Pinus sylvestris) or hemp shives (Cannabis sativa L.) combined with 25% and 50% ABS regranulate. The research focused on evaluating the mechanical energy consumption during the compaction of wood-ABS biocomposites with different pine fractions pretreated with hot water extraction (HWE) and analyzing the relationship between strength and thermoplastic content. Results indicate that the composition of the mixture and the size of the hemp shives fraction did not significantly influence energy consumption during densification. Energy values ranged from 1.234 × 10⁻8 J to 8.296 × 10⁻8 J. While the densification of pine after HWE was unsuccessful without ABS, preheating the mixtures with ABS facilitated the production of a uniform composite.

Their industrial utility is largely determined by their physicochemical properties. However, comprehensive data on the properties of pea protein–psyllium binary hydrogels under different pH and ionic strength conditions are limited. The aim of this research was to evaluate the impact of pH (adjusted to 7, 4.5, and 3) and ionic strength (modified by NaCl addition to 0.15 and 0.3 M) on the physical stability, color, texture, microrheological, and viscoelastic properties of these hydrogels. Color differences were most noticeable at lower pH levels. Inducing hydrogels at pH 7 (with or without NaCl) and pH 4.5 and 3 (without NaCl) resulted in complete gel structures with low stability, low elastic and storage moduli, and low complex viscosity, making them easily spreadable. Lower pH inductions (4.5 and 3) in the absence of NaCl resulted in hydrogels with shorter linear viscoelastic regions. Hydrogels induced at pH 4.5 and 3 with NaCl had high structural stability, high G’ and G” moduli, complex viscosity, and high spreadability. Among the tested induction conditions, pH 3 with 0.3 M NaCl allowed for obtaining a hydrogel with the highest elastic and storage moduli values. Adjusting pH and ionic strength during hydrogel induction allows for modifying and tailoring their properties for specific industrial applications."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664815","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2310-2861/10/6/401","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682507e0fdbe83139258f857","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Wroniak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6d4f8059-ac01-4764-b601-034201cbe3cd"},{"objectId":"682507e0fdbe83139258f856","name":"Anna","lastName":"Florowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"90c0557a-974e-4938-8ba2-2ea7e9fe41ea"},{"objectId":"682507e0fdbe83139258f855","name":"Adonis","lastName":"Hilal","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"44759098-b82f-4210-bd19-47a89cf99f94"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a047392210","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Domian","uuid":"1A5C7564EB741C596EE64E8D9366D49FAAB4D41D5FFA078598E4C2EBC211BEC09FF6174B9DF83BFB599A3D16E858071F569BF02C8B66349FB0D299AF14EE5011","orcidId":"0000-0001-6318-751X","documentHash":"71ceda41-2bae-4704-92e6-44ca390db60f"}],"doi":"10.3390/gels10060401"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["PEP carboxylase","stomatal conductance","photosynthesis","waterlogging","chlorophyll","photosynthetic pigments"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709259878c28a0473941bf"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Ultrastructure, adaptability, and alleviation mechanisms of photosynthetic apparatus in plants under waterlogging: A review","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547924d","mniswId":"16055","title":"Photosynthetica","doi":null,"issn":"0300-3604","eissn":"1573-9058","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f577074e-8872-47bf-a0a4-effcecd1688a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-08-18","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682504c9fdbe83139258f028","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["682504c9fdbe83139258f029","682504c9fdbe83139258f02a","682504c9fdbe83139258f02b","5e709259878c28a0473941bf","682504c9fdbe83139258f02c","682504c9fdbe83139258f02d"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Photosynthesis is a process highly sensitive to various abiotic and biotic stresses in plants. Among them, the major abiotic stress, waterlogging, affects the crop's growth and productivity. Under waterlogging, the photosynthetic apparatus of plants was destroyed. Waterlogging reduced chlorophyll content and the net photosynthetic rate. Therefore, this updated review summarized the effect of waterlogging on chloroplast ultrastructure, photosynthetic characteristics, and chlorophyll fluorescence attributes of plant species. By studying various research papers, we found that intercellular concentration of available carbon dioxide in mesophyll cells, assimilation of carbon, and the net photosynthetic ratio declined under waterlogging. The chlorophyll fluorescence efficiency of plants decreased under waterlogging. Thus, the study of photosynthesis in plants under waterlogging should be done with respect to changing climate. Moreover, the recognition of photosynthetic characteristics present in tolerant species will be beneficial for designing the waterlogging-tolerant crop plant in changing environments."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664817","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"60","pagesFromTo":"430-444","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ps.ueb.cas.cz/artkey/phs-202203-0012_ultrastructure-adaptability-and-alleviation-mechanisms-of-photosynthetic-apparatus-in-plants-under-waterloggi.php","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682504c9fdbe83139258f02d","name":"V","lastName":"Soni","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7897e2f6-c98b-4425-a1dd-adfa3e4b9c93"},{"objectId":"682504c9fdbe83139258f02c","name":"J","lastName":"Mojski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0259062b-46b3-4a95-b65b-5081385cba08"},{"objectId":"682504c9fdbe83139258f02b","name":"J","lastName":"Sharma","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4a566228-4ca5-4440-82d3-1bcd4f5cbca0"},{"objectId":"682504c9fdbe83139258f02a","name":"U","lastName":"Bhatt","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"34bcc520-bfb0-47f4-9737-694144cf0d75"},{"objectId":"682504c9fdbe83139258f029","name":"Sudhir Kumar","lastName":"Sharma","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fc55b0a6-7049-48dd-8eed-8c911b1176be"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941bf","name":"Mohamed","lastName":"Kalaji","uuid":"E980832F46BD43DEC3B7BE0AF6953EFF6EFA2450F0F24597D0811CF571F4A5B08DE7D49F0E697901B7A39E422A74CF9108BC2BF9E4A67F966407BBFE73E43426","orcidId":"0000-0002-3833-4917","documentHash":"63337622-ec27-4520-9587-1f4a884fc748"}],"doi":"10.32615/ps.2022.033"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","uid":"bIJt_NDqzpR2rNcRdakaG3g","uuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","parentUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","rootUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","name":"Politechnika Warszawska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6338f7a87523402e340e4915","5e709213878c28a04738f796"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Następca prawny właściciela jako strona postępowania reprywatyzacyjnego – glosa krytyczna do wyroku Naczelnego Sądu Administracyjnego z 29 sierpnia 2022 r.

Curdlan is a high molecular weight polysaccharide consisting of β-1,3- linked glucose units, produced by fermentation from Rhizobium radiobacter biovar 1 strain NTK-u.\nThe toxicological dataset consisted of sub-chronic,\nchronic and carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity studies as well as genotoxicity. In vivo data showed that curdlan is not absorbed as such but is extensively metabolised by the gut microbiota into CO2 and other innocuous compounds. Curdlan was not genotoxic and was well-tolerated with no overt organ-specifictoxicity. Effects observed at very high doses of curdlan, such as decreased growth and increased cecum weight, are common for indigestible bulking compounds and therfore considered physiological responses. In a combined three-generation reproductive and developmental toxicity study, decreased pup weight was observed during lactation at 7500 mg curdlan/kg body weight (bw) per day, the highest dose tested. The Panel considered the observed effects as treatment-related and adverse, although likely secondary to nutritional imbalance and identified a conservative no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 2500 mg/kg bw per day. Despite the limitations noted in the dataset, the Panel was able to conclude applying the margin of exposure (MOE) approach. Given that curdlan and its break-down products are not absorbed and that the identified adverse effects neither systemic nor local, no adjustment factor was deemed necessary. Thus, an MOE of at least 1 was considered sufficient. The highest exposure estimate was 1441 mg/kg bw per day in toddlers at the 95th percentile of the proposed maximum use level exposure assessment scenario. The Panel concluded that there is no safety concern for the use of curdlan as a food additive at the proposed uses and use levels."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664826","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"1-31","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2903/j.efsa.2024.8985","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68250853fdbe83139258fb13","name":"Laurence","lastName":"Castle","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"721ff8f2-0cd1-4169-8138-5853db9ceac7"},{"objectId":"68250853fdbe83139258fb12","name":"Sam","lastName":"Vermeiren","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2e59d51c-a1f5-4bfa-98c7-1f60c08f81b2"},{"objectId":"68250853fdbe83139258fb11","name":"Alexandra","lastName":"Tard","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e4024139-4d1a-4e76-9b43-eb6ade36a5f6"},{"objectId":"68250853fdbe83139258fb10","name":"Camilla","lastName":"Smeraldi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5faad3ee-e310-4cdd-889a-8d4f006c2ac1"},{"objectId":"68250853fdbe83139258fb0f","name":"Laura","lastName":"Ruggeri","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1bd11254-7b2b-41ef-b85a-3a35d87bf63f"},{"objectId":"68250853fdbe83139258fb0e","name":"Salvatore","lastName":"Multari","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"31096a2c-274e-456f-adb9-72c0845fbbda"},{"objectId":"68250853fdbe83139258fb0d","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Mech","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"df0d9eeb-bffa-481f-b1c9-a12568813bd5"},{"objectId":"68250853fdbe83139258fb0c","name":"Jaime

activities in the concept of integrated water resources management play a vital role. Especially in dry and\r\nsemi-dry regions, agricultural activities have the largest share of water consumption. By employing a model-based approach\r\nusing modified Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT agro-hydrological model), this study has prepared\r\nWater Accounting Plus (WA+) framework requirements to investigate different conditions of supply and demand in\r\nwet (1985–2000) and dry (2001–2015) periods in a semi-dry basin (Karkheh River Basin) in Iran. Our assessments\r\nbased onWA+show decreasing 10%(21.65 to 19.29 Billion Cubic Meters (BCM)/year) of precipitation in the dry period\r\ncaused a 4% (0.13 BCM/year) decline in natural evapotranspiration. However, the basin experienced a 24% increment\r\nin evapotranspiration from agricultural activities at the same period, and runoff was approximately halved\r\n(2.45 BCM/year). Therefore, especially in downstream parts, surface water withdrawal has decreased by 18%.\r\nThese new conditions have put pressure on groundwater resources. The aquifer extraction and total withdrawal for irrigation\r\nhave grown by about 17% and 4%, respectively. Finally, it is evident that the manageable water has diminished\r\ndue to climate change; not only the managed water consumption in the basin has not reduced, but it has also\r\nhighly risen. The current study results help water authorities arrange new hydrological and climatic conditions\r\nstrategies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664829","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://bw.sggw.edu.pl/info/article/WULS087fade8aef7496fa90bec18af7ce396/Publication%2B%25E2%2580%2593%2BModel-based%2Bwater%2Baccounting%2Bfor%2Bintegrated%2Bassessment%2Bof%2Bwater%2Bresources%2Bsystems%2Bat%2Bthe%2Bbasin%2Bscale%2B%25E2%2580%2593%2BWarsaw%2BUniversity%2Bof%2BLife%2BSciences%2B-%2BSGGW?r=publication&ps=20&tab=&lang=en","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68250406fdbe83139258ec4e","name":"Ali","lastName":"Motamedi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1d6cf06c-8669-4bd1-925e-85352c5eb7e1"},{"objectId":"68250406fdbe83139258ec4d","name":"Farhad","lastName":"Noormohammadi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eb40daa4-d713-46d8-af01-92ca8b3b9e85"},{"objectId":"68250406fdbe83139258ec4c","name":"Ali","lastName":"Shahbazi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"95106ffa-625e-47b8-99b6-07a6e91937e7"},{"objectId":"68250406fdbe83139258ec4b","name":"Mohammad

The aim of this study was to determine the impact of shelf temperature (10 °C, 25 °C and 40 °C) during freeze drying on the foam-mat kiwiberry pulp drying process and the quality of the obtained material based on analyses such as moisture content, water activity, hygroscopicity, solubility, microstructure and spectral measurement using the FTIR method. The use of higher shelf temperatures during freeze drying positively influenced the drying process, reducing its duration by up to 40.7%. The shelf temperature caused changes in the dry matter content (97.2–99.6%), water activity (0.159–0.221), structure and hygroscopic properties (1.41–4.41 g water/100 g d.m.) of the kiwiberry foam mats. Foam-mat drying at 40 °C exhibited a significantly lower water activity, total porosity and hygroscopicity, providing properties favorable for good microbiological and functional stability during storage. Furthermore, this temperature applied during freeze drying resulted in an increase in the solubility of the obtained material, which indicates its possible use in the matrix of other food products."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664836","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/13/5629","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682507f4fdbe83139258f896","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Witrowa-Rajchert","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a666471b-1c89-4620-96d6-0ff19560d15c"},{"objectId":"682507f4fdbe83139258f895","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Bogusz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ea012abb-d8e5-4a14-9e3f-d07b7325fd4d"},{"objectId":"5e709487878c28a0473bf096","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Rybak","uuid":"23CE32C58512E32A4B96EAE0AE9ECB2BF23310D66D220B65BFBB79CD39E7F53ECA83523B7822465B1A3A51369BA847D9FDD6BA28CDC2F09E8BE6E1DD13CE7440","orcidId":"0000-0003-3595-0818","documentHash":"4fdd131f-d106-4642-a4be-de7994ac4305"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a04739221b","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Nowacka","uuid":"E85B587CB83FA262B33EC648A56233E393FCEE2E993B8374949D817101C99BFE915F89BFEA3B24894CF241C78C82241C2FCAD33FFB0DBE868B6365630E5D17A8","orcidId":"0000-0003-4689-6909","documentHash":"4ecb9480-c3af-4d13-9055-38f9ae2905e5"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a0473921ce","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Gondek","uuid":"14A9FB7F468BC97C2BBE85DD6FCE2FDD5D9FB39D906A417C9BF8B3B6B2CCF99EFDA950BDA09B5286F4C603057D1A117AB8322398A77F9B2527889C3FB6EEEC59","orcidId":"0000-0002-5705-6529","documentHash":"ee27d3b7-1838-410a-9dc3-8feb2f5b2993"}],"doi":"10.3390/app14135629"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Trichostrongylidae","anthelmintic resistance","DMSO","five-parameter logistic curve","inhibitory concentration"]}],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["682508dafdbe83139258fcd8","682508dafdbe83139258fcd6","682508dafdbe83139258fcce","5e70923a878c28a0473920cf","682508dafdbe83139258fcd4","682508dafdbe83139258fcd3","682508dafdbe83139258fcd1","682508dafdbe83139258fcd0"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Inhibitory effect of dimethyl sulfoxide on the development of gastrointestinal nematode larvae in the larval development test","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research (Poland)","doi":null,"issn":"2450-7393","eissn":"2450-8608","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"5a3ef30a-e992-42a0-a40a-ad7662219310"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2025-03-25","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682508dafdbe83139258fccd","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["682508dafdbe83139258fcce","682508dafdbe83139258fccf","682508dafdbe83139258fcd0","682508dafdbe83139258fcd1","682508dafdbe83139258fcd2","682508dafdbe83139258fcd3","5e70923a878c28a0473920cf","682508dafdbe83139258fcd4","682508dafdbe83139258fcd5","682508dafdbe83139258fcd6","682508dafdbe83139258fcd7","682508dafdbe83139258fcd8"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction\nDimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is an amphipathic solvent for molecules in in vitro tests for detection of anthelmintic resistance of gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN). It has been shown to have a concentration-dependent detrimental effect on Caenorhabditis elegans, a free-living nematode. If GIN are likewise affected, using DMSO in egg-hatch test and larval development test (LDT) may confound their results. Therefore, the DMSO concentration was determined at which it exerted an inhibitory effect on GIN larval development to the third stage.\nMaterial and Methods\nA standard LDT was performed in 30 replications at DMSO concentrations of 0.0% (control), 0.6%, 1.3%, 2.6%, 5.2%, 10.4%, and 20.8%. The numbers of all developmental stages of Haemonchus contortus, Trichostrongylus spp. and Oesophagostomum spp. (unhatched eggs, larvae of the first, second and third stages (L1-L3) were determined, the proportion of L3 (the percentage of larval development – PD) was calculated and L3 were identified at the species or genus level. A five-parameter logistic curve was fitted to the observed PDs and modelled the DMSO–larval development relationship.\nResults\nThe PD significantly decreased with increasing DMSO concentration and was significantly reduced at the 2.6% concentration. The median inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 3.79%, the concentration for 10% inhibition (IC10) was 1.75% and for 90% inhibition (IC90) was 8.20%. The percentage of L1 and L2 followed an analogical but opposite pattern to that of PD and was complementary to it at each DMSO concentration. The unhatched egg percentage was rarely >1% and showed no pattern.\nConclusion\nAt ≥2.6% concentration, DMSO significantly inhibited the L3 development of all three GIN species. It had a practically important inhibitory effect (IC10) at as low concentration as 1.75%. At lower concentrations, DMSO did not appear to inhibit larval development. The compound did not seem to exert an in vitro ovicidal effect regardless of the concentration."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664838","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"69","pagesFromTo":"83-90","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://sciendo.com/article/10.2478/jvetres-2025-0016","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682508dafdbe83139258fcd8","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Kaba","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e74cfecb-f04b-42f6-8547-6c017f2d4d5a"},{"objectId":"682508dafdbe83139258fcd7","name":"Marián","lastName":"Várady","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f886a1a1-ba73-40fd-8e05-ec5664c3cd68"},{"objectId":"682508dafdbe83139258fcd6","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Markowska-Daniel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"76e2b522-4eea-4ca7-affa-770cbd33168f"},{"objectId":"682508dafdbe83139258fcd5","name":"Alistair","lastName":"Antonopoulos","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4fdd1c0a-fdf9-49c6-bf84-9652862468be"},{"objectId":"682508dafdbe83139258fcd4","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Górski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e92fbf72-3d30-44a1-a540-befee96e0a71"},{"objectId":"682508dafdbe83139258fcd3","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Biernacka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"43ff99fd-152b-4165-90f6-765692cdcb3e"},{"objectId":"682508dafdbe83139258fcd2","name":"Adrian-Valentin","lastName":"Potărniche","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e5711ae5-b72a-452d-b544-80e4d25fed69"},{"objectId":"682508dafdbe83139258fcd1","name":"Agata","lastName":"Moroz-Fik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"32dba9ff-c943-4ce6-9501-d2080aa2bda2"},{"objectId":"682508dafdbe83139258fcd0","name":"Michał","lastName":"Czopowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e9547fc1-1b03-42f6-a891-6963be81af4b"},{"objectId":"682508dafdbe83139258fccf","name":"Zofia","lastName":"Nowek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0c99c426-475e-4d66-9c76-3399a53b27c5"},{"objectId":"682508dafdbe83139258fcce","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Mickiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"36760bb4-890d-4c89-b127-4d32fe1674aa"},{"objectId":"5e70923a878c28a0473920cf","name":"Olga","lastName":"Szaluś-Jordanow","uuid":"17E0C2E907F83BE9A5EBDFD3E673036778FDDB294F8757BD18958138EAF5901F661CBD36D72D64A6AB7AEF74143CFA6D95A76A556B4BA82F55938028F549E63D","orcidId":"0000-0002-2532-3338","documentHash":"f0073e54-14b3-4f8b-8264-80992aea8b6f"}],"doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2025-0016"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de96","uid":"bAo34UoX0XIwK2rusa5QrAw","uuid":"3c9cd6a7-306c-491d-bf77-811eec2fdef5","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de96","parentUuid":"3c9cd6a7-306c-491d-bf77-811eec2fdef5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de96","rootUuid":"3c9cd6a7-306c-491d-bf77-811eec2fdef5","name":"Instytut

A reduction in this phenomenon is necessary for the sustainable development of the food service industry. However, the issue of the influence of various characteristics of food service establishments (FSEs) on food waste has still not been studied sufficiently. The aim of this research was to assess the impact of the type of FSE, type of customer service, time in business of the FSE, and average daily number of consumers served on measures taken in FSE in relation to ready meals in the context of food waste. Survey research was conducted in 131 FSEs. It was found that the different groups of dishes that were prepared in excess and not served to consumers are most often stored in refrigerated conditions until the following day. The management of unserved dishes was correlated with business time and the type of FSE. Dishes like cold and hot snacks, in particular, were more often made available to employees in establishments with shorter time in business. In restaurants and small food service outlets/cafés, discarding was more often indicated as the management method for these types of dishes. The majority of food service establishments were not able to sell half portions. In conclusion, there is great potential to reduce food waste in food service establishments, but education of both staff and customers is essential."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664844","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/15/6631","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6825064efdbe83139258f5d6","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Kołożyn-Krajewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"59a4ee4c-3408-4e59-ad89-c61cf7a2118a"},{"objectId":"6825064efdbe83139258f5d5","name":"Beata","lastName":"Bilska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"058cdc6b-9e0f-4536-be39-f6a6ddcaa61c"},{"objectId":"6825064efdbe83139258f5d4","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Tomaszewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a20b8a14-f575-44d3-912a-37e7e6011939"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a047392251","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Tul-Krzyszczuk","uuid":"F1A6E7EA70A48F167A6F3D74AD496A1035848FD5B2BAEE83DED4F8BB1267B929E866D8EEF2F169EBCDAD9CFF59A91706ADB3A76FFEA1686D39820772DAC31E69","orcidId":"0000-0002-6732-0346","documentHash":"6164e913-1eca-4524-b5b6-2a92f459609a"}],"doi":"10.3390/su16156631"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["li-ion","polymer electrolytes","shear thickening electrolyte","impact resistant batteries","safe lithium-ion battery"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","uid":"bIJt_NDqzpR2rNcRdakaG3g","uuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","parentUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","rootUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","name":"Politechnika Warszawska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709327878c28a0473a3c1b","634a1b297523402e3412727a","5e709429878c28a0473b7695","68249cf1fdbe83139258c857"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Shear Thickening, Star-Shaped Polymer Electrolytes for Lithium-Ion Batteries","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":null,"issn":"1420-3049","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"85ea3d3d-2670-4384-98ee-1b5b44edab21"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-08-09","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"68249cf1fdbe83139258c856","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["634a1b297523402e3412727a","68249cf1fdbe83139258c857","5e709429878c28a0473b7695","5e709327878c28a0473a3c1b"]},"issue":"16","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The safety concerns associated with current lithium-ion batteries are a significant drawback. A short-circuit within the battery’s internal components, such as those caused by a car accident, can lead to ignition or even explosion. To address this issue, a polymer shear thickening electrolyte, free from flammable solvents, has been developed. It comprises a star-shaped oligomer derived from a trimethylolpropane (TMP) core and polyether chains, along with the inclusion of 20 wt.% nanosilica. Notably, the star-shaped oligomer serves a dual function as both the solvent for the lithium salt and the continuous phase of the shear thickening fluid. The obtained electrolytes exhibit an ionic conductivity of the order of 10−6 S cm−1 at 20 °C and 10−4 S cm−1 at 80 °C, with a high Li+ transference number (t+ = 0.79). A nearly thirtyfold increase in viscosity to a value of 1187 Pa s at 25 °C and a critical shear rate of 2 s−1 were achieved.

The research is conducted using the techniques of descriptive method. The choice of these publications is intentional and dictated by the desire to contrast the site positioned as a quality site with its mass competitors. This contrast occurs at the content level and is reflected in the headlines, because mass publications actively use speech techniques that allow to quickly establish contact with the reader. The article briefly discusses the most important aspects of headlines, as well as the types and functions of synonyms in them.\nThe analysis has shown the relationship between the nature of the publication, the synonyms appearing in it and the function they fulfil. In a quality publication, headings are less expressive, as they focus mainly on the presentation of facts. In turn, the main purpose of headlines in mass publications is to attract as many readers as possible and emotionally influence them."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664855","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67ec25edfdbe8377067527be","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"24","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"97514829-d2fc-46d6-babd-b7e2b4322d4d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"259-273","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093d5878c28a0473b18e6","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Wasiluk","uuid":"3044A9877039154867BFD67AF691303C4305F4F7341AFE972801C01FD9159A5540EFB9E1044BC2E3711386F3604E0866F4143BE3F63177CB7E3822E8F7FE4F2F","orcidId":"0000-0002-8994-8177","documentHash":"e5ffbe02-eec1-4e26-822b-786165eee42d"}],"doi":"10.15290/sw.2024.24.13"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["polyphenols","training","cardiovascular risk","sport","oxidative stress","berry fruit","physical activity"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","uid":"b8_88IdVhNl7JcW-ZebuD4Q","uuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","parentUuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","rootUuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Łodzi","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092df878c28a04739e824","5e7092df878c28a04739e905","5e7092e2878c28a04739ea77"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Influence of Berry-Derived Polyphenol Supplementation on Exercise-Induced Oxidative Stress and Cardiovascular Health in Physically Active Individuals","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b9c0","mniswId":"1366","title":"Antioxidants","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-3921","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"5ec622a7-7fa9-4218-a935-9f333c764c84"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-12-19","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6824766ffdbe8313925811d1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092df878c28a04739e824","5e7092df878c28a04739e905","5e7092e2878c28a04739ea77"]},"issue":"12","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Numerous studies have documented that high-intensity or prolonged exercise is associated with increased oxidative stress and modification of antioxidant status. Polyphenol-rich dietary supplements seem to be the compounds that can upregulate the endogenous antioxidant defense system and consequently prevent muscle damage, support recovery. As berry fruits are at the top of the list of the richest polyphenol food sources, supplements containing berries have become the subject of interest in the context of counteracting exercise-induced oxidative stress and the development of cardiovascular diseases. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge on the effects of berry-derived polyphenol supplementation on exercise-induced oxidative stress and cardiovascular health in physically active individuals. Based on the available literature, blackcurrant supplementation, with its richest version being New Zealand blackcurrant extract, is the most commonly explored berry fruit, followed by chokeberries and blueberries. Although several studies have documented the significant and beneficial influence of berry-derived supplements on redox status and cardiovascular response, some inconsistencies remain. The presented findings should be interpreted with caution due the limited number of available studies, particularly with the participation of physically active individuals. Further research is needed to reveal more comprehensive and accurate data concerning the impact of berry-derived supplements on exercise-induced outcomes taking into account the type of supplement, time of administration, and dosage."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664857","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/13/12/1561","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092e2878c28a04739ea77","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kwaśniewska","uuid":"BFEBAAB22A295B36BA29D0AE6B243D0B7B1FD1AD6CACA4A72E455AC24A30DA1ECA252E8DF5EAB4ACD29A6A7CC7A8EF57F650831C844564C7D064F60DED164F52","orcidId":"0000-0003-4547-5627","documentHash":"f7aef8ab-ace6-4c12-90ed-3d3f9463b564"},{"objectId":"5e7092df878c28a04739e905","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Drygas","uuid":"5CDE8B19A355BB2381D506EA532A4D6DD65219B6AD3172E2045DFAC4AE8BE37E571A8EB4D0801B8BA00F9432FCE2638726332FA2B7945317FB420AF1D404FCA1","orcidId":"0000-0002-4351-6459","documentHash":"cf31548f-02a1-4efa-961d-5090ce602e66"},{"objectId":"5e7092df878c28a04739e824","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Ruszkowska","uuid":"8796D80112DB0E67F9C86A3AB4D7C8AC6B78D6144C81F3907BD1F5102E7F9002A91307C5C8D7118A3C09C1BAA9C83CB53184ABF1B90C85F980984528F703F922","orcidId":"0000-0002-9509-1026","documentHash":"a04c03ec-5094-42df-abff-88358208958a"}],"doi":"10.3390/antiox13121561"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65730e8e4097074b377dd724","doi":"10.18778/8331-293-4","title":"W metropolii i poza metropolią.

The analysis conducted for PPP revealed favorable phenolic and flavonoid content along with antioxidant activity. Additionally, PPP exhibited promising physicochemical features, including dietary fiber, good water holding and oil holding capacity. Patties were developed after incorporating 2, 4, 6, and 8% PPP (PPP1, PPP2, PPP3 and PPP4) respectively. The inclusion of PPP in the patties, particularly in the sample containing 8% PPP, yielded a significant elevation (P < 0.05) in dietary fiber content from 0.56 to 5.86%, accompanied by improved stability of lipids and proteins against oxidation. The incorporation of PPP at a level of 6% (PPP3) resulted in increased sensory ratings and an overall improvement in the quality of the patties. The inclusion of 8% PPP in the samples demonstrated a reduction in the total plate count of the samples from 6.96 to 5.06 log CFU/g on the 21st day of the study. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that compared to the control patties, the PPP-treated patties had less surface roughness and uneven distribution. Therefore, the incorporation of PPP has been demonstrated to be a successful approach for enhancing the patties’ storage stability and dietary fiber, which may have potential health benefits."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664860","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"4088-4107","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11694-024-02478-x","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68250862fdbe83139258fb57","name":"Syed Amir","lastName":"Ashraf","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"79cf1f4e-1e3e-49de-ae0d-329242143bee"},{"objectId":"68250862fdbe83139258fb56","name":"Mohd","lastName":"Adnan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e380f93d-5c6c-4ff2-9b2d-1965befdb95d"},{"objectId":"68250862fdbe83139258fb55","name":"Sarah Owdah","lastName":"Alomrani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4c8c4f1b-f5c9-4ea4-96aa-b660acc54cf0"},{"objectId":"68250862fdbe83139258fb54","name":"Tariq","lastName":"Khan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4f23639d-cb48-4f0a-8e94-885b632d9c9c"},{"objectId":"68250862fdbe83139258fb53","name":"Saghir","lastName":"Ahmad","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"355f9791-f53c-4a92-845b-5a34ecb5e177"},{"objectId":"68250862fdbe83139258fb52","name":"Abdul","lastName":"Haque","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9a29574c-b72b-43dd-a00b-d996ae996378"},{"objectId":"5e70943c878c28a0473b89a6","name":"Marek","lastName":"Kieliszek","uuid":"BF17B535A9DF7D5B71F0115DCAF96BF5B94A7C45AEB042E97F0F6906CA0A44B181AF535EF66D52D534049192E65B097C644136630E7ED390A314A25DE2C83EBA","orcidId":"0000-0002-5836-4865","documentHash":"f0c6999e-62a7-4e42-ac70-c769fa3373a5"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11694-024-02478-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["a cross-sectional study","adults","food intake"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70923d878c28a04739226c","5e70923d878c28a047392258","682507ebfdbe83139258f870","5e70923d878c28a04739225f","682507ebfdbe83139258f86f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Predictors of Eating Less Meat and More Plant-Based Food in the Polish Sample","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790a2","mniswId":"15295","title":"Nutrients","doi":null,"issn":"2072-6643","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"249ff7e0-f443-46aa-b5c4-21f8cf400d2e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-05-27","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682507ebfdbe83139258f86e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["682507ebfdbe83139258f86f","5e70923d878c28a04739225f","682507ebfdbe83139258f870","5e70923d878c28a04739226c","5e70923d878c28a047392258"]},"issue":"11","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The study aimed to identify predictors of the intention to eat less meat and more plant-based foods, including attitudes towards eating meat, habitual meat eating, subjective norms, and self-identity. A cross-sectional study using CAWI (Computer-Assisted Web Interview) was conducted in a group of 1003 Polish adults in 2023. To measure the predictor variables, the following tools were used: Beliefs and Eating Habits Questionnaire (KomPAN), Meat Attachment Questionnaire (MAQ), and scales to measure subjective norms and self-identity. Logistic regression analysis was used to verify associations between independent variables, and the intentions to eat more plant-based food and less meat next year were treated as dependent variables. More respondents were willing to increase their consumption of plant-based foods rather than reduce their meat consumption. The intention to consume less meat and more plant foods was more prevalent among women, older people (only intention to reduce meat consumption), and better-educated people (only intention to increase plant food consumption). Habitual frequency of eating plant foods, negative feelings about meat, and environmentally oriented identities had a stimulating effect on the intention to eat more plant foods and less meat, while experiencing pleasure in eating meat had a limiting effect on the intention to eat more plant foods and less meat. In addition, the habitual frequency of meat consumption and subjective norms reduced the likelihood of eating less meat, while no predictive effect was observed for the intention to eat more plant foods. In conclusion, educational and promotional activities to raise awareness of the link between food consumption and the environment can have a strong impact on eating less meat and more plant-based food, even among those strongly accustomed to meat consumption."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664864","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/11/1646","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682507ebfdbe83139258f870","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Gębski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"84e2efd6-b492-4ebb-bb3d-b8563044cae0"},{"objectId":"682507ebfdbe83139258f86f","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Jeżewska-Zychowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eb6d31dc-a638-42b7-9b82-874ecc2baf5f"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a04739226c","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kosicka-Gębska","uuid":"498664A249DBEEE4A40EC738A9EDA3CC0726787A20176FCB61961C124B7AC2BD1A2AA944A64E9F78A2B962422A134395C3EE2E71792D62C782F14195A8F3604F","orcidId":"0000-0002-2043-7627","documentHash":"390fc136-2670-46a9-8809-fdbbf8ec37d2"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a04739225f","name":"Marta","lastName":"Sajdakowska","uuid":"B6F93B12768DF8F2351566B118466B9A75124812F72AEA49DF485C9B1CF96E65762994BE11035E5878FAAE01F0849A6C37FA341D0D5898ABF2BFD90910287D50","orcidId":"0000-0001-9635-5719","documentHash":"97c0c771-af97-43cd-a129-abda568929ba"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a047392258","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Gutkowska","uuid":"952594336B19CCEF7F48DF8964F052EEE4759BCBD7CB0A0022B397A025FB67BEFC1A5260E7104F0C2EB7C0D0B1CDDFB99F923C2C6C51ADCDC6E6D154A781DFA9","orcidId":"0000-0002-0873-8478","documentHash":"6ddfba88-2969-47c8-8172-8a9176f34c98"}],"doi":"10.3390/nu16111646"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Piezoredox catalysis: a new tool for organic transformations","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454771cd","mniswId":"1753","title":"ARKIVOC","doi":null,"issn":"1551-7012","eissn":"1551-7004","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"7e5472aa-7e0b-436b-baf5-5e3ca8c7d1c4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682486f6fdbe836c41b8f145","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["682486f6fdbe836c41b8f147","5e7093b2878c28a0473af5db"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Piezoredox catalysis exploits the unique properties of piezoelectric materials to drive redox reactions under mechanical stress, combining sonochemistry and mechanochemistry with heterogeneous catalysis as an alternative to traditional methods.

For the SOFC stacks, the removal of sulphur contaminations from fuels is crucial as the content of sulphur compounds is strictly limited, even to dozens of mol ppb. The modelling and calculations were performed for a selected testing system of deep adsorptive purification of methanol to remove dibenzothiophene (DBT) on activated carbon (AC), where DBT was taken as a representative of compounds contaminating sulphur. An appropriate model of the adsorption column packed with activated carbon pellets was elaborated as a basis for process simulations and further techno-economic considerations. The research focused on modelling sulphur removal to achieve the required purity of methanol, then on cost analysis to optimize the proposed purification process. At the current stage, the aim of the performed studies was a preliminary check of a possibility of successfully performing deep adsorptive desulphurisation of methanol and an estimation of purification costs."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664869","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"45","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/dlibra/publication/149467/edition/132440/content","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"635c90287523405a7dcc9357","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Stankiewicz","uuid":"AB99B97E84567EF7E4DBE524BF83F9B4057916D64D2B67619C4B1C5112139C3E8E3EA87B52BA3D9C1DE2067C3D4E6163FE98A9A9D69711FFC7F8CCFEA6C75A37","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f15cb0a6-6a28-4ff7-999f-f0bcf8d4508e"},{"objectId":"5e709325878c28a0473a3b06","name":"Michał","lastName":"Lewak","uuid":"F8CE483ED379718A8CFBF04CAE847E0B6F8F5D16F6289FD05ABE38B039F805782A641F9637615B8C06A5B5D8D2BCCFF5CF5CB2385C7DF73B29BFB75EFA46C8B0","orcidId":"0000-0001-9012-8347","documentHash":"f16a491d-e007-4659-9d8b-ad55f9821fa3"},{"objectId":"5e7091ff878c28a04738e476","name":"Robert","lastName":"Cherbański","uuid":"A6C5FFD8FD1210CDA9BBD085DCB1EF70230685639A055237F8ECF0BABD5E32BBD1EA356A4CB3B8B5717C9E7CAC9CBDBD4EAFC63B3B8BDD66D49C92F095AF0B11","orcidId":"0000-0003-2649-7361","documentHash":"1bdd4dbd-a6b9-4b98-88a3-eddc723cd5cd"},{"objectId":"5e7091ff878c28a04738e462","name":"Eugeniusz","lastName":"Molga","uuid":"D0361810C8F565FF5A7B7225C2282306C8C38863B418E496BEE4BF207E8DE55C0301838E70687C0884CAD2F4D74B3BCB868767EC555056881C1DB3E0FCE5FE66","orcidId":"0000-0002-4788-3117","documentHash":"4440571d-78c1-4541-bd8d-570add5d89df"}],"doi":"10.24425/cpe.2024.149467"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"673719cafdbe831984706369","doi":"10.53271/2024.008","title":"Medycyna estetyczna.

We also evaluated expression of such nodulation genes as NIC1, NOD21, and NORKb. The following inoculants were used: Nitragina IUNG, Nitragina Biofood, Nitroflora Mycoflor, Rhizobium Bio-Gen, and HiStick® Soy. The study was carried out on plants grown in pots in an open foil tunnel or glasshouse conditions. Experimental seeds were inoculated before sowing, while the control ones were not. Physiological and biochemical analyses involved the leaves, and gene expression was investigated in the roots. The bacterial inoculants significantly affected individual parameters of chlorophyll a fluorescence. The highest photochemical efficiency was induced by Nitroflora Mycoflor, which also activated nitrate reductase to the greatest extent. Nitragina IUNG most strongly stimulated accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, facilitated formation of the greatest number of nodules, and improved seed yield per plant in comparison with the control and other inoculants. Of the studied nodulation genes, NIC1 showed the strongest expression following HiStick®Soy treatment. Nitragina Biofood and Nitragina IUNG most significantly reduced the expression of all studied genes. Expression of NOD21 and NORKb exposed to other inoculants was the same as in the control plants. High content of hydrogen peroxide can be considered a marker of the inoculant ability to increase nodulation and yield of soybean. Commercial preparations containing the same amount of B. japonicum but different carriers of bacteria show different ability to form root nodules, and their differential impact on yield is related to the intensity of nodulation and expression of the Nod genes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664876","journalIssue":{"objectId":"659f9f2a40970707a1275f5b","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"24","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"d145b28b-6742-485c-90f6-9995d41c9a31"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12870-024-05911-x.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68247966fdbe836c41b7dec5","name":"Franciszek","lastName":"Dubert","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f00c4fc2-0b62-4dd8-89a5-3fd954c21c63"},{"objectId":"68247966fdbe836c41b7dec4","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Wójcik-Jagła","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"023c9c13-035b-4185-9f0f-ed51797e5de3"},{"objectId":"68247966fdbe836c41b7dec3","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Płażek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b2aec7e6-eab2-499a-a31d-ec4227f76e4f"},{"objectId":"68247966fdbe836c41b7dec2","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szczerba","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"caca16be-5e7c-473d-82df-0d56fb8f9c1b"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473a9dc0","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Kopeć","uuid":"E1820DB4116E272CE23C0C1255497908B37054A5BEFF8EBE7F84498F049140E9BB886011FF0BE8E99B38987F0090F6509D307848BDE5C7DD40F5B330F3828BEF","orcidId":"0000-0002-0008-4860","documentHash":"e46c66f5-859e-4111-8429-1b0a2fd92052"}],"doi":"10.1186/s12870-024-05911-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Extreme Learning Machine","Neural networks","Machine learning","Artificial intelligence","Python","TensorFlow"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["615fad2875234017e0505d73","5e7092e6878c28a04739ee2f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"TfELM: Extreme Learning Machines framework with Python and TensorFlow","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547ea5b","mniswId":"26500","title":"SoftwareX","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2352-7110","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b6a1ff98-7502-42f9-89fc-063a7f8dbec1"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2024-08-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682501bdfdbe83139258e69b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["615fad2875234017e0505d73","5e7092e6878c28a04739ee2f"]},"issue":"27","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"TfELM introduces an innovative Python framework leveraging TensorFlow for Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs), offering a comprehensive suite for diverse machine learning (ML) tasks.

It may be that the clinical significance of FGFR ought to be analysed in the context of the stroma, activating or repressing its function. The present review aimed to provide such a context by summarizing the existing data on the prognostic and/or predictive value of selected cancer‑associated fibroblasts (CAFs)‑related factors, that either directly or indirectly may affect FGFR‑signalling. PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and Medline (https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medline/medline_home.html) databases were searched for the relevant literature related to the prognostic and/or predictive significance of: CAFs phenotypic markers (αSMA, S100A4/FSP‑1, PDGFR, PDPN and FAP), CAFs‑derived cognate FGFR ligands (FGF2, FGF5 and FGF17) or inducers of CAFs' paracrine activity (TGF‑β1, HDGF, PDGF, CXCL8, CCL5, CCL2, IL‑6, HH and EGF) both expressed in the tumour and circulating in the blood. A total of 68 articles were selected and thoroughly analysed. The findings consistently identified upregulation of αSMA, S100A4/FSP‑1, PDGFR, PDPN, HDGF, PDGF, CXCL8, CCL5, CCL2, IL‑6, HH and EGF as poor prognostic markers in BC, while evaluation of the prognostic value of the remaining markers varied between the studies. The data confirm an association of CAFs‑specific features with BC prognosis, suggesting that both quantitative and qualitative profiling of the stroma might be required for an assessment of the true FGFR's clinical value."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664881","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"65","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.spandidos-publications.com/10.3892/ijo.2024.5682","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682466a3fdbe831392576b42","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Sadej","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ac4181e0-86d6-441a-b1f0-4f7e454bdaf9"},{"objectId":"682466a3fdbe831392576b41","name":"Julia","lastName":"Solek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"254a8143-13b2-4e3e-a344-4bc218ddc0b0"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7d67","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Romańska-Knight","uuid":"2141AAF1142FA39570A986764FB70C1DE93F95CF64EC0BFC2E251271BF013CE3EA3E0AC01FDBE49BD1D4FAE5EA02A407FE88EDD42EB380AAA0B02F8172AFDC4D","orcidId":"0000-0002-2328-710X","documentHash":"dc4f1aa4-3edb-418d-a1a1-f7bb44bd6a4d"},{"objectId":"5e7092db878c28a04739e487","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Braun","uuid":"4362C3BD6F5C4B7880DB9ADA36261C30A52BAA5312920056E3E36AFDC661DD1206AF22B2931B5C40C6A2601EFCD3999713CFACDFED06AB6F75E9E227BB5E9E18","orcidId":"0000-0003-3804-7042","documentHash":"bc691c66-b511-4b97-9db4-84b47e9846b3"}],"doi":"10.3892/ijo.2024.5682"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2025,"isbn":"978-1-041-03011-9","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[],"type":"BOOK","title":"Smart Universities in Smart Cities.

systems of electropneumatic automation are one of the main classes of industrial automation systems. A laboratory stand for the study of the mechatronic system of automatic control of the pneumatic manipulator and a computer model for preliminary experiments on the adjustment of the automatic control system were developed. Manual and software control modes are provided for research of indicators of safety and quality of management in both modes. To implement the software control mode, a microcontroller part of the laboratory stand based on ADuC841 was developed, with the help of which it is possible to simulate a part of a certain technological process, to detect and eliminate faults in the automatic control system. A study of automatic control systems using a traditional relay-contactor control system, based on GrafCet technology and using a virtual controller. The combination of computer modeling of technological processes and physical modeling of executive mechanisms is a kind of digital double that displays its state, parameters and behavior in real time. The use of a laboratory stand in combination with an adequate simulation model reduces the complexity of developing control systems for practical applications, and also contributes to the formation of students' creative component, ability to analyze the results, and make decisions in unusual situations, which will increase their theoretical and practical training. The study of mechatronic systems of pneumatic manipulators will allow to increase their efficiency and productivity, to optimize their speed and accuracy for various applications in production. The interaction of mechatronic systems of pneumatic manipulators with other technologies, such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, IoT is the basis for creating more integrated and intelligent systems."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664893","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-56672-4","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68250390fdbe83139258ea88","name":"Iryna","lastName":"Horetska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"052ac062-f93c-43f5-9214-ef63d67a2dc6"},{"objectId":"68250390fdbe83139258ea87","name":"Vadym","lastName":"Hulevskyi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b64894b6-f476-44ce-b67c-b01dad7d61ca"},{"objectId":"68250390fdbe83139258ea86","name":"Taras","lastName":"Hutsol","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c42fca29-0ad0-4639-8c57-e2191764c99f"},{"objectId":"68250390fdbe83139258ea85","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Osadchyy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"78cd97b5-a2e5-46a1-9239-93b0f3d75089"},{"objectId":"68250390fdbe83139258ea84","name":"Olena","lastName":"Nazarova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c1e404a5-1159-4df7-ae8d-ce568f4b55b7"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a047392465","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Nurek","uuid":"0A7AAEA1CFEF037180069638C55BAD8071E9BEE15EAD26322162EC9696FF7B25A59D3A4AB21299DBFBA92D9F720F3547A7BFB0BA737BECC01F911DA10D4FD63C","orcidId":"0000-0003-2821-3377","documentHash":"4685ade8-76eb-4b5a-8afd-4be4c7ab5bb1"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a04739245c","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Głowacki","uuid":"7DF8668A806EF12045EAFBDA69B212828860D29AAE52471C7B5604BAE429E77F1D829B784973C89694B1D2EE6569C375A0D1883B5368D2FFE75B5567013BB570","orcidId":"0000-0002-0373-6633","documentHash":"b0c2c89a-29cc-4d4f-afc1-6b3b53914c14"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-024-56672-4"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Edible insects\nSalt-assisted extraction methods\nProtein functional properties\nRheological analysis\nProtein solubility"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["68250517fdbe83139258f31b","68250517fdbe83139258f31e","68250517fdbe83139258f31d","68250517fdbe83139258f31f","5e709347878c28a0473a6614","68250517fdbe83139258f320"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Edible insect protein concentrates: Optimized salt-assisted extraction methods evaluation","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477d0f","mniswId":"6692","title":"Food Chemistry","doi":null,"issn":"0308-8146","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"fbfaf7a2-0f1a-4862-bf5b-dc2e67514105"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"68250517fdbe83139258f31a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["68250517fdbe83139258f31b","68250517fdbe83139258f31c","68250517fdbe83139258f31d","5e709347878c28a0473a6614","68250517fdbe83139258f31e","68250517fdbe83139258f31f","68250517fdbe83139258f320"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study explores the extraction of proteins from edible insects such as Tenebrio molitor, Acheta domesticus, and Locusta migratoria using alkaline extraction and acid precipitation (AEAP) as a control method and evaluates the influence of salting-in (NaCl-assisted), salting-out ((NH₄)₂SO₄), and combined salting-in/out techniques on the resulting protein quality and functional properties. We hypothesized that salt-assisted methods would enhance protein extraction efficiency and functionality compared to AEAP. Molecular size distribution analysis confirmed that the salting-out method preferentially aggregated smaller proteins (<30 kDa). FT-IR spectroscopy revealed notable changes in protein secondary structure across extraction methods, while amino acid profiling identified 17 amino acids, with essential amino acids (EAAs) comprising 37.8–44.2 % of total amino acids. Salt-assisted methods significantly increased the zeta potential (up to −62.67 mV) and modulated particle size distribution (180–492 nm) compared to the control samples. Rheological properties varied with extraction techniques, with potential fluid-type transitions. Proteins extracted via salt-assisted methods demonstrated high purity (>70 %), enhanced solubility (>60 % at pH 7.4), improved oil- and water-holding capacities (1.40–8.09 g/g, 2.41–4.4 g/g), and superior emulsifying properties (EAI >47 m2 g−1, ESI >50 %). These findings highlight that salt-assisted extraction methods can improve the quality and functionality of insect protein concentrates, supporting their potential for food-grade applications."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664895","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"466","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814624038755","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68250517fdbe83139258f320","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Kurek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7969993a-841b-4a50-8414-2fda0075126b"},{"objectId":"68250517fdbe83139258f31f","name":"Havva","lastName":"Aktas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"94809e2f-feee-4f7c-b6ab-00af052f3c4b"},{"objectId":"68250517fdbe83139258f31e","name":"Jorge","lastName":"Custodio Mendoza","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8d9b9645-4d5b-4b40-a538-88263492cf48"},{"objectId":"68250517fdbe83139258f31d","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Moczkowska-Wyrwisz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"376aa5dd-e3dc-4172-9299-6051bd5d624e"},{"objectId":"68250517fdbe83139258f31c","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Michałowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"42a5918f-7907-4672-8116-b155e343fe2b"},{"objectId":"68250517fdbe83139258f31b","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Pokorski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a228664e-97f4-4dde-b52e-d57705df8ce1"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6614","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Strojny-Cieślak","uuid":"282953FF58491C1238C16B177387789F1434777E6A4E0EA0A20A82540F466B0AA5F36753BA43CA5670329D3F21117CE6F78638FF85EB5F60EB9471DB9447FE3E","orcidId":"0000-0002-2642-5491","documentHash":"45adc1c1-5ede-4872-abff-bbaf18995efe"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.foodchem.2024.142225"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["opłata za korzystanie z przystanków i dworców","prawo administracyjne","zasada równości","publiczny transport zbiorowy"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["principle of equality","public transport","administrative law","fee for the use of public transport stops and stations"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","uid":"bIJt_NDqzpR2rNcRdakaG3g","uuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","parentUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","rootUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","name":"Politechnika Warszawska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6338f7a87523402e340e4915"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"(Nie)dyskryminacyjne zasady ustalania wysokości opłat za korzystanie z przystanków komunikacyjnych i dworców – glosa częściowo krytyczna do wyroku Wojewódzkiego Sądu Administracyjnego w Poznaniu z 26 kwietnia 2023 r.

In this ruling, the Court accepted that non-discriminatory principles in setting the rates of fees for all operators and carriers must take into account the assurance of equal treatment of all carriers, which, in its opinion, simultaneously contradicts setting the rate at a uniform level.  This position requires a more in-depth commentary and the embedding of these considerations in the existing line of judgments of the administrative courts and the legal doctrine.\n\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664898","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"108-113","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.wolterskluwer.com/pl-pl/news/orzecznictwo-w-sprawach-samorzadowych-2-2023","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6338f7a87523402e340e4915","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Hadel","uuid":"624D763A9E290F51CD7BFB30FEBC363FB35D4CB9AA66C44E93097EFE2C7218F4E1B8AE72617BF814DADE67D5580DCE36B7CF9E05C54A911F5EE4EAC3115636AE","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c897bba2-9566-487b-8d07-6bdbfe3728e7"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ffd447c085dcb6be6b60a19"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Corporate foundations compared to foundations in Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547766f","mniswId":"3732","title":"Civil Szemle","doi":null,"issn":"1786-3341","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"0269f662-03f4-418a-9c8f-615d44912c20"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682506a1fdbe83139258f622","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5ffd447c085dcb6be6b60a19"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747261664901","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"72","pagesFromTo":"91-104","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.civilszemle.hu/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/72-Civil-Szemle-20223-3.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ffd447c085dcb6be6b60a19","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Mincewicz","uuid":"FCD951E7023F3E1BAC5E9670A5BC76B2B2A9E0024533DD9D99E3E948F86056B200D330FD2327B10F16271F128950EB21B75F24BB579B47DBC7AB5FA2DCA6F45B","orcidId":"0000-0003-0460-9158","documentHash":"ccebe1c8-b2d9-40b8-bc48-326e511ed268"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Lactation","Body mass index (BMI)","Respiratory quotient (RQ)","Resting energy expenditure (RMR)","Adipokine","Substrate oxidation"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6825081ffdbe83139258f967","6825081ffdbe83139258f968","5e70923d878c28a047392249"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"No effect of circulating leptin on energy metabolism in normal weight or overweight/obese lactating mothers: The case-control Breastmilk and the Link to Overweight/Obesity and Maternal diet (BLOOM) study","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547d9eb","mniswId":"21677","title":"Clinical Nutrition ESPEN","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2405-4577","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"6bbd7a1e-8f88-451f-8d5d-47b89abb1ee7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-02","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6825081ffdbe83139258f966","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6825081ffdbe83139258f967","6825081ffdbe83139258f968","5e70923d878c28a047392249"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background & aims: Pregnancy and lactation are associated with metabolic changes, including alterations in energy metabolism, which are closely linked to body mass and composition due to hormonal\nstatus. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the energy metabolism in exclusively or predominantly breastfeeding mothers with normal weight (NW) and overweight/obesity (OW/OB) and\nevaluate its associations with fasting serum leptin.\nMethods: This cross-sectional BLOOM study was conducted among 39 mothers (n ¼ 19 NW, n ¼ 20 OW/ OB) in 15.5 ± 1.2 weeks of lactation. The leptin was analyzed in a blood sample using an enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assay, body composition was analyzed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and resting metabolic rate (RMR) was measured by indirect calorimetry method. Results: The average RMR for all groups was 1747.5 ± 281.9 kcal/d, with a statistically significant difference between groups (1932.7 ± 222.6 vs. 1550.5 ± 190.6, p < 0.001, respectively in the OW/OB and NW group). The OW/OB mothers had higher oxygen uptake (VO2) and exhaled carbon dioxide (VCO2), but\nnot respiratory quotient (RQ), carbohydrate (CHO%) and lipid oxidation (FAT%). When analyzing correlations stratified by BMI category, we found that serum leptin was correlated with CHO% negatively, and\nwith FAT% positively in the NW but not in OW/OB mothers. Additionally, serum leptin was a significant predictor of RMR, VCO2, VO2, CHO%, and RMR/kg of total body weight. However, after adjusting for\nconfounders, the observed associations were no longer statistically significant (RMR: b ¼ 0.113, 95% CI 0.354e0.319; VO2: b ¼ 0.141, 95% CI 0.462e0.744; VCO2: b ¼ 0.238, 95% CI 0.411e0.888; CHO%:\nb ¼ 0.146, 95% CI 0.151e0.444; RMR/kg of total body weight: b ¼ 0.294, 95% CI 0.831e0.244).

The objective was to explore how sexual dimorphism and size influence cranial structures using advanced 3D geometric morphometric methods. Three-dimensional models of the skulls and mandibles of 12 brown bears were used. Differences in skull morphology between male and female brown bears were observed in this study. The male brown bear skull, larger than the female, exhibited a more pronounced extension of the upper part of the nuchal region towards the posterior. Additionally, the posterior part of the frontal region appeared notably thinner in male brown bears compared to females. Analysis of the mandible revealed that the masseteric fossa was more developed in males than females. These shape differences between males and females were found to be influenced by body size. Statistical analyses indicated a significant allometric effect of body size on skull PC1 values, suggesting that giant bears tend to have more elongated skulls. This implies a relationship in which larger individuals exhibit greater cranial elongation. In contrast, mandible PC1 values showed no size-related variation, indicating that mandibular shape is less influenced by overall body size. However, PC2 values in the mandible increased significantly with larger specimens, indicating a larger masseteric fossa in larger bears. This morphological adaptation potentially enhances feeding efficiency and bite strength in larger individuals, reflecting functional adaptations in brown-bear mandibular morphology. These findings contribute to our understanding of sexual dimorphism and size-related morphological adaptations in brown bears, providing insights into their adaptation biology and ecological roles within their habitats."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664906","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/14/17/2541","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68250745fdbe83139258f684","name":"Ozan","lastName":"Gündemir","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"096da7ae-2711-42d1-b9b4-436dbb5e781c"},{"objectId":"68250745fdbe83139258f683","name":"Ebru

methods of assessing land fragmentation (LF) are mainly based on analysis of parameters at the level of plots and individual farms. However, existing methods appear to be insufficient in the assessment of the spatial structure of land at the regional and national levels. The aim of the research is to propose an effective way of comparing the land fragmentation parameters that determine the profitability of agriculture. To estimate the parameters of large-area land fragmentation, data on the spatial distribution of rural settlements and on average land fragmentation parameters were used. A grid-based structure was employed. The grid cell size represents the average size of plots, whereas the numerical values associated with grid cells represent the minimum distances of plots from farm buildings. Using the aforementioned grid and data on the impact on operating costs of plot size and distance from settlements, spatial indicators were obtained that show the diversity of economic costs related to the examined land fragmentation parameters. The obtained results showed a very large variation in the operating conditions of the farms, depending on the LF parameters. The average size of cultivated fields ranges from 0.5 ha (Pakistan) to 67.2 ha (Slovakia), while the average distance of plots from farm buildings ranges from 334 m (China) to 2781 m (Turkey), although the maximum observed values for straight-line distances significantly exceed 7 km, and this value increases to 10 km when the orthogonal layout of roads is taken into account. The density of field boundaries varies from 250 m/ha to over 3500 m/ha, and the associated estimated loss of cultivated area may reach 1.5% of the total cultivated land area (Pakistan). In economic terms, the variability in land cultivation costs related to the size of plots and their distance from buildings varies from 535 EUR/ha/year (Slovakia) to 1412 EUR/ha/year (Greece), which indicates a nearly threefold difference in this aspect. The proposed approach should facilitate an assessment of the competitiveness of agriculture in individual countries. It can also be used when planning land consolidation projects, assessing the risks associated with land abandonment, estimating the negative impact on the environment of fossil fuel combustion effects in agriculture, and determining the impact of land fragmentation parameters on poverty and migration phenomena in rural areas."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664910","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67bc3407fdbe833d436fa024","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"140","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"a911276e-5c5e-47b3-91c8-dd9219ec7d01"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"140","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0197397523001716?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682459ccfdbe836c41b4ae7b","name":"Hrvoje","lastName":"Tomić","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e48a1d4c-d594-477c-9467-52c2b2d26250"},{"objectId":"682459ccfdbe836c41b4ae7a","name":"Zlatica","lastName":"Muchová","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4692527a-abff-443a-94d8-7628158ead85"},{"objectId":"682459ccfdbe836c41b4ae79","name":"Ela","lastName":"Ertunç","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eb8a98a7-5f64-46cb-a5c6-effd88a91b61"},{"objectId":"5e709309878c28a0473a185f","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Janus","uuid":"70D8206F04808F2CCC5A963C098C457545644B9A1987275ECB911DEE9DB3E9DC5018F4620C2F2566AE7B8E2A477D65EB646A77ADC5AF63BB4F6EFFD1CA6D7FA1","orcidId":"0000-0003-1725-1589","documentHash":"25dea30b-cb6d-4291-a419-8caacac63ba5"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.habitatint.2023.102911"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["furniture","circular economy","recycling","particleboard","window frames"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70923d878c28a0473923f5","68250595fdbe83139258f35d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Supporting Circular Economy Principles by Recycling Window Frames into Particleboard","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1944","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-08-21","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"68250595fdbe83139258f35c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["68250595fdbe83139258f35d","5e70923d878c28a0473923f5"]},"issue":"16","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the study was to identify limiting factors for reusing wood through the recycling of window frames by conducting research under fully controlled conditions.

The proportion of wood particles in recycling was 0, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 parts by weight of the manufactured particleboard. Mechanical property tests were conducted: modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR), internal bond (IB), screw withdrawal resistance (SWR), and physical properties: density profile (DP), thickness swelling (TS) after water immersion, water absorption (WA), as well as formaldehyde emission and total volatile organic compound (TVOCs) tests. The research indicates a significant potential for utilizing wood from this sector of the wood industry, particularly considering variants with a higher proportion of recycled wood. MOR and MOE results are most promising for variants above 50 parts by weight of recycled wood. Based on the results obtained, it is clear that the production process should be improved or the raw material modified to enhance the internal bonding of particleboard, as\nthese results were the weakest.

study investigates the potential of utilizing hazelnut shells (HS) as an innovative filler in three-layer plywood technology, addressing the growing need for sustainable, high-performance materials. Traditional plywood production relies on adhesives enhanced with various fillers to improve physical, mechanical, and operational characteristics. This research explores using native, chemically modified, and activated carbon derived from hazelnut shells as fillers in ureaformaldehyde (UF) resin. The produced plywood’s mechanical properties, water absorption, and formaldehyde emissions were thoroughly analyzed. Key findings demonstrate that incorporating 10 part by weight (pbw) native hazelnut shell flour significantly enhances the modulus of rupture (MOR) to 138.6 N mm−2 and modulus of elasticity (MOE) to 13,311 N mm−2. Chemically modified hazelnut shell flour achieves optimal results at 5 pbw, while activated carbon from hazelnut shells, even at 1 pbw, markedly improves bonding strength (2.79 N mm−2 referred to 0.81 N mm−2 for reference sample without filler added). Notably, activated carbon effectively reduces formaldehyde emissions (2.72 mg 100 g−1 oven dry panel referred to 3.32 mg 100 g−1 oven dry panel for reference samples with\n10 pbw filler) and improves water resistance, indicating better further dimensional stability and lower environmental impact. The study also shows that excessive filler content negatively affects strength parameters, confirming the importance of optimizing filler concentration. These results highlight the potential of hazelnut shells as an eco-friendly alternative filler in plywood production, contributing to waste valorization and environmental sustainability. This study supports the practical application of hazelnut shell fillers, promoting a circular economy and reducing reliance on traditional, less sustainable materials, thus providing a valuable solution for the wood composite industry."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664916","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/16/4128","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682505b8fdbe83139258f471","name":"Damian","lastName":"Wojnicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d1c7d8a5-6889-488a-b2c1-1d991b233c08"},{"objectId":"682505b8fdbe83139258f470","name":"Marta","lastName":"Wronka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6369f1b2-0e9a-45d1-8466-de4a87e70a8a"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923f5","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Kowaluk","uuid":"68FBD120BB38A98CBB3EEA3BD6ED9F0498687633ADB279D51D69CAD676E465F0F6ED590B66AD118E477534CC7E2DEE92CB80B1E7A1B838ECEB1636F9AAA2E01E","orcidId":"0000-0003-1463-0540","documentHash":"99b518a0-3f6f-4b31-8930-dee3b8571abf"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17164128"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sustainable development","nature protection","technical infrastructure","zero unitarization method","multi-criteria analysis"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709249878c28a04739311e","5e709259878c28a0473941ef"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Classification of Municipalities Located in National Parks in Poland with Respect to the Wastewater and Waste Management","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a017","mniswId":"10838","title":"Journal of Ecological Engineering","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2299-8993","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"c03b3c69-b063-4cf4-ba6e-ee68672b7011"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-08-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682503fbfdbe83139258ebca","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709249878c28a04739311e","5e709259878c28a0473941ef"]},"issue":"9","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The study concerns waste and waste water management in municipalities located within borders of national parks in Poland.

An efficient and cost-effective salting-out assisted liquid–liquid extraction (SALLE) method has been developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of six catechins and caffeine in tea and wine samples using high-performance liquid chromatography–ultraviolet (HPLC–UV). This method demonstrates outstanding performance: linearity (1–120 µg/mL, r2 > 0.999), accuracy (96.5%–103.4% recovery), and precision (≤14.7% relative standard deviation), meeting validation requirements set by the US Food and Drug Administration. The reduced sample size (0.1 g) minimizes matrix interferences and costs without compromising sensitivity. All analytes were detected in Camellia sinensis teas, with green tea displaying the highest total catechin content (47.5–100.1 mg/mL), followed by white and black teas. Analysis of wine samples reveals the presence of catechin in all red and white wines, and epigallocatechin gallate in all red wine samples, highlighting the impact of winemaking processes on catechin content. The SALLE–HPLC–UV approach represents a green alternative by eliminating organic waste, surpassing conventional dilution methods in specificity and sensitivity for catechin determination. AGREEprep assessment emphasizes the strengths of the SALLE procedure, including material reusability, throughput efficiency, minimal sample requirements, low energy consumption, and the absence of organic waste generation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664920","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"47","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jssc.202400142","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68250799fdbe83139258f6a8","name":"Antonia M.","lastName":"Carro","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a87bb1b8-1d99-45ea-9cfe-3136a561a714"},{"objectId":"68250799fdbe83139258f6a7","name":"Havva","lastName":"Aktas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5a1ca1a2-50e9-46f9-be47-2416eb3fcf39"},{"objectId":"68250799fdbe83139258f6a6","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Pokorski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1d392985-df5e-4ae8-8968-c45d285100c9"},{"objectId":"68250799fdbe83139258f6a5","name":"Jorge","lastName":"Custodio Mendoza","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7a8361bf-dfbc-4bcd-9584-20ae3eb99b91"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a0473993b1","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Kurek","uuid":"E6AFF50DBBB1BF4D0A6AA2C1CA3388CF3FEA03579936F75C43C580DF90E67A497E37F90C751B0202D74C14BB94DBACB625BA535629EF8EE35E20D96A8AB11905","orcidId":"0000-0002-1544-5251","documentHash":"fdeae7e6-b4d2-4525-abc1-053cce9d4c2a"}],"doi":"10.1002/jssc.202400142"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["teacher","knowledge and skills","upbringing process","trainer","sport coach","training","learning","integral development","personality development"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["640876d87523405b4c2b2fcc"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Common features of the process of influencing young people used by sports coach and teacher","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa83c9aff2974850cd64","mniswId":"484053","title":"Transformacje","doi":null,"issn":"1230-0292","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"d344df13-519a-4c72-8650-b8414d186e1c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682506e7fdbe83139258f63e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["640876d87523405b4c2b2fcc"]},"issue":"4 (119)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents characteristics of the upbringing process used by the sports coach\nand the teacher, which are in line with the ideas of the environmental upbringing system,\nwhich creates favorable conditions for the multilateral and continuous learning process\nof the individual student and the development of his potential abilities.

Usually there are periodical weather patterns in the winter period with substantial amounts of wind energy production. Sometimes this results in a shut-off of the wind turbines due to the inability of the grid to use the produced power (overproduction). This paper assesses two thermal storage systems to service space heating and domestic hot water that exploit the overproduction of electricity and thereby bridge periods of lower electricity production. The first system utilizes inner walls and ceilings with a thermally activated building system (TABS) to store and dissipate heat. The second system is a stand-alone high temperature stone storage system (HTSS). Models to simulate such systems within a whole building simulation framework are introduced and the verification with measured data from field measurements is presented. Both models are used to assess the systems with regard to the speed of loading and the potential to bridge time periods without additional heating in high-performance buildings. It is shown that both systems can provide heating and domestic hot water (DHW) up to 13 days without substantial additional electricity."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664926","journalIssue":{"objectId":"68248c47fdbe836c41b9c20d","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2654","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"1536f5a7-e485-4b82-8aa0-446d782f8710"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2654","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2654/1/012104","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68248c47fdbe836c41b9c213","name":"H","lastName":"Sinnesbichler","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"310bd0ba-d616-4ae0-b307-8b4e5ecb15c8"},{"objectId":"68248c47fdbe836c41b9c212","name":"M","lastName":"Kersken","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ca11555e-90dc-4223-a033-b0bdeae83f55"},{"objectId":"68248c47fdbe836c41b9c211","name":"F","lastName":"Antretter","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e0f75ff1-c177-4acd-a66f-fdb77022a223"},{"objectId":"68248c47fdbe836c41b9c210","name":"F","lastName":"Sirtl","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"41259428-83a0-451d-b980-966e1c97622f"},{"objectId":"68248c47fdbe836c41b9c20f","name":"F","lastName":"Hanen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e7d3e21f-1225-4d6a-ba01-1aaed5a304a4"},{"objectId":"68248c47fdbe836c41b9c20e","name":"M","lastName":"Pazold","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e4997f47-008e-4c52-bd8c-0bef6141988c"},{"objectId":"5e709309878c28a0473a188f","name":"Jan","lastName":"Radoń","uuid":"9FCEC1C216B256DD08D3ADAFA40C1BDE84BFF21F30C6B28A173FBE82B40391A01EED473D36F0A67432F22DD8C0A7A1A3F4022181EA26E3D9379AE2D0049A262E","orcidId":"0000-0002-2119-4903","documentHash":"e2943eb6-262c-4683-9efe-5ddf5c39eafc"}],"doi":"10.1088/1742-6596/2654/1/012104"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fatty acids","carotenoids","blackberry pomace","volatile compounds","chlorophylls","extracts"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70923b878c28a047392231","68250847fdbe83139258fa7e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Supercritical CO2 and Conventional Extraction of Bioactive Compounds from Different Cultivars of Blackberry (Rubus fruticosus L.)

For Soxhlet extraction, two different solvents, ethanol and n-hexane, were used. Qualitative and quantitative composition of fatty acids was determined by GC, carotenoids and chlorophylls by HPLC, and volatile organic compounds were identified with an e-nose based on GC. The yield of the extract was influenced by the extraction, while the qualitative content of the extracts was also dependent on the cultivar. While there were no differences in the types of fatty acids extracted, their content varied significantly depending on the cultivar, extraction method, and their interaction. The results showed that linoleic acid (C18:2), oleic acid (C18:1), and α-linolenic acid (C18:3) were the most prevalent in all cultivars of blackberry pomace extracts. The linoleic acid content varied from 33.33 to 64.77% depending on the variety, and the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 varied from 3.17% to 5.71%. Significantly higher quantities of carotenoids and chlorophylls were obtained in Soxhlet extraction with n-hexane in all extracts. The major carotenoid in the ‘Orkan’ and ‘Polar’ extracts was lutein, while in the ‘Brzezina’ extract, it was β-carotene.

It is therefore, imperative to investigate the interaction of these biomolecules in plants subjected to heavy metal stress. The concomitant effects of Ca2+ and/or\nJA on the physiological mechanism associated with metalloid stress tolerance are still not substantially\nexplored in tomato seedlings. Present study unveils the synergistic role of Ca2+ and JA in mitigation of arsenic\ntoxicity (As) in tomato seedlings. Present evidence reveals that plant grown in As toxicity conditions exhibited a decrease in growth attributes (shoot length, shoot fresh weight and shoot dry weight) and supressed\nthe biosynthesis mechanism of chlorophyll (Chl), nutrients homeostasis [Ca2+, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P),\nand potassium (K)] and glyoxalase system. Exogenous As induced the over production of reactive oxygen\nspecies (ROS) and methylglyoxal (MG), and enhanced Chl degrading enzyme [chlorophyllase (Chlase) activity\nin tomato seedlings. However, exogenous application of Ca2+ and/or JA supressed the adverse effect of As.\nMoreover, combined application of Ca2+ and JA was found to be more effective than their individual effects\nto the seedlings. Application of Ca2+ and JA together significantly enhanced the biosynthesis of Chl by\nsupressing Chlase activity and enhancing the d-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (d-ALAD) activity (a Chl synthesising enzyme) and also improved activity of glyoxalase I (Gly I) and Gly II activity (responsible for the\ndetoxification of MG ). Exogenous supply of Ca2+ and JA maintained the balance supply of nutrients and glycine betaine in tomato seedlings under As toxicity conditions. Combined application of Ca2+ and JA supressed\nthe overproduction of ROS by modulating activity of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase,\nascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase. When Ca2+ and JA were supplied with the Ca2+-chelator\nEGTA (ethylene glycol-bis(b-aminoethylether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid), the efficacy of Ca2+ was eliminated,\nconfirming the participation of Ca2+ and JA in mitigation of As toxicity. Thus, it is evident that Ca2+ and JA\ntogether mediated As tolerance of tomato seedlings t by improving physiological defence mechanisms."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261664935","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"150","pagesFromTo":"14-25","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S025462992200326X","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682504eafdbe83139258f187","name":"Zafarul","lastName":"Hasan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d34e8a80-ad53-4037-bdef-f63da6950865"},{"objectId":"682504eafdbe83139258f186","name":"Hayssam M","lastName":"Ali","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"12455d58-21fb-4bfe-b296-708c4f5f8519"},{"objectId":"682504eafdbe83139258f185","name":"Saud","lastName":"Alamri","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b8fbcbcf-3861-4732-82d0-84ea3f62141f"},{"objectId":"682504eafdbe83139258f184","name":"Soumya","lastName":"Mukherjee","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3eddbdb5-57a6-4568-a8ec-dd5ae81708a9"},{"objectId":"682504eafdbe83139258f183","name":"Manzer H","lastName":"Siddiqui","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b7fd8310-2b98-4b9e-ba23-2ec9f94bf1ea"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941bf","name":"Mohamed","lastName":"Kalaji","uuid":"E980832F46BD43DEC3B7BE0AF6953EFF6EFA2450F0F24597D0811CF571F4A5B08DE7D49F0E697901B7A39E422A74CF9108BC2BF9E4A67F966407BBFE73E43426","orcidId":"0000-0002-3833-4917","documentHash":"63337622-ec27-4520-9587-1f4a884fc748"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.sajb.2022.06.030"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzI2MTY2NDkzNQ=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
