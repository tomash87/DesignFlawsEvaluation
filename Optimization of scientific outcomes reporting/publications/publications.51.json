Individuals, companies, and supply chains face challenges emerging from economic, sociological, and political phenomena. These phenomena disrupt regular performance and limit the efficient functioning of companies and economies. Due to numerous relations and connections in the economy, disruptions in one area affect the others and spread, growing in range and severity. Hence, disruptions should be dealt with to provide continuity of supply chains and to ensure their efficient and effective performance. The study aims to identify crucial characteristics of disruptions to facilitate disruption minimization strategies. The characteristics of disruptions in supply chains are identified based on a literature review, synthesized and validated by the experts. A study is implemented to validate identified characteristics and to confront theoretical findings with the practical experience and observations of the experts. The results of the study are discussed and commented on. The conclusions from the study refer to the nature and characteristics of disruptions in the contemporary economy, equipping managers with useful knowledge when dealing with disruptions, and academics with observations that can stimulate further discussion on stability, flexibility, and resilience of companies and supply chains."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149539","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b30925409707737cf519c7","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"13","doi":null,"documentHash":"6d3d4e41-2f09-492c-9423-5a7dd3a0a115"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"4579-1 - 4579-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/13/4579","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473aeaca","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Grzybowska","uuid":"DD255F6D56C58D28571E86B00B5C921C2C57622079A6F62BAB89668A2D8AED5E851DC05C08DC9EE3CC024C292A2C6F802817811A7FBB400294A1D1BD755E2B85","orcidId":"0000-0002-4026-2473","documentHash":"f09cbf61-7f62-48a3-9925-604af98567b8"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a0473971c7","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Stachowiak","uuid":"8542C5A7D7607B4E7B3CAC383F8B36E190A62A91AF4B3191030D199AFBD593C8D550B3F772728D763A9922E9F34B02CE654ED633BE01EDE34ED9C821682F14CC","orcidId":"0000-0002-1874-9218","documentHash":"42dede39-1457-425c-9ac0-88732a2513af"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15134579"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["concept of sustainable development","international order","system of international environmental law"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61a600e62467f0269e7ffa8c","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Poltava State Agrarian University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62cbd5ec409707746ec4be50"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Concept of sustainable development in the system of international environmental law","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e7187e446e0fb0001d14443","mniswId":null,"title":"ScienceRise: Juridical Science","doi":null,"issn":"2523-4145","eissn":"2523-4153","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"f5933e10-55ec-4614-a505-4846f5546593"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62cbd5ec409707746ec4be4e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62cbd5ec409707746ec4be50"]},"issue":"2(20)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The essence of the concept of sustainable development and its significance for environmental protection by means of international law are analyzed. For this purpose, foreign and domestic scientific literature is researched, as well as legal documents, which formulate the goals of sustainable development. It is proved, that the concept of sustainable development should be considered in the system of international law in general, and in International Environmental Law in particular. This approach is due to the consequences of the global economic crisis, COVID-19 and Russia's military aggression against Ukraine. Since the maintenance of international order depends on sustainable development, the main goals of sustainable development are listed, the implementation of which guarantees stability in the world, which should be the basis of international law. Implementing the goals of sustainable development, restoring balance in nature and international relations are expected to be provided by individuals, so understanding the essence of global social processes is extremely important, which indicates the relevance of the study. The development trends of such an international organization as the World Trade Organization, which intensified its activities after the Russian invasion of the sovereign territory of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, are analyzed separately, in particular on issues, such as food security. At the same time, the necessity of using legal, in particular judicial, methods of resolving disputes between WTO members along with diplomatic ones was argued. In general, this work is based on the statement about the importance of implementing the concept of sustainable development to minimize risks, in particular in the field of nuclear safety. It is the priority of stable development of the states that ensure the operation of nuclear power plants that will guarantee global environmental security, which determines the essence of international environmental law, the content and direction of the legal norms that shape it"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149541","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cbd130409707746ec47a3e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"2(20)","doi":"","documentHash":"323daab6-815b-4e8d-8067-3df2a7855a31"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"29-33","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/sr_law/article/download/259731/256532","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62cbd5ec409707746ec4be50","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Kupchenia","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4504-8158","documentHash":"3c3d3566-1a31-4243-bf04-d3db01738691"}],"doi":"10.15587/2523-4153.2022.259731"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62cd46134097075e7c5bc77b","doi":null,"title":"Science, Business and Universities : Cooperation, Knowledge Transfer and Entrepreneurship","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"9781032192345","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://www.routledge.com/Science-Business-and-Universities-Cooperation-Knowledge-Transfer-and/Duda-Bernat/p/book/9781032192345","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"0022a172-5f34-4b42-87c8-723aaef83d62","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb764","mniswId":"2600","name":"Taylor & Francis Group","documentHash":"58bf6545-278f-427f-94ec-d2511c107c95"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092fb878c28a0473a071f","5e7092fb878c28a0473a072d"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Technological Entrepreneurship and Entrepreneurial University towards Greater Effectiveness of Business-Science Cooperation","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62cd461f4097075e7c5bc817","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092fb878c28a0473a071f","5e7092fb878c28a0473a072d"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This explorative qualitative study focuses on the relationships between university-based entrepreneurial activities, the requirement of a more practice-oriented application of research findings, and the entrepreneurial ecosystem with regard to contemporary business needs. The purpose of the study is to present a discussion of the theoretical framework that concerns the challenges of modern business (primarily, Industry 4.0) in Poland, technological entrepreneurship, and the entrepreneurial university approach that emphasizes the need for definitely more effective cooperation within the triple helix: university – industry – government. This is an attempt to adapt the existing insights and bring new factors together with the current reflections on business-science collaboration and efficient knowledge sharing while outlining the need to pay attention to the development of Industry 4.0. The contribution consists of the development of a conceptual model of relationships and interdependencies among the triple helix entities embedded in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, with a strong focus on technological entrepreneurship. The model provides a framework for designing efficient business-science-government cooperation, visualizing and shedding light on the challenges of mutual relationships; at the same time, it helps to identify, prioritize, and execute the key paths that are crucial to achieving a common goal. The research finds that the patterns of business-science cooperation can vary considerably depending on the government’s support policy and the involvement of entrepreneurial ecosystem entities. The study may provide a starting point for in-depth empirical research and a contribution to the discussion on the methodological dilemmas associated with conducting research in this area. In order to obtain a deeper insight into the practical implication of the created model, a future investigation will focus on identifying the critical factors within the interdependencies among entrepreneurial universities, Industry 4.0, and governments towards technological entrepreneurship by using multiple case studies. The application of real business cases should provide insightful guidance for the needs of the rapid growth of Industry 4.0 and research-intensive organizations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149542","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"145 -

Significant changes in this regard occurred in the Age of Enlightenment and in the first half of the 19th century.

However, little is known about vitamin D metabolites and their association with physical performance in athletes. Therefore, the aim of our study was to determine the relationship between metabolites of vitamin D, vitamin D binding protein (VDBP), free, bioavailable 25-(OH)D, and physical fitness tests in athletes. A total of 40 indoor and outdoor players (16 judoists and 24 football players) participated in the study. Vitamin D metabolites (25-(OH)D, 24,25-(OH)2D3, 3-epi-25-(OH)D3, and 1,25-(OH)2D) were assessed using LM-MS/MS. Free 25-(OH)D concentration was evaluated by calculation using serum albumin and VDBP levels. Athletic performance was assessed using handgrip and vertical jump. Our study showed a significant correlation between vitamin D metabolites and handgrip strength and vertical jump variables in indoor players. It demonstrated a significant association between 3-epi-25-(OH)D3 and vertical jump parameters in outdoor players. The results of our study showed relationship between free, bioavailable 25-(OH)D, and vertical jump variables in indoor players. In conclusion, we provide novel information on the vitamin D metabolites and athletic performance in athletes. Based on the results of our study, we concluded that vitamin D metabolites might be involved in skeletal muscle function in relation to athletic performance."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149552","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62149f192467f02f1e609b99","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"fc58aa34-2a77-405e-beae-264a42d104b9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"art. 909086, s. 1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2022.909086/full","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094e9878c28a0473c6b88","name":"Giovanni","lastName":"Lombardi","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8365-985X","documentHash":"e9e6ed7a-432a-48b7-8b43-22ef1bb14480"},{"objectId":"5e70937f878c28a0473ab32e","name":"Anna","lastName":"Książek","uuid":"7078D3A42DAB98316AA2F248F8F5973725D3588A069AC403D06C52573C744C9463F025324ADDC24489BB8B9A339AEA75966FAA7C3EF713EA6F67C98F3D7BEE04","orcidId":"0000-0002-6677-5920","documentHash":"c889e593-a073-41ad-aa93-4122a1b94a81"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047395026","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Zagrodna","uuid":"2E72BE1F8DD05CFBBA7DB60AE4E0FDC2FBF357321184E89D8BA7C47A9F80B66AE73E731C8CABB20D03E56F46B4B8DF120806FFC23427FC2FCAC7D39536B94B7B","orcidId":"0000-0003-0649-4083","documentHash":"6e11e68f-152b-4f65-a002-37a3b2ba4651"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047394fba","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Słowińska-Lisowska","uuid":"260C4A0D4113E3591F42694E6F53E0239D5955843ACEE2C04AE59466CF3B93BEDD1E9E5F6A74715BDBCC905515F5A60719E40BE76AF5D6A331DD3CB4B9278DF8","orcidId":"0000-0001-7522-4058","documentHash":"b4f4ec93-2f35-42e5-85e8-32323fe93775"}],"doi":"10.3389/fphys.2022.909086"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["design","potato harvester","organic farming","FEM strength analysis"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709416878c28a0473b5fcc","62c80fdc4097075e7ce0b519"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709478878c28a0473bdd87"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Analysis of the strength of an innovative design of an organic farming potato harvester","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547e315","mniswId":"24302","title":"Journal of Physics: Conference Series","doi":null,"issn":"1742-6588","eissn":"1742-6596","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"c0f0e3e6-8a4b-48f2-b946-33ce0fd76472"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62c80fdc4097075e7ce0b515","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"62c80fdd4097075e7ce0b62d","mniswId":null,"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"fullName":"International Conference on Applied Sciences ICAS 2021","shortName":"ICAS 2021","city":null,"country":null,"website":"https://sin.put.poznan.pl/conferences/details/conference/international-conference-on-applied-sciences-icas-2021","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"7f3c924f-f5c2-499f-9a45-98b8eabd7407"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709416878c28a0473b5fcc","62c80fdc4097075e7ce0b518","62c80fdc4097075e7ce0b519","62c80fdc4097075e7ce0b51a","62c80fdc4097075e7ce0b51b","5e709478878c28a0473bdd87"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Small organic farms still use potato lifters for harvesting.

The aim of this study was to design an innovative organic farming potato harvester aggregated with a 38 kW tractor and to analyse its strength with the finite element method (FEM). The research assumption was to fit the innovative construction with a potato basket in order to minimise the labour consumption of organic potato cultivation. The project involved analytical calculations of the strength, which were followed by the design of a CAD model and a detailed strength analysis with the FEM. Autodesk Inventor and Femap were the programs used to aid the design of the machine. The designed model had no nodes where stresses would be greater than 32% of the maximum allowable stress in the material structure and 43% of the maximum allowable stress in the structure of welds. The innovative design of the potato harvester developed in this study can be used with all tractors (farm and orchard tractors) equipped with a three-point linkage."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149559","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c80fdd4097075e7ce0b62c","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"2212","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"377b580a-a892-4d6a-99ec-aaa33eb6af72"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"62c80fdd4097075e7ce0b62e","mniswId":null,"startDate":"2021-05-12","endDate":"2021-05-14","fullName":"International Conference on Applied Sciences ICAS 2021","shortName":"ICAS 2021","city":"Hunedoara","country":"RO","website":"https://sin.put.poznan.pl/conferences/details/conference/international-conference-on-applied-sciences-icas-2021","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"f9835a23-9159-46dd-852a-935671cdbbee"},"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2212","pagesFromTo":"1 - 6","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/2212/1/012028","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62c80fdc4097075e7ce0b51b","name":"Adamina","lastName":"Duda","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"855bf8fb-f896-4fc6-bc1d-2e3fd143c888"},{"objectId":"62c80fdc4097075e7ce0b51a","name":"Marek","lastName":"Szychta","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"62126505-85e9-4138-9b3c-2f4593d3aa6b"},{"objectId":"62c80fdc4097075e7ce0b519","name":"Anna","lastName":"Marciniak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"651a77e0-2850-44d9-8045-c23f40109262"},{"objectId":"62c80fdc4097075e7ce0b518","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Koszela","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ada7f215-ec67-48e7-95ea-6a8e348e1051"},{"objectId":"5e709478878c28a0473bdd87","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Przybył","uuid":"4E6F0E1311C95C478878C39CD58884375B3B75A1B72BCD7871A6DE7E2BA9C2F6A986750085014DE4EC6F422680AE6FD0F956D83F319D73835F2F7BE8C4D34CE1","orcidId":"0000-0002-2535-8370","documentHash":"ba4db1e4-ec1d-489b-8a37-5fb3e29cba21"},{"objectId":"5e709416878c28a0473b5fcc","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Gierz","uuid":"6470FCF8B73421AAE8FB263AA313AF3F2360431D4F863027F8E74F0DEC186E093E45643C3B29291A503C69C3AC3CA49700CC09D663828D3908614BD727714AC5","orcidId":"0000-0003-4040-5718","documentHash":"4417edaa-aac3-4373-97a6-2b7f1ea0587d"}],"doi":"10.1088/1742-6596/2212/1/012028"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["economy","employee","labour, market","protection"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62cbefbc409707746ec5bd81","doi":null,"title":"EU ANTITRUST: HOT TOPICS & NEXT STEPS","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-80-7630-021-7","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://rozkotova.cld.bz/EU-ANTITRUST-2022/602/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"e416ee13-1f09-4de0-a54b-b55a809dc068","publisher":{"objectId":"649c05cb4097071386c3ffcb","mniswId":null,"name":"Charles University Faculty of Law","documentHash":"1cf9ca64-5148-43cf-ba66-00b27a4ac62d"},"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"JUNE","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null}},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dde8","uid":"biELrlVfVcOt_TCWbRopx5w","uuid":"8247bc1c-0816-4f78-881f-c8cf81f5380b","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dde8","parentUuid":"8247bc1c-0816-4f78-881f-c8cf81f5380b","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dde8","rootUuid":"8247bc1c-0816-4f78-881f-c8cf81f5380b","name":"Akademia Nauk Stosowanych WSGE im.

Although unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) constitute a branch of the industry rather than transport as a whole, their development is oriented toward increasingly more serious applications involving the transport of goods and people. The constantly growing number of operations employing UAVs requires not only identification of hazard sources or risk assessment recommended by the applicable regulations, but also comprehensive risk management. In order to develop a systematic approach to risk management for air operations of UAVs, the classic risk management method can be used. This work proposes a novel multi-criteria risk model that may serve as the basis for further activities aimed at developing a risk management method for this domain. The model was based on six criteria and validated using a virtual route to risk assessment and valuation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149572","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6241a3072467f0290d2dfe70","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"7","doi":null,"documentHash":"b570d4dc-59ac-4043-b660-8f9a1479c58d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"2448-1 - 2448-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/7/2448","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093c1878c28a0473b0344","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kobaszyńska-Twardowska","uuid":"C08A031504184B8EBFD807BF3EF17829F6D3A381D553F7B322DB10E181CC6AD1EAA34A510444EE8435B08A40243F67E09C6EAE3E2BF32D096B3DE8C5F096019C","orcidId":"0000-0002-3087-8119","documentHash":"a3f6dd29-067d-46bc-b4c9-d4d91aa6f576"},{"objectId":"5e7093a5878c28a0473ae709","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Sielicki","uuid":"135CA73F278BC1243987996B25C2FF214B0C6F6751665886E0B4630D192313A9B4B0210B889BB3B64F81C15559121F086C6FD41B5F70F4ADC3ECBCD8DF972143","orcidId":"0000-0002-5331-6645","documentHash":"78cf8f04-d0c2-4170-a6f4-fa5ec67999c1"},{"objectId":"5e70934a878c28a0473a6a55","name":"Jędrzej","lastName":"Łukasiewicz","uuid":"D41E46BD12C5D00CAE3CC9EC896DF0528CB1A0F529802329EEC0D1259285A59AF15682D0F21F24AE8F6C345C58090273F3C537C1C47860C9EDB9B3AC64F5BDF6","orcidId":"0000-0002-7082-8511","documentHash":"34591be6-cdc4-4975-a72b-30264432b46b"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15072448"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Antoni Stanisław Jurasz Poznań Bydgoszcz Lwów Greiswald laryngologia medycyna nauka"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62c942b040970747506535e3","doi":null,"title":"EX cathedra.

Bycie sportowcem automatycznie niesie ze sobą konieczność przeżywania stresu i wypracowania efektywnych strategii radzenia sobie z nim. Zawodnicy nierzadko muszą dostosowywać się do ogromnych obciążeń treningowych, być nastawieni na ciągłe polep-szanie swoich wyników i balansować na granicy własnych możliwości, co wpływa na powstawanie chro-nicznego zmęczenia, stresu, a co za tym idzie – sprzyja pojawianiu się kontuzji. Wydaje się, że sportowcy przeżywający wiele stresu w codziennym życiu, mający ubogie kompetencje w radzeniu sobie i mający nikłe wsparcie społeczne są zagrożeni kontuzją bardziej, niż ci o uboższej historii stresorów, o pozytyw-nych cechach indywidualnych (jak np. wysoka motywacja osiągnięć, odporność psychiczna, optymizm), czy o bogatym wachlarzu wykorzystywanych strategii zaradczych. Co więcej kontuzja u takich jednostek może być poważniejsza, a jej konsekwencje trwać dłużej. Zadanie sportowe, choć z jednej strony jest wysoce sformalizowane i typowe (bo dobrze rozumiane przez wszystkich jej uczestników, określone pew-nymi regulaminami i przepisami sędziowskimi, względnie ustabilizowane przez wielokrotne powtarzanie tych samych czynności, nastawione na cel, jakim jest zwycięstwo w konkurencji), jest równocześnie zada-niem niepewnym. Nigdy nie wiadomo, kto zwycięży, a kto poniesie porażkę, mimo, iż sportowcy na ogół znają możliwości i dotychczasowe rezultaty zarówno własne, jak i swoich rywali. Zatem przed przystą-pieniem danego zawodnika do startu, występować u niego mogą różnorodne objawy zdenerwowania oraz dolegliwości somatyczne, które składają się na typową reakcję wywoływaną zagrożeniem i trudnością. To, czy dany zawodnik spróbuje podołać zadaniu, czy też będzie się raczej z niego wycofywał zależy od znaczenia, jakie nada zachodzącej sytuacji – czy jest ono dla niego zagrożeniem, czy wyzwaniem"},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Stress is an indispensable element of modern life. Sports activity is one example of an emotional stress situation. Being an athlete automatically involves the need to relive stress and develop effective coping strategies. Competitors often have to adapt to huge training loads, be focused on continuous improvement of their results and balance on the limit of their own abilities, which contributes to the formation of chronic fatigue, stress, and thus – promotes the appearance of injuries. It seems that athletes who experience a lot of stress in everyday life, have poor coping skills and have little social support, are more at risk of injury than those with a poorer history of stressors, with positive individual characteristics (such as high achievement motivation, mental resilience, optimism), or with a wide range of coping strategies used. Moreover, an injury to such individuals may be more serious and its consequences may last longer. A sports task, although on the one hand it is highly formalized and typical (because it is well understood by all its participants, defined by certain rules and regulations of judges, or stabilized by repeating the same activities many times, aimed at the goal of winning the competition) is also a task uncertain. You never know who will win and who will fail, despite the fact that athletes generally know the possibilities and results so far, both their own and their rivals. Therefore, before a given competitor starts to start, he may have various symptoms of nervousness and somatic ailments, which constitute a typical reaction caused by threat and difficulty. Whether a given player will try to cope with the task, or rather withdraw from it, depends on the importance given to the current situation – whether it is a threat or a challenge for him."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149575","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"182-193","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"Prestart and starting stress in competitors - runners"}],"publicUri":"https://health.nuwm.edu.ua/index.php/rehabilitation/article/view/234/202","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62c81c9e4097077330cd35e1","name":"B.","lastName":"Kindzer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"88ac69be-cd5d-486a-9ec5-3bb0080a55f4"},{"objectId":"62c81c9e4097077330cd35e0","name":"O.","lastName":"Khoma","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ddb7f32d-0e87-4a2c-b7fa-0ea348e0b132"},{"objectId":"62c81c9e4097077330cd35df","name":"I.

One of its most important elements is terrain passability analysis, which involves research on the terrain characteristics in terms of the cross-country movement (CCM) ability (outside the road network). Factors that affect the conditions of passability include fast changeable elements such as weather factors (precipitation, temperature, humidity) or environmental changes: both natural and caused by anthropogenic factors. These elements have a decisive influence on the CCM conditions (e.g. on the traction properties of soils). Taking the above into account, the aim of the performed research was to develop a methodology, which makes enable to consider fast changeable factors in the process of developing the most up-to-date maps of passability. This\nmethodology has been implemented in the IT system, which is able to generate maps of passability in real-time of a specified level of detail (the size of the primary field) and spatial range, completely automatically, including the acquired environmental data (topographic databases, satellite and weather data). Taking into account the specifics of weather data, the system generates maps both including the current weather situation and allows for prediction of passability conditions, taking into account weather forecasts."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149580","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"60e577762467f034022bfa27","mniswId":null,"startDate":"2022-06-20","endDate":"2022-06-25","fullName":"8th International Conference on Cartography and GIS","shortName":"8ICCGIS","city":"Nessebar","country":"BG","website":"https://iccgis2020.cartography-gis.com/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"6b21d5c8-cea4-4f6b-8a18-9eff9cecae37"},"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"244-252","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://iccgis2020.cartography-gis.com/8ICCGIS-Vol2/8ICCGIS_Proceedings_Vol2_(28).pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093e7878c28a0473b300c","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Pokonieczny","uuid":"EC13706606DF574836E4B9AB5F3BFEE805C26B498FBDBEFB2B5086C3130F6CFC7B6F2E204628C923CEB2DBB201143965355FCA88EB50606D6215DF67D4E1B976","orcidId":"0000-0001-9114-5317","documentHash":"bcde8f8f-69eb-4f81-aca8-932107cda35a"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["value added chain","commodity chains","international trade","comparative advantage","revealed comparative advantage indices","developing countries"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6e","uid":"bQeipS4MvQr1wvpe3eSfkxA","uuid":"ce9d174a-cb81-4f87-9171-977021bb017c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Ekonomiczny","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f8878c28a0473a045e","5e709225878c28a047390abe"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Importance of Global Value Chains in Developing Countries’ Agricultural Trade Development","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","doi":null,"issn":"2071-1050","eissn":"2071-1050","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"46882d20-8996-4dde-bd15-7d5f8ecc797a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-26","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62c58dd84097074de22a10b3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f8878c28a0473a045e","5e709225878c28a047390abe"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The role of global value-added chains is growing in international trade. The development gap between highly developed economies and developing countries means that the only products with which less developed economies can compete on the international arena are agricultural products.\nMoreover, integration into global value-added chains is an important factor in achieving comparative advantages in trade and improving export competitiveness. The main aim of this article is to assess the impact of integration within global value chains on changes in the comparative advantage of developing countries in the global agricultural trade. The degree of participation of developing countries in global value chains (GVC) was assessed using data from the Trade in Value-added OECD–WTO database (November 2021 edition) by calculating domestic (DVA), foreign value-added (FVA), and revealed comparative advantage (RCA) indexes. The analysis covers the period 1995–2018 and 28 developing economies. The research showed that the foreign value added in the gross exports of agricultural commodities of developing countries was an important factor in strengthening their export position and the importance of integration within global value chains rises with increasing product complexity. In agricultural production, FVA in most developing countries does not have a significant impact on the shaping of the comparative advantage."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149582","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61fb93ff2467f07d34e5186a","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"d3d4148c-c0e7-4539-8595-b86123c9d1ed"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/3/1389/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092f8878c28a0473a045e","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Białowąs","uuid":"4D3ABB23657E956E686041E3A5B2BA1B16A664C77178912958001C3A7A42640B0461062455A4D6486A2DCAFDFF46E2F58FC35679007D8FDDE2AF0BC9F552BF7D","orcidId":"0000-0002-8898-9989","documentHash":"879dee9f-2de2-4edb-9e8a-bc8a794e606b"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a047390abe","name":"Anna","lastName":"Budzyńska","uuid":"7C9CDA92B4A041D4CB7A8E86A1B2D355124B172C94757BD7C08DCEC6850474E2E8EDF6F45F305D7CA6AB158CEF0B1ED691DC2FF8DFE56785ADF110B53FE6E4CF","orcidId":"0000-0002-6959-0585","documentHash":"78957801-a7ce-49b9-8bea-73466ae96687"}],"doi":"10.3390/su14031389"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decd","uid":"bDVT6eE951oVevqx9vwsANA","uuid":"52307719-d5a8-4e16-8c65-acc1f011e9bb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decd","parentUuid":"52307719-d5a8-4e16-8c65-acc1f011e9bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decd","rootUuid":"52307719-d5a8-4e16-8c65-acc1f011e9bb","name":"Główny Instytut Górnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709384878c28a0473abc50"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Modelowanie numeryczne procesu fermentacji ukierunkowanej na produkcję biowodoru","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c2851454793fd","mniswId":"16683","title":"Przemysł Chemiczny","doi":null,"issn":"0033-2496","eissn":"2449-9951","websiteLink":"http://www.sigma-not.pl/czasopisma-62-przemysl-chemiczny.html","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"91496329-bf17-4a54-80b9-d4a16c721b54"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62cc06ea409707746ec6a5ba","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709384878c28a0473abc50"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Przeprowadzono symulację numeryczną bioreaktora do produkcji wodoru z ciemnej fermentacji, w której substratem były produkty zawierające glukozę.

The actual means for dealing with them involve the use of damaging chemical pesticides that harm the environment, threaten biodiversity, and undermine human health. This research was aimed at developing an environmentally friendly means to cope with emerging oomycete disease from tomato fields in the province of East-Azerbaijan. The oomycete disease causal agent was isolated and identified as Ovatisporangium sp. using a combination of morphological features and molecular methods. Six wood vinegars (pyroligneous acid) belonging to pine, pomegranate, pistachio, almond, walnut, and cypress were produced during this study and examined against Ovatisporangium sp. Their inhibition of volatile metabolites (VOCs) using different dilutions (1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, and 1/10) was assessed against the mycelial growth of Ovatisporangium sp. In vitro analysis demonstrated that pistachio, cypress, and almond dilution 1 (D 1) wood vinegar VOCs had the ability to stop the mycelial growth of Ovatisporangium sp. All other treatments including pine, walnut, and pomegranate with relevant dilutions significantly reduced the mycelial growth of Ovatisporangium sp. compared with the control (p ≤ 0.05). Wood vinegar is therefore a potent means to cope with pathogenic infections and allows plant protection against oomycete

period from around 1450 to 1550 in Europe is extremely interesting from the perspective of research on extreme weather events. It was a period of events that strongly influenced the societies and economies of the Old Continent. So far, the literature has been more focused on western and northern Europe. Concerning the region of central Europe, the greatest attention was paid to the Czech Republic or Hungary. This article revolves around the Polish lands, which experienced their greatest economic boom in the 16th century. We consider whether and how the droughts of the decade from 1531 to 1540 might have affected the country's economic development. We analyse a number of written sources which are the product of the treasury apparatus of the time (tax registers, data from water customs, tax exemptions, inventories of land estates etc.), but also information on fluctuations in product prices in the most important cities in this part of Europe. The work not only provides a detailed account of economic data, but also attempts to reflect on the relevance of linking information on fires in urban centres in the period characterized by weather extremes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149607","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"1541-1561","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://cp.copernicus.org/articles/18/1541/2022/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e6e2df4097076263f29b4b","name":"Dagmara","lastName":"Adamska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0bf88595-493a-4982-bb76-f626e18d8eef"},{"objectId":"65e6e2df4097076263f29b4a","name":"Bogusława","lastName":"Kruczkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f60b9506-d4e6-4457-a335-275346fad772"},{"objectId":"65e6e2df4097076263f29b48","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Panecki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"375611fb-d65b-4250-8eb4-f98e5603337f"},{"objectId":"65e6e2df4097076263f29b47","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kozłowska-Szyc","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"74498da8-a9dd-47e8-bb52-1efd3a06383a"},{"objectId":"65e6e2df4097076263f29b45","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Poniat","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a30334f7-c7b7-4f79-8a88-df5c8c71b12e"},{"objectId":"65e6e2df4097076263f29b44","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Guzowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"09043094-a045-4e11-818b-d41155c39ee4"},{"objectId":"65e6e2df4097076263f29b43","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Związek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1123ab8d-f048-46c6-999c-1fc3d0b28c75"},{"objectId":"5e709459878c28a0473baf9d","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Radomski","uuid":"3D426C689E1CBFF6BC592C76A5AB0B4D7C2BEC62870409FDE8205AE569BC158B9EE8B9D6EE9B83E133BC74EB3D044648577E06696C2B407BB4BCC7EB94AFB768","orcidId":"0000-0002-7868-7768","documentHash":"82d97b53-7854-4835-af62-aa27a7178c83"},{"objectId":"5e709409878c28a0473b540e","name":"Sandra","lastName":"Słowińska","uuid":"312B3F81521048C4D850D197EA4DB4D44A7AE90A5ED1EDE946CC19A611B1E009CD52646222B76F9FB10099A0FA02A6BA3B0C0751C9AAAEBD20AE53B775FE0016","orcidId":"0000-0003-4233-7384","documentHash":"b4805236-41d9-4297-b936-2630162250c0"},{"objectId":"5e7092c1878c28a04739c21e","name":"Michał","lastName":"Targowski","uuid":"6299C7ECFC9C16F89A8896E8AC0EF67DD4D863D533235C8CCEA703B0306652B30EF5A8ADB3A5B92154AEB5CF7BCE52989C2154FEF8E206CEC75989C7BB914E41","orcidId":"0000-0002-6525-0604","documentHash":"10fc5197-6302-403c-ba55-53d2ef1c2dcf"}],"doi":"10.5194/cp-18-1541-2022"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Revisiting Austria: Tourism, Space, and National Identity, 1945 to the Present.

This is a comprehensive global database about building occupant behavior. The database includes occupancy patterns (i.e., presence and people count) and occupant behaviors (i.e., interactions with devices, equipment, and technical systems in buildings). Brick schema models were developed to represent sensor and room metadata information. The database is publicly available, and a website was created for the public to access, query, and download specific datasets or the whole database interactively. The database can help to advance the knowledge and understanding of realistic occupancy patterns and human-building interactions with building systems (e.g., light switching, set-point changes on thermostats, fans on/off, etc.) and envelopes (e.g., window opening/closing). With these more realistic inputs of occupants’ schedules and their interactions with buildings and systems, building designers, energy modelers, and consultants can improve the accuracy of building energy simulation and building load forecasting.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149619","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"9","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01475-3","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6751a8acfdbe835717e7aa9f","name":"Xin","lastName":"Zhou","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cf2cda29-589a-432e-b111-3f123477398b"},{"objectId":"6751a8acfdbe835717e7aa9e","name":"Xiang","lastName":"Zhou","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"069a1f17-6eb4-43e3-b3b2-a9a8ac7ec554"},{"objectId":"6751a8acfdbe835717e7aa9d","name":"Jingsi","lastName":"Zhang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7eee01be-3935-466e-88d9-0c7e4f5710c6"},{"objectId":"6751a8acfdbe835717e7aa9c","name":"Paolo","lastName":"Zangheri","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2296857a-e7b4-4ed2-b929-3317f274b073"},{"objectId":"6751a8acfdbe835717e7aa9b","name":"Da","lastName":"Yan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a5f81ee4-e41a-4829-9efa-4322bed8b5e3"},{"objectId":"6751a8acfdbe835717e7aa9a","name":"David

The aim of this paper is to conduct an analysis of the effect of motivators on the employees’ performance in handling system orders at the warehouse of distribution center. Design/Methodology/Approach: Three employees included in the study were post probationary period, while two employees were on probationary period. In the first stage, a face-to-face interview was conducted with each representative of the study group in order to gain a closer understanding of each individual and then, based on the responses obtained, a decision was made to introduce an appropriate experimental factor into the research process. The moment when the selected motivator was applied to each employee allowed to passively generate relevant data, such as percentage productivity and productivity in pieces of completed items. The printouts of the employees’ performance constituted documents that were thoroughly analyzed in order to create the database needed to conduct the performance study and statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was the final stage in the entire project and research process. The analysis consisted of two parametric tests, t-test for independent groups and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), supplemented by a multiple comparisons LSD (Least Significant Differences) test. Findings: The results supported the hypotheses set regarding the effect of motivators on average productivity, on average daily number of items completed, and the form of employment on the work efficiency of warehouse workers. Practical Implications: The research results have practical implications for every distribution center. Research results can be helpful for managers. Knowing about the motivators of warehouse workers allows you to build an appropriate motivation system. Originality/Value: The originality of the presented research results from the applied research methods. This analysis consisted of two parametric tests: t-test for independent groups and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), supplemented by a multiple comparisons LSD (Least Significant Differences) test."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149622","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c542184097075e7ccc5242","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"25","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"db6b4b99-21b1-453f-a2ed-17761e462939"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"25","pagesFromTo":"286 - 295","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.ersj.eu/journal/2843","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62cd45974097075e7c5bc70f","name":"Adam","lastName":"Koliński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f29732ac-f890-4e10-85b7-096edec210ee"},{"objectId":"62cd45974097075e7c5bc70e","name":"Amadeusz","lastName":"Urbaniak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"71f7692a-abe7-40e5-b394-1b813d2fc356"},{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473aeac5","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Werner-Lewandowska","uuid":"D7817717ED1F8054B6417ECA807CE302099DA76B0EFB446149A88DCBD2202BD5AD3B442F5B57DDE3C7C3409D0D9E3C8EE5557ABAF3E50B14B680742C500F8C99","orcidId":"0000-0002-9549-4511","documentHash":"ee710a5f-3dbb-4e7b-83a3-40082de7519c"}],"doi":"10.35808/ersj/2843"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["air-assisted rocket launch system","defense","safety","satellite","space"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","uid":"byIMgWh_9RUyyDH3dMzNDyw","uuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna im.

This paper verifies and evaluates such an air-assisted rocket system used for launching payloads to low Earth orbit (LEO) in many aspects. Mission profile and rocket drop maneuver concepts have been developed. From the adopted model of calculations and simulation results, it follows that in the considered configuration, the aforementioned aircraft will be capable of accomplishing a mission in which a payload of at least 10 kg is launched into low Earth orbit. The analyses were complemented by simulations and wind tunnel tests verifying the impact that space rockets may exert on the aerodynamic and mechanical properties of the carrier aircraft. Results of numerical simulations and wind tunnel tests to which models of the air-assisted rocket launching system were subjected indicate the rocket's impact on the aerodynamic characteristics of the aircraft and its in-flight properties is negligible. Similarly, load and strength tests to which the airframe’s load-bearing structures have been subjected also failed to show any significant changes or deformations caused by the space rockets attached. The kits proposed may be deemed as the so-called Responsive Space Assets for the Polish Armed Forces. Implementation of such a system not only offers independence from countries or commercial companies providing space services but also allows us to master new capabilities in the context of deploying satellite systems for safety and defense purposes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149624","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c824394097077330cd93cc","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"8","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"29efab42-6ab4-49c7-9b4d-caed3a1ecae1"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"8","pagesFromTo":"30-40","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://sd-magazine.eu/index.php/sd/article/view/171","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebede22752340254fc4290f","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Walkowiak","uuid":"38AC795FBC2763FA20E884AB60581AB2F2AB0B5F19444F2D54C04F920D045ACC24A312693C8AEF2E1845A71DDF13561B03E60A02C9430355BEBDFCEC70BADAED","orcidId":"0000-0002-4472-9253","documentHash":"bf221f81-4b36-43c1-b9dc-65d688ff3c55"},{"objectId":"5e7093f4878c28a0473b3e8d","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Kiszkowiak","uuid":"3932990A90961571E7510896D6C7F54880C3FB3EF427047111DBFCB76F22DC485066DC75F45C250B2C5C539905F95E7B6977CAA51B39F40A50D88B63CD1741C7","orcidId":"0000-0002-4855-7639","documentHash":"55fda95f-5ef9-4791-bf72-f841141e65c0"},{"objectId":"5e7092a4878c28a047399c85","name":"Robert","lastName":"Rogólski","uuid":"AE5509FED91420BC34D692080BB6C9243884F77164692377903424F05C55F5A68557687A7BAE56BD3F3BB8434EDEA2F2B348A9F296409FD2A5EC48AD7FC43C97","orcidId":"0000-0002-3729-6680","documentHash":"f8129220-e477-4828-a3a4-5f70c976e9f3"},{"objectId":"5e7092a4878c28a047399c6e","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Zalewski","uuid":"46088FA5EBF556E0D7D71CA718BE6F02E02FA016237AE0087B183DE7FC1672D44E5B00B6A0E750F0D4A4A13C449D6BD29A79E25EB95A950458CF03CA67DEBECC","orcidId":"0000-0002-3834-5376","documentHash":"52dbf150-2dad-492e-9351-08399204f6c7"},{"objectId":"5e7092a4878c28a047399c53","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Olejnik","uuid":"E807F388329F9DC7FFCC330E2C5B32780163D533D327E3286C5E02AF45309A885832BB361BAB9F34B846C419FCCD06D7351F75D8920E35032F75B003A4F6EDD6","orcidId":"0000-0003-2354-0782","documentHash":"b643e0ee-437e-48b8-8cec-dcccc3165146"}],"doi":"10.37105/sd.171"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Information","decisions process"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b6878c28a047385e24","uid":"bITc4cttztoiiv973rXfccw","uuid":"9d48cae3-39ad-462a-8216-ad67ec5520ed","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wydział Bezpieczeństwa, Logistyki i Zarządzania","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709447878c28a0473b97ff"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Dissemintation Of Information - Impact For Decitions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62cd3e264097073c6e2d95ae","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c28771574186e","mniswId":"862","startDate":null,"endDate":null,"fullName":"International Business Information Management","shortName":"IBIMA","city":null,"country":null,"website":null,"isEdition":false,"documentHash":"6029aca7-ff4d-42fd-9ba3-6932a546725d"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709447878c28a0473b97ff"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article covers reflection in the field of scope of dissemination/proliferation of information by internet users and impact of media coverage.

To assess new introduced varieties of pea (Pisum sativum L.) of different ecological and geographical origin in conditions of the Southern part of the Forest-Steppe of Ukraine according to a set of productivity and adaptability indicators.\n\nMethods. During 2018–2020 in the conditions of Ustymivka Experimental Station of Plant Production of the Plant Production Institute named after V. Ya. Yuriev NAAS of Ukraine (Poltava region, 49°18′21″N, 33°13′56″E) 30 new pea samples originating from Belarus, Azerbaijan, Canada, Poland and the Netherlands were studied. In the ripening phase of pods and seeds (BBCH 86–90) in field and laboratory conditions yields, productivity, 1000 beans weight, early-ripening, plant height and height of attachment of the lower pods above the soil level, number of nodes to the first pod and their total number per plant, number of pods and seeds per plant, number of seeds per pod, pod parameters were studied.\n\nResults. As a result of studying new samples of pea, the range of variation of their yield from 200.5 to 300.0 g/m2 was established, while the varieties ‘Aleks’, ‘Atlant’, ‘Minskiy ovoschnoy’ (Belarus), ‘Fidan’ (Azerbaijan), ‘Dacota’ (Canada), ‘Angela’ (Netherlands) were more productive, in which the mass of grain from the plant exceeded 10.0 g. The productivity of the plant was high due to both the increased number of seeds and the weight of 1000 grains. Almost all the studied samples were mediumripe (71–80 days) and are optimal for the Southern Forest-Steppe zone of Ukraine. The most early maturing (64–69 days) were the Belarusian varieties ‘Yan’, ‘Gontso’, ‘Goryinets’, ‘Alfa’, ‘Pryivabnyi’, ‘Malyish’ and the Dutch ‘Angela’ variety. The lowest varieties were Belarusian varieties – ‘Goryinets’, ‘Vlad’, ‘Alfa’, ‘Atlant’ and others (31.0–60.0 cm), which can be used as sources on this basis. Special attention should be paid to varieties that combine several valuable features: ‘Aleks’, ‘Atlant’, ‘Minskiy ovoschnoy’, ‘Korelicheskiy ovoschnoy’, ‘Slodyich’, ‘Malyish’, ‘Kosmay’, ‘Kelvidon’ (Belarus), ‘Fidan’ (Azerbaijan), ‘Jof’ (Poland), ‘CDC Limerick’ (Canada), ‘Orix’ (Spain).\n\nConclusions. The above varieties can be recommended as sources of valuable traits for practical use in breeding, and they are suitable for cultivation in the Southern Forest-Steppe, subject to inclusion in the State Register of plant varieties suitable for distribution in Ukraine."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149637","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cac85b4097071cdd63c43f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"18","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"93af0c9e-4519-471d-9bb7-596d5b3bf736"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"24-33","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journal.sops.gov.ua/article/download/257584/256666","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62cacd0d4097071cdd63cecb","name":"O.

The correct selection of technological parameters and the maintenance of the machines in the right technical condition allow obtaining very high quality of the cut edge, which will not require additional mechanical treatment. However, this is a complex issue. Appropriate control of the cutting process requires knowledge about the impact of individual parameters on the process and the quality of the cut edge. The influence of selected parameters and conditions of the laser cutting process on the technological quality of the obtained product was determined. The laser power and cutting speed had a significant influence on the output factors for two cutting techniques.For cutting material with a thickness of t = 3 mm with a CO2 laser, the highest quality of the cut edge was obtained using the power values ​​P = 4200-4300 W and cutting speed v = 2100 mm/min. For the thickness t = 6 mm, the speed values ​​should be approximately set in range v = 1600-1800 mm/min. The power value should be selected in a range from P = 3700 W to P = 4200 W. For a fiber laser with a material thickness of t = 3 mm, the best results were obtained using speeds in the range v = 2000-3300 mm/min. For the thickness of t = 6 mm, the cutting speed must be higher and in the range v = 3500-4000 mm/min while maintaining the power of about P = 4500-4800 W. The conducted experimental research can be useful on production lines in the aspect of the correct selection of technological parameters of the process due to the adopted energy and quality criteria."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149644","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cbda6f409707746ec4df06","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"16","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"e8ea7e7c-5548-4095-9956-992ee208480a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"8862–8872","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journal.ump.edu.my/jmes/article/view/6504","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62cbda6f409707746ec4df04","name":"D.","lastName":"Schmidtke","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cce55dbd-7481-44ee-8607-d08010297d46"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a9b3","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Bohdal","uuid":"37AD8E5FD9FC52160A5CD264F0F3BF371CA1259CBD08340CD75BBFB2714F9CC15AD7FAF52351972EF82C577C8AAE6DF1F46914262C8B77CF15200894C58DBF2D","orcidId":"0000-0002-8085-9530","documentHash":"12c3a779-f746-4a5c-bd7b-ab8dd28857ca"}],"doi":"10.15282/jmes.16.2.2022.05.0701"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["komunikacja w małżeństwie","zadowolenie ze związku","schematy płci","płeć psychologiczna"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["communication in marriage","relationship satisfaction","gender schemas","psychological gender"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Marital communication and relationship satisfaction – the differential role of gender schemas","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a0f6","mniswId":"200054","title":"Kwartalnik Naukowy Fides et Ratio","doi":null,"issn":"2082-7067","eissn":"2082-7067","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"3e49bca3-a3ea-43c2-8a18-bf22f0e61bd8"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62c6d95f40970720873ba680","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709378878c28a0473aa75f"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Celem prowadzonych badań było sprawdzenie czy schematy płci różnicują komunikację w małżeństwie oraz zadowolenie ze związku.

The respondents completed the Marital Communication Questionnaire (KKM), the Masculinity and Femininity Scale (SMiK) and the Relationship Satisfaction Scale. The results obtained indicate\r\na differential role of gender schemas in terms of preferred conversational styles. Psychological gender does not affect relationship satisfaction. Furthermore, the gender patterns evident in the four psychological gender types differentiate the relationship of spouses' communication with their ratings of relationship satisfaction. To conclude, including the construct of psychological gender in the analyses is important from the point of view of research as well as practice. Firstly, it deepens knowledge on relationship satisfaction and communication in marriage, secondly, the knowledge gained may find practical application e.g. in marriage therapy."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149647","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"50","pagesFromTo":"92-102","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://fidesetratio.com.pl/ojs/index.php/FetR/article/view/1085","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709378878c28a0473aa75f","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Lipińska-Grobelny","uuid":"AC0EA50C1D25C41CB24116FBB1B2303CF218A38A6EE6270A6408FE2967C61FBE341C4111906BD51BE6ED9695DD86F195379D36B306B65056FD899D840295EC9E","orcidId":"0000-0003-2770-1723","documentHash":"234a4c26-0bbd-4aad-8e26-e1c1cbcf99b5"}],"doi":"10.34766/fetr.v50i2.1085"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Blockchain;","Cloud computing;","Security;","Scheduling;"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6269034a409707015986093a","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-04036-8","title":"Cybersecurity of Digital Service Chains.

The proposed model assumes\ncompetition between different schedule providers. The winner of such a\ncompetition takes account of the client’s requirements faster and prepares\nan optimal schedule to meet them.

However, we still have no clear information on the normative values of pelvic girdle tilt and mobility. Objective: The study aimed to (1) evaluate the position and mobility of the pelvic girdle in the sagittal and frontal planes in asymptomatic adults aged 19-30, (2) evaluate the possible variation of results according to gender and to develop a proposal for normative values, and (3) evaluate whether body mass, height and BMI are related to the magnitude of hip girdle position and mobility. Methods: The research was conducted in a sample group consisting of 346 men and women using the scaled form of the anthropometric level of the Duometr® The values of position and mobility of the pelvic girdle in the sagittal and frontal planes were analyzed. Results: Differences were noted in the values of the pelvic tilt (p= 0.033) between the men and women. The women showed slightly higher values of posterior range of motion (p= 0.0002) and total range of motion (p= 0.002). The other parameters did not show any significant variation. There was no clear association between body weight, height and BMI and the study variables, except for a small, significant correlation between BMI and posterior pelvic tilt in women (r= 0.175, p= 0.005). In the frontal plane there were no differences in the analyzed variables in terms of gender or side of the body measured. Conclusions: There was no association between the anthropometric variables and the pelvic girdle tilt and mobility. No size variation by gender was observed in the frontal plane. Slight differences were observed in the sagittal plane. Normative values are proposed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149656","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-back-and-musculoskeletal-rehabilitation/bmr200176","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093e7878c28a0473b2fce","name":"Anna","lastName":"Lipowicz","uuid":"92812D336C7097797F3426AE0B5C748BBE6C5742126726F14010B3D7A0D844530C89F1CAB4A3D1A298CB7A439950DCC84F1AF19B515983A940D992AFC909E9A2","orcidId":"0000-0002-9182-6953","documentHash":"4634821d-603c-48b8-a54e-d0d33777d414"},{"objectId":"5e70932e878c28a0473a4771","name":"Robert","lastName":"Walaszek","uuid":"8D80D269E48A328D86F7BF889D35BB69BABD572C1C078BEE1FEA2EED707952872F9957DF1ADFD334588C3E12064D5087FE6FAAB7ABA1D9E1DA1A794B056A57AF","orcidId":"0000-0001-7639-2192","documentHash":"e1da87e0-2730-4bec-bda2-d5a8be5418ba"},{"objectId":"5e7092b3878c28a04739af0f","name":"Karol","lastName":"Bibrowicz","uuid":"CB1F6D93ED62216FB26D9F99E17DDA414DC7FA84C1408C30E0F21085E66B1B5FE447E68F2024D2EFE0F9F7EB6F78FB173AC81A28A0C5C79BD152DEDB8D2FE440","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2ec28a8c-d570-4f7e-93f1-dfbd32f51220"},{"objectId":"5e709287878c28a047397454","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Szurmik","uuid":"26EAA579F6E9EE69B664B504E5D0FFA938DE596E0E9E472C7A07D8A52E6B7E3A56686178478A4C8D7E4FC220386FA58FD6F484B09F644B0C3354089BF396869E","orcidId":"0000-0001-5085-0976","documentHash":"cc4fdaa3-1da0-4199-8abe-cb8a148727c7"},{"objectId":"5e709235878c28a047391b76","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Mitas","uuid":"16D5EFCFCA3479F4BC5F2665F2C51109DFBA30162DC888D4DFE6E09D36000DDFE7FEC9668667EA12EA7C3028FA266DF35D4118BF51DBF2F0816280505268FCA1","orcidId":"0000-0001-7833-5845","documentHash":"0731266f-faff-4951-a7da-37b83e396016"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fuel spray","optical research","fuel injection","rate-shaping"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d73c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Fuel injection rate shaping and its effect on spray parameters in a direct-injection gasoline system","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478be8","mniswId":"13175","title":"Journal of Visualization","doi":null,"issn":"1343-8875","eissn":"1386-6478","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"c2c74e7d-60be-44ad-80c2-dfed3aef8c71"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62c51ea94097075e7ccc38fb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d73c"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The presented test results contain an analysis of the variable control of fuel flow from high-pressure gasoline injectors. To control such a system, the cRIO 9063 system and NI-driven module were used. This system allows controlling a piezoelectric injector with a time-varying needle height, which affects the time-varying fuel flow during a single-time opening of the injector needle. The tests were carried out in a constant volume chamber with a constant fuel dose (Pinj = 15 MPa and qo = 17.4 mg), with two values of medium back pressure: Pb = 1.0 and 1.5 MPa as well as different injector opening times (resulting from equal doses of fuel). Analyzes of changes in linear and radial fuel spray range as well as the fuel spray volume were made. It has been found that injection rate-shaping allows to control the fuel flow from the injector at a variable needle height. A reduction of the linear range of the spray by 50% and a radial range by 40% compared to conventional settings within a specified time from the start of the injection was achieved. The surface area of the spray is limited by a maximum of 60% compared to the settings at the maximum control voltage. The use of injection rate-shaping may be an effective method of controlling the variable fuel flow from the injector and may allow the replacement of multi-stage fuel injection."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149665","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c51ea94097075e7ccc3901","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"25","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"3703af45-febe-4d68-9ea1-0500ae4e0b76"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"25","pagesFromTo":"727 - 740","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12650-021-00823-6.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d73c","name":"Ireneusz","lastName":"Pielecha","uuid":"993A84DDACD55CB20D8FFCB402D93BAC02E78D2E72EB8EE9455202959964DD255EC54A8127C6BE7C0682C9F84AA1BCDDB3B99CE40F11F78764BB05E089D37DD8","orcidId":"0000-0001-7340-635X","documentHash":"3b921803-486c-4d61-aeb4-f5f751a225bc"}],"doi":"10.1007/s12650-021-00823-6"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

To assess the combining ability, features and nature of the inheritance of the trait “number of grains from the main spike” in varieties of spring durum wheat for their further involvement in breeding programs.\n\nMethods. The investigations were carried out at the V. M. Remeslo Institute of Wheat of NAAS of Ukraine. Varieties (‘Zhizel’, ‘MIP Raiduzhna’, ‘Kharkivska 27’, ‘Kharkivska 39’, ‘Spadshchyna’, ‘Kuchumovka’, ‘Tera’) of domestic breeding were involved in crossings according to the full diallel scheme (7 ´ 7). Parental components and F1 were studied in the field in 2016, 2017.\n\nResults. The analysis of variance of combining ability showed a significant advantage in general combining abili­ty (GCA) effects. The mean square of the specific combi­ning ability (SCA) was significantly inferior to the GCA, but was significant in both years of the study. Consistently high GCA effects in 2016, 2017 were determined in the variety ‘Tera’ (gi = 1.35; 2.37). Non-alelic gene interaction was not found, which made it possible to analyze the main parame­ters of genetic variation. In two years of investigations, in the phenotypic manifestation of the number of grains from the main spike, dominant effects (H1 and H2) survived over additive ones (D). The average degree of dominance indicated overdominance (H1/D). The indicator of the ave­rage degree of dominance in loci () also indicated overdominance. Dominance was significantly oriented. Dominant effects of genes increased the number of grains, while recessive effects decreased them. At least one group of genes has been identified that has led to dominance. In general, dominant genes (F > 0) or groups of genes dominated quantitatively in cultivar investigated. A high coefficient of heritability in a broad sense (H2 = 0.88; 0.90) indicates a significant phenotypic conditionality to genetic factors. The coefficient of heritability in a narrow sense (h2 = 0.31; 0.38) indicates the average contribution of the additive effects of genes over the dominant ones.\n\nConclusions. The identified breeding and genetic features on the basis of the “number of grains from the main spike” trait make it possible to predict the effectiveness of selections aimed at increasing the trait in the newly hybrid material. However, due to the predominance of dominant effects and overdominance in the genetic control of a trait, selection in later generations will be more effective. Varieties ‘Kharkivska 27’, ‘Kharkivska 39’ and ‘Tera’ should be used as genetic sources to increase the trait “number of grains from the main spike”."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149668","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cac85b4097071cdd63c43f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"18","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"93af0c9e-4519-471d-9bb7-596d5b3bf736"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"34-41","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journal.sops.gov.ua/article/download/257585/256669","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62cacde14097071cdd63cfa3","name":"M.

Alpha-linolenic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid easily subject to oxidative transformation. The auto-oxidation of α-linolenic acid is the main process contributing to off-flavor, color loss, and change in the nutritional value of flax oil. We used six flax genotypes differing in fatty acid content in our research. For all the DNA samples extracted from the leaf tissue of the studied flax, the new, cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences (CAPS) markers specific to the LuFAD3A desaturase gene were applied. A specific PCR product from the LuFAD3A flax gene comprising fragments of exon 5, exon 6, and the intron between these exons was digested using six various restriction enzymes. These experiments could differentiate between some of the studied varieties of flax. We also proved that the LuFAD3A gene mutation previously detected by other authors in the low-linolenic forms of flax (solin line 593–708) was absent in the low-linolenic forms of flax that we studied (Linola KLA and Linola KLB)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149683","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62a8316040970742eed39fcd","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"c33ae7fc-a686-4cc3-87f9-2fff88c33bcc"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1432","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/6/1432/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473bead9","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Walkowiak","uuid":"33F8D67D5FDCBCD5F54EF922660AB54D5DB0231A8ACF55F4B059001C5793083655FAF4AC48D7011D6A61AE0840353ED4F2103A383FB458C9AEEBEEDDDF9CD2AB","orcidId":"0000-0002-1168-8870","documentHash":"a3686cff-7249-4f51-a7b4-54d59b0650c6"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4ae2","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Matuszczak","uuid":"5DDC6E13AF8F738B6F8ADD7610F1530B8E0BAA8349D1BB8BFF6CB8A316CDF311AD2BF187E9B0F6D67338D5F336A483F53BD51BA5607485FFBA2340A90C7565F0","orcidId":"0000-0003-0712-7568","documentHash":"f111ca90-9c01-49a2-acf6-5e7bd06680c9"},{"objectId":"5e7093ff878c28a0473b4972","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Spasibionek","uuid":"A353F873D267A4CF0655B0D4E10D5BD9FC894538A8AC0FF11D8D6FA682D611510703370633760ABF676789A01B1C6F8BE70BD8486F1000068948F193E11D213C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"92d7872d-8bb5-4a87-a17d-4dc21f6776f7"},{"objectId":"5e7093fd878c28a0473b48a3","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Mikołajczyk","uuid":"0E0DE82B70C7048BD0FC35A8D1B12FDEEBC1D72C165EBA26D717FB64927308EE7D3F43760370ED180FDEF101214E038DDDE58F74089CB50E84F5E4B5617B2376","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9cf1abb5-d16d-4638-8c3c-348321ac8709"},{"objectId":"5e7093fd878c28a0473b487c","name":"Alina","lastName":"Liersch","uuid":"FC5711185665619C8ECB65B939DD1C66C78E0532BA356E13ECEDA2F1704D97E876E69B71B9B4699B8891F2C38B085D5523E9132DE7DEAF1A9A7B6C4522B97827","orcidId":"0000-0002-5076-4514","documentHash":"1fa4a7ff-1398-4ffb-a6ab-f0ac86d649eb"}],"doi":"10.3390/agronomy12061432"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f6878c28a0473b40bd","5e7093a4878c28a0473ae63a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"DNA Methylation as an Early Indicator of Aging in Stored Seeds of “Exceptional” Species Populus nigra L","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bca9","mniswId":"3385","title":"Cells","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2073-4409","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e0e46edf-5894-4199-b2b3-901234c8fc89"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62c7f5564097077330cba408","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093a4878c28a0473ae63a","5e7093f6878c28a0473b40bd","6405ebdd40970770355935e7","5e709349878c28a0473a684d","6405ebdd40970770355935e8"]},"issue":"13","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>Ex situ preservation of genetic resources is an essential strategy for the conservation of plant biodiversity. In this regard, seed storage is the most convenient and efficient way of preserving germplasm for future plant breeding efforts. A better understanding of the molecular changes that occur during seed desiccation and aging is necessary to improve conservation protocols, as well as real-time methods for monitoring seed quality. In the present study, we assessed changes in the level of genomic 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in seeds of Populus nigra L. by 2D-TLC. Epigenetic changes were characterized in response to several seed storage regimes. Our results demonstrate that P. nigra seeds represent an intermediate type of post-harvest behavior, falling between recalcitrant and orthodox seeds. This was also true for the epigenetic response of P. nigra seeds to external factors. A crucial question is whether aging in seeds is initiated by a decline in the level of 5mC, or if epigenetic changes induce a process that leads to deterioration. In our study, we demonstrate for the first time that 5mC levels decrease during storage and that the decline can be detected before any changes in seed germination are evident. Once P. nigra seeds reached an 8–10% reduction in the level of 5mC, a substantial decrease in germination occurred. The decline in the level of 5mC appears to be a critical parameter underlying the rapid deterioration of intermediate seeds. Thus, the measurement of 5mC can be a fast, real-time method for assessing asymptomatic aging in stored seeds.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149685","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c7f5564097077330cba410","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"11","number":"13","doi":null,"documentHash":"86303d41-bb40-48e3-ab91-32678644aded"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"2080","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/11/13/2080","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6405ebdd40970770355935e8","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Chmielarz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"edad21b7-aff4-4591-8e49-81af2eb82bba"},{"objectId":"6405ebdd40970770355935e7","name":"Mirosława Zofia","lastName":"Naskręt-Barciszewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0b408b07-11a1-4e47-bc5c-8b4d7f8ed554"},{"objectId":"5e7093f6878c28a0473b40bd","name":"Beata","lastName":"Plitta-Michalak","uuid":"41E30D616EB09F44D304D08EB0E61118D033BADEB722CAF034C509C71FF91B25D743F6B9DA724DB10E460F8DC74429F22C92324A5E5B2452196BC60850D6D4D8","orcidId":"0000-0002-2643-5120","documentHash":"d647260e-3e9a-48c8-bac0-cc478eb4d7df"},{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae63a","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Michalak","uuid":"C9F118B8A253B30BBB4259CB4F4F86AB21E3C0A4D72A48F06DC0FD45C6950113F898C748339ED13DC8E92954568EC2F7606BDCF14D062D23F7343F62EDFC77C3","orcidId":"0000-0003-1907-9719","documentHash":"e237b7ca-06dd-4ee5-8421-7ca50b0ba62b"},{"objectId":"5e709349878c28a0473a684d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Barciszewski","uuid":"4892123E469AACA5B6DDF405993EAF835C484C0CD3ACF57EDA4A179A1A6223D2E4CC1EE7F58464B34E2AC6E7132B94ABFE0F247AA73B6AF295684B759E3C6D27","orcidId":"0000-0001-7766-5594","documentHash":"a736361e-e975-4645-95fc-a098e3ae86b2"}],"doi":"10.3390/cells11132080"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Polishness","Poland","Nation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-66386-30-3","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5f5c1eac752340073806a9b7","uid":"bQguJlY7YSAbsff0rfgVzVQ","uuid":"89dfd9c7-5576-465d-8936-c50bea28c963","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Socjologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709355878c28a0473a77f2"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737ddd9","uid":"brSLXPVso2IWE01FTmuoK5g","uuid":"58bdce52-e319-4ebc-8565-cf242318e51c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737ddd9","parentUuid":"58bdce52-e319-4ebc-8565-cf242318e51c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737ddd9","rootUuid":"58bdce52-e319-4ebc-8565-cf242318e51c","name":"Collegium Civitas w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092fb878c28a0473a054c"]}],"type":"BOOK","title":"The Nation’s Longue Durée.

We then focus on the problem of software development productivity in the area of automated software generation as the main factor of the Industry 4.0 concept in the area of business information. In our study, two different approaches to user interface development in a business process management low-code platform were evaluated. The first, the multi-form model, assumes that input forms are prepared separately for each user task in the business process being automated. The second approach, the single-form model, assumes that there is one global input form for every task in the business process. Since users have access to different data in different process tasks, it is necessary to prepare the visibility matrix to define which data are relevant to which tasks. The experiments presented in this paper help to answer the following question: which approach yields better results in terms of productivity, which is measured as costs and time required to prepare the application? Several dozen real business processes were analysed to examine the properties of their visibility matrix. Additionally, the real project team members were evaluated to determine their productivity.

For this purpose, various types of acoustic maps are made, however, as scientific research shows, not every acoustic model is best suited for conducting effective quantitative analyses. Another problem is to carry out effective qualitative analyses, which additionally represent structural distribution of rolling noise generated by rail vehicles. The authors of the article present an original model of acoustic signature emitted by a selected type of urban rail vehicle in normal operation. To carry out the investigation, several dozen sound measurements were made according to own research methodology as well as several acoustic roughness measurements of wheel and rail rolling surfaces. The most important conclusion of this paper is the fact that based on validation and verification it can be concluded that the developed model is very well suited to estimate octave spectra of sound levels in relation to distance from the source (range 1–10 m) and speed (range 40–70 km/h) of a passing city rail vehicle."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149696","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c5347e4097075e7ccc4ea2","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"195","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"6b059241-538a-4b18-a4cc-4711a2f26b7e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"195","pagesFromTo":"108807-1 - 108807-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003682X22001815","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473aea33","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Komorski","uuid":"1D516F01BD2AD3E37748247CE8C94B8BFC3D86F805B3D63DDB14A6AE6B6199CDE264795E522895BEC245CD4D79B292643ADC491FECFEC4BDCB0CF590BD37E5EE","orcidId":"0000-0003-3213-3855","documentHash":"ae9d5585-3f21-4eac-b853-831f76ec4a49"},{"objectId":"5e70934f878c28a0473a6e76","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Nowakowski","uuid":"82D81D47F18787FCEED9EB5F3E4688C61267EEBBDCA2B19523F4862CAFBDB20AFD30014EE309E351A6A02272557452B4E43F465A57B3EA92BA2BA29542CCC18A","orcidId":"0000-0001-5415-7052","documentHash":"3243bb0a-a2c4-42bb-84d4-d48512f12625"},{"objectId":"5e7092fc878c28a0473a0843","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Szymański","uuid":"4C2FF90546D9B39806B5D38B21227206812EB67B7A6ABBE85A483EC800DF8727630AEA544389E8B55588BF351DC21F14C5FAF6AF4533635FA989A6AA6AB45189","orcidId":"0000-0002-2784-9149","documentHash":"4e3c8459-1bd8-4ddd-9b19-06e81ebd841b"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.apacoust.2022.108807"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["substancje podstawowe; substancje naturalne; mikroorganizmy pożyteczne; patogeny glebowe"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["basic substances; natural substances; beneficial microorganisms; soil pathogens"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee9","uid":"btl1TUFZ-RmtE1VFT09EDlQ","uuid":"f68cdefe-93d4-402f-94e1-bd2ef1f8616a","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee9","parentUuid":"f68cdefe-93d4-402f-94e1-bd2ef1f8616a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee9","rootUuid":"f68cdefe-93d4-402f-94e1-bd2ef1f8616a","name":"Instytut Ochrony Roślin - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afd72","5e7093b9878c28a0473afcd2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Metody zaprawiania materiału siewnego dozwolone w rolnictwie ekologicznym","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a352","mniswId":"200101","title":"Progress in Plant Protection","doi":null,"issn":"1427-4337","eissn":"2084-4883","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"2e228e67-fbf9-403a-9cf0-b49e7c889b9e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62cd62164097073c6e3050a7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afcd2","5e7093b9878c28a0473afd72"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Zaprawianie materiału siewnego jest pierwszym i czasami najważniejszym zabiegiem ochronnym.

In many of the world’s major economies, SOEs play an important role, and in some, such as China, India, Russia and Brazil, they are outright dominant. At the same time, the existence of SOEs is largely ignored by economic theory and the current figures on SOEs on a global scale available in the literature are questionable in terms of their methodological validity and thus they do not allow for a proper cross-country analysis. This book fills\nthis research gap.\nIt focuses on the scope and importance of SOEs in a broad group of the largest economies, primarily on a variety of quantitative estimates. It contains the results of an extensive and unique empirical study of 37 of the world’s largest economies over the period from 2009 to 2018. The findings showed that the average share of SOEs – measured by operating revenues and total assets – in the group of the largest 100 enterprises (Top 100) of a given country is nearly 30%, while in the Top 20 group it is even slightly higher. The authors present an econometric analysis showing the relationship between the scope of SOEs and the various economic and non-economic characteristics of the studied set of countries. The book also contains an in-depth discussion of selected key issues, such as the functions of SOEs in various types of economies, the role of SOEs in capital markets and the phenomenon of SOEs with foreign capital.\nThis work is addressed to academic economists, dealing with macroeconomics and economic policy, as well as researchers and analysts from various international organisations and

aim of the research was to show that changes occur in floor surface parameters resulting from increased use in public utility buildings. The study included corridors and staircases that differ in terms of covering material in a public utility building in Poznań. Measurements were carried out with the use of the British Pendulum Test Value (PTV) in three stages. The first stage included a research methodology recreating the movement of people wearing footwear with rubber soles and people using assistive devices with rubber endings. It indicated that surface wear is the greatest at staircase edges and lift entrances, and the possibility of slipping is increased from ca. 17% do 41%, depending on surface type. The second stage consisted of research taking into account the interaction of various surfaces used for floors in homes, shops, and industrial premises, with a rubber sample representing the ending of assistive devices. It demonstrated that the least dangerous surface material among the tested ones in terms of slip risk is roofing with an SVR of 73 ± 8, and the most dangerous are laminated surfaces of wood-based materials with an SVR of 29 ± 12. The last stage consisted of recreating the movement of people in various footwear on the selected research surface. It demonstrated that a bare foot (corresponding to a measurement with a rubber solitaire 55 or footwear with a rubber sole - Slip Resistance Value (SVR) of 55 ± 5) is characterized by the lowest possibility of slipping, while footwear with a felt sole (SVR of 29 ± 3) used, e.g., when visiting historic palaces and castles is characterized by the highest slip risk. The conducted tests made it possible to identify locations in the public utility building with an increased risk of slipping. The total number of surfaces examined during the three stages was sixteen. The test results were then referenced to the criteria for assessing surface slip resistance specified in applicable standards. The conducted research may support the processes of designing assistive devices (e.g., orthopaedic crutches, walking sticks, tripods, etc.) for persons with disabilities moving in buildings, and may also constitute a criterion for the scope of safety and a determinant of planned renovation works."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149732","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c81e604097075e7ce0bf86","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"54","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"ee8295e0-36aa-45ec-85f7-9d6da82dd0a4"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"54","pagesFromTo":"104643-1 - 104643-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352710222006568","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473aeaf0","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Waluś","uuid":"A0CE2F31097CD981AA3963B4128832B91B091BE7B59096E298A0D8DF0B0A2A435F3899ABE351D749532814F47FAD9872540B0F3A5E7BF3AC1DFAFA7F7D7F01B8","orcidId":"0000-0001-5567-0317","documentHash":"bee4f584-ec19-4e66-8c0b-ecc13da4e968"},{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473aea0f","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Wieczorek","uuid":"0E2DF050D3EB724FD107765BCA233DF105FD808AEB38ECAF0F13D5CE540D45C160AA24CCA2C42087F1006042270CBE64648632935F2A0F244CECD1BDB3386FB6","orcidId":"0000-0003-0808-298X","documentHash":"88aec8fd-bc2e-4d9b-9281-26cba5a1d91f"},{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473ae9af","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Warguła","uuid":"ECA88BF19FB79CAF7CDC5E038D945411A2975BC5D0A032E6474BA490643A169AF6C8D374F453ABAC664FF294431E29B01AABA9C4073910670D2CDD0D620313B7","orcidId":"0000-0002-3120-778X","documentHash":"a7dad9d7-536b-4e72-b82b-4bb677d9eeb4"},{"objectId":"5e7092f2878c28a04739fc9b","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Krawiec","uuid":"DFFC48A58331EDD19F5F1B8AA8AFD3CCA54109D05C8C55534911ADC84E33A9BBB3CAAA8700661EF93C20592007724D0D74457256008B430EC4C37465EE43DE81","orcidId":"0000-0003-3076-0337","documentHash":"bfb3cd8e-156e-4a5b-ad37-561d36c24d2a"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jobe.2022.104643"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["zarodniki Alternaria","biometeorologia","transport atmosferyczny","epidemiologia alergenów patogenicznych"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["epidemiology","pathogens","Alternaria fungal spores","Aeroallergens","Biometeorology","atmospheric transport"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f903","uid":"bDRV4MaxR-ZX3JsID2JoVuw","uuid":"6d62a94f-547c-43bd-8416-8fbcb223b250","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","parentUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","rootUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","name":"Instytut Biologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a7878c28a047399f99"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Bioaerosols on the atmospheric super highway : an example of long distance transport of Alternaria spores from the Pannonian Plain to Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"Science of the Total Environment","doi":null,"issn":"0048-9697","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"59516ca8-3554-4f06-a1d4-f330ee71985e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"MAY","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62ce7d174097075e7c65647e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6661a1444097074fa1bcc7e3","6661a1444097074fa1bcc7e4","6661a1444097074fa1bcc7e5","5e7092a7878c28a047399f99","6661a1444097074fa1bcc7e6","6661a1444097074fa1bcc7e7","6661a1444097074fa1bcc7e8","6661a1444097074fa1bcc7e9","6661a1444097074fa1bcc7ea","6661a1444097074fa1bcc7eb","6661a1444097074fa1bcc7ec","6661a1444097074fa1bcc7ed","6661a1444097074fa1bcc7ee","6661a1444097074fa1bcc7ef","6661a1444097074fa1bcc7f0","6661a1444097074fa1bcc7f1","6661a1444097074fa1bcc7f2","6661a1444097074fa1bcc7f3","6661a1444097074fa1bcc7f4","6661a1444097074fa1bcc7f5","6661a1444097074fa1bcc7f6","6661a1444097074fa1bcc7f7","6661a1444097074fa1bcc7f8"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Alternaria spores are pathogenic to agricultural crops, and the longest and the most severe sporulation seasons are predominantly<br />recorded in rural areas, e.g. the Pannonian Plain (PP) in South-Central Europe. In Poland (Central Europe),<br />airborne Alternaria spore concentrations peak between July and August. In this study, we test the hypothesis that the<br />PP is the source of Alternaria spores recorded in Poland after the main sporulation season (September–October).<br />Airborne Alternaria spores (2005–2019)were collected using volumetric Hirst spore traps located in 38 locations along<br />the potential pathways of air masses, i.e. from Serbia, Romania and Hungary, through the Czech Republic, Slovakia<br />and Ukraine, to Northern Poland. Three potential episodes of Long Distance Transport (LDT) were selected and characterized<br />in detail, including the analysis of Alternaria spore data, back trajectory analysis, dispersal modelling, and description<br />of local weather and mesoscale synoptic conditions.<br />During selected episodes, increases in Alternaria spore concentrations in Poznań were recorded at unusual times that<br />deviated from the typical diurnal pattern, i.e. at night or during morning hours. Alternaria spore concentrations on<br />the PP were very high (&gt;1000 spores/m3) at that time. The presence of non-local Ambrosia pollen, common to the<br />PP, were also observed in the air. Air mass trajectory analysis and dispersal modelling showed that the northwest<br />part of the PP, north of the Transdanubian Mountains, was the potential source area of Alternaria spores.<br />Our results show that Alternaria spores are transported over long distances from the PP to Poland. These spores may<br />markedly increase local exposure to Alternaria spores in the receptor area and pose a risk to both human and plant<br />health.

It uses many instances of small perceptron neural networks in a massively parallel manner and runs on Jetson TX2 platform, which uses a GPU for parallel processing. Based on performed benchmarking, approximately 140,000 sensors can be processed in real time within the sensor sampling period equal to 10 ms and an accuracy of 99%.

These new concepts consider the possibility of using electrical machines both as starters and generators, as well as suspension systems for the turbine shafts of aircraft engines. The paper will present mathematical analysis regarding active magnetic bearing (AMB) implementation for rotor–shaft support. This technology allows the elimination of friction forces between cooperating kinematic pairs (stator and rotor), reduces the adverse effects of classic bearings, and increases operating speed range and an operational susceptibility. The mathematical and numerical analysis of active magnetic suspension systems are presented.

To elicit a response to the stress factors, interactions between reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, calcium ions, mitogen-activated protein kinases, calcium-dependent protein kinases, calcineurin B-like interacting protein kinase, phytohormones and transcription factors occur. The integration of all these elements enables the change of gene expression, and the release of the antioxidant defence and protein repair systems. There are still numerous gaps in knowledge on these subjects in the literature caused by the multitude of signalling cascade components, simultaneous activation of multiple pathways and the intersection of their individual elements in response to both single and multiple stresses. Here, signal transduction pathways in cereal plants under drought, salinity, heavy metal stress, pathogen, and pest attack, as well as the crosstalk between the reactions during double stress responses are discussed. This article is a summary of the latest discoveries on signal transduction pathways and it integrates the available information to better outline the whole research problem for future research challenges as well as for the creative breeding of stress-tolerant cultivars of cereals."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058151756","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-30","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/11/8/1009","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62751e8f4097075854f93f24","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Labudda","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8014-1644","documentHash":"7f0c057f-b9b0-4476-917c-d482915545fe"},{"objectId":"62751e8f4097075854f93f22","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Muszyńska","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0419-4597","documentHash":"219200e8-89e7-4028-b07b-0c5ed814e406"},{"objectId":"62751e8f4097075854f93f20","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Graska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bb7de3b8-6fbd-444a-bb3f-2fa64d358c1a"},{"objectId":"62751e8e4097075854f93f1f","name":"Anna","lastName":"Rybarczyk-Płońska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a1fb7c75-f8d0-4f57-b30d-262763c82100"},{"objectId":"62751e8e4097075854f93f1e","name":"Beata","lastName":"Prabucka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1c776718-8933-4c86-8809-19a022e273bc"},{"objectId":"62751e8e4097075854f93f1d","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Fidler","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2474-1888","documentHash":"c0e0ad97-cd19-4230-bba6-894f1674aaa3"},{"objectId":"62751e8e4097075854f93f1c","name":"Marta","lastName":"Gietler","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-9414-9436","documentHash":"9f768194-f740-4423-985d-df19a7494d7d"},{"objectId":"62751e8e4097075854f93f1b","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Nykiel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7451d60f-4c6c-4752-b022-db937964ebfb"},{"objectId":"5e7093fd878c28a0473b4818","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Boguszewska-Mańkowska","uuid":"381CFA06887E23FE70114EA406C2171E45AB64CE7C2A69E9DDAEA1ABE1CC5D797EADE165CF8373F88245B6CD8977F37D4D161A63EACD304CF85C5849544E7529","orcidId":"0000-0002-2815-7507","documentHash":"9840416d-7c54-4f1a-ae01-23a48e440256"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a639a","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Morkunas","uuid":"BED12881F77FE386A5A8E7B7C462C644FA8D6D6AEC435CB695B7D4EB8AD97695DFF43599C249300071E7D0A98D643C238C913A915FBEEC28ED1E336ECC1AE4FE","orcidId":"0000-0003-4186-0202","documentHash":"46c02a67-f2c3-4618-b88e-4bda679557a1"}],"doi":"10.3390/plants11081009"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["grzyby przechowalnicze","grzyby patogeniczne","mykotoksyny","zdrowotność nasion","zdrowie człowieka","bezpieczeństwo żywności"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["storage fungi","pathogenic fungi","mycotoxins","seed health","human health","food safety"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a644b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The occurrence of fungi on the commercial dietary supplements based on the milk thistle (Silybum marianum (L.)

Gaertn.) is an important medicinal plant, its achenes\ncontain a silymarin, which has a regenerating and stabilizing effect on liver cells. The milk thistle based\ndietary supplements are among the best-selling plant pharmaceuticals in the US and the UE.\nObjective: The goal of the experiment was to determine which – if any – fungi contaminated either the\nwhole or ground milk thistle achenes, available on the Polish market.\nMethods: The mycological analyses were performed on 200 achenes, using deep-freeze blotter method.\nGround material was assessed using agar test method. For each sample, 10 Petri dishes were used. The material was applied in five places per one Petri dish, with a micro scoop laboratory spatula. Then, Petri dishes\nwith achenes and ground material were incubated at 20°C under alternating cycles of 12 h NUV light and\n12 h darkness. The identification of fungi was performed using stereo microscope and compound microscope, if necessary.\nResults: The milk thistle achenes were infested with following fungi: Alternaria alternata, Alternaria sp.,\nAspergillus flavus, Aspergillus spp., Bipolaris sp., Cladosporium spp., Epicoccum nigrum, Fusarium spp.,\nMelanospora simplex, Mucor spp., Penicillium spp., Phoma sp., Rhizopus stolonifer, Sarocladium strictum,\nStemphylium botryosum, Trichothecium roseum, Ulocladium consortiale and Verticillium sp.

Individuals with current or past infection should be identified as soon as possible to prevent the spread of disease. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is an analytical technique that has the potential to be used to detect viruses at the site of therapy. In this context, SERS is an exciting technique because it provides a fingerprint for any material. It has been used with many COVID-19 virus subtypes, including Deltacron and Omicron, a novel coronavirus. Moreover, flexible SERS substrates, due to their unique advantages of sensitivity and flexibility, have recently attracted growing research interest in real-world applications such as medicine. Reviewing the latest flexible SERS-substrate developments is crucial for the further development of quality detection platforms. This article discusses the ultra-responsive detection methods used by flexible SERS substrate. Multiplex assays that combine ultra-responsive detection methods with their unique biomarkers and/or biomarkers for secondary diseases triggered by the development of infection are critical, according to this study. In addition, we discuss how flexible SERS-substrate-based ultrasensitive detection methods could transform disease diagnosis, control, and surveillance in the future. This study is believed to help researchers design and manufacture flexible SERS substrates with higher performance and lower cost, and ultimately better understand practical applications."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058151766","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cfebc2409707101fea8258","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"7","doi":null,"documentHash":"e8431b47-af64-477b-9d69-939e69e4f00a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"Article number: 466","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6374/12/7/466/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62cfebc2409707101fea8256","name":"Wei-Hung","lastName":"Chiang","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6350-6696","documentHash":"b022a986-979d-49ee-9920-6226477fee81"},{"objectId":"62cfebc2409707101fea8255","name":"Navid","lastName":"Omidifar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fb05db1c-b614-4cad-ad99-8c45f5388f9f"},{"objectId":"62cfebc2409707101fea8254","name":"Ahmad","lastName":"Gholami","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-1851-159X","documentHash":"30015a9f-5c30-472e-891a-561fcbfcb4ac"},{"objectId":"62cfebc2409707101fea8253","name":"Masoomeh Yari","lastName":"Kalashgrani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"adbcfae9-4125-4f04-aaaa-086aacc91610"},{"objectId":"62cfebc2409707101fea8251","name":"Seyyed Alireza","lastName":"Hashemi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3fcccb4a-0e22-40bc-9f3b-fa061e22ef4d"},{"objectId":"62cfebc2409707101fea8250","name":"Seyyed Mojtaba","lastName":"Mousavi","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2866-9286","documentHash":"d762238c-bb93-4e8f-a5b6-24671708391c"},{"objectId":"6038852e9543c7410626fcf5","name":"Vahid","lastName":"Rahmanian","uuid":"DF88832D8A6E6F1933DA47DC3F56F0CF31B3E27487C32951A3C405043903A0849A085263CCE587E5167CA62A8EC9CD4CE6A0498506B8FBAC74434477007623F9","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5a20f4c8-8fb6-4409-9882-14854350cffe"}],"doi":"10.3390/bios12070466"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hypoxia-ischemia","birth asphyxia","group II metabotropic glutamate receptors","LY379268","NAAG","neuroprotection","apoptosis","neurotrophins"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","parentUuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","rootUuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of group II mGlu receptors activation after experimental birth asphyxia (hypoxia-ischemia) on the expression of factors involved in apoptosis and neuroprotective neurotrophins. Hypoxia-ischemia (HI) on 7-day-old rats was used as an experimental model. The effects of intraperitoneal application of mGluR2 agonist LY379268 (5 mg/kg) and the specific mGluR3 agonist NAAG (5 mg/kg) (1 h or 6 h after HI) on apoptotic processes and initiation of the neuroprotective mechanism were investigated. LY379268 and NAAG applied shortly after HI prevented brain damage and significantly decreased pro-apoptotic Bax and HtrA2/Omi expression, increasing expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. NAAG or LY379268 applied at both times also decreased HIF-1α formation. HI caused a significant decrease in BDNF concentration, which was restored after LY379268 or NAAG administration. HI-induced increase in GDNF concentration was decreased after administration of LY379268 or NAAG. Our results show that activation of mGluR2/3 receptors shortly after HI prevents brain damage by the inhibition of excessive glutamate release and apoptotic damage decrease. mGluR2 and mGluR3 agonists produced comparable results, indicating that both receptors may be a potential target for early treatment in neonatal

A glutamatergic system dysfunction has been reported to be implicated in the pathomechanism of AD. Therefore, in the current study we characterized the transcriptional profile of glutamate-related genes in transgenic AbPP V717I (TgAD) and sporadic (SAD, streptozotocin-induced) models of AD. Genes encoding glutamate membrane-bound (GLAST, GLT1, EAAC1) and vesicular (VGLUT1-3) transporters as well as ionotropic (AMPA, NMDA) and metabotropic (mGluR3, mGluR5) receptors were analysed. Based on qPCR analysis, we observed a discrepancy between TgAD and SAD mice in the profile of targeted genes. We noticed age-dependent upregulation of genes encoding VGLUT1, NMDAR1 and mGluR3 in 12-month-old TgAD mice. In the SAD model upregulation of genes encoding AMPAR1 and NMDAR1 as well as downregulation of GLAST, VGLUT3 and mGluR5 were found. Next, the effect of fingolimod (FTY720) was indicated. In the TgAD model, the drug reversed altered transcription of the mGluR3 glutamate receptor to the control level, whereas in the SAD model it downregulated the genes encoding VGLUT1, AMPAR2 and mGluR3. Interestingly, FTY720 influenced mGluR3 mRNA in both examined models. Observed alterations of gene transcription and the effects of FTY720 may potentially constitute an interesting target for further pharmacological studies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058151773","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62692e6e409707015987750e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"60","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"87ecbbf4-42ee-46c9-b60f-bd70407a2d64"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"60","pagesFromTo":"10-23","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/doi_ft/10.5114/fn.2022.114302","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b7c1","name":"Robert","lastName":"Strosznajder","uuid":"ABE7F3F8AB6E3B282DF1FBA2CFE8D7D0A4C3839CE97570E1A434B9CCC42FC2317D0F7104C6BD51E32517FF96CEC2B20321CA79189C3050317B7A90BE8E75428A","orcidId":"0000-0002-1922-0295","documentHash":"4c2f3110-8d91-4be1-8b2d-10107643e53e"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739adbd","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Wencel","uuid":"10F5A013EE704714C33E51F574DC33FB8C55200A85BC64BEE3836E1E3D1B3886D537563F7B23E3F49342B240ADBA43CF6E0E6D18537C572724113975F7395FD5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0587-2951","documentHash":"afda368c-4077-4a66-8c44-14fc454ae1ce"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397e36","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Sulkowski","uuid":"C70D832ED4703A0918EB0AD804671514F7E8A6A58EC9DC880B386968C929816B4EFF2877CCB54C820F1935EAFDBF80068DE4D56B99D9D5EEF6AF5591EFAE9238","orcidId":"0000-0002-4812-2205","documentHash":"b7a566f5-1256-45bc-97af-8822f593d565"},{"objectId":"5e709287878c28a0473974e8","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Strużyńska","uuid":"737C26782247E91A83D0ABB84B1857C77ADB7B38EF31321BA74CC0DB5082E5DAD2052046CCBE52BE5F9FBD8222CC158DC0B4A49A23E354C69224412176C851F5","orcidId":"0000-0002-9007-792X","documentHash":"35bc725f-efcd-4843-a1e4-1afe0b1aef5c"},{"objectId":"5e70927a878c28a047396767","name":"Beata","lastName":"Dąbrowska-Bouta","uuid":"29DEE9B56BBD1AE51D3825292159A9F22E4903FBE46DD58099581ABC1CB41864381C550A7FCD1EFB9C53A8ADC6B303F6C0B74465726BC9FA4656504DE3078B24","orcidId":"0000-0002-8625-4559","documentHash":"46a5d151-7578-4d3c-a45c-0405ebaba830"}],"doi":"10.5114/fn.2022.114302"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709193878c28a04737f082","uid":"b9SXTF1Zzo_eiHN0JX9AfyA","uuid":"951ff117-fef4-4ad2-81fa-149f6095a5a7","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Centrum Nowych Technologii UW","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709359878c28a0473a7d68"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Reactions of a Four‐Membered Borete with Carbon, Silicon, and Gallium Donor Ligands: Fused and Spiro‐Type Boracycles","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775f1","mniswId":"3513","title":"Chemistry-A European Journal","doi":"10.1002/chem.","issn":"0947-6539","eissn":"1521-3765","websiteLink":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1521-3765","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"56606be2-854e-47eb-92eb-2de5acecfa73"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62d10fda4097073a4bc4f77b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62d10fda4097073a4bc4f77c","62d10fdb4097073a4bc4f77d","62d10fdb4097073a4bc4f77e","62d10fdb4097073a4bc4f77f","5e709359878c28a0473a7d68","62d10fdb4097073a4bc4f781"]},"issue":"32","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Donor-acceptor cyclopropanes or cyclobutanes are dipolar reagents, which are widely used in the synthesis of complex organic (hetero)cycles in ring expansion reactions.

The paper presents new possibilities for monitoring exhaust emissions using an exhaust gas analyzer. At the same time, it points out the topicality and significance of the issue in the monitored area. It examines the impact of a change in fuel on emissions. This change is monitored in various areas of vehicle operation. Measurements were performed during real operation, which means that the results are fully usable and applicable in practice. The driving simulation as well as the test conditions correspond to the RDE (Real Driving Emissions) test standard. A commercially available car was first selected to perform the tests, which was first measured in the original configuration (petrol drive). Based on real-time RDE driving tests, it is possible to determine the number of exhaust emissions. Subsequently, the same measurements were performed with the same vehicle, but the vehicle’s propulsion was changed to LPG. The vehicle was equipped with an additional system that allowed the vehicle to be powered by LPG. The results from the individual driving tests allowed the determination of the exhaust emissions. Emissions of CO (carbon monoxide), CO2 (carbon dioxide), HC (hydrocarbons), and NOx (nitrogen oxides) were monitored as a matter of priority. Through the driving tests, it was found that the gasoline combustion produced higher CO (1.926 g/km) and CO2 (217.693 g/km) emissions compared to the combustion of liquefied gas, where the concentration of the CO emissions was 1.892 g/km and that of the CO2 emissions was 213.966 g/km. In contrast, the HC (0.00397 g/km) and NOx (0.03107 g/km) emissions were lower when petrol was burned. During LPG combustion, the HC emissions reached 0.00430 g/km, and the NOx emissions reached 0.05134 g/km. At the end of the research, the authors compared the emissions determined by real driving (in g/km) with the emission values produced by the emission standard EURO 4 and the certificate of conformity (COC). Practical measurements showed that the vehicle produced excessive amounts of CO when burning gasoline. This production is 0.926 g/km higher and 0.892 g/km higher when burning LPG compared to the limit set by the Euro 4 Emission Standard. The difference is even greater than the limit value stated in the COC document. For other substances, the monitored values are in the norm and are even far below the permitted value."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058151777","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e6eab52467f030e8c433a6","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"6f6ef340-c61f-44fb-8d93-a045bc59a21f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1184","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/3/1184","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6735f22dfdbe832d85a4911c","name":"Michal","lastName":"Loman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"747133c8-cc2c-436e-b4b5-7667579ebad7"},{"objectId":"6735f22dfdbe832d85a4911b","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Tarnapowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"34043fa5-6699-42de-afc5-25bf4deec7f1"},{"objectId":"6735f22dfdbe832d85a4911a","name":"Marek","lastName":"Jaśkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2fe51b68-8ae2-4ebf-89c9-73366bd903eb"},{"objectId":"6735f22dfdbe832d85a49119","name":"Branislav","lastName":"Šarkan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2ea5c5e4-479f-4205-8b2d-00aa054af32b"},{"objectId":"5e709334878c28a0473a4e24","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Kubiak","uuid":"24045639B33B92BBDA4CE920035016DB01FE4CFE4C34D8FF1F7D328D40A6FE298DE33B6AE68BE9A945A0C1C706231063D63C05B8DEF8912AA6D7ACC875F1D09D","orcidId":"0000-0003-0225-9609","documentHash":"b2eba1c6-926e-4e1a-aee3-b44dc75ab5de"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15031184"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["honey powder","spray drying","carrier","FTIR spectroscopy","chemometric analysis"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Classification of Honey Powder Composition by FTIR Spectroscopy Coupled with Chemometric Analysis","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":null,"issn":"1420-3049","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"85ea3d3d-2670-4384-98ee-1b5b44edab21"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-13","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62ce77eb4097075e7c6551e6","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["648e05bd4097077564282198","648e05bd4097077564282199","648e05bd409707756428219a","648e05bd409707756428219b","648e05bd409707756428219c","648e05bd409707756428219d","5e70923b878c28a04739220b"]},"issue":"12","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in connection with chemometric analysis were used as a fast and direct approach to classify spray dried honey powder compositions in terms of honey content, the type of diluent (water or skim milk), and carrier (maltodextrin or skim milk powder) used for the preparation of feed solutions before spray drying. Eleven variants of honey powders containing different amounts of honey, the type of carrier, and the diluent were investigated and compared to pure honey and carrier materials. Chemometric discrimination of samples was achieved by principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) modelling procedures performed on the FTIR preprocessed spectral data for the fingerprint region (1800–750 cm−1) and the extended region (3600–750 cm−1). As a result, it was noticed that the type of carrier is a significant factor during the classification of different samples of powdered multifloral honey. PCA divided the samples based on the type of carrier, and additionally among maltodextrin-honey powders it was possible to distinguish the type of diluent.

The pooled incidence rates were: prevalent neoplasia 4.5 % (95 %CI 2.2 %–8.9 %) at baseline and an additional 0.3 % (0.1 %–0.7 %) within the first 6 months, PEBN 0.52 % (0.46 %–0.58 %), and incident neoplasia 1.4 % (0.9 %–2.1 %). At 3 years from the index endoscopy, PEBN accounted for 3 % of total Barrett’s neoplasia, while prevalent neoplasia accounted for 97 %.\n\nConclusion Neoplasia detected at or within 6 months of index endoscopy accounts for most cases of Barrett’s neoplasia (> 90 %). PEBN accounts for ~3 % of cases and can be used for validation in future. This highlights the importance of a high quality index endoscopy in Barrett’s esophagus and the need to establish quality benchmarks to measure endoscopists’ performance."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058151790","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6400a6f94097072cded00f98","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"54","number":"9","doi":"","documentHash":"fd3a90ff-dc11-4e7d-9593-1e77b2a0029e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"54","pagesFromTo":"881-889","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.thieme-connect.de/products/ejournals/pdf/10.1055/a-1729-8066.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"626bc47140970752eddc78c9","name":"Prateek","lastName":"Sharma","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ab81157e-1d26-41d5-9724-3c381ba5505d"},{"objectId":"626bc47140970752eddc78c7","name":"Cesare","lastName":"Hassan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a1b5476c-cf63-4f56-8c04-f1692d61020e"},{"objectId":"626bc47140970752eddc78c6","name":"Alessandro","lastName":"Repici","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6291ce5a-d672-453d-ad84-50ec1e1173a6"},{"objectId":"626bc47140970752eddc78c5","name":"Suneha","lastName":"Sundaram","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6774-5451","documentHash":"0d9a0350-2a24-4828-809f-8e6a1a5df5d9"},{"objectId":"626bc47140970752eddc78c4","name":"Pankush","lastName":"Kalgotra","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d1a1331b-e8be-44ac-93d2-c51f3bae2b74"},{"objectId":"626bc47140970752eddc78c3","name":"Abhishek","lastName":"Challa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a570bfc6-c5c6-4b21-bcb3-b04a1365c76f"},{"objectId":"626bc47140970752eddc78c2","name":"Venkat","lastName":"Nutalapati","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5f100734-fa2a-45ff-be65-896485097d7c"},{"objectId":"626bc47140970752eddc78c1","name":"Sachin","lastName":"Srinivasan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"47c69e7c-0fee-4b96-95f7-5d166b98fe2e"},{"objectId":"626bc47140970752eddc78c0","name":"David","lastName":"Lieberman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c9141f10-44b8-4b2a-990b-93e6db1c6dab"},{"objectId":"626bc47140970752eddc78bf","name":"Madhav","lastName":"Desai","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a064a917-2963-4a09-a017-537b8028a0c5"},{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae60f","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kamiński","uuid":"CC13E360DCD3F04BEC2AFC4F83774E20061FAD57A2BDB4FA6BE34FD8FFF5C7DAB09BFDAB880637C59100DFA836A0A2F469F37AEAD09465A03463A9D599269EF6","orcidId":"0000-0002-9714-6457","documentHash":"6481674e-4774-40a8-a1ee-b92ae79fc8f6"}],"doi":"10.1055/a-1729-8066"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Molecular structure; Nanoparticles; Aggregation; Plasmons; Metal nanoparticlesLangmuir"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f82d","uid":"baM7_bWGivADreGHZOXP9TA","uuid":"f30e0713-62f4-48d4-adfd-229566974a34","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","parentUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","rootUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","name":"Wydział Chemii (od 1.10.2019 r.)","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709337878c28a0473a51f8"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b0039","5fc4accd085dcb1e6ae0b89f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Probing E/Z Isomerism Using Pillar[4]pyridinium/Gold Nanoparticle Ensembles and Their Photoresponsive Behavior","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478c83","mniswId":"13449","title":"Langmuir","doi":null,"issn":"0743-7463","eissn":"1520-5827","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"f95168ab-9db8-44d9-aaf9-792e619e3349"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-15","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62724b6d4097077af5262b03","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709337878c28a0473a51f8","5fc4accd085dcb1e6ae0b89f","5e7093bd878c28a0473b0039"]},"issue":"16","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Despite the fundamental importance and broad applicability of E/Z dicarboxylic acids, their discrimination remains challenging and greatly unexplored.

Efficacy and safety of ofatumumab with iphosphamide, etoposide and cytarabine (O‐IVAC) was evaluated in a single‐arm study. Dosing was modified for elderly patients. Patients received up to six cycles of treatment. The primary end‐point was the overall response rate (ORR). Patients were evaluated every two cycles and then six and 12 months after treatment. Other end‐points included progression‐free survival (PFS), event‐free survival (EFS), overall survival (OS) and safety. Seventy‐seven patients received salvage treatment with O‐IVAC. The average age was 56.8 years; 39% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of at least 3; 78% had disease of Ann Arbor stage 3 or 4; 58% received one or more prior salvage therapies. The ORR for O‐IVAC was 54.5%. The median duration of study follow‐up was 70 months. The median PFS and EFS were 16.3 months each. The median OS was 22.7 months. Age, ECOG performance status and the number of prior therapy lines were independent predictors of survival. Treatment‐related mortality was 15.5%. O‐IVAC showed a high response rate in a difficult‐to‐treat population and is an attractive treatment to bridge to potentially curative therapies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058151882","journalIssue":{"objectId":"626ae8cb4097075861ce41af","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"1ca3bb89-1687-453c-98be-f256621a81f2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"198","pagesFromTo":"73-81","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bjh.18166","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"626ae8cb4097075861ce41ad","name":"Jan","lastName":"Walewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c01d21e1-c8c2-497b-9945-43b608280231"},{"objectId":"626ae8cb4097075861ce41ac","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Rymkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"59217ebf-9feb-46de-b4a5-e674028c518e"},{"objectId":"626ae8cb4097075861ce41ab","name":"Jan

w badaniach nad niepełnosprawnością zmiana paradygmatyczna niesie ze sobą również zmiany w strategii działań pomocy społecznej. Sprzyja to przekształcaniu działań pomocowych w kierunku wzmacniania samodzielności, autonomii oraz wspierania aktywności klientów pracowników socjalnych. Celem artykułu jest określenie roli czynników personalnych w kształtowaniu autonomii i uczestnictwa w życiu społecznym osób z niepełnosprawnością ruchową. Zastosowano metodę sondażu diagnostycznego z wykorzystaniem IPA (The Impact on Participation and Autonomy Questionnaire) oraz kwestionariusza własnej konstrukcji. Wyniki wskazują, że poczucie autonomii i uczestnictwa można wyjaśnić przy udziale trzech czynników personalnych związanych z niepełnosprawnością, takich jak poziom samodzielności w codziennym funkcjonowaniu, sposób poruszania się i wiek nabycia niepełnosprawności, oraz dwóch czynników socjodemograficznych, takich jak wiek i miejsce zamieszkania. W praktyce pracy socjalnej uwzględnianie czynników związanych z niepełnosprawnością indywidualizuje i zwiększa efektywność wsparcia."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058151887","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"37","pagesFromTo":"95-108","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5604/01.3001.0015.8167","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709375878c28a0473aa2f5","name":"Marlena","lastName":"Duda","uuid":"CF89EC3322AF8D0BC0C4E63EDF1B9E6B7E5D9FE0BAAF1893DD88FE2BC52DF29786036787CF1E0BDE895E14629120B99C7C320FE94795967DA39C64CE0DD61038","orcidId":"0000-0001-9168-808X","documentHash":"cba9f4fc-a487-4d40-8ee1-6a0c634b5038"}],"doi":"10.5604/01.3001.0015.8167"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decd","uid":"bDVT6eE951oVevqx9vwsANA","uuid":"52307719-d5a8-4e16-8c65-acc1f011e9bb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decd","parentUuid":"52307719-d5a8-4e16-8c65-acc1f011e9bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decd","rootUuid":"52307719-d5a8-4e16-8c65-acc1f011e9bb","name":"Główny

COVID-19 pandemic caused a major upheaval to the lives of people and placed a strain on societal mental health. The aim of this research is to estimate the impact of the pandemic on the mental condition of the Polish population measured through the consumption of relevant medication and medical leave of absence from the workplace.\n\nMethods: We analyzed national-level data on the consumption of pharmaceuticals used in clinical practice in Poland in the treatment of depression and anxiety alongside medical absence in the workplace using the Interrupted Time Series model to estimate the significance of the pandemic.\n\nResults: We found no significant change regarding the consumption of pharmaceuticals with the development of the pandemic. Conversely, medical leaves of absence for psychiatric reasons increased significantly with the onset of COVID-19. The influence was strongest in the diagnosis of anxiety or reaction to severe stress and weakest in recurrent depression.\n\nConclusion: The pandemic had a significant influence on the ability to work for psychiatric patients in Poland but did not change pharmaceutical use. Physicians should consider the mental health of patients impacted by the anti-epidemic measures. Further study is needed to fully understand the long-term impact of the pandemic on mental health in Poland."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058151931","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6214a2502467f02f1e60a4ec","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"19","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"fe49ebf0-2d25-4fae-9c71-fb05b0767896"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"art. id. 2135 (1-11)","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/4/2135/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62722ea44097077af5256022","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Krupa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ae5f16e6-2711-4a64-88c3-da49ba347d6c"},{"objectId":"5e70933a878c28a0473a554b","name":"Anna","lastName":"Mosiołek","uuid":"FF2AB97D93A1537E86A5340038E0CE4E19A22EF3B22486F2E73D9FB0BE0088F615A8A1A2025990C18C614ED9FE92F0EEE591F1E6E56613761527A356591F18A7","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8cfd12d2-c843-46c0-b01d-0edd9f8eb86e"},{"objectId":"5e70933a878c28a0473a54ba","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"CZECH","uuid":"FA5F2297EB11CF714DED7176D935BCE45269B1BCD2DF5CD57380EC2194C230F736644073417E7DC57AB5FF0745E7E1925E8E63F2CDF1DC2FEF40C930C379A42A","orcidId":"0000-0001-7292-1712","documentHash":"3ccea24d-4d7f-4318-98ef-9066de8509b0"},{"objectId":"5e70921c878c28a047390170","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Pinkas","uuid":"0822759ACAF0374389765B26C7E9F179476D93FC6B78F5E089C982A84AE29A60D05AD442898E11B17A0124B716E2CA6DFAAF46EAA1B4F4D5B7D5E3D980240157","orcidId":"0000-0002-1015-9643","documentHash":"2ee4be0a-6607-4f82-9d43-babf906745fb"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19042135"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Outliers in databases · fuzzy rules · detection of outliers · outlying objects."]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918c878c28a04737e049","uid":"b4fgYY2Mxwh_PUhU7P68_Tg","uuid":"a5fea403-3e76-478e-937d-8d6ba69cf30c","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Wydział Fizyki Technicznej, Informatyki i Matematyki Stosowanej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709203878c28a04738e974","5e7093c1878c28a0473b02fc","5ebed8ca752340254fc41141"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Detection and Recognition of Outliers by the Use of IF-THEN rules","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":{"objectId":"626a6e514097075861cc7ff4","doi":null,"title":"PP-RAI'2022 Proceedings of the 3rd Polish Conference on Artificial Intelligence April 25-27, 2022, Gdynia, Poland","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-7421-401-8","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://wydawnictwo.umg.edu.pl/pp-rai2022/pdfs/ProceedingsPP-RAI2022.pdf","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"7500e1c5-0789-4497-937c-c594ffe72bb8","publisher":null,"openAccess":null},"_version":4,"objectId":"626a73fe4097075861cc99b6","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"626a6e514097075861cc7ff5","mniswId":null,"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"fullName":"3rd Polish Conference on Artificial Intelligence","shortName":"PP-RAI'2022","city":null,"country":null,"website":"https://wydawnictwo.umg.edu.pl/pp-rai2022/pdfs/ProceedingsPP-RAI2022.pdf","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"6ffc8d52-c4af-42d8-8ee0-bd605b1d72ba"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093c1878c28a0473b02fc","5ebed8ca752340254fc41141","5e709203878c28a04738e974"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In data mining and exploration, outliers are strange, specific,\nrare data in the database that cannot be ignored because they can pro-\nvide potentially dangerous information. Outlier detection can contribute\nto detecting an illegal usage of a credit card, breaking into transaction\nsystems at the bank, hacking into a computer system, etc. The paper\npresents an original fuzzy solution to the issue of outliers detection in\ndata sets. The following novelties are introduced: definition of an outlier\nin terms of fuzzy logic and methods for detecting and recognizing out-\nliers in databases.

In addition to the impact on native biodiversity, impoundments may facilitate biological invasions. A successful invasion is presumably related to the individual life history and resource allocation strategy in expanding populations. We tested whether reservoirs affect the body condition of invasive Faxonius limosus in upland streams. We found positive allometry of growth in females but more frequent isometric growth in males, and the form factor a3.0 was significantly higher in males than in females within populations. Fulton’s condition factor (K) was calculated for standard carapace lengths of 20 mm (juvenile) and 40 mm (adult). Both mean KCL 20 and KCL 40 were higher in males than in females. Positive allometry of growth in females resulted in a larger mean KCL 40 than KCL 20. The majority of the mean K obtained in reservoirs was similar or lower than the respective condition in streams. The condition of adult females was higher in streams in comparison to reservoirs. The obtained results are in contrast to the hypothesis that reservoirs positively affect individual body conditions and show that these man-made lakes do not provide more favourable habitat conditions for F. limosus than those in the natural aquatic environments of an upland landscape. An advantageous effect of the presence of reservoirs on invasion spread may be possible in more ecologically harsh landscapes, especially in colder climatic zones. Our study is the first to investigate the relationship of the body condition of F. limosus in two contrasting habitats."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058151940","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11356-022-19678-x.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70946f878c28a0473bcf28","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Bonk","uuid":"7E25FE0AF1632ED227FDCB52456E91D951106A4C573B627EA46F76587760E8E8ACAEBD1FBD509320DE3ADF85D19A9B72D85E2D08231781CAAA52A455F32980D6","orcidId":"0000-0003-4093-2542","documentHash":"0c9f2ce2-3ae4-4fdc-86d9-a743aa68fd71"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5b30","name":"Antoni","lastName":"Amirowicz","uuid":"7EE8A5B9ED322212E9FEE3009B1FC0821A584BACB87B9B6724B703CE4ADB6F9356A3FCC563BC34C1D909B31B7325BFB48C964BB6E0608D70424126F3BA28D2B5","orcidId":"0000-0002-9549-5944","documentHash":"529d7fe9-a058-437d-9694-3ffffb1f562e"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11356-022-19678-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091be878c28a04738758c","uid":"bMw2GI7iI3tW4yrhIZnPlyw","uuid":"b34e58bd-9a66-4ca8-9e42-c6cc0fa05453","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Katedra Herbologii i Technik Uprawy Roślin","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709224878c28a047390901","5e709224878c28a04739091a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The yield and weed infestation of winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L. ssp. oleifera Metzg) in two tillage systems","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d1","mniswId":"675","title":"Agriculture (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2077-0472","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"fb8db9b6-d4d7-498a-b26c-2119c1ad43da"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-14","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62cfc8c44097075e7c6f6492","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709224878c28a04739091a","5e709224878c28a047390901"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Results from a four-year field experiment were used to evaluate the effect of conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) systems on the yield, selected yield and crop structure elements, weed infestation, and contents of fat and glucosinolates in the seeds of winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L. ssp. oleifera Metzg).

The scope of the work covered the construction of four partial models, i.e., electricity yield from solar radiation conversion for three types of photovoltaic cells (mono- and polycrystalline and CIGS), energy storage in a PCM battery, heat losses in a PCM battery and energy collection from photoelectric conversion in PCM battery. Their construction was based on modelling methods selected on the basis of literature review and previous analyses, i.e., artificial neural networks (ANN), random forest (RF), enhanced regression trees (BRT), MARSplines (MARS), standard multiple regression (SMR), standard C&RT regression trees (CRT), exhaustive CHAID for regression (CHAID). Based on the analysis of the error values (APE, MAPE, ΔESRt), the best quality models were selected and used in the further part of the work. Based on the developed models, a simulation of the influence of the size of the photovoltaic power plant and the type of cells on the process of storing energy from photoelectric conversion in a PCM battery was carried out. For the battery under study, a PV power output of 9 kWp for mono and polycrystalline panels and 13 kWp for CIGS panels is recommended for reasons of energy storage efficiency. The obtained results made it possible to develop a model determining the amount of energy stored in a phase change battery depending on the power of a photovoltaic power plant and variable solar conditions. In order to store the greatest amount of energy, we should choose a source with a capacity to produce at least 70 kWh of electricity per day. In the final stage of the work, the indicators of solar radiation energy storage in the tested phase change accumulator were determined. For the battery tested, the solar energy storage efficiency can reach 12–13% for mono and polycrystalline panels and less than 7% for CIGS panels."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058151944","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e6eab52467f030e8c433a6","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"6f6ef340-c61f-44fb-8d93-a045bc59a21f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/3/1132/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6273748a409707200058e8c8","name":"Anna","lastName":"Karbowniczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c61b444a-f5d3-44b0-8ea1-cf490b37cbfb"},{"objectId":"5e709309878c28a0473a186d","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Książek","uuid":"D513BEEB30FBE9F98F4E883116E52CDFD1EB2FB236C2C7E29BF7075D0B513FE5CE4E1648130379B85067694F0F7AF1AA0762F377D9E98FE725CBB580D16BB740","orcidId":"0000-0003-0678-3328","documentHash":"7ae12b00-35b0-4fab-996e-b3267b456b7e"},{"objectId":"5e709306878c28a0473a1562","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Nęcka","uuid":"002C9AC654BDAF416C8FD168FD3C5C8AE72D22B014043BA6AC785AB6C631E653C0A6004A0367F8BEA7B90F7F705DE52E206FD0A79B7992EF761DCBBB68891752","orcidId":"0000-0002-0401-1239","documentHash":"4b72aaf0-69fb-4204-ae37-4ee6c0621ccb"},{"objectId":"5e709306878c28a0473a155b","name":"Hubert","lastName":"Latała","uuid":"4F4F53EDDE62826544EEF4A8649829DB5D281300A7EF0A57405048A7436BD15283141825FC2F78D0E5132759819B135B859729CE43074F0A5726F6A53EC9799B","orcidId":"0000-0002-8572-407X","documentHash":"45150c17-026c-43f3-b324-a63463ea4732"},{"objectId":"5e709306878c28a0473a1558","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Kurpaska","uuid":"1E22713E6732C3600E3E497026181E01DBE22DD3078A3B4442F53D23A269411A03AEB834910247541E84CA2A77CC04DB0133B025F1E73E3071C4B80A532C20C6","orcidId":"0000-0003-1885-4568","documentHash":"4db440c1-c527-4a15-ac3b-0f445d19b3ae"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15031132"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091c6878c28a047388f26","uid":"brVq5KJkWMPTyxpzHNjLrBw","uuid":"4f708f15-f7c3-4891-9d8f-3e8f78424f41","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Katedra Inżynierii i Maszyn Spożywczych","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709225878c28a047390a8e","5e709225878c28a047390a54","5e709225878c28a0473909ec"]},{"id":"5e7091c6878c28a047388f28","uid":"ba4GN1lrx1CIxpLlZSnBiBw","uuid":"86320de7-d68d-469f-845e-590bb97f9425","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Katedra Podstaw Techniki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709224878c28a047390945"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Technology for apple pomace utilization within a sustainable development policy framework","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","doi":null,"issn":"2071-1050","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"76492123-acbe-4743-a4ae-6a63f3108e24"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-02","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62ce84fd4097075e7c658851","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709224878c28a047390945","5e709225878c28a047390a8e","5e709225878c28a047390a54","5e709225878c28a0473909ec"]},"issue":"9","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this study was to develop a concept, within the framework of sustainable agriculture, for utilizing apple pomace as a valuable raw material in food production.

When using waste, the heavy metal (HM) concentration must be taken into account since HMs can be potentially released to the environment, posing a toxicity threat. The aim of the study was thus to estimate the availability for plants of Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb introduced into the soil with waste. We hypothesized that the prepared waste mixtures containing coal or biomass ash and municipal sewage sludge would reduce the environmental risk compared to the studied waste used separately. The research was conducted during a 6-year field experiment with grasses and legumes. HM concentration in soil, waste, and plant biomass; tolerance index; and uptake of HMs by plants were measured. The ash–sludge mixtures had a more favourable effect on the soil in terms of pHKCl, TOC, total nitrogen, and total exchangeable bases than the waste used separately. This provided beneficial conditions for plant growth and development. Consequently, the ash–sludge mixtures increased the plant yield as compared to ash alone, while the mixture containing the biomass ash also enhanced the yield in relation to the sewage sludge. The study showed that the mixtures allowed for a reduction of environmental risk arising from the HM input with waste to the soil. It was proven that HM availability for plants could be beneficially modified by mixing waste. Combining the coal ash with the sewage sludge is particularly recommended, owing to the unfavourable properties of coal ash for plants. The application of the higher dose of the coal ash–sludge mixture showed a better effect than the lower dose, while the influence of both doses of the biomass ash–sludge mixture was similar.

in peripheral areas need to fully utilize a multidimensional regional environment in order to reduce regional innovation gaps. To gain a deeper theoretical and empirical understanding of the determinants of innovation processes in peripheral areas, this article sheds light not only on hard infrastructure and financial factors, but also on institutional, social, and relational factors. Studies of innovation in peripheral areas were conducted with the classic concept of regional innovation systems. Based on the results of a survey among 300 entrepreneurs in Polish peripheral regions, it was found that peripheral regions suffer from a deficit of human and social capital, particularly local leaders and mentoring and networking assistance. In addition, the analysis shows that peripheral regions do not have an effective innovation development strategy, lack institutional capital, and local authorities are not working to remove local barriers."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058151964","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62ce9e684097070a2ca39a3f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"14","doi":"","documentHash":"cfbaa3ee-2704-4fa8-8001-611ca2fa7283"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"8529","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/14/8529#","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c542","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Czerwińska-Jaśkiewicz","uuid":"CE0ABA767BDB49FE468030D0D79984BCAFD7988D9FE72097FF87EB08E180DF7ED3D1FC510D69650AFC42C559D2F2C38A09DC9C836F50279405C68932CD88D94B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6904-670X","documentHash":"3b9b1b59-4599-4b15-ac33-dbbb7afe5bf1"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c540","name":"Maria","lastName":"Klonowska-Matynia","uuid":"9CD6E88EB86DBBC735BBE5647EEA6FD68A6B2D8CF2273791ADAA233C0B5C2A19F02055D7196B479C2241C0A8D934CAEFF0ADD21B9DE8032D6EED0472193BB9FA","orcidId":"0000-0002-4351-7304","documentHash":"0fe6c2a3-af91-417c-a485-bcaaab6c974d"},{"objectId":"5e70927d878c28a04739691d","name":"Patrycjusz","lastName":"Zarębski","uuid":"08C7C58E1CE469D65EED81DCC7DC93DCB4F94790659255CA55B81F95524C8254085E2D29CB91CC802EB2BA57C1D74DCF584A6D0F89A13C3DB311489749C74F3B","orcidId":"0000-0002-2774-9180","documentHash":"f309cf05-a9f4-4092-a64b-9aa6e77115fb"}],"doi":"10.3390/su14148529"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA1ODE1MTk2NA=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
