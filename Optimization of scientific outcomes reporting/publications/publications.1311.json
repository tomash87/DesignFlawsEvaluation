Its emergence has severely disrupted the functioning of health services and the economic and social situation worldwide. Therefore, new diagnostic and therapeutic tools are urgently needed to allow for the early detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and appropriate treatment, which is crucial for the effective control of the COVID-19 disease. The ideal solution seems to be the use of aptamers—short fragments of nucleic acids, DNA or RNA—that can bind selected proteins with high specificity and affinity. They can be used in methods that base the reading of the test result on fluorescence phenomena, chemiluminescence, and electrochemical changes. Exploiting the properties of aptamers will enable the introduction of rapid, sensitive, specific, and low-cost tests for the routine diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Aptamers are excellent candidates for the development of point-of-care diagnostic devices and are potential therapeutic tools for the treatment of COVID-19. They can effectively block coronavirus activity in multiple fields by binding viral proteins and acting as carriers of therapeutic substances. In this review, we present recent developments in the design of various types of aptasensors to detect and treat the SARS-CoV-2 infection."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554303","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"1-28","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/3/1412","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661f991e4097076263688589","name":"Marek","lastName":"Libura","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7b697469-3eb4-4f0c-9e19-6e6b1ae6050c"},{"objectId":"661f991e4097076263688588","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Szczur","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4c63a5e8-a34d-4b89-a7a7-63af168cfc0a"},{"objectId":"5e709454878c28a0473ba93e","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Wandtke","uuid":"1CE5B86DC3F11459966434F821645DD0896E084526E220513B7996F5A87946306AFED87DA26EAE442DEC8434F6297A0538E2BFB15F7600CC1E471483A9877B13","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bd713aa5-79cd-45fd-b1c1-fe99c532adfb"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7e32","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Wędrowska","uuid":"EE23B870FECE41194ADA0083E1A1B21EF1C81796BA8E53BE5F2F2BE0A22D52039FF80DA4BC096E06E7D16479770475E413EB3ED45600C63C560C67C95F7695C7","orcidId":"0000-0003-4478-6749","documentHash":"dbc4baed-3c2d-46b2-b674-5a9c9c371783"},{"objectId":"5e7092c1878c28a04739c1a3","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Przybylski","uuid":"AE3219B82777DD29DADB502851D6CEC1D13B8B1201E54C75786B4644AB4E014C4D8F3CEC4D3D0390D3B9B5DAD28252FA66A2FFB7ACA88F91B65FB090984E7CA6","orcidId":"0000-0002-8324-163X","documentHash":"33b83d5f-96b5-4f70-a4ff-d4a44340eb8a"},{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739c10c","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kopiński","uuid":"98EFCC986A0DD5BBF852DA40947FB4353414C9AA051F4A9A56FB2CAD71A96190206732739D5FCE2039870EAED505A8A9DFD80C54A239D368C50913ACA90FEDA4","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"17077f3c-2610-413e-813e-9338596ab1f1"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms23031412"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Zespół układowej odpowiedzi zapalnej","Laboratoria","COVID-19","Dzieci"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["PIMS-TS","Clinical symptoms","Laboratory tests","Child","COVID-19"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Clinical and laboratory characteristics of patients with paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with COVID-19 (PIMS-TS)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a282","mniswId":"28696","title":"Pielęgniarstwo XXI Wieku","doi":null,"issn":"1730-1912","eissn":"2450-646X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"72994ab8-e3ee-4fd0-880c-b63e2316860b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-09-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"661fa1bb409707626368e1ea","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["661fa1bb409707626368e1eb","5e70938b878c28a0473ac4cf","5e7092c1878c28a04739c12f"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Wstęp.

The study was a retrospective analysis of hospital records of 29 PIMS-TS patients of the Provincial Paediatric Hospital in Bydgoszcz hospitalised between November 2020 and August 2021.\r\nResults. Fever was found in 100% of the patients. Other symptoms reported were gastrointestinal problems, headache, apathy, oral infl ammation, and more. Every fourth patient was diagnosed with pulmonary interstitial lesions in the form of smudgy or fine patchy thickening. Echocardiographic tests showed decreased left ventricular contractility in 10 patients. Reduced left ventricular fractional shortening below 28% was found in four patients and ejection fraction below 55% in five patients. In every second child, abdominal ultrasound imaging showed lesions such as enlarged\r\nmesenteric lymph nodes, peritoneal effusion, or enlarged liver. Changes were also confirmed by laboratory tests. \r\n\r\nConclusions. Patients with PIMS-TS showed increased levels of inflammatory and myocardial dysfunction markers. The long-term prognosis for PIMS-TS is still uncertain.

The new approach considers the imprecise nature of CSR data through the fuzzy data envel- opment analysis (FDEA) method and further extends it by allowing for the dynamic interdependence of firms’ production decisions through adjustment costs, related to firms investments. In addition, the new method deals with zero or negative values for inputs and/or outputs of the data. The empirical appli- cation used in this paper considers a dataset of CSR activities of European firms for three industries (capital, consumption, and other) over the period 2014–2016. Two main results are found with this data. First, the study shows that fuzzy dynamic inefficiencies tend to be lower than these obtained from the conventional crisp evaluation of inefficiency. Second, the study finds some differences in dynamic inef- ficiencies at distinct levels of fuzziness. Overall, the results seem to confirm that the usage of dynamic fuzzy methodology adds some value to the standard crisp approach."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554306","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"306","pagesFromTo":"986–997","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661656cc40970762639cf616","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Ortiz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9fd61870-5558-4d7d-a2a1-26983faa1d88"},{"objectId":"661656cc40970762639cf615","name":"Juan","lastName":"Aparicio","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"10b13673-e594-4dfc-ba22-b5aa2c153f63"},{"objectId":"5e7093bf878c28a0473b0225","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kapelko","uuid":"04B7539A9C852658CD8CE86EA286B23DAF1027BB45A9139047FDDE516FD7F8EBC74A6D85F14988FA4315D2B102272BF2604351BB25401A334A498A82272DD97B","orcidId":"0000-0003-2020-2374","documentHash":"701b66d8-6580-49f7-b878-ee1f23f37431"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ejor.2022.09.003"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Niewydolność serca","Adiponektyna","Leptyna","Rokowanie"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Chronic heart failure","adipocytokines","adiponectin","tumor necrosis factor alpha","leptin","prognosis"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Selected adipocytokine concentrations in patients hospitalized for exacerbated chronic heart failure","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547eeb9","mniswId":"200457","title":"Medical Research Journal","doi":null,"issn":"2451-2591","eissn":"2451-4101","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"7decb22a-f62e-4c10-a82e-49dd5de51d3e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-06-13","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"661f992340970762636885c4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709344878c28a0473a60e8","6093a6c39543c73526c48d40","5e7092c1878c28a04739c13e","5e7092c3878c28a04739c342","5e7092c3878c28a04739c35b","661fa262409707626368e965","661fa262409707626368e966","661fa262409707626368e967"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: The role of adipose tissue as energy storage and endocrine organ is an area of interest in the treatment of several diseases. This study aimed to to evaluate blood adiponectin (ADP), leptin, tumor necrosis factor type alpha (TNF-alpha) concentrations, and their prognostic value in patients with exacerbated chronic heart failure (CHF).\r\nMethods and results: The following were assessed in 64 consecutive patients hospitalized for exacerbated CHF and a control group of 32 age and sex-matched individuals admitted due to life-limiting symptoms of peripheral artery disease: serum leptin, ADP, TNF-alpha concentrations, and body composition determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Compared to the control group, CHF patients had significantly higher blood ADP concentrations, a higher ratio of ADP to fat mass expressed as a percentage of body mass, and lower blood TNF-alpha concentrations and ratios of TNF-alpha to the visceral fat level (VFL). Compared to patients who survived, patients with CHF who died during the one-year follow-up had significantly higher values of ADP and higher ratios of ADP to body surface area. In the Cox regression model, blood ADP concentration was the only\r\nindependent risk factor in respect of all-cause mortality during the one-year follow-up (HR; 95% CI: 1.16; 1.03-1.31).\r\nConclusions: Patients with CHF present dysregulation in the secretion of ADP and TNF-alpha. Increased blood ADP concentration was associated with an increase in one-year all-cause mortality by 16%."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554308","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"7","pagesFromTo":"142-150","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.viamedica.pl/medical_research_journal/article/view/MRJ.a2022.0021","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661fa262409707626368e967","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Żbikowska-Gotz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"946e8249-2ac4-4e55-88df-d168b9523111"},{"objectId":"661fa262409707626368e966","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Anaszewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"03e51459-8659-402b-a688-b2a1a2d7f3bf"},{"objectId":"661fa262409707626368e965","name":"Anna","lastName":"Wawrzeńczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ca714c00-112c-4bb6-acdc-f8f8dcc249ee"},{"objectId":"6093a6c39543c73526c48d40","name":"Wioletta","lastName":"Banaś","uuid":"95D4585CFD5B2844AD678C87C44E7C10B26531197300A657792C5F444B85212EE673AB5B3DF87B5C0589D34DF16C6BC5204C46D70F07539E96CAFD39B3314C9A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dfd3565f-f589-4c79-9e3d-3f15f4bd0ac8"},{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a60e8","name":"Beata","lastName":"Szukay","uuid":"99F8435C5007446A6C1693D7D39999130D6084909E764A23F21BBC0A612C02DA1E5ABAA90C9EB434DEC6923098CDA1EFFE1317DED7C06195CC59D69A4CE0847A","orcidId":"0000-0003-2518-6887","documentHash":"00bbcb56-8feb-4d60-8e93-af30b4375523"},{"objectId":"5e7092c3878c28a04739c35b","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Budzyński","uuid":"77641D331628CC6FA49AD1807B8781CFC647860428EB6C29C520E09D629D93E662F00C53E6BF9A873F25DEAAF4145C77F5E4D7319206E246E2AE69C6DAF6B46E","orcidId":"0000-0003-3556-5821","documentHash":"5cf6cf23-8357-4660-bb39-1adf2924c5e4"},{"objectId":"5e7092c3878c28a04739c342","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Bartuzi","uuid":"DB458C16B223AAA739B7A9DC5AA133725337272ADE9DEE411367F7BFF8F0429FB05370DA31F03D52F5A201B1FA395635BEED1418F2AE8C34C4A022CC038D9698","orcidId":"0000-0001-8328-1386","documentHash":"626e6fe4-f6eb-427a-8dfd-16dcc9cf33bb"},{"objectId":"5e7092c1878c28a04739c13e","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Lis","uuid":"F6D172B73EBD3E2AE76A2600E762DBE0951006B72F450309B86AF8D6882C8316FC1A0C1047B4CD3100CB726CDE783A47C974F910CF9CC0541085E51D4BA207A0","orcidId":"0000-0003-2651-8468","documentHash":"ff6177b6-8d4d-4d19-a163-4f3be9e58063"}],"doi":"10.5603/mrj.a2022.0021"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"655b539840970749a82f1c1b","doi":null,"title":"Ludzie ziemi.

The problem with maintaining health and its care may concern school-age adolescents, and therefore health behavior should be shaped\r\nin this social group. Conscious choice of behaviors aimed at maintaining and improving health by using all available factors becomes one of the most important problems of our society. Great emphasis should be placed on learning to maintain good health. A healthy lifestyle is very important for every human being, because it is thanks to him that we have energy and willingness to function on a daily basis. The condition of our body is influenced by many important factors. It is certainly the number of hours of daily spending of time outdoors, in front of a computer, TV or other electronic devices with a screen. The diet used is also important. The main goal of the work is to demonstrate the impact of systematic and complementary educational activities on the change of pro-health attitudes among school students. The level of knowledge of students in the field of health education was assessed after conducting many health programs at school. It was examined whether the new information acquired during the implementation of school programs would change the lifestyle of young people. The research questions in this paper concern demonstrating the impact of systematic and complementary educational activities on changing pro-health attitudes of young people.\r\nOne of the main tasks aimed at confirming the hypotheses was to characterize the pro-health attitudes of schoolchildren. Research problems and hypotheses were verified by analyzing the content of the research results. As a result of the analysis of the results, conclusions were formulated in the field of pro-health knowledge, physical activity, nutrition, perception of own health and involvement in campaigns promoting a healthy lifestyle by school youth."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554318","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"17-36","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://zenodo.org/record/7062946.YxrxW7TP2Uk","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661fcdfd4097076263694f2f","name":"Dariusz W.","lastName":"Skalski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a0f691b0-54ae-40c9-bbd0-7b4b0f564523"},{"objectId":"661fcdfd4097076263694f2e","name":"Oleh","lastName":"Rybak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6b8a5114-2edf-4004-bcde-dee400e163aa"},{"objectId":"661fcdfd4097076263694f2d","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Jankiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d5b3be70-d78f-439f-85db-8aba8895bb7b"},{"objectId":"5e709419878c28a0473b6295","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Zieliński","uuid":"ACAB43E2E161D8607CB743908B401D2CF09E9ACEDD25765795980CB87BD7B2AD8768C8E72306453166EE85C033D708AB76D2DD0B24A66AD37101E3B5A51D93A6","orcidId":"0000-0002-0013-6448","documentHash":"a1668071-a471-4c98-95bf-6d06eb9b37a8"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Nowotwory jelita grubego - chirurgia","Jakość życia","Kwestionariusze"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["QLQ- CR29","Surgery","QLQ-C30"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","uid":"b_b7HPtUTCJYlxfss9Ssv-A","uuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","parentUuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","rootUuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","name":"Uniwersytet Mikołaja Kopernika w Toruniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092c3878c28a04739c3a9","5e709344878c28a0473a606a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Assessment of the quality of life in patients treated for colorectal cancer","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"61b9abfcad204581b62ebb09","mniswId":"201159","title":"Journal of Education, Health and Sport","doi":null,"issn":"2391-8306","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"MINISTRY","editor":null,"documentHash":"ca2f3bdf-81a2-4af7-a75f-f629cac05bb3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY_NC_SA","releaseDate":"2022-04-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"661f97184097076263686cdc","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709344878c28a0473a606a","5e7092c3878c28a04739c3a9","661fa184409707626368dd91","661fa184409707626368dd92"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Colorectal cancer is a common cause of death. The incidence of cancer increases every year, it is caused by better secondary prevention - screening and early stage cancer detection. The early stages of neoplasms enable the implementation of effective treatment. The method of treating colon cancer is radical treatment - surgery. The quality of life in patients with chronic diseases such as cancer is variable in each phase of the disease.\r\nThe presented work aims to show the quality of life of patients on the day of admission to the hospital for the surgical treatment of colorectal cancer. The study used standardized QLQ-C30 forms with the extension of the CR29 module. Comprehensive assessment of the quality of life enables the presentation of the patient's condition before the procedure and is the starting point for the assessment of the patient after the procedure.\r\nThe studies show that patients have the lowest assessment of the overall quality of life and emotional functioning. They judge physical and mental functioning well. Symptoms related to the disease, such as abdominal pain, significantly reduce the quality of life.\r\nThe presented research shows that each time before the procedure, the patient should have the quality of life assessed in order to possibly further compare the changes in the subjective assessment of the quality of life. The research shows that patients diagnosed with cancer have a low quality of life assessment and preventive measures should be implemented in the form of consultations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554319","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"326-334","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://apcz.umk.pl/JEHS/article/view/40074","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661fa184409707626368dd92","name":"Michał","lastName":"Jęchorek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4e0f1aa8-7c1d-42aa-803f-99150f8681a3"},{"objectId":"661fa184409707626368dd91","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Filarecka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"181aa01e-0ea7-4575-8900-38e66d4e42a6"},{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a606a","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Leksowski","uuid":"4DE44342E2FE3D8FA22D19EED64B51AF9E7A2AD16CCC434D3C09613C628CE474975ED77AADBC06C8E25DDCDB84CE7AB066D54C360AA55C993F4A929B84308F41","orcidId":"0000-0002-1197-4105","documentHash":"ac7950e8-a9f5-4ac3-8b50-ca84697bbad2"},{"objectId":"5e7092c3878c28a04739c3a9","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Biernacki","uuid":"C0C84476509B07442B583D57B03402DCC32477444FF3B60ED7EA437D6DB232C676DCA2E0ED83F9C49148DBAC44010B7788106DE079158E22620B24A8D2FC7EA2","orcidId":"0000-0002-6473-7883","documentHash":"58d8524f-877e-4c3f-957f-42fa98037d51"}],"doi":"10.12775/jehs.2022.12.04.027"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Electrical and electronic engineering","Electronic properties and materials","High-harmonic generation","Materials for devices","Surfaces, interfaces and thin films"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","uid":"bdkLR6wGCrp59lwUjwb_dMA","uuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","parentUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","rootUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","name":"Instytut Fizyki Jądrowej im.

Optoelectronic devices based on this effect are limited because it typically appears at low temperatures and in complex compounds characterized by Dirac or Weyl electrons. Here we report a room-temperature nonlinear Hall effect in polycrystalline thin films of the centrosymmetric elemental material bismuth. The electrons at the (111) surface possess a Berry curvature triple that activates side jumps and skew scatterings, which generate nonlinear transverse currents. We show that the zero-field nonlinear transverse voltage can be boosted in arc-shaped bismuth stripes due to an extrinsic geometric classical counterpart of the nonlinear Hall effect. The electrical frequency doubling in curved geometries can be extended to optical second-harmonic generation in the terahertz spectral range. We also demonstrate efficient third-harmonic generation in polycrystalline bismuth films and bismuth-based heterostructures across a broad range of terahertz frequencies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554321","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"7","pagesFromTo":"207-215","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41928-024-01118-y","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"66153cc44097076263998ba7","name":"Carmine","lastName":"Ortix","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a8c35c5b-3cb4-415b-b0d6-f304f4528102"},{"objectId":"66153cc44097076263998ba6","name":"Denys","lastName":"Makarov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"61129c67-11fc-4554-833e-f28600ba06c0"},{"objectId":"66153cc44097076263998ba5","name":"Fabian","lastName":"Ganss","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"17316722-778d-46d1-965f-f605a2352f35"},{"objectId":"66153cc44097076263998ba4","name":"Yurii","lastName":"Skourski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8bf7a87e-c9c8-420b-a815-7c592be6f21a"},{"objectId":"66153cc44097076263998ba3","name":"Tobias","lastName":"Kosub","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"32026bc3-cb08-44e6-8b64-8eb62b137ff5"},{"objectId":"66153cc44097076263998ba2","name":"Igor","lastName":"Veremchuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"18fba049-6f56-4885-8f71-210104e97644"},{"objectId":"66153cc44097076263998ba1","name":"Paul","lastName":"Chekhonin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aae39f96-200b-4b73-9e31-4c348e6d2845"},{"objectId":"66153cc44097076263998ba0","name":"Jan-Christoph","lastName":"Deinert","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4e692dee-f7c3-4362-b93f-3a4499d860a0"},{"objectId":"66153cc44097076263998b9f","name":"Thales V.A.G.","lastName":"de Oliveira","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ea9b8986-8967-41da-97af-f4bb72012db2"},{"objectId":"66153cc44097076263998b9e","name":"Gulloo","lastName":"Lal Prajapati","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"48646695-9518-48bb-9a64-adb3b92ec948"},{"objectId":"66153cc44097076263998b9d","name":"Atiga","lastName":"Arshad","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"85ee5e02-c12e-4892-be12-74b6d3f1b4f5"},{"objectId":"66153cc44097076263998b9c","name":"Alexey","lastName":"Ponomaryov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a7874432-11a9-4b6a-b1d7-ef8de5ee6e1c"},{"objectId":"66153cc44097076263998b9b","name":"Igor","lastName":"Ilyakov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d524a655-f139-4bd5-807f-ee395c643802"},{"objectId":"66153cc44097076263998b9a","name":"Sergey","lastName":"Kovalev","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d5de1c63-3e73-422d-be7c-5c3326f012e9"},{"objectId":"66153cc44097076263998b99","name":"Pavlo","lastName":"Makushko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b4dcd9bb-6779-40d9-af5d-6be87f27c438"},{"objectId":"5e7092cf878c28a04739d2ac","name":"Yevhen","lastName":"Zabila","uuid":"8C1045ED28CEB086E7F69A0040B1F6E26FEEC4C541F05F113A07952B16AFA7EA7BE08B7CA28E6030903C48443ACA3A309D1C956D925B502CCD54BB09996BFBC6","orcidId":"0000-0002-3931-5945","documentHash":"1b63cdcf-1553-4031-973d-06f19df84dc2"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41928-024-01118-y"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Nowotwory krwi","Komórki macierzyste hemopoetyczne -

Mycobacterial infections pose both diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The management of mycobacterial infections is particularly complicated for patients in haematology because of the many drug–drug interactions between antimycobacterial drugs and haematological and immunosuppressive treatments. The management of mycobacterial infections must also consider the effect of delaying haematological management. We surveyed the management practices for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in haematology centres in Europe. We then conducted a meticulous review of the literature on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of LTBI, tuberculosis, and nontuberculous mycobacterial infections among patients in haematology, and we formulated clinical guidelines according to standardised European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL) methods. In this Review, we summarise the available literature and the recommendations of ECIL 8 for managing mycobacterial infections in patients with haematological

The main aim of the study was to identify the key factors motivating people to make decisions regarding tourist offers. Additional aims of the research were segmentation of tourists with similar choice preferences, as well as market share simulation of trip offers not previously included in the study. Design/methodology/approach: Traditional conjoint analysis method was used for the measurement and analysis of stated consumers’ preferences. All calculations were carried out using R program and conjoint R package. Findings: The obtained results made it possible to calculate the importance of the factors included in the study, as well as to determine the most and least preferred profile of a tourist trip at the individual level as well as for all respondents. Also, estimation of market share of the so-called simulation profiles not ranked by the respondents before and segmentation of tourists with similar choice preferences has been made. Practical implications: Presented in the paper authoring conjoint R package is universal tool enabling the measurement and analysis of consumers' preferences of products and services,  as well as political opinions and other attitudes. Social implications: The conjoint R package implements the traditional conjoint analysis method similarly to the module Conjoint IBM SPSS program. The statistics (about half  a million of downloads by RStudio users) indicate that the non-commercial conjoint package is popular among users. Originality/value: The results of the research, as well as conjoint R package can interest of students and researchers in the field of microeconomics and marketing research in the practical application of the traditional conjoint method in analysis of stated preferences.

Recent reports indicate 2-14% of COVID-19 survivors develop POTS and 9-61% experience POTS-like symptoms, such as tachycardia, orthostatic intolerance, fatigue, and cognitive impairment within 6-8 months following a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Pathophysiological\r\nmechanisms of Post-COVID-19 POTS are not well understood. Current hypotheses include autoimmunity related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, autonomic dysfunction, direct toxic injury by SARS-CoV-2 to the autonomic nervous system, and invasion of the central nervous system by SARS-CoV-2. Practitioners should actively assess for POTS in patients with post-acute COVID syndrome symptoms. Given symptoms of Post-COVID-19 POTS are predominantly chronic orthostatic tachycardia, lifestyle modifications in combination with the use of heart rate-lowering medications along with other pharmacotherapies should be considered. For example, ivabradine or beta-blockers in combination with compression stockings and increasing salt and fluid intake has shown potential. Treatment teams should be multidisciplinary, including physicians of various specialties, nurses, psychologists, and physiotherapists. Additionally, more resources to\r\nadequately care for this patient population are urgently needed given the increased demand for autonomic specialists and clinics since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering our limited understanding of Post-COVID-19 POTS, further research on topics such as its natural history, pathophysiological mechanisms, and ideal treatment is warranted. This review evaluates the current literature available on the associations between COVID-19 and POTS, possible mechanisms, patient assessment, treatments, and future directions to improving our understanding of Post-COVID-19 POTS.Journal Pre-proof\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554335","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"1880-1889","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.heartrhythmjournal.com/article/S1547-5271(22)02185-3/fulltext#articleInformation","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661f984e4097076263687d48","name":"P.R.","lastName":"Taub","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"08da4eac-bdd6-4c69-be6c-ce509ccbd3c9"},{"objectId":"661f984e4097076263687d47","name":"Cameron K.","lastName":"Ormiston","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"19ff17df-37b5-4db8-8885-5259f939afb8"},{"objectId":"5e7092c1878c28a04739c1eb","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Świątkiewicz","uuid":"615094F91F77310CE960C3533668E30054439D87104FAB6149B4BF3387454E951266198ED197195510DF672288DEB00C2B3AFACF53D3249D44DA20D13763CDBA","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"961847d7-53c8-4924-a6ef-7c48017aa566"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.hrthm.2022.07.014"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Nowotwory sutka","Aktywność fizyczna","Ćwiczenia fizyczne"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Aerobics","Fitness","Breast cancer"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Physical activity after breast cancer: conditions for practicing sports","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"61b9abfcad204581b62ebb09","mniswId":"201159","title":"Journal of Education, Health and Sport","doi":null,"issn":"2391-8306","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"MINISTRY","editor":null,"documentHash":"ca2f3bdf-81a2-4af7-a75f-f629cac05bb3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY_NC_SA","releaseDate":"2022-10-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"661f971b4097076263686ce7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709344878c28a0473a606a","5e7092c3878c28a04739c3a9","661fa184409707626368dd9c","661fa184409707626368dd9d"]},"issue":"10","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Physical activity is a vital part of your lifestyle.

We discuss the bidirectional influence of security and defence organisations and society; the intersectionality of issues related to social justice, health, race, and ethnicity; sexual abuse and exploitation; and cultural factors that influence the functioning of LGBTQ+ personnel and the gender/technology nexus in the context of North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). During the application of the Sustainable Security Paradigm to gender diversity management, we found that ecofeminism and the ideas of post-colonial theory should inform the transformational shift of contemporary security and defence organisational cultures. This approach was used by the multinational NATO Science & Technology Organization Exploratory Team ET-197 Gender, Peace and Sustainable Security (2022-23) and its successor, the NATO HFM-368 Research Task Group (2023-26). Our research efforts were triangulated by an analysis of doctrinal textual, audiovisual and art sources that relate to gender diversity and its management. Given the complexity of future warfare, there is a strategic imperative to develop an inclusive defence strategy that reconfigures the traditional white male-focused military paradigm. It is evident that the root cause of gender inequality cannot be solved solely by doctrine and training solutions—rather a transformational organisational culture shift is pivotal and critical to the future global security. This is the first article that addresses the issues of gender diversity management for sustainable security and peace in an interdisciplinary and holistic manner. Our approach is relevant to any organisation with internal gender and intersectional diversity and systemic discrimination."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554341","journalIssue":{"objectId":"661ccee540970734e76fd69d","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"45","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"58c5fa40-a110-40d9-a3f9-7a4c04810a61"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"45","pagesFromTo":"18-32","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://securityanddefence.pl/pdf-183658-107053","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661e6f3640970743f2a5817a","name":"Anne","lastName":"Holohan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7c7afe5b-0137-4183-ac78-f5811ff53fbd"},{"objectId":"661e6f3640970743f2a58179","name":"Montgomery","lastName":"McFate","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a10eb7d8-db92-4b1e-aa82-722c7b4a77f3"},{"objectId":"661e6f3640970743f2a58178","name":"Yvonne Rose","lastName":"Masakowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a01be2e9-403e-4abf-ad16-2941bd85b0ef"},{"objectId":"5e7093e1878c28a0473b2633","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Trochowska - SVIDEROK","uuid":"40B17295B82C758E8FBC5E2D37F6236A74D4175D5959BA8291F5DE79AB72621170D1D2D0E7AE35950F43C42CF8628501DD0AD48EE6CB56101F19B92713138073","orcidId":"0000-0003-2730-5536","documentHash":"005cf614-446d-4b92-9934-4a4d347384e3"}],"doi":"10.35467/sdq/183658"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Stenty","Kamica moczowa","Nadczynność przytarczyc"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Double-J stent","JJ stent","Forgotten stent","Endourology","Urolithiasis","Hyperparathyroidism"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Severe calcification of forgotten Double-J ureteral stent in a patient with undiagnosed hyperparathyroidism","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"61b9abfcad204581b62ebb09","mniswId":"201159","title":"Journal of Education, Health and Sport","doi":null,"issn":"2391-8306","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"MINISTRY","editor":null,"documentHash":"ca2f3bdf-81a2-4af7-a75f-f629cac05bb3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY_NC_SA","releaseDate":"2022-05-05","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"661f98544097076263687d60","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["661f98544097076263687d61","661f98544097076263687d62","661f98544097076263687d63","661f98544097076263687d64","5e7094cf878c28a0473c4309","5e7092c0878c28a04739bffe"]},"issue":"6","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background\r\nDouble J stent (DJ) is widely used in urological practice in patients with renal stones. However, its application is related to the risk of incrustation. We present a case of severe calcification of forgotten DJ in a patient with previously undiagnosed hyperparathyroidism (HPT).\r\nCase presentation\r\nA 30-year-old female was admitted to the Urology Department with renal colic. An initial kidney, ureter, and bladder X-ray revealed a completely calcified DJ catheter placed twelve months earlier. Unfortunately, the patient did not show up for a follow-up visit, and stent removal was not performed.  Due to the extent of the disease, the patient was qualified for multistage endoscopic treatment. Total treatment lasted six months and consisted of five urereroscopies and one hybrid procedure. Simultaneously, diagnostics of a metabolic cause of the advanced stone disease suggested primary hyperparathyroidism, confirmed during parathyroid scintigraphy. After urological treatment had been completed, parathyroidectomy was performed. During a further 7-year follow-up, only one episode of renal colic occurred within the first year after treatment. The patient is stone-free until the present day.\r\nConclusions\r\nStents are designed to last usually up to six months, but they should be removed as quickly as possible after finishing treatment.

During their thermonuclear runaway, PISNe can produce up to several tens of solar masses of radioactive nickel, resulting in luminous transients similar to some superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). Yet, no unambiguous PISN has been discovered so far. SN 2018ibb is a hydrogen-poor SLSN at z = 0.166 that evolves extremely slowly compared to the hundreds of known SLSNe. Between mid 2018 and early 2022, we monitored its photometric and spectroscopic evolution from the UV to the near-infrared (NIR) with 2-10 m class telescopes. SN 2018ibb radiated > 3 × 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg during its evolution, and its bolometric light curve reached > 2 × 10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>−1</SUP> at its peak. The long-lasting rise of > 93 rest-frame days implies a long diffusion time, which requires a very high total ejected mass. The PISN mechanism naturally provides both the energy source (<SUP>56</SUP>Ni) and the long diffusion time. Theoretical models of PISNe make clear predictions as to their photometric and spectroscopic properties. SN 2018ibb complies with most tests on the light curves, nebular spectra and host galaxy, and potentially all tests with the interpretation we propose. Both the light curve and the spectra require 25-44 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of freshly nucleosynthesised <SUP>56</SUP>Ni, pointing to the explosion of a metal-poor star with a helium core mass of 120-130 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> at the time of death. This interpretation is also supported by the tentative detection of [Co II] λ 1.025 μm, which has never been observed in any other PISN candidate or SLSN before. We observe a significant excess in the blue part of the optical spectrum during the nebular phase, which is in tension with predictions of existing PISN models. However, we have compelling observational evidence for an eruptive mass-loss episode of the progenitor of SN 2018ibb shortly before the explosion, and our dataset reveals that the interaction of the SN ejecta with this oxygen-rich circumstellar material contributed to the observed emission. That may explain this specific discrepancy with PISN models. Powering by a central engine, such as a magnetar or a black hole, can be excluded with high confidence. This makes SN 2018ibb by far the best candidate for being a PISN, to date. \n\nTables 1 and C.1 and SN 2018ibb: multi-band and bolometric light curves, and blackbody properties are available at the

The work function and surface wetting properties of the ITO were tuned by SAM molecules. The power conversion efficiency of fabricated OSC devices was improved compared to that of the control device from 1.93 to 2.20% and 2.22% with ZE-Ph and ZE-1F-modified ITO electrodes, respectively. The short-circuit current density (Jsc) was increased from 6.16 to 7.10 mA/cm2 and 6.94 mA/cm2 with control, ZE-Ph, and ZE-1F-modified solar cells, respectively. The increase in short-circuit current density (Jsc) shows that the hole-transporting properties between ITO and MoO3 were improved by the use of ZE-Ph and ZE-1F compared with that of the ITO/MoO3 electrode configuration. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the SAM-modified ITO-based devices was also improved compared with the Voc of unmodified ITO-based devices. These results show that using a monolayer as an interlayer in OSCs is an important strategy to improve the performance of OSCs. All the device parameters were characterized by Kelvin probe force microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, contact angle, and I–V measurements."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554355","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65a7d4344097071e0b8c5033","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"4dd02ce2-2cf5-4027-bffa-fb8302b4a7a5"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"9","pagesFromTo":"7413–7423","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsomega.3c04081","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661f8ec04097075339a685b7","name":"Cem","lastName":"Tozlu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9a7eca15-6150-483f-92b8-6f74d4ac42e8"},{"objectId":"661f8ec04097075339a685b6","name":"Mustafa","lastName":"Can","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aa32d2e8-57ec-4be9-a609-8bcde58b4645"},{"objectId":"661f8ec04097075339a685b5","name":"Adem","lastName":"Mutlu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ce392d2d-360c-46e9-be49-e5f651de3e03"},{"objectId":"640aa43a7523407854436996","name":"Mesude Zeliha","lastName":"Arkan","uuid":"D5DA14430132C6997141AB0561D3AFADEF74486E885C4819CB3F2B7E387357B72975565220472926BC3E4160212B1AC23F842B5957507632028C05DEB48EAA04","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4eb9433f-7023-4d56-a3e5-a4c07d00a965"}],"doi":"10.1021/acsomega.3c04081"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["barriers to growth","cross-border","electronic commerce","Internet","Poland","sale"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de69","uid":"b8lEq4e8f8p1V09_nBsO4Ew","uuid":"7b1ecf5e-1c1d-40d0-91a9-cbde801c4409","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de69","parentUuid":"7b1ecf5e-1c1d-40d0-91a9-cbde801c4409","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de69","rootUuid":"7b1ecf5e-1c1d-40d0-91a9-cbde801c4409","name":"Akademia Bialska im.

Design/Methodology/Approach: The study used secondary sources of information, primarily the available subject literature, statistical data from industry reports, and databases from the Central Statistical Office (GUS). The descriptive statistics method was employed, mainly employing tabular, graphical, and parametric descriptions of the statistical population Findings: The analysis indicates that cross-border e-commerce in Poland is developing dynamically, and its future prospects are promising. However, there are areas for improvement, namely key elements that need to be refined. Practical Implications: The main challenges include local payment methods, as well as costs associated with marketing and distribution. Polish e-commerce businesses predominantly seek their customers in Europe, especially within EU countries. Originality/Value: It is essential to focus not only on improving the efficiency of core business processes but also on other activities, such as integrating the so-called silver economy into e-commerce or investing in e-innovations. A crucial area for enhancement emerges, namely, logistics organization."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554358","journalIssue":{"objectId":"661f79bf4097075339a53edf","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"XXVI","number":"Issue 3","doi":null,"documentHash":"a7920115-2da3-4e90-a549-bba436c6b154"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"XXVI","pagesFromTo":"496-508","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ersj.eu/journal/3227","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709270878c28a047395b2b","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Pyra","uuid":"191ADDD874BDF0C53D0DD4E08A5EB39754CA8A6DF0B151313BCE80AC80CA7076185F7F1CDB7391B47D0EF774C1EC9DD7AD09158F4B1A428FB2FA299368FA4ACB","orcidId":"0000-0001-8246-851X","documentHash":"9b0d5b59-613b-443d-b028-b6a48bb42603"},{"objectId":"5e709270878c28a047395b20","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Żurakowska-Sawa","uuid":"4098367EB326DF6172D62A80EB2C4E6316EC10F6315793D6A18FF7F16B57E912ED8D9A608CA5EE3E24DAC8E26CBB0D94D9462CA782B85EDAE9213FF4ADFBE02F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3811-4586","documentHash":"e414b905-bca9-4cf4-ae01-a38b7483904d"}],"doi":"10.35808/ersj/3227"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["SnTe nanowires","topology","spin−orbit","density functional theory","Majorana"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","uid":"btSYdQGYDtmYBdiC2rKR_nQ","uuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","parentUuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","rootUuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","name":"Instytut Fizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60138bd69543c74f83155145","641530397523407854458d56","64b0b32940e3ff295b978804","6013eae59543c74f831551a4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Density Functional Theory Study of the Spin–Orbit Insulating Phase in SnTe Cubic Nanowires: Implications for Topological Electronics","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f09c","mniswId":"27715","title":"ACS Applied Nano Materials","doi":null,"issn":"2574-0970","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f73d5a60-05ef-4413-a88f-1f9aa61a0c30"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-03-27","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"661f82304097075339a5c136","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["641530397523407854458d56","64b0b32940e3ff295b978804","6013eae59543c74f831551a4","60138bd69543c74f83155145"]},"issue":"7","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We investigate the electronic, structural, and topological properties of the SnTe and PbTe cubic nanowires using ab initio calculations. Using standard and linear-scale density functional theory, we go from the ultrathin limit up to the nanowire thicknesses observed experimentally. Finite-size effects in the ultrathin limit produce an electric quadrupole and associated structural distortions; these distortions increase the band gap, but they get reduced with the size of the nanowires and become less and less relevant. Ultrathin SnTe cubic nanowires are trivial band gap insulators; we demonstrate that by increasing the thickness, there is an electronic transition to a spin–orbit insulating phase due to trivial surface states in the regime of thin nanowires. These trivial surface states with a spin–orbit gap of a few meV appear at the same k-point of the topological surface states. Going to the limit of thick nanowires, we should observe the transition to the topological crystalline insulator phase with the presence of two massive surface Dirac fermions hybridized with the persistent trivial surface states. Therefore, we have the copresence of massive Dirac surface states and trivial surface states close to the Fermi level in the same region of the k-space. According to our estimation, the cubic SnTe nanowires are trivial insulators below the critical thickness tc1 = 10 nm, and they become spin–orbit insulators between tc1 = 10 nm and tc2 = 17 nm, while they transit to the topological phase above the critical thickness of tc2 = 17 nm. These critical thickness values are in the range of typical experimental thicknesses, making the thickness a relevant parameter for the synthesis of topological cubic nanowires. Pb1–xSnxTe nanowires would have both these critical thicknesses tc1 and tc2 at larger values depending on the doping concentration. We discuss the limitations of density functional theory in the context of topological nanowires and the consequences of our results on topological electronics."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554360","journalIssue":{"objectId":"661f82304097075339a5c137","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"7","number":"7","doi":null,"documentHash":"14beff06-cd92-431a-9ab3-97eab9efefeb"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"7","pagesFromTo":"8044-8052","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsanm.4c00506","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64b0b32940e3ff295b978804","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Warda","uuid":"AA5CC91DF83ED67D3044CB24D954D9F461A76EA7FFC6494C7F2A24FEAEC106B15446A1733DB7463EF563D77F883E6087E877C06B574872FE81067422A5ACCDB0","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2ffb5b10-14db-427b-809f-ef3ed687e083"},{"objectId":"641530397523407854458d56","name":"Ghulam","lastName":"Hussain","uuid":"C8F1B26F81FDC7E8B2CF8F42F9E345670C835C75282F51B5ABC86E0552F414058AEE764993F3878331222DA614D8C790C3CEEB7EF7263FD1C998834F86BE5BB7","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fd4f93fd-6488-48c7-b539-5920c8bc3738"},{"objectId":"6013eae59543c74f831551a4","name":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Cuono","uuid":"69889B1EFCEFAE9FD882083572184F9A45EDC7CD7C0F8A693CC73F1A5B4A57FF592DA33EB7140F9FA415635B730836DC5EB7597B3C03DE9908D324D806688306","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a738025c-3eba-4dce-a077-a30608947f05"},{"objectId":"60138bd69543c74f83155145","name":"Carmine","lastName":"Autieri","uuid":"B105E7A6A31DAD2837404C328BB4A44E967D34F810F78DE646C2798ECAEB49F654996B2DD93D0244515DBDDC4D158384552BC2B4793421207992A67E3D763AAC","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6e9b6b13-6e8b-46ef-91cf-7647844cf43b"}],"doi":"10.1021/acsanm.4c00506"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Migrena - leczenie","Ból głowy - leczenie"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Vestibular migraine","Chronic migraine (CM)","Trigemino-vascular pathway","Vertigo-pathophysiology","Vestibular disorders"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Care gaps and recommendations in vestibular migraine: an expert panel summit","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d65","mniswId":"6854","title":"Frontiers in Neurology","doi":null,"issn":"1664-2295","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"8ebec6e5-093e-4aaa-bbc4-17686a289a9d"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-03","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"661f97fb4097076263687971","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["661f97fb4097076263687972","661f97fb4097076263687973","661f97fb4097076263687974","661f97fb4097076263687975","661f97fb4097076263687976","661f97fb4097076263687977","661f97fb4097076263687978","661f97fb4097076263687979","661f97fb409707626368797a","661f97fb409707626368797b","661f97fb409707626368797c","661f97fb409707626368797d","661f97fb409707626368797e","661f97fb409707626368797f","5e7092c0878c28a04739c05c","661f97fb4097076263687980","661f97fb4097076263687981","661f97fb4097076263687982","661f97fb4097076263687983","661f97fb4097076263687984","661f97fb4097076263687985","661f97fb4097076263687986"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Vestibular migraine (VM) is an increasingly recognized pathology yet remains as an underdiagnosed cause of vestibular disorders. While current diagnostic criteria are codified in the 2012 Barany Society document and included in the third edition of the international classification of headache disorders, the pathophysiology of this disorder is still elusive. The Association for Migraine Disorders hosted a multidisciplinary, international expert workshop in October 2020 and identified seven current care gaps that the scientific community needs to resolve, including a better understanding of the range of symptoms and phenotypes of VM, the lack of a diagnostic marker, a better understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms, as well as the lack of clear recommendations for interventions (nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic) and finally, the need for specific outcome measures that will guide clinicians as well as research into the efficacy of interventions. The expert group issued several recommendations to address those areas including establishing a global VM registry, creating an improved diagnostic algorithm using available vestibular tests as well as others that are in development, conducting appropriate trials of high quality to validate current clinically available treatment and fostering collaborative efforts to elucidate the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying VM, specifically the role of the trigemino-vascular pathways."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554361","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2021.812678/ful","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661f97fb4097076263687986","name":"Frederick","lastName":"Godley","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"07b6a274-5602-4bbd-9e23-933e517c5246"},{"objectId":"661f97fb4097076263687985","name":"Michael","lastName":"Teixido","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5d766b72-1485-4ab3-ac7a-3a15aa2ac596"},{"objectId":"661f97fb4097076263687984","name":"Ashley","lastName":"Zaleski-King","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f3de2251-5ed0-4dc2-9a9d-b1ec241edd29"},{"objectId":"661f97fb4097076263687983","name":"Hsiangkuo","lastName":"Yuan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bac96363-8d9a-4ae2-be78-26cdf75d5928"},{"objectId":"661f97fb4097076263687982","name":"Maurizio","lastName":"Versino","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"caf1c577-df8b-4b14-9d4b-3db8c0002892"},{"objectId":"661f97fb4097076263687981","name":"Roberto","lastName":"Teggi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2d7d6f31-b9ef-45f5-b7c5-6ea67ad0c290"},{"objectId":"661f97fb4097076263687980","name":"Nicole","lastName":"Spare","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"380a0f99-e055-4e78-aa16-b58bc1077c75"},{"objectId":"661f97fb409707626368797f","name":"Marco","lastName":"Mandalà","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5b02ccb2-5d3e-4db6-92f9-f10fcdc3e248"},{"objectId":"661f97fb409707626368797e","name":"Anne E.","lastName":"Luebke","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1a5f9c54-c439-4165-a5b1-b2e616539b0b"},{"objectId":"661f97fb409707626368797d","name":"Jeffery J.","lastName":"Kuhn","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2b6edf0e-bc47-41c4-bb2b-5f865f54918b"},{"objectId":"661f97fb409707626368797c","name":"Joel A.","lastName":"Goebel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c74f478f-68f7-4f97-8676-c0b81975059e"},{"objectId":"661f97fb409707626368797b","name":"Hamid","lastName":"Djalilian","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c3cfaca3-a74b-4663-b3ad-5dac6ca1c6c8"},{"objectId":"661f97fb409707626368797a","name":"Matthew G.","lastName":"Crowson","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c695c495-07ab-46a2-8647-3ea0d8451aec"},{"objectId":"661f97fb4097076263687979","name":"Claire E.

From the epistemological perspective, the reality of the human “life-world” is considered not only as a static position of the individual subject’s being-in-the-world, but also as his/her/its experience of living-the-world or things-of-the-world. Against the background of epistemology, defined in terms of ontological and gnoseological assessments pertaining to the knowledge of how things exist and how they are cognitively accessible, and epistemology as an activity of acquiring knowledge about an object of cognition, the author puts forward a hypothetical deductive scaffold of the linguistically and phenomenologically rooted documentary epistemology of practice, which refers to the practicing researchers’ knowledge as a set of texts created for the purposes of communicating in the first person about the awareness of lived word-ness and lived sign-ness of the transmedial and multimodal means and ways of how the world is perceived."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554380","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66150f5e4097075b4777ca88","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"19","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"8b493ec0-242d-461e-8556-6ee19981b8c8"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"703-729","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/css-2023-2029/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7091ff878c28a04738e450","name":"ZDZISŁAW","lastName":"WĄSIK","uuid":"96F4D3EB34E0F44E387D5DCD181B0C93B302E66E65C15E6DD062E49EAAB621391889B3588038344731D07B4F33E157ABE59F44E76614C4805A09D5692D433A57","orcidId":"0000-0003-2556-8228","documentHash":"c5184cb6-23e3-4e47-a9d7-101d0b2a7a5f"}],"doi":"10.1515/css-2023-2029"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Liquid crystal textures","machine learning","neural networks","style transfer","deep dream","art"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","uid":"bdkLR6wGCrp59lwUjwb_dMA","uuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","parentUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","rootUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","name":"Instytut Fizyki Jądrowej im.

The lungs remain the most frequently affected organ, whereas lesions in the genitourinary system affect around 0.2% of patients. The primary site found in the spermatic cord is extremely rare.\r\nCase presentation: We present a patient’s case where the spermatic cord involvement was the first manifestation of sarcoidosis. For several months, a number of tests had been performed, which showed, among others, non-caseating granulomas in pathomorphological material, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and leukopenia with lymphopenia. Tumor markers were normal. Infection with urogenital pathogens (including <i>Chlamydia Trachomatis</i>, Neisseria gonorrhea, <i>Mycoplasma hominis</i>) was excluded. The patient did not report any general symptoms such as fever, excessive fatigue, weight loss. He denied swelling, shortness of breath. At the same time, a complete differential diagnosis was carried out, and the extent of the disease was assessed. Due to interdisciplinary management, the patient’s quality of life and fertility is preserved. In the discussion, we present the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of such patients.\r\nConclusion: Sarcoidosis is a multi-system disease, which should not be omitted in the differential diagnosis. Selective excision of the lesion with intraoperative examination plays a significant role while establishing a diagnosis. However, in the primary site in the genitourinary system, the diagnosis is challenging."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554389","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"32","pagesFromTo":"1-6","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://bacandrology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12610-022-00158-8","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661f98514097076263687d57","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Ostrowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4ff7bbe4-ba5f-496f-8916-a776bed2a8ce"},{"objectId":"5ebedf7b752340254fc42f23","name":"Filip","lastName":"Kowalski","uuid":"EA47EB7DA605DB2BE49C92559F0FDCC8D61FE7A012D362E336D664CA04E1B4B7D491D3C17BEB131A0376557FADF516DFA265617CF4CFE866695276BB82064253","orcidId":"0000-0002-7981-8600","documentHash":"ddb1ab7f-c081-44d9-926d-5957d09f4a79"},{"objectId":"5e7094e7878c28a0473c678c","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Świniarski","uuid":"55FC714584C3440565B411EB71654803802638827A1922D42A2BFEC518BD09EF73C519279901AF859231E1E8DCD1E367CEE2223CC6FCFEA45E16F9BB3D15A396","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2679f6ba-6d1a-4342-8d60-329905010928"},{"objectId":"5e7094dd878c28a0473c58ee","name":"Jan","lastName":"Adamowicz","uuid":"BC7DC99F85933053BF94F76D164EF2966428F11ACB554E07B1200DECAC926FEA4DB15A25264DF77EC07632FAE0425DC88BC953BD0FB436BF7049C433CE8DF46C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e973f2cf-d638-4253-9d82-3600f99c9d20"},{"objectId":"5e7094cf878c28a0473c4309","name":"Adam","lastName":"Ostrowski","uuid":"E142D17AD7749997CE85BA422D0B9A0C1C8867F248B8337662F2CD05331E1059E02C549EB3D0DBEC7D2D771C692614FE55A8C82FECDF8B40D24B263E91D383B6","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c1d6b9f-6747-489f-a526-d0176794bb45"},{"objectId":"5e709324878c28a0473a3822","name":"Kajetan","lastName":"Juszczak","uuid":"69181E3871A51B28509A0A28D8ABE58B1E26E253960EB57FE4EFE77AD7A68844BACDBE98228C160D2E50FC9D71C66183D5B7AE1C914550CFBED6A599C9761F67","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fcac98c5-ee16-4c8f-b3e5-77460e75efee"},{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739c0ad","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Grzanka","uuid":"26B5062638AC08FF6C90A5B523EEC89B126BF4B03FB2ED2FD57F6CC04BD71D383BA17100ACBB322C862B6CE3CA8D14ACED8B0EB1D29C38D6EF86FACAFD6D637F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0416-7583","documentHash":"48277d4e-1dd5-4d02-8381-0b4e7d494610"},{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739bffe","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Drewa","uuid":"B694F29E137BDAD2001C2D2584A69D3C412FF9D2CE5A90CF67B3D0A0332C46D7491D0C0CB864518DB747EDD42E633AE7B3408D42DCDEF75592233B030C32DEF6","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d21e8f5a-1d48-4b0e-9603-c853444e8c2a"}],"doi":"10.1186/s12610-022-00158-8"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":"978-83-67881-27-2","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet

In this study, we applied combination of mineralogical data on allochthonous sediments with digital modelling of isobase surfaces to reconstruct the multi-phased geomorphological development of the karst of the Harmanecká dolina Valley. The allochthonous cave sediments contain quartz and translucent heavy minerals (HMs) such as tourmaline, garnet, rutile, apatite, zircon, pyroxene, amphibole, staurolite, spinel, monazite, corundum, epidote, xenotime and florencite. Rounded shape and surface microtextures preserved on quartz and most HM grains point to predominantly a fluvial transport of detritus and its multiple recycling history. Pyroxene and amphibole are exceptions that denoted a very close source and the first-cycle sedimentation from the adjacent volcanic Kremnické vrchy Mts. corresponding to obtained SHRIMP U–Pb detrital zircon ages of ~13.8–12.8 Ma. Heavy-mineral geochemistry (e.g., zoned grossular-rich garnet) and wide range of the Palaeozoic ages (Ordovician to Permian) confirms that the studied detritus sourced dominantly in the Western-Carpathian crystalline basement rocks of the Veporic/Tatric tectonic units initially distributed by the palaeo-Hron River and its tributaries from the east. Rare cummingtonite, remarkable tourmaline with omphacite inclusions and florencite point to the mixture of recycled sediments of Neogene Danube Basin formations containing also Austroalpine pre-Neogene basement detritus, and confirm the original widespread distribution of the Neogene sediments currently eroded. Geomorphometric analyses of a LiDAR digital terrain model and derived isobase surface elevation models indicate the topographic development of wider area and support the findings about the transport direction of detritus. Presented multi-method approach is suitable not only for the understanding of development of the surroundings of Harmanecká dolina Valley but also for the palaeogeographic and geomorphological reconstructions of similar karst and non-karst areas."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554395","journalIssue":{"objectId":"661f97134097075339a70034","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"80661b43-f536-433a-a3d2-131a33e228c2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"149","pagesFromTo":"1682-1704","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/esp.5780","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661f97134097075339a7003b","name":"Tomáš","lastName":"Mikuš","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3a5e5703-98a1-4cb6-9bb0-85dd1b5a98b3"},{"objectId":"661f97134097075339a7003a","name":"Ľubomír","lastName":"Hraško","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"293b2bb1-17ae-42b8-991f-e8afe7ad5b70"},{"objectId":"661f97134097075339a70039","name":"Pavel","lastName":"Bella","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5e28e838-4ebf-4d46-8005-58b5cfd92c86"},{"objectId":"661f97134097075339a70038","name":"Jozef","lastName":"Hók","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d9acd951-94c7-4061-9a30-dfbb7701b123"},{"objectId":"661f97134097075339a70037","name":"Michal","lastName":"Gallay","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6a4255ea-69c9-4d0e-b42a-80f3d618f245"},{"objectId":"661f97134097075339a70036","name":"Ján","lastName":"Bóna","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d66b6f2c-d2fb-435c-951f-de1f4eaa2f3b"},{"objectId":"661f97134097075339a70035","name":"Katarína","lastName":"Bónová","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"78697f5a-3f95-48c8-b3f2-f9a5f525c5af"},{"objectId":"5e70934a878c28a0473a6a2b","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Pańczyk-Nawrocka","uuid":"99774A700A33ED1E0CA0F14275D9FAA5625D8FEFC3B96A3A344DAF1F6E41C0B4167B9B41FEA94D4E1744A614B3982DF77CE160E22E8F1261D57C90D1B70A0E0E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9435-8481","documentHash":"7b41abb4-1242-4b09-af90-47dafc93f2ec"}],"doi":"10.1002/esp.5780"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","uid":"bt6mbuLY9Vpc_KWGkV1Lk4w","uuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709225878c28a047390a94","5e709262878c28a047394c23","5e709225878c28a047390a98","5e709225878c28a0473909ea","5e709224878c28a0473908b0"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Smart solutions in car dashboard interfaces as a response to needs of drivers and their assessment","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bc91","mniswId":"3316","title":"Case Studies on Transport Policy","doi":null,"issn":"2213-624X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b14f23c1-7b6e-4097-86df-d41a5317263d"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-04-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"66151bf540970762639896d4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709262878c28a047394c23","5e709225878c28a047390a98","5e709225878c28a047390a94","5e709224878c28a0473908b0","5e709225878c28a0473909ea","66151bf540970762639896d5","66151bf540970762639896d6","66151bf540970762639896d7"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Current trends in the production of passenger cars focus on the development of the so-called intelligent cars, richly equipped with multimedia systems with uninterrupted access to the Internet, connected to digital road infrastructure leading to autonomous driving in the future. Such changes lead to the development of new solutions and testing them, first in laboratory conditions, and then in practical use with the participation of consumers, and especially drivers. Vehicle designers are guided by the idea of simplifying vehicle interfaces’ operation and making them more comfortable and easier to use, while maintaining safety standards for traveling people and other road users. However, the question arises whether they actually achieve the expected results. The authors of the work focused on selected solutions and on assessing the validity of using such solutions in terms of convenience and safety. Various factors influencing drivers' driving behavior were discussed, mainly related to media handling. The research was based on a survey questionnaire containing a number of questions addressed to people using particular systems. Vehicle users expressed their opinions on three solutions available on the market used in car cockpits (ASD – analogue switch dashboards, GSD – gesture/speech controlled dashboards, and TSD – touch screen dashboards).

W artykule podjęto próbę analizy uwarunkowań formowania się kapitału społecznego w szkole oraz niektórych czynników wspierających jego rozwój. Szczególną uwagę przywiązuje się do zarządzania kulturowego, które jest postrzegane jako wyznacznik skutecznego kształtowania nieformalnych wartości i standardów etycznych wspólnych dla społeczności szkolnej. W konkluzji wskazuje się, że nadrzędną wartością takiego strategicznego zarządzania kapitałem społecznym jest budowanie relacji opartych na zaufaniu i partnerstwie. Tworzy to innowacyjną kulturę organizacyjną społeczności szkolnej. Jej charakterystyczne cechy to: orientacja na przyszłość, elastyczność i zdolność do proaktywnego działania. W ten sposób kapitał społeczny staje się nośnikiem wartości kulturowych, które powodują pozytywne zmiany w dominującym systemie kulturowym współczesnej edukacji. Artykuł prezentuje następujące implikacje dla praktyki lub polityki edukacyjnej: kreatorzy polityki edukacyjnej mogą zapoznać się z głównymi wymiarami organizacji społecznej szkoły, które w teorii zarządzania stanowią podstawę wzrostu kapitału społecznego szkoły ; Administratorzy mogą podjąć działania polegające na wypracowaniu innowacyjnej kultury organizacyjnej społeczności szkolnej, dostosowanej do aktualnych i przyszłych zmian w otoczeniu szkoły jako organizacji ; Edukatorzy mogą poprawić indywidualne środowisko edukacyjne każdego ucznia dzięki cyberprzestrzeni edukacyjnej, która obecnie staje się coraz atrakcyjniejszą alternatywą dla dotychczasowych metod kształtowania kapitału społecznego szkoły ; Uczestnicy procesu kształcenia powinni razem brać udział w wypracowaniu innowacyjnych struktur więzi relacyjnych wspólnoty edukacyjnej za pośrednictwem zarządzania kulturowego, które formatuje kulturę organizacyjną kapitału społecznego szkoły, jako systemu zrozumiałych dla uczniów i kolektywnie przez nich akceptowanych znaczeń."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Besides various proposals of solving current problem with education crisis, some new economic and social concepts appear, which are related to the notion of social capital. This article attempts to analyse conditions of social capital formation in the school as well as some factors that support its development. Particular attention is given to cultural management, which is perceived as a determinant of effective development of informal values and ethical standards common for the school community. In the conclusion it is pointed out that the supreme value of such strategic management of social capital is building relationships based on trust and partnership. This creates innovative organizational culture of school community. Its characteristic features are: a future orientation, elasticity and ability to act proactively. Thus, social capital becomes a bearer of cultural values that cause positive changes in the dominating cultural system of contemporary education. The article presents the following implications for practice or educational policy: educational policy makers can familiarise themselves with the main dimensions of the social organisation of the school, which in management theory are the basis for the growth of the social capital of the school ; Administrators can take action to develop an innovative organisational culture for the school community, adapted to current and future changes in the school environment as an organisation ; Educators can improve the individual educational environment of each pupil through cyberlearning space, which is now becoming an increasingly attractive alternative to existing methods of shaping the social capital of the school ; The participants of the educational process should together take part in the development of innovative structures of the educational community’s relational bonds through cultural management which formats the organisational culture of the school’s social capital as a system of meanings understood by the pupils and collectively accepted by them."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554402","journalIssue":{"objectId":"661e8d1e40970743f2a832b3","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"32","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"08df119e-adc9-4392-8fc7-09f2e55a56c2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"32","pagesFromTo":"31-42","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"pol","title":"Zarządzanie kulturą jako element strategii rozwoju kapitału społecznego szkoły"}],"publicUri":"http://dlibra.bg.ajd.czest.pl:8080/Content/7319/3_Juszczyk_Rygallo.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70923e878c28a047392582","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Juszczyk-Rygałło","uuid":"C9EAB8212C7B83983ED161BC8F21602A265782DE1BE4ABAB935FD63EDF51490CC00EE0713873A79ECA7D7FEC369EE2F30DD98D51FAF8FFA6D5B1F3A3806C62A3","orcidId":"0000-0002-4176-9794","documentHash":"320785d8-be19-497b-ad2e-be9acd37e5ad"}],"doi":"10.16926/p.2023.32.02"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Nowotwory gruczołu krokowego - diagnostyka","Mutacja","Geny","Polimorfizm (genetyka)"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Prostate cancer","germline variants","clinical significance","early detection"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Clinical Significance of Gene Mutations and Polymorphic Variants and their Association with Prostate Cancer Risk in Polish Men","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477527","mniswId":"3206","title":"Cancer Control","doi":null,"issn":"1073-2748","eissn":"1526-2359","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"9e60fcb1-37f7-4012-8d7e-524cb796fb47"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2022-05-31","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"661f975b4097076263686f95","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709474878c28a0473bd645","5e7094e9878c28a0473c6b51","5e7094a8878c28a0473c1197","5e7094ab878c28a0473c14d6","5e7094b2878c28a0473c1caa","5e709433878c28a0473b806d","5e7092c3878c28a04739c267","661fa19e409707626368e120","661fa19e409707626368e121"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p> Objectives: We tested the association of germline variants in BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, CDKN2A, CYP1B1, HOXB13, MLH1, NBS1, NOD2 and PALB2 genes, as well as in 8q24 region, with prostate cancer (PC) risk and estimated their impact on disease clinical course, including overall survival time in Polish men with localized PC qualified for radical treatment. </jats:p><jats:p> Materials and Methods: DNA of 110 patients with localized prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy (RP), from each age group and with different stages of the disease. DNA samples of the control group consisted of 111 men, volunteers, without PC (age-matched to study group).

However, tacrolimus has a narrow therapeutic range that requires regular monitoring of blood concentrations to minimize toxicity. A new once-daily tacrolimus formulation, LCP-tacrolimus (LCPT), has been developed, which uses MeltDose™ drug-delivery technology to control drug release and enhance overall bioavailability. Our study compared dosing of LCPT with current standard-of-care tacrolimus [immediate-release tacrolimus (IR-Tac) or prolonged-release tacrolimus (PR-Tac)] during the 6 months following <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> kidney transplantation. Comparisons of graft function, clinical outcomes, safety, and tolerability for LCPT versus IR-Tac/PR-Tac were also performed.\r\nMethods:Standard immunological risk patients with end-stage renal disease who had received a <jats:italic>de novo</jats:italic> kidney transplant were randomized (1:1) to LCPT (N = 200) or IR-Tac/PR-Tac (N = 201).\r\nResults:Least squares (LS) mean tacrolimus total daily dose from Week 3 to Month 6 was significantly lower for LCPT than for IR-Tac/PR-Tac. Although LS mean tacrolimus trough levels were significantly higher for LCPT than IR-Tac/PR-Tac, tacrolimus trough levels remained within the standard reference range for most patients. There were no differences between the groups in treatment failure measures or safety profile.\r\nConclusion:LCPT can achieve similar clinical outcomes to other tacrolimus formulations, with a lower daily dose.\r\nClinical Trial Registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/</jats:ext-link>, identifier NCT02432833.

However, there are only a few studies analyzing leak occurrence and postoperative results after surgical MVR. The aim of this study was to assess the rate and determinants of early mitral PVL and to evaluate the impact on survival.\r\nMethods: We performed a retrospective analysis involving patients who underwent MVR from January 2012 to December 2019 at our Institution. Postoperative transthoracic echocardiography evaluation was done for all subjects before hospital discharge. Multivariable analysis was carried out by constructing a logistic regression model to identify predictors for PVL occurrence.\r\nResults: Four hundred ninety-four patients were enrolled. Operative mortality was 4.9%. Early mitral PVL was found in 16 patients (3.2%); the majority were mild (75%). Leaks occurred more frequently along the posterior segment of the mitral valve annulus (62.5%). Only one individual with moderate-to-severe PVL underwent reoperation during the same hospital admission. Multivariable analysis revealed that preoperative diagnosis of infective endocarditis was the only factor associated with early leak after MVR (odds ratio: 4.96; 95% confidence interval: 1.45–16.99; <i>p</i> = .011). Overall mortality at follow-up (mean follow-up time: 4.7 [SD: 2.5] years) was 19.6% and favored patients without early mitral PVL.\r\nConclusion: The incidence of early PVL after MVR is low. PVL is usually mild and develop more frequently along the posterior segment of the mitral valve annulus. Preoperative diagnosis of infective endocarditis increases the risk of PVL formation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554409","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"37","pagesFromTo":"1559-1566","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jocs.16422","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661f98154097076263687ab5","name":"Cesare","lastName":"Beghi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"deed468a-eef5-4acc-a81f-bae8277b1d07"},{"objectId":"661f98154097076263687ab4","name":"Roberto","lastName":"Lorusso","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5cd5980d-f17e-4cec-afb5-54e94db7aeaf"},{"objectId":"661f98154097076263687ab3","name":"Paolo","lastName":"Severgnini","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"734e2286-16ca-410a-b844-10f57718e93e"},{"objectId":"661f98154097076263687ab2","name":"Claudio","lastName":"Corazzari","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fa31671c-538c-4fa0-9f50-c40068c9c199"},{"objectId":"661f98154097076263687ab1","name":"Giangiuseppe","lastName":"Cappabianca","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"98da917b-79e4-4892-b352-5d42e081f897"},{"objectId":"661f98154097076263687ab0","name":"Giada","lastName":"Pedroni","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9dfdfea3-c271-4990-9a86-d40510d76569"},{"objectId":"661f98154097076263687aaf","name":"Vittorio","lastName":"Mantovani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9679ea49-43c6-43b9-b0e4-f6f865852295"},{"objectId":"661f98154097076263687aae","name":"Cristiano","lastName":"Cantore","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ca073ad2-5147-43f4-a5c8-d3e9d5737cbb"},{"objectId":"661f98154097076263687aad","name":"Sandro","lastName":"Ferrarese","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"038cc4b0-c14e-4154-b8f9-a98ba6072d95"},{"objectId":"661f98154097076263687aac","name":"Matteo","lastName":"Matteucci","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8d5a4bc4-7b9e-43e0-8802-38456bc6f5c2"},{"objectId":"5e70938b878c28a0473ac4ca","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Kowalewski","uuid":"6B689E6CD2A471AEAE343D96A14CD6899525EDB497871DAAA3A07CF94CE13A6C867CA89C079B7F63348D9F949D35675BCA1EEEA7192726E3A868B65581A34F08","orcidId":"0000-0002-5478-3245","documentHash":"835babac-131e-4cb9-bdff-e59894fff2b6"}],"doi":"10.1111/jocs.16422"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["COVID-19","Nowotwory sutka"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Breast cancer","diagnostic and treatment","COVID-19 pandemic","cohort study"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Did the COVID-19 Pandemic Truly Adversely Affect Disease Progress and Therapeutic Options in Breast Cancer Patients?

High achievable velocities and accelerations of linear motor machines present new computational challenges in implementing feedrate generation and toolpath interpolation algorithms in real-time controllers. The proposed algorithm is capable of on-line generation of the feedrate profile with axial acceleration and jerk constraints. Each stage of the feedrate profiling algorithm is described with attention being given to both performance and implementation aspects. Furthermore an alternative to the commonly used Taylor series interpolation method is also tested to ensure minimal interpolation errors. The feedrate profiling and interpolation algorithms' implementation in a PC-based controller with real-time Linux kernel is described. Experimental results are presented that confirm that the algorithm is capable of limiting acceleration and jerk in the machine's axes and it's low computation time enables real-time on-line operation in a PC-based CNC controller."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554414","journalIssue":{"objectId":"661521464097075b477934c7","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"18","number":"11","doi":null,"documentHash":"1958987f-d6c0-4416-a4cf-7f034ea13588"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"7560-7571","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/9424/9895125/09699084.pdf?arnumber=9699084","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709413878c28a0473b5d89","name":"Krystian","lastName":"Erwiński","uuid":"1B09AFA8AB747F52B7F891115CD8896EC978C5800D37C84055DB9C79FC01C34E042EF5B433A5AA9FEFEA842F49B6D9FE28DB4F503AE0BE32C49639BCE192B01D","orcidId":"0000-0001-6899-1785","documentHash":"265a07e2-22ff-4b2d-8586-2fd7ede7ea10"},{"objectId":"5e7092c1878c28a04739c147","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Paprocki","uuid":"4C5C5ED66966094234B45830701D8BE7193E2A9EB4B79725D3DA9999051E3E3BC0FF7BE5232A2F57EECD0E8EC7C41911D72F5CE40905EED9F8B27F876F8226B5","orcidId":"0000-0003-2687-1181","documentHash":"baa7797c-a9b8-46e3-ac52-758d485e55da"},{"objectId":"5e7092bf878c28a04739beb3","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Wawrzak","uuid":"12A0BEAA8997126E23B4FDA6B79123601084AA05F27049E029C419DABA731A6B5E6573C4D747500631139A7C9CE1409254C733D20F521163D3CC55A83E6BCFA5","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3ee7e6bc-83e4-4e5f-9e41-dcdf8ef2f5ce"}],"doi":"10.1109/tii.2022.3147806"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["recycled content","substitution","recycling rate","scenarios","waste management"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a9878c28a0473aeab6"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Circularity of Materials from the Perspective of the Product Life Cycle: A Case Study of Secondary Fence Board, Part 2 (Scenario Analysis)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d0b9","mniswId":"17279","title":"Resources","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2079-9276","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"8a78c5d8-d313-497e-8adf-a2203d82ae1a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6616506d40970762639cf1cd","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66d70483fdbe832737abe658","66d70483fdbe832737abe659","66d70483fdbe832737abe65a","5e7093a9878c28a0473aeab6"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Recycling strategies demonstrate different life cycle environmental performance. In order to assess this performance, a life cycle assessment may be used. In such studies, the recycling should be linked with multifunctionality and allocation. This requires it to be modelled accordingly, especially in terms of environmental burdens and credits. The paper presents a case study of open-loop recycling. A flow of mixed post-consumer multi-material waste was reprocessed into another product with a new application—a fence board made of recycled material (secondary fence board). Although many allocation-related case studies are provided in the literature, no example of a comparison between different substitution scenarios for open-loop recycling has been found. In order to fill the gap, various hypothetical market-mix-based alternatives related to the virgin production and durability of products have been examined. The goal of the study is to assess the potential environmental impact of 1 m2 of secondary fence board modelled in different substitution scenarios. The paper is the second part of a two-part study. In Part 1, life cycle assessment results were presented for a baseline scenario (1A). Part 2 focuses strongly on allocation considerations. In order to ensure a consistency between the results of Part 1 and Part 2, the entire life cycle of the fence board has been taken into account in both calculations. The case study has shown that the results may be highly sensitive to the choice of substitutes and the choice of quality attributes impacting the reference flows (in our example, the durability of products)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554416","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6628b9504097073ca70ebc90","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"f203d143-01b2-4c16-a5a2-b35774cf08eb"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"52-1 - 52-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9276/13/4/52","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"66d70483fdbe832737abe65a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Joachimiak-Lechman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4ff8adef-2b54-45f7-a048-d2539ab1df6b"},{"objectId":"66d70483fdbe832737abe659","name":"Anna","lastName":"Lewandowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3de3fc47-e672-4ccb-859a-c1b44b88a8f3"},{"objectId":"66d70483fdbe832737abe658","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kulczycka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d335892f-57d7-4fad-b442-cb2cb4ca9725"},{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473aeab6","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Kurczewski","uuid":"AE4A859A8FBC9D57E183F274B55F61EF2421448063C1972829770D376B2D6F5876D359371E5C7167D063C248ED1F6928A8CB657304CFEBB1605CF46CF0BBD892","orcidId":"0000-0001-7619-4778","documentHash":"55917069-a02c-4a76-a67f-31762d304e58"}],"doi":"10.3390/resources13040052"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Martwica","Trzustka","Endoskopia - metody"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Necrosis","Retroperitoneal access","Transmural access","Preferred"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Percutaneous endoscopic necrosectomy: a review of the literature","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c754","mniswId":"10517","title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2077-0383","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"11fb906d-8d54-4e42-be05-fb426fe7219b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-06","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"661f976b4097076263687013","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709383878c28a0473ab952","661f976b4097076263687014","5e7094ab878c28a0473c151a","5e7092c1878c28a04739c25a"]},"issue":"14","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this article, an attempt was made to clarify the role of percutaneous endoscopic necrosectomy (PEN) in the interventional treatment of pancreatic necrosis.

The aim of the study was to review the literature on minimal invasive necrosectomy, with emphasis on PEN using esophageal self-expanding metal stents (SEMS). The described results come from 15 studies after a review of the current literature. The study group comprised 52 patients (36 men and 16 women; mean age, 50.87 (13–75) years) with walled-off pancreatic necrosis, in whom PEN using a self-expandable esophageal stent had been performed. PEN was successfully completed in all 52 patients (100%). PEN complications were observed in 18/52 (34.62%) patients. Clinical success was achieved in 42/52 (80.77%) patients, with follow-up continuing for an average of 136 (14–557) days.

This has been documented to be involved in tumor progression in several types of cancers, such as lung, colon, breast, pancreatic, ovarian, and brain. During the process, platelets protect circulating tumor cells from the deleterious effects of shear forces, shield tumor cells from the immune system, and provide growth factors, facilitating metastatic spread and tumor growth at the original site as well as at the site of metastasis. Herein, we present a wider view on the induction of platelet aggregation by specific factors primarily developed by cancer, including coagulation factors, adhesion receptors, growth factors, cysteine proteases, matrix metalloproteinases, glycoproteins, soluble mediators, and selectins. These factors may be presented on the surface of tumor cells as well as in their microenvironment, and some may trigger more than just one simple receptor–ligand mechanism. For a better understanding, we briefly discuss the physiological role of the factors in the platelet activation process, and subsequently, we provide scientific evidence and discuss their potential role in the progression of specific cancers. Targeting tumor cell-induced platelet aggregation (TCIPA) by antiplatelet drugs may open ways to develop new treatment modalities. On the one hand, it may affect patients’ prognosis by enhancing known therapies in advanced-stage tumors. On the other hand, the use of drugs that are mostly easily accessible and widely used in general practice may be an opportunity to propose an unparalleled antitumor prophylaxis. In this review, we present the recent discoveries of mechanisms by which cancer cells activate platelets, and discuss new platelet-targeted therapeutic strategies.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554419","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2022.909767/full?&utm_source=Email_to_authors_&utm_medium=Email&utm_content=T1_11.5e1_author&utm_campaign=Email_publication&field=&journalName=Frontiers_in_Oncology&id=909767","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661f98d74097076263688336","name":"Wiktoria","lastName":"Strasenburg","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9ae148c6-e12f-49fa-82a0-a93195f93d07"},{"objectId":"5e7094dd878c28a0473c58ee","name":"Jan","lastName":"Adamowicz","uuid":"BC7DC99F85933053BF94F76D164EF2966428F11ACB554E07B1200DECAC926FEA4DB15A25264DF77EC07632FAE0425DC88BC953BD0FB436BF7049C433CE8DF46C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e973f2cf-d638-4253-9d82-3600f99c9d20"},{"objectId":"5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f29","name":"Adam","lastName":"Kowalewski","uuid":"9E9C1F9F6661BE04DE1D129297B26A12E635F98B23A16FF260EAD3659937485E4393CF0F04FFBC2C43F5E6C7878A64881DE48194FD3F7B49807BCEEB4280CDB1","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0b9f5b4e-0339-4d99-b0a7-2822f946aa44"},{"objectId":"5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f15","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Durślewicz","uuid":"236B0022A3573AF9FE49E9B62D2B15332262BF417F61F81E0BEC0273EA2085B1ADBE32C829CB29DA90DB1446E36B41CFBF12889E7E9E1309CF476B200DE6B005","orcidId":"0000-0001-7301-5324","documentHash":"ebfa5e97-d8b2-486e-a271-f4a30d110c8f"},{"objectId":"5e70938a878c28a0473ac490","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Parol-Kulczyk","uuid":"F27B6FAFE74528136F5FE4DB5B274784BF24D80E36C3423ED22BEA268147630BBD9169D6ADF3D5F3B6784A936E7FCF6976C471D2A6C2A05E59F3E47AB61D4EC1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8130-4302","documentHash":"796a16fa-83c6-44a4-b7a1-5106f63217b6"},{"objectId":"5e709383878c28a0473ab93f","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Jóźwicki","uuid":"B0FAAF6A39E17731301C192BAF8169BBC215D0FFB88708EDD3D162913F001F6B2A24DD62CAD0519B44724694501BC20987DB4DB8DD4668EC944C6D52B66B4D54","orcidId":"0000-0002-2771-413X","documentHash":"026261f9-68cf-4c44-a763-1bdf3a1731f8"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5c22","name":"Błażej","lastName":"Kuffel","uuid":"0146DBC2582FB76C41FEDDD87A7753CACB0FB327283C58C7CF26EBADA717DB66B542642AE8062E34F9EFE295F948382883419D130FA48333207320368F205A5C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"54a04d7e-f19a-4ecb-a287-6cc28c958bd2"},{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739c0ad","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Grzanka","uuid":"26B5062638AC08FF6C90A5B523EEC89B126BF4B03FB2ED2FD57F6CC04BD71D383BA17100ACBB322C862B6CE3CA8D14ACED8B0EB1D29C38D6EF86FACAFD6D637F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0416-7583","documentHash":"48277d4e-1dd5-4d02-8381-0b4e7d494610"},{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739bffe","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Drewa","uuid":"B694F29E137BDAD2001C2D2584A69D3C412FF9D2CE5A90CF67B3D0A0332C46D7491D0C0CB864518DB747EDD42E633AE7B3408D42DCDEF75592233B030C32DEF6","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d21e8f5a-1d48-4b0e-9603-c853444e8c2a"}],"doi":"10.3389/fonc.2022.909767"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Jelito

ToTV also infects other Solanaceae plants, including Nicotiana benthamiana, where it induces distinctive disease symptoms: plant growth drop with the emergence of spoon-like malformed systemic leaves. Virus-induced post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) is significant among plant defense mechanisms activated upon virus invasion. The PTGS, however, can be counteracted by suppressors of RNA silencing commonly found in viruses, which efficiently disrupt the antiviral defense of their host. Here, we addressed the question of PTGS antiviral activity and its suppression in N. benthamiana during ToTV infection—a phenomenon not described for any representative from the Torradovirus genus so far. First, we showed that neither the Vp26—a necrosis-inducing pathogenicity determinant of ToTV—nor other structural viral proteins limited the locally induced PTGS similar to p19, a well-characterized potent suppressor of RNA silencing of tombusviruses. Moreover, by employing wild-type and transgenic lines of N. benthamiana with suppressed Dicer-like 2 (DCL2), Dicer-like 4 (DCL4), Argonaute 2 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6) proteins, we proved their involvement in anti-ToTV defense. Additionally, we identified DCL4 as the major processor of ToTV-derived siRNA.

Polegała na skutecznej profilaktyce w czasach prosperity i uzdrawiających, czasem wręcz brutalnych interwencjach w momentach kryzysu. Władca powinien być jak lekarz ciała politycznego, które każdego dnia zagrożone jest śmiertelnymi chorobami – dżumą, buntem, nieporządkiem, zniewoleniem, demagogią, dekadencją. Medycyna i polityka zazębiają się w wielu punktach machiawelicznego dyskursu, tworząc specyficzne ima ginarium, przez które przenikają lęki i traumy pokoleń żyjących w ciągłym zagrożeniu powrotem dżumy. Wydawałoby się więc, że filozofię Machiavellego można odczytywać jako przypadek polityczno-medycznego projektu, będącego odpowiedzią na kryzys spowodowany zarazą, rzeczywistą i metaforyczną. Tymczasem w pismach tego kontrowersyjnego myśliciela mamy także do czynienia z formą pastiszu mającego na celu parodystyczne przedstawienie nie tylko rzeczywistości zarazy, ale także literatury, która o niej opowiada. Dychotomia dyskursów sięgająca samej istoty corpus machiavellicum często prowadziła komentatorów do wniosku, iż istnieje pewien kłopotliwy rozłam między Machiavellim ojcem obiektywnej nauki politycznej wzorowanej na naukach medycznych a Machiavellim artystą, twórcą subiektywnych i fikcyjnych światów literackich. Ta pozorna sprzeczność może jednak zostać łatwo przekształcona w bardziej spójny portret Machiavellego jako myśliciela, dla którego przewodnim motywem jest refleksja nad kondycją człowieka stojącego w obliczu katastrofy. Jedno i drugie podejście odpowiada duchowi renesansowego odradzania się po zarazie, przeciwdziałającego rezygnacji i dążącego do regeneracji społeczeństwa.&lt;/div&gt;"},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Niccolò Machiavelli viewed the governance of a state as parallel to the practice of medicine — endeavors characterized by proactive measures during times of prosperity and healing, at times harsh, interventions during moments of crisis. In Machiavelli’s conception, the ruler assumes the role of a physician for the body politic, perpetually threatened by a host of maladies including plague, rebellion, disorder, subjugation, demagoguery, and decadence. The intersection of medicine and politics within Machiavellian discourse constructs a unique narrative framework, reflecting the anxieties and collective traumas of generations grappling with the constant specter of plague resurgence. It appears, therefore, that Machiavelli’s philosophical framework can be interpreted as a socio-political venture akin to a medical intervention, formulated in reaction to both the tangible and metaphorical crises precipitated by the plague. Simultaneously, within the works of this contentious philosopher, we encounter a form of pastiche intended to satirize not only the reality of the plague but also the literature that chronicles it. The dichotomy of discourses inherent within the corpus machiavellicum often prompts scholars to discern a perplexing disjunction between Machiavelli as the progenitor of objective political science, modeled after medical principles, and Machiavelli as the artist, weaving subjective and fictional literary worlds. However, this apparent contradiction can be reconciled into a more coherent depiction of Machiavelli as a thinker, whose central theme revolves around contemplation of the human condition amidst calamity. Both perspectives resonate with the ethos of the Renaissance resurgence following the plague, defying resignation and striving to rejuvenate society.&lt;/div&gt;"}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554431","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"495–518","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://czasopisma.ignatianum.edu.pl/pk/article/view/2024.4401.33","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70944e878c28a0473ba2c8","name":"Bogumił","lastName":"Strączek","uuid":"04D75A50FBF4EE773A1EE6B790F878FD903103E6C80B7BED964DAC9CCE4C82773B3E0D998CFD36C4F74858A78A760FC4EACB4A868D75D4A404CE4241B487E0BF","orcidId":"0000-0002-6386-2332","documentHash":"10abd9e7-1038-4601-90e0-c4750d35c08c"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deab","uid":"bsFXqcMUEmm0C4RhCx2RNvg","uuid":"0160a6a0-6886-44b8-bbf8-4296df6c35ec","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deab","parentUuid":"0160a6a0-6886-44b8-bbf8-4296df6c35ec","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deab","rootUuid":"0160a6a0-6886-44b8-bbf8-4296df6c35ec","name":"Instytut Historii im.

The growth of e-commerce and the increasing digitalisation of customer interactions with banks was particularly accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic (the  first  ‘black  swan’).  These  processes  have  also  influenced  the  rapid  growth  of  the LendTech  (LT)  sector within  FinTech with  its  digital loans and  buy-now-pay-later  (BNPL) services. The war in Ukraine (the second ‘black swan’) has led to an energy crisis, increased inflation, interest rates and credit costs, and reduced credit accessibility. In this context, the following research questions are addressed: Are the LT and banking sectors complementary or substitutive in the area of consumer financing? Does complementarity apply to all customer segments and loan amounts? How does the extent of complementarity or substitutability of the LT sector depend on, and to what extent do changes in the regulatory and macroeconomic environment affect, the interaction between the banking and LT sectors?Purpose  of  the  article: The aim of the article is to identify trends in the LT sector within FinTech in the context of assessing the scale and determinants of current and future comple-mentarity of the non-bank sector and the banking sector in the area of consumer credit in time of black swans. An additional purpose of the article is to estimate revenues from the basic operating activities of companies from the on-line channel.  Methods: The research process was multi-stage and the research procedure was structured. Due to the lack of a uniform source of data on LT products and services, the study used many data sources — data from the Credit Information Bureau, a primary nationwide survey on LT users a primary survey of people representing LT's managerial staff. The selection of LTs was carried out according to the concept of the monetary sampling unit. The Horvitz-Thompson estimator with Sen-Yates-Grundy variance form was used to estimate net operating income for LT from the online channel in 2021. Findings & value added: The LT companies surveyed state that black swans (the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine) and the current macroeconomic situation have not significantly affected demand for non-banking loans. The reduction in the opportunities for the LT sector as a result of anti-usury regulations will only lead to a shift in consumer demand to the pawnshop sector and the shadow economy, which will be detrimental to consumers. Com-plementarity between LT and the banking sector is revealed especially in crisis situations, thus limiting the effects of market shock (limited supply of loans offered by banks). In periods of stabilisation, a rather clear division of preferences is noticeable – in the case of seniors and loans for higher amounts, banks dominate, while in the case of lower amounts and in younger age  groups,  non-bank  institutions  are  more  popular.  The  mechanism  by  which  shrinking banking services are replaced by LT in short-term crises confirms the importance of LT in balancing the Consumer Finance market in the face of unstable periods. From a medium- and long-term perspective, it should be noted that inflation and rising interest rates will increase the scale of credit exclusion in commercial banks, shifting part of the demand to the non-bank sector. These phenomena have an international dimension. Similar observations were made already in 2012 by the CFPB in the USA and the British FTA, when analysing the consumer finance  market  immediately  after  the  subprime  crisis,  emphasising  the  effects  of  limiting access to bank consumer loans and the resulting growth of the LT market (Gębski, 2013).

EF are crucial in management of pre-diabetes, diabetes and obesity which are grievous diseases and can lead to severe complications. The aims of our study were to: assess EF in group of obese subject with carbohydrate disorders, evaluate whether biochemical factors and\r\ncomorbidities related to metabolic disorders have adverse effect on EF in this group of patients. Methods: The study included 185 obese patients (146 women; 39 men) who were divided on three groups: pre-diabetic, diabetic and control subgroup. Patient underwent Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) to evaluate EF. Assessed biochemical factors included C-peptide, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Results: Diabetic patients showed the worst WCST scores among the rest of groups. Pre-diabetic individuals did not differ in EF performance from control subgroup. We observed significant correlations between FPG and HbA1c and worse WCST scores in pre-diabetic subgroup. In diabetic patients C-peptide correlated with poorer EF. Depressive symptoms and hypertension significantly correlated with non-perseverative errors in WCST. Conclusions: The subgroup of diabetic patients were\r\nthe most obese and had the worst glycemia parameters. They also showed the worst EF in WCST. According to obtained results, hyperglycemia positively correlated with poor EF in pre-diabetes.

80 % of the oceans, especially the Arctic and Subarctic are primarily inhabited by marine mammals.\r\nMarine species depend mostly on sea ice for food, raising their young ones and safeguarding

Consumption of marine mammals has always been recommended as healthy, but the truth is that it\r\ncan be detrimental for human health because of sea water pollution from trash and chemicals. This systematic\r\nreview provides an in-depth examination of sea mammals, their complex relationship with humans, and their\r\nsustainability in the face of various threats such as overexploitation and climate change. Through analysis of\r\nvarious aspects regarding human-sea mammal interactions - including consumption, cultural and religious beliefs, use in traditional medicine, and negative impacts from, e.g. by-catch and overfishing - the significant\r\npressures exerted on these species are highlighted in this systematic review. Despite conservation efforts, certain\r\nsea mammal populations continue to decline, necessitating more robust research and policy action. The need for\r\nfurther research into the sustainable utilisation of sea mammals, considering health, ecological, economic,\r\nethical and cultural aspects, as well as the accumulation of pollutants in sea mammals, is underscored.

PRES most often occurs in connection with severe hypertension and autoimmune diseases. It can also appear during chemotherapy or immunosuppressive treatment. A 38-year-old woman with a negative medical history was admitted to the local hospital due to loss of consciousness accompanied by seizures and high values of blood pressure, and a PCR test for COVID-19 was positive. The patient’s condition was preceded by weakness, wet cough, runny nose, and low-grade fever for three days. Due to the conducted diagnostics after negative CT scans and angio CT studies, an MRI of the head with contrast was performed, where changes characteristic of PRES syndrome were found. During the hospitalization, the patient did not require invasive ventilation and did not receive antiviral drugs or tocilizumab as a result of treatment for her high blood pressure values, and after establishing the diagnosis, the patient was discharged home with a significant improvement in her well-being. In the literature, there are discussions as to whether COVID-19 predisposes patients to PRES. Isolated cases have been described, but its frequency is not yet established. Case reports in the literature appear to be specifically associated with a severe course of the disease, unlike in our patient.

This study aims to present an exploration of the scientific literature indexed in Scopus dedicated to electromobility logistics and the business ecosystem. The methods used in this article include a classical literature review and a systematic literature review, combined with bibliometric analysis in VOSviewer software (version 1.6.19). These methods allowed for the analysis of keywords and research motifs related directly to the development of electromobility from a business ecosystem perspective. Results of this study indicate that while technological innovations play a significant role, the success of electromobility is also highly dependent on its efficient and collaborative business ecosystem of entities involved in transportation and energy sectors. This ecosystem, defined by mutual value creation and strategic collaboration along with infrastructure and logistics, has the potential to drive economic growth and create new green jobs in the energy and transport sectors. In conclusion, the study underscores the importance of a sustainable and balanced approach, emphasizing both technological advancements and the significance of a robust business ecosystem for the future of the electromobility business ecosystem."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554445","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"1-27","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6616575b40970762639cf8a0","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Grzesiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e87e5f67-e9e4-44ea-b5e6-eeb25c0721e5"},{"objectId":"5e709339878c28a0473a533e","name":"Adam","lastName":"Sulich","uuid":"CADE312272DB7897C3792FB242811D5C07B1834131AB12244AED93AC9B6FA780EECB65A966CC016A79A0BE2154E5B8E14FD36CDE23F0F116378D0782C5A05BB2","orcidId":"0000-0001-8841-9102","documentHash":"325f1701-2fd1-4795-8f21-9dda31ce6a1e"}],"doi":"10.3390/en16217249"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Zawał serca","Mięśnie brodawkowate - urazy","Zastawka mitralna - chirurgia"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Papillary muscle rupture (PMR)","Mitral valve surgery","Mitral regurgitation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Surgical treatment of post-infarction papillary muscle rupture: systematic review and meta-analysis","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b98d","mniswId":"1218","title":"Annals of Cardiothoracic Surgery","doi":null,"issn":"2225-319X","eissn":"2304-1021","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b76ea0e0-d0c1-4544-bc82-16474cd5cd21"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-01-11","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"661f98114097076263687a92","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["661f98114097076263687a93","661f98114097076263687a94","5e70938b878c28a0473ac4ca","661f98114097076263687a95","661f98114097076263687a96","661f98114097076263687a97","661f98114097076263687a98","661f98114097076263687a99"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Papillary muscle rupture (PMR) is a rare but potentially fatal complication following acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Surgical treatment is considered the standard of care. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the early outcomes after surgical correction of post-AMI PMR.\r\nMethods: Electronic databases were searched from January 1990 to December 2020. Studies reporting patients undergoing mitral valve surgery for post-AMI PMR were analysed. The primary outcome assessed was operative mortality. Differences were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) to assess the relationships between predefined surgical variables and clinical prognosis.\r\nResults: A total of 1,851 adult patients, from 12 observational studies, were identified. Operative mortality\r\nwas 21%. Meta-analysis revealed reduced operative risk in patients undergoing mitral valve repair (MVr) as compared to replacement (MVR) (RR, 0.33; 95% CI: 0.14 to 0.79; P=0.01), and an increased risk of operative mortality in patients with complete PMR (RR, 2.54; 95% CI: 1.12 to 5.74; P=0.03). No significant differences in terms of operative mortality were observed between patients with or without pre/perioperative intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support and between subjects who underwent mitral valve surgery with or without concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).\r\nConclusions: Mitral valve surgery for post-AMI PMR carries a high operative mortality. Patients with complete PMR and subjects undergoing MVR have increased risks of operative mortality. The preoperative use of IABP and concomitant CABG seem not to influence the early postoperative course in this context."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554447","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"252-260","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.annalscts.com/article/view/16924/html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661f98114097076263687a99","name":"Roberto","lastName":"Lorusso","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c011020f-8110-47f7-9803-3e1d62a6506e"},{"objectId":"661f98114097076263687a98","name":"Paolo","lastName":"Severgnini","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"97a24455-6cec-44af-9ced-d7fa141a5be3"},{"objectId":"661f98114097076263687a97","name":"Cesare","lastName":"Beghi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"18372f3a-8327-49ef-89fd-702642e37ae1"},{"objectId":"661f98114097076263687a96","name":"Federica","lastName":"Jiritano","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"954a07f3-0a30-4c9c-8627-797690fc28fc"},{"objectId":"661f98114097076263687a95","name":"Daniele","lastName":"Ronco","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"39b8fdf3-865b-4150-a3c1-29b048493068"},{"objectId":"661f98114097076263687a94","name":"Matteo","lastName":"Matteucci","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"da5786bf-3c23-4dbd-a1bf-31a56aacbb14"},{"objectId":"661f98114097076263687a93","name":"Giulio","lastName":"Massimi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e8375f75-6c02-4095-ab8c-8dd1684b89c7"},{"objectId":"5e70938b878c28a0473ac4ca","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Kowalewski","uuid":"6B689E6CD2A471AEAE343D96A14CD6899525EDB497871DAAA3A07CF94CE13A6C867CA89C079B7F63348D9F949D35675BCA1EEEA7192726E3A868B65581A34F08","orcidId":"0000-0002-5478-3245","documentHash":"835babac-131e-4cb9-bdff-e59894fff2b6"}],"doi":"10.21037/acs-2021-ami-15"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["aktywa finansowe netto","Europejski Bank Centralny","Umowa ANFA"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["net financial assets","European Central Bank","Agreement on Net Financial Assets"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3d","uid":"b2eiZUbb85g0FOaTA2KZtOw","uuid":"c7c10a2a-f381-4dc2-8511-53400ceb4a90","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3d","parentUuid":"c7c10a2a-f381-4dc2-8511-53400ceb4a90","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3d","rootUuid":"c7c10a2a-f381-4dc2-8511-53400ceb4a90","name":"Szkoła Główna Handlowa w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094e7878c28a0473c678e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Role of Net Financial Assets in the Euro Area in the scope of Agreement on Net Financial Assets (ANFA)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d51878c285145479c8b","mniswId":"21189","title":"Bank i Kredyt","doi":null,"issn":"0137-5520","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"af320de8-284f-4e17-81de-3fa20582edb9"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"661f6cef409707626360b35b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094e7878c28a0473c678e","672e1754fdbe8303499c01f0"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Agreement on Net Financial Assets (ANFA) is an important element of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and it is supposed to grant national central banks a large degree of autonomy in a management of some of its assets and liabilities. Until the turn of 2015 and 2016, it was very little known about both, this agreement and the way it works. It was not until the eruption of the last phase of the Greek crisis in 2015 - when certain rumours started to circulate, according to which the ANFA could have become an instrument aimed to alleviate fiscal tensions. This kind of claims incentivized the ECB in February 2016 to disclose the content of the ANFA. If all the rumours concerning possibilities of financing debt proved to be unfounded, the ANFA seems not only to grant autonomy in the management of a given national central bank’s assets and liabilities, it also offers room for these banks to manage its liquidity needs. This paper is aimed to present an importance the net financial assets (NFAs which are subject of the ANFA) for the Eurosystem from two different perspectives. The first one focuses on the NFA perception from the point of view of the balance sheet of different national central banks which are part of the Eurosystem. The second one scrutinises a link involving net financial assets and liquidity management. Conclusions drawn upon the content of this paper point that thanks to ANFA, national central banks enjoy large degree of autonomy within the Eurosystem, and its use helps to preserve integrity of the EMU.

Two architectures of deep neural networks were created: multilayered deep convolutional neural networks and a long short-term memory network with regression output. Both neural networks were trained, validated and tested on the same engine data and with a various network training options. Results were compared with the neural network performance metrics and figures presenting network prediction convergence. To present how the real-life engine dataset differs the results from the simulated data, both datasets were validated on the same neural network architectures.

Following that, 545 HPV DNA positive women were tested for HPV infection using HPV mRNA with the Nucleic Acid Sequence-Based Amplification Assay (NASBA) method.\r\nResults\r\nIn our study group, 70.1% had DNA HPV positive results. Only 4% of the women had normal cytology. Among 545 HPV DNA positive patients, 36.3% had HPV mRNA positive tests.

The role of antibiotics is one of the most controversial issues in interventional endoscopic management of local complications of pancreatitis.\r\n\r\nMethods: This study was a randomized, non-inferiority, placebo-controlled, and double-blinded clinical trial to investigate the role of antibiotic prophylaxis in endoscopic transmural drainage in patients with symptomatic non-infected PPPFCs and assess the influence of antibiotic treatment on the results of endotherapy in patients with symptomatic infected PPPFCs.\r\n\r\nThis trial included 62 patients treated endoscopically for PPPFCs in 2020 at our medical center. Patients were divided into two groups; group 1 comprised patients who had received empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy during endotherapy and group 2 comprised patients who did not receive antibiotic therapy during endoscopic drainage of PPPFCs. The end points were clinical success and long-term success of endoscopic treatment.\r\n\r\nResults: Thirty-one patients were included in group 1 (walled-off pancreatic necrosis [WOPN, 51.6%; pseudocyst, 48.4%) and 31 patients in group 2 (WOPN, 58.1%; pseudocyst, 41.9%) (p=0.6098/nonsignificant statistical [NS]). Infection with PPPFCs was observed in 15/31 (48.39%) patients in group 1 and in 15/31 (48.39%) patients in group 2 (p=1.0/NS). The average time of active (with flushing through nasocystic drainage) drainage in group 1 was 13.0 (6 – 21) days and was 14.0 (7 – 25) days in group 2 (p=0.405/NS). The average total number endoscopic procedures on one patient was 3.3 (2 – 5) in group 1 and 3.4 (2 – 7) in group 2 (p=0.899/NS). Clinical success of PPPFCs was observed in 29/31 (93.5%) patients from group 1 and in 30/31 (96.8%) patients from group 2 (p=0.5540/NS). Complications of endotherapy were noted in 8/31 (25.8%) patients in group 1 and in 10/31 (32.3%) patients in group 2 (p=0.576/NS).

in one of the clinical hospitals in Poland. The analysis included the births given by 133 adolescent mothers and 169 young women.\r\n\r\nResults and discussion:\r\nThere was a downward trend in the percentage of births given by adolescent mothers and young women over a 9-year period. The placenta of adolescent women was lighter, by 25 g on average (<i>P</i> = 0.011), and had a smaller size (<i>P</i> = 0.038) than the placenta of young women.

The goal of the treatment is to release the stress on facets joints as well as decompress the nerve roots by enlarging the intervertebral foramina and narrowed canal recesses.\r\nPurpose: To evaluate possible structural changes in the lumbar spine after implantation of an IPD on operated and adjacent segments.\r\nPatients and Methods: Twenty-two patients were enrolled in the study. Preoperative MRI scans of the lumbar spine evaluated recess and foraminal stenosis prior to the application of an IPD. CT exams were performed and morphometric measurements were made to assess the size of intervertebral foramina after implantation on the operated and adjacent segments.\r\nResults: Statistically significant enlargements in diameter and surface area of the intervertebral foramen were seen at the operating level. On the right and left sides, foraminal enlargement after the procedure was 1 mm in diameter. The average enlargement of the foramina surface area at the level of implantation was 10 mm<sup>2</sup>. The median interspinous distance was significantly enlarged by 3.5 mm. No significant changes in adjacent segments were observed. Clinical improvement was confirmed by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and visual analog scale (VAS). Preoperative disability was reduced (mean ODI from 70.5 (12.25) to 49.5 (23.75)), as well as back pain (mean VAS from 8.0 (1.7) to 4.4 (2.6)) and pain in lower limbs (mean VAS from 7.4 (1.9) to 3.8 (2.9)).\r\nConclusion: Decompression surgery using an IPD is effective in the treatment of lumbar foraminal and canal stenosis. It provides relief of symptoms in short-term observation through enlargement of intervertebral foramina and decompression of neural roots. It reduces overload of facet joints of the operated segment and does not decrease the size of the intervertebral foramina and disc heights of adjacent segments."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554477","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1971-1982","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.dovepress.com/articles.php?article_id=76580","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661fa1be409707626368e22a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Leki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dec2490f-15ae-41b7-af1d-3c77ff475195"},{"objectId":"661fa1be409707626368e229","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Jaremko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9e9159f5-bb9f-495a-82b8-e1973789a70f"},{"objectId":"661fa1be409707626368e228","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Rudaś","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d2c2612f-1886-457b-b7d7-de1debc785ed"},{"objectId":"661fa1be409707626368e227","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Rulewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dd06a84e-3d0c-4273-99bd-15e52e7e85a5"},{"objectId":"661fa1be409707626368e226","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Krakowiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"be77f910-f27e-48d0-87e2-38fd3fce1555"},{"objectId":"609393769543c73526c48d30","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Broda","uuid":"0DDAAF970FAD157A4C47CBD269C022C923B06145D6E959932BD25F34078AE3F517D613A735FDF34FC2BD56D6C2BEF1841507AAC71E50832153FB30384EF069E1","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6067762a-71ba-4b02-894e-30c32f4c915c"},{"objectId":"5e7094cf878c28a0473c43d1","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Sokal","uuid":"EEE3B3FBB7E599443591B9F6E13B08F1D31EAC710DE8386F820C13C9E1EEEEEA0E65C3745A4CFF66E07B6B59EB8796734E964979FC7FA27D2BBA0100EA291B50","orcidId":"0000-0002-1226-1983","documentHash":"d5bcc0ab-303c-40c5-8137-73da8c1050d8"},{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a6043","name":"Michał","lastName":"Sabramowicz","uuid":"C9AB6AEB2A4C9712437EBC7B516FE3FCADEE1AF7724764F6A5B14C0EC1582900DFF70ADD0A0A9460821C7BB8338EBEB8814FFFE6FCA7BC34EB1D65451E01B466","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e85e5c57-cad3-4813-bffd-5e19ef2522d5"}],"doi":"10.2147/jpr.s356898"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Nowotwory jelita grubego - chirurgia","Stan odżywienia","Skład ciała","Tomografia komputerowa","Sarkopenia"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Colorectal cancer","Nutritional status","Body composition","Computed tomography scans","Sarcopenia"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Nutritional and functional status as indices of short- and long-term prognosis in patients undergoing surgery due to colorectal cancer","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547eeb9","mniswId":"200457","title":"Medical Research Journal","doi":null,"issn":"2451-2591","eissn":"2451-4101","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"7decb22a-f62e-4c10-a82e-49dd5de51d3e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-12-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"661f9901409707626368847a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709344878c28a0473a60e8","5e70943b878c28a0473b87c5","5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f17","5e7092c3878c28a04739c35b","661fa248409707626368e85e"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction:\r\nNutritional status and body composition parameters would seem to be reasonable prognostic factors in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). The study aimed to investigate the relationships between numerous parameters of nutritional status and prognosis in patients undergoing surgery due to CRC.\r\n\r\nMaterial and methods:\r\nClinical nutritional assessment and biochemical determinations were performed on 110 patients who underwent elective surgery due to primary CRC. Body composition was also analyzed using bioelectrical impedance (BIA) and computed tomography (CT) scans at the third lumbar (L3) vertebra using OsiriX software.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nPatients who failed to attend a visit 3 months after surgery (n = 15; 13.6%) were more likely to be sarcopenic, with lower baseline functional status, handgrip strength, skeletal muscle (SM) parameters in BIA and a smaller SM area in CT. Compared to those who died during, on average, 3.6 years of follow-up (n = 33; 30%), patients who survived had, at baseline, a significantly higher Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA) score, lower waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), and higher scores on functional status scales. In a Cox’s proportional-hazards model, in addition to an advanced WHO CRC stage, scores for MNA (HR; 95% CI: 0.85; 0.74–0.98; p = 0.021), Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and WHtR (3.68; 1.03–13.13; p = 0.049) were independent risk factors for death.\r\n\r\nConclusions:\r\nPatients’ functional status 3 months after surgery due to CRC was related to baseline SM strength, mass, and functional performance, whereas 3.5-year mortality was associated with lower MNA and IADL scores and higher WHtR and PG-SGA scores."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554479","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"7","pagesFromTo":"307-313","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.viamedica.pl/medical_research_journal/article/view/MRJ.a2022.0054","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661fa248409707626368e85e","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Mysiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"44cea35b-6f08-4bf5-a093-c14e287ffc1b"},{"objectId":"5e70943b878c28a0473b87c5","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Tojek","uuid":"5EDD4E51AC55DB8442545453129336C4D109EAB57EA6C5FD22B6D2EAF593C54FFD06106A622ABE9941B10E5873DD88957E8E66E09983648B977EB707E1B35ED9","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"36caf9e4-e961-4082-88b7-f3e90ac27459"},{"objectId":"5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f17","name":"Gabriel","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"B0D96FFE9A04A78DF8A561A9A5A6410D79148930B470E318B02FF167776D9C35E0E12F2DCF0D62082B696E70B9C4DB55ADC194B9980635BF236A00706514C985","orcidId":"0000-0001-7863-4909","documentHash":"e2cacf20-41da-4e1c-b502-a6afcfda61bd"},{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a60e8","name":"Beata","lastName":"Szukay","uuid":"99F8435C5007446A6C1693D7D39999130D6084909E764A23F21BBC0A612C02DA1E5ABAA90C9EB434DEC6923098CDA1EFFE1317DED7C06195CC59D69A4CE0847A","orcidId":"0000-0003-2518-6887","documentHash":"00bbcb56-8feb-4d60-8e93-af30b4375523"},{"objectId":"5e7092c3878c28a04739c35b","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Budzyński","uuid":"77641D331628CC6FA49AD1807B8781CFC647860428EB6C29C520E09D629D93E662F00C53E6BF9A873F25DEAAF4145C77F5E4D7319206E246E2AE69C6DAF6B46E","orcidId":"0000-0003-3556-5821","documentHash":"5cf6cf23-8357-4660-bb39-1adf2924c5e4"}],"doi":"10.5603/mrj.a2022.0054"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Urazy czaszkowo-mózgowe","Pielęgniarstwo","Opieka pielęgniarska"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"661fa2ec409707626368f17f","doi":null,"title":"Wybrane problemy pielęgnacyjne pacjentów w schorzeniach układu nerwowego","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-66987-00-5","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://www.continuo.wroclaw.pl/home?func=productPage&wid=40&pid=425&cid=1&prid=","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"a1e81833-917d-4737-a47e-ee5928e0f331","publisher":{"objectId":"5d78c016878c284eaa45d3e2","mniswId":"67100","name":"Wydawnictwo Continuo","documentHash":"4effbd0a-f1c4-4267-8b84-1fe59b6d2da9"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Problemy pielęgnacyjne pacjentów po urazie czaszkowo-mózgowym","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"661fa327409707626368f73a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c0878c28a04739c11c","5e7091f3878c28a04738d974"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059554480","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"314-331","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.continuo.wroclaw.pl/home?func=productPage&wid=40&pid=425&cid=1&prid=","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739c11c","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Królikowska","uuid":"33B44ABBF9C737E440016CA4AEDA648F63A590320A0BFA5599BE661D1BCB73FECBD728B290A0915342B6EADC77671D87FD857DB34EC9324294AF6E7358EB67E9","orcidId":"0000-0002-0175-6198","documentHash":"6a74837f-0146-4957-a857-112b85d119c3"},{"objectId":"5e7091f3878c28a04738d974","name":"Robert","lastName":"Ślusarz","uuid":"88DB22F30DED1AF007DE24C2B0510088BD1DF3940C6528A52044849788634B58BE9F5591D5A3FB2B6ADB8F3EFC167FF3E678671B12EBE298FDE0CEBF06E32758","orcidId":"0000-0001-6087-1893","documentHash":"7c9e74e4-baaa-42c6-9dc0-762e57c8b36c"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Nowotwory nerek -

cancer (CRC) is one of the most common and deadliest cancers worldwide. According to the GLOBOCAN (WHO) report in 2020, nearly 2 million patients were diagnosed globally. Despite the advances in cancer diagnosis and therapy, CRC remains a global challenge. Recently, attention has been paid to the tumor microenvironment (TME), which constitutes a significant part of the tumor and mainly includes various immune cells, fibroblasts, vascular cells, and extracellular elements, such as the extracellular matrix (ECM). Many components of the stroma initially exert an anti-tumor effect, but over time, they undergo functional transformation into elements that promote tumor growth. As a result, conditions conducive to further cancer development, invasion into local tissues, and distant metastasis arise. The microenvironment of colorectal cancer (CRC) may be an important direction in the search for therapeutic targets, but it requires further understanding. The main purpose of our review is to explain the role of the complex CRC microenvironment in the progression of this cancer and highlight the potential of targeted therapy directed at the TME. Therefore, continued research into its components and typical biomarkers is necessary to improve therapy and enhance the quality of life for patients."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554487","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/7/2930","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6615281e409707626398ba2c","name":"Paulina Magdalena","lastName":"Pieniądz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8f0738e5-2ff8-4526-9c70-d84902d408bc"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a65fe","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Pięt","uuid":"6A6869A8AE430EA60C93E5AAF946966A36A31434199AD0F8013532609BEA7CDEF5B5982DC64791D3FFD410AD02341DC77ABD678317E617C2B810A82D925E823D","orcidId":"0000-0003-3073-2512","documentHash":"c325d773-8911-4790-94bf-e095754bbca6"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a04739ff65","name":"Roman","lastName":"Paduch","uuid":"F9972A22A8A2D8DED0A8E63EB51AD566FBFE04ECA1CC918EB3F89B1573DAEDBCCC03FD48FFFDE1AA8480B469CF9B41D5F879DC7B7E0A07575C24750C9B94B08E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9779-7252","documentHash":"b9cba0eb-5d37-4836-b507-5c73349c68ee"}],"doi":"10.3390/app14072930"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Choroby układu krążenia - leczenie","Migotanie przedsionków - leczenie","Leki przeciwzakrzepowe","Osoby w wieku podeszłym"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Elderly","Antiplatelet","Anticoagulant","Coronary syndromes","Atrial fibrillation","Surgery","TAVI","LAAC"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","uid":"b_b7HPtUTCJYlxfss9Ssv-A","uuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","parentUuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","rootUuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","name":"Uniwersytet Mikołaja Kopernika w Toruniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ba878c28a0473afde8"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Acute, periprocedural and longterm antithrombotic therapy in older adults","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b82","mniswId":"6115","title":"European Heart Journal","doi":null,"issn":"0195-668X","eissn":"1522-9645","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b61ffae4-2b13-43e0-ad91-105e3b91efe2"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-07","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"661f96a240970762636867c3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["661f96a240970762636867c4","661f96a240970762636867c5","661f96a240970762636867c6","661f96a240970762636867c7","661f96a240970762636867c8","661f96a240970762636867c9","661f96a240970762636867ca","661f96a240970762636867cb","5e7093ba878c28a0473afde8","661f96a240970762636867cc","661f96a240970762636867cd","661f96a240970762636867ce","661f96a240970762636867cf","661f96a240970762636867d0","661f96a240970762636867d1","661f96a240970762636867d2"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\r\n               <jats:p>The first international guidance on antithrombotic therapy in the elderly came from the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Thrombosis in 2015.

The aim is to provide a succinct but comprehensive tool for readers to understand the bases of antithrombotic therapy in older patients, despite the complexities of comorbidities, comedications and uncertain ischaemic- vs. bleeding-risk balance. Fourteen updated consensus statements integrate recent trial data and other evidence, with a focus on high bleeding risk. Guideline recommendations, when present, are highlighted, as well as gaps in evidence. Key consensus points include efforts to improve medical adherence through deprescribing and polypill use; adoption of universal risk definitions for bleeding, myocardial infarction, stroke and cause-specific death; multiple bleeding-avoidance strategies, ranging from gastroprotection with aspirin use to selection of antithrombotic-drug composition, dosing and duration tailored to multiple

Despite the relatively low mortality rate, prostate cancer is still one of the most common neoplasms in men, which proves the need for continuous improvements in the diagnostics of this disease. New biomarkers may address these challenges in the form of extracellular vesicles (EV) secreted by prostate cancer cells. The available literature in the PubMed, SCOPUS, and ResearchGate databases from the last ten years was analyzed using search phrases such as extracellular vesicles, microparticles, microvesicles, cancer biomarkers, and prostate cancer. Then, the research was selected in terms of the size of the tested EVs (the EV medium of 100–1000 nm diameter, was taken into account), the latest versions of the literature were selected and compiled, and their results were compared. The group of extracellular vesicles contain a substantial amount of genetic information that can be used in research on the specificity of prostate cancer and other cancers. So far, it has been shown that EVs produced by PCa cells express proteins specific for these cells, which, thanks to their specificity, can make EV useful biomarkers of prostate cancer. Moreover, the importance of the quantitative release of EV from PCa cells has been demonstrated, which may be necessary to diagnose prostate cancer malignancy. Each method positively correlates with Gleason’s results and is even characterized by greater diagnostic sensitivity. Medium extracellular vesicles are a promising research material, and their specificity and sensitivity may allow them to be used in future prostate cancer diagnostics as biomarkers."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554495","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/11/2856","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661fcdd44097076263694d25","name":"Oliwia A.","lastName":"Jarosz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b3168658-bee9-4e8c-8928-a88be4b39624"},{"objectId":"5e7094df878c28a0473c5a9d","name":"Dagmara","lastName":"Szołna-Klufczyńska","uuid":"8C8E244410E0A6572D9C3BF99BE8280790970E70BD318B5B99E5CEF58BB2B7EAF9C562F3352285B408858064BBB391E85D592D6D926918D99DE140628C343BE4","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"940fdaf8-ed35-4c5d-92f5-30ccb261d8db"},{"objectId":"5e70947e878c28a0473be59c","name":"Milena","lastName":"Świtońska","uuid":"FABB0071F24DC8E9981FCE8D346A48B5243226041FEB7B952143F29985937A103CEC111D54CB22D4A33710AEDAEABB4C7B38E7BBC238BBDC731AF4B949970118","orcidId":"0000-0001-9504-7845","documentHash":"237f2ba0-3735-4cb8-a3eb-8d197e800eca"},{"objectId":"5e7092c1878c28a04739c1f8","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Sierakowska","uuid":"7006AA14B186FA279506B4ECFC8CD70F82E4A17F39EF2BDBBD80214BB1AB889878E3ECFE991FF9A161B844E596D784DB10D2CCFB44E5A3BA39157EF4A2452D8D","orcidId":"0000-0002-2296-0892","documentHash":"1dd09afb-a562-44b4-8e9e-f575797ac3dd"}],"doi":"10.3390/biomedicines10112856"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Przewód tętniczy przetrwały","Zespół niewydolności oddechowej noworodków"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6602c0be40970762632539f3","doi":null,"title":"Promocja, edukacja zdrowotna oraz profilaktyka w naukach medycznych.

However, even though proper antithrombotic prophylaxis is crucial in most urological procedures, we have insufficient high-quality studies on this topic. The European Association of Urology Guidelines (EAU) are outdated and lack data on COVID-19 increased risk of thrombosis. This review aimed to summarize data on thromboprophylaxis after radical prostatectomy, cystectomy, and nephrectomy during COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nMaterial and methods A thorough analysis of the EAU Guidelines of thromboprophylaxis was performed and compared to PubMed search, considering updated literature on thromboprophylaxis of radical prostatectomy, cystectomy, nephrectomy, as well as COVID-19 influence on venous thrombosis and urological practice.\r\nConclusions Each patient should be evaluated individually to balance bleeding and venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk. There is still much uncertainty in low and medium-risk patients and all endoscopic procedures. All patients should be tested for COVID infection prior to a planned surgery during bursts of infections, regardless of vaccination status. Efforts to maintain early cancer diagnosis and treatment during the pandemic should be maintained. The quality of evidence is inadequate, and when deciding\r\non thromboprophylaxis, we need to base it on individual risk, cancer advancement, procedure type, and our own experience."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554501","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"75","pagesFromTo":"128-134","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://ceju.online/journal/2022/thrombosis-venous-thromboembolism-thromboprophylaxis-2206.php","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661f99974097076263688a09","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Adamczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c70fdf60-d4e3-4ee0-9fc9-304f27ac08ed"},{"objectId":"661f99974097076263688a08","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Ostrowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bb1b713f-c4f4-465b-9879-19d1cf08dc28"},{"objectId":"661f99974097076263688a07","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Lipowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8062e171-3fcd-4128-9ffc-21fe9df6fcc6"},{"objectId":"661f99974097076263688a06","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Skrudlik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ccadd70a-65f8-488d-9cb0-142287a55a5d"},{"objectId":"5ebedf7b752340254fc42f23","name":"Filip","lastName":"Kowalski","uuid":"EA47EB7DA605DB2BE49C92559F0FDCC8D61FE7A012D362E336D664CA04E1B4B7D491D3C17BEB131A0376557FADF516DFA265617CF4CFE866695276BB82064253","orcidId":"0000-0002-7981-8600","documentHash":"ddb1ab7f-c081-44d9-926d-5957d09f4a79"},{"objectId":"5e7094dd878c28a0473c58ee","name":"Jan","lastName":"Adamowicz","uuid":"BC7DC99F85933053BF94F76D164EF2966428F11ACB554E07B1200DECAC926FEA4DB15A25264DF77EC07632FAE0425DC88BC953BD0FB436BF7049C433CE8DF46C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e973f2cf-d638-4253-9d82-3600f99c9d20"},{"objectId":"5e7094cf878c28a0473c4309","name":"Adam","lastName":"Ostrowski","uuid":"E142D17AD7749997CE85BA422D0B9A0C1C8867F248B8337662F2CD05331E1059E02C549EB3D0DBEC7D2D771C692614FE55A8C82FECDF8B40D24B263E91D383B6","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c1d6b9f-6747-489f-a526-d0176794bb45"},{"objectId":"5e709324878c28a0473a3822","name":"Kajetan","lastName":"Juszczak","uuid":"69181E3871A51B28509A0A28D8ABE58B1E26E253960EB57FE4EFE77AD7A68844BACDBE98228C160D2E50FC9D71C66183D5B7AE1C914550CFBED6A599C9761F67","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fcac98c5-ee16-4c8f-b3e5-77460e75efee"},{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739bffe","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Drewa","uuid":"B694F29E137BDAD2001C2D2584A69D3C412FF9D2CE5A90CF67B3D0A0332C46D7491D0C0CB864518DB747EDD42E633AE7B3408D42DCDEF75592233B030C32DEF6","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d21e8f5a-1d48-4b0e-9603-c853444e8c2a"}],"doi":"10.5173/ceju.2022.0047"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["COVID-19","Medycyna ratunkowa","Bydgoszcz"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19","Emergency medical service","Pandemic","Response time"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on emergency medical service response to emergency calls: a retrospective analysis of data from Emergency Medical Service station in Bydgoszcz","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547eeb9","mniswId":"200457","title":"Medical Research Journal","doi":null,"issn":"2451-2591","eissn":"2451-4101","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"7decb22a-f62e-4c10-a82e-49dd5de51d3e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-08-02","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"661f985c4097076263687de5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c0878c28a04739c068","5e7093e7878c28a0473b3032","5e7092d8878c28a04739de7f","661fa203409707626368e657","661fa203409707626368e658","661fa203409707626368e659","661fa203409707626368e65a"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<b>Introduction:</b> Emergency medical systems, as the first line of management of infectious patients, were affected by the 2019 coronavirus acute respiratory disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The aim of the study was to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) with emphasis on response time.\r\n\r\n<b>Material and methods:</b> Retrospective analysis of dispatch card from EMS in Bydgoszcz between January 2018 and December 2020. The differences regarding the EMS response were analyzed between the pre-pandemic (2018–2019) and the pandemic (2020) period in three time-points: from call to Emergency Medical Team (EMT) departure (T1), from departure to arrival at the scene (T2), and from arrival to reaching the emergency department (T3).\r\n\r\n<b>Results:</b> There were 47783 EMT departures in 2018, 47113 in 2019 and 40835 in 2020. In 2020 mean (SD) monthly number of interventions was significantly lower [3403 (349) <i>vs.</i> 3954 (182), p < 0.001) compared to the 2018–2019 period.

The increase in the human population leads to the need to optimise agricultural production, with an increasing demand for plant protection products. Historically, there have been serious fires at plant protection product storage facilities with devastating consequences for the environment. For this reason, it is worth investigating what risks arise for people and the environment during a fire at storage sites for these substances. In this article, tests were carried out for three plant protection products containing azoxystrobin as the active substance, in order to investigate the effects of the additives on combustion processes. Tests of combustion parameters were performed using a cone calorimeter. A tube furnace with asphyxiating and irritant gas analysers and gas chromatography with a mass spectrometer were used to analyse the resulting gas products. The Plant Protection Products tested achieved high values for combustion parameters. Analysis of the substances produced during their combustion showed that large amounts of asphyxiating and irritating gases (CO, N2O, NO, SO2, NH3, HCl, CH2O, HCN) were generated."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554508","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66013bed40970762631ad753","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"922","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"d827ce66-2a90-4f1e-9c09-439fea4b1534"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"922","pagesFromTo":"171243","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0048969724013822?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"657a76b840e3ff3ab2904a8d","name":"Jan","lastName":"Przybysz","uuid":"E5483740CBE197FBDEF60DAE032A3738F54459A07BB2F9D5CCA71FE28861E61BB81C25C01493F171D4F82FFF2620FB3641D4D2291385EDFB4A9A611869D2AD19","orcidId":"0000-0002-3958-1581","documentHash":"6645ada7-4d32-4ff0-b498-bb052bb9fe80"},{"objectId":"5e70946c878c28a0473bca3f","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Mizera","uuid":"910C88D08854F807E0A973990A24A95D7BF0798685E8713F7D1333A35D27B7AFC95C0D19BD98B32209AAC369419303201DFB97985FC8C68285B9C3746CCEC487","orcidId":"0000-0001-7427-7588","documentHash":"58e29704-3372-4689-8aa1-31a385cdab68"},{"objectId":"5e709459878c28a0473bb15a","name":"Monika","lastName":"Borucka (Sankowska)","uuid":"C04478D65C5C93CDF89B8FAC524FBF6244854D508E5190C4BDEDA0D88132E418A19DDAD83AE7E56459BAEA08148DBCB7D3CC75B8A65F4A8F577BEA7CB24A3920","orcidId":"0000-0003-0261-0147","documentHash":"5246c6c7-e7fa-4ee7-9597-930bb171690f"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba023","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Gajek","uuid":"8F2E09B17D3BEEC064D63D65A0EABF5F974791FAD070B0121C2ED61A53D6BE8301F0E2F3914765D8738A37309A5E2117EED83C94C59D8A6C7694678F538EF38C","orcidId":"0000-0003-2461-5352","documentHash":"25701e85-38af-494a-8ad3-6227866ba80d"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171243"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Glejak - leczenie","Reoperacja","Analiza przeżycia"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Glioblastoma","Reoperation","Survival time","Predictors of survival"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Survival after reoperation for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme: a prospective study","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479896","mniswId":"19163","title":"Surgical Oncology","doi":null,"issn":"0960-7404","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"02ff8296-74a6-4bc6-817c-57073b37964b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"661fa18d409707626368ddfa","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["661fa18d409707626368ddfb","661fa18d409707626368ddfc","661fa18d409707626368ddfd","661fa18d409707626368ddfe","661fa18d409707626368ddff","661fa18d409707626368de00","661fa18d409707626368de01","661fa18d409707626368de02","661fa18d409707626368de03","661fa18d409707626368de04","5e7092c0878c28a04739c0e6"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose\r\n\r\nGlioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor. Moreover, GBM recurs in nearly all patients. Although a standard STUPP protocol has been widely used for newly diagnosed GBM, no standard regimen has been established for recurrent patients. Here we evaluated the clinical value of recurrent GBM reoperation by comparing overall survival and quality of life (QoL) in patients with recurrent GBM undergoing repeat surgery or conservative treatment.\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nThis was a prospective study of 165 patients with GBM receiving first operations for their disease between 2011 and 2013 at two tertiary neurosurgery centers in Poland. Thirty-five eligible patients were re-operated for recurrence (the study group), and 35 patients were selected as the control group using propensity score matching. A model was created to determine advantageous prognostic factors for longer survival of patients qualifying for reoperation using stepwise linear regression.\r\nResults\r\n\r\nThe mean overall survival of patients undergoing repeat surgery was 528 days compared to 297 days in patients who did not undergo repeat surgery. Reoperation did not result in a significant deterioration in performance status as measured by the Karnofsky Performance Scale.

The study analyzed the activity of acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, urease and dehydrogenases as well as the potential biochemical soil fertility index of soil and the chemical parameters of soil. Soil material was collected from spring wheat grown after spring barley, oats and red clover, occurring in conventional or organic systems in 2009-2019. It has been shown that, compared to a conventional system, the perennial cultivation of red clover and cereals in the organic farming system has contributed to a significant improvement in the chemical (pHKCl by an average of 8%, total organic carbon – 18%, total nitrogen – 15%, N-NH4+ – 34%) and enzymatic (acid phosphatase – 29%, alkaline phosphatase – 67%, urease – 28% and dehydrogenases – 25%) soil quality indicators.

Therefore, the research on factors affecting the quality of imprints obtained by flexographic printing, in particular on film materials, is relevant. A comparison of the quality of flexographic imprints on PET obtained at different printing speeds was made. Control charts for the measured imprint indicators (optical density, raster dot compression, contrast, print stability) were constructed. In the process of analysis, some deviations from the standards were found, in particular optical density, which can be related to the change in viscosity of the ink in the process of increasing the printing speed. Using optical and electron microscopy, the influence of the parameters and cell structure of the anilox roller on the shape and size of the raster dots on the imprint was investigated. Based on microscopic studies of the surface and morphological structure of the substrates, the influence of the surface topography of the film materials on the densitometric and colourimetric indicators of the printed images was confirmed. The analysis of the phenomena of the interaction of ink with the film material during the imprint’s formation in the process of high-speed printing was carried out. Using the method of morphological analysis, the effectiveness of the interaction of the main influencing factors on the quality of printed images on packaging made of film materials was determined. A multi-level hierarchical model has been developed, which takes into account the factors affecting the quality of flexographic imprints during the production of packaging."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554520","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6615135a4097076263989675","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"12938","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"f228929e-57bd-4459-b7c2-0f2ae7ff8a9d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12938","pagesFromTo":"1-5","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/12938/129380W/Study-of-flexographic-imprints-using-the-methods-of-optical-and/10.1117/12.3012269.short","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"673345e2fdbe830349a0d538","name":"Tetyana","lastName":"Telehina","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"87a79ddc-117d-4400-a9bd-ea032f1517cc"},{"objectId":"673345e2fdbe830349a0d537","name":"Marta","lastName":"Labetska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bac208cf-a6d2-47da-ab48-384ee9f99269"},{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395ebf","name":"Svitlana","lastName":"Havenko","uuid":"3D643D46E374FD1332C39062EAE23D2EE30A9D79E475CD8730689AD8CB66F9C165E481421D76FFD6363A78D93CF6323306DA5080B095FA78F2C37662F7E71171","orcidId":"0000-0003-4973-5174","documentHash":"b0c028da-4acd-43e6-a02e-1ed6630e2d2f"}],"doi":"10.1117/12.3012269"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Ćwiczenia fizyczne","Gimnastyka","Kultura","Kobiety","Ukraina"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Female gymnasts","Ukrainian folk games","Physical fitness","Testing"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Ukrainian folk outdoor games in the system of physical training facilities for gymnasts aged 6-7 years","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e718ce846e0fb0001d1e177","mniswId":null,"title":"Slobozhanskyi Herald of Science and Sport","doi":null,"issn":"1991-0177","eissn":"1999-818X","websiteLink":"http://journals.uran.ua/index.php/1991-0177","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"9d490a8f-4b57-465f-9bd1-aa9c59e9c1f6"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-16","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"661f9969409707626368884f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["661f99694097076263688850","5e70920d878c28a04738f317","661f99694097076263688851","661f99694097076263688852"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<b>Purpose:</b> to substantiate the effectiveness of the use of Ukrainian outdoor games to increase the level of physical preparedness of 6-7 year old gymnasts.\r\n\r\n<b>Material & Methods:</b> the study involved 22 female athletes aged 6-7 years old involved in artistic gymnastics.

Eleven sedimentary facies were recognized, based on lithological and sedimentological investigations of 655.7 m of drill cores from the Otyń IG 1, Gorzów Wielkopolski IG 1 and Kamień Pomorski IG 1 boreholes. The facies can be grouped according to a lithological criterion into facies of predominantly siliciclastic lithology (including 9 facies types) and facies of predominantly carbonate lithology (including 2 facies types). Facies analysis allowed to distinguish 8 facies associations of: 1) alluvial fan, 2) playa, 3) sandy-muddy coastal plain, 4) embayment and distal delta, 5) lagoon, 6) sand bars or shoals, 7) ooidal shoals or bars, and 8) offshore. Deepening-upward (DC) and shallowing-upward (SC) sedimentary cycles were recognized in parts of the Baltic Formation, with DCs dominating in the southernmost located Otyń IG 1, and SCs dominating in Gorzów Wielkopolski IG 1, located in the axial part of the basin. Symmetrical cycles are very rare. The statistical significance of the sedimentary cycles is relatively low according to Markov-chain analysis conducted with the phpSedistat software of Stanova et al. (2009). Analysis of small–scale cycles performed on well logs of investigated boreholes and additional boreholes in the vicinity of Otyń IG 1, implementing the earlier study of Becker (2005), showed that the correlation of well-log cycles (GR cycles) and sedimentary cycles is not obvious. GR cycles can be roughly correlated with lithological carbonate–siliciclastic cycles (c-s cycles), reflecting alternations of facies groups of predominantly carbonate and siliciclastic lithology. Calibration of GR cycles to earlier magnetostratigraphic results of Nawrocki (1997) and Becker and Nawrocki (2014) showed that neither the boundaries of GR cycles serve as reference horizons, nor the cycles document equal time periods. All existing depositional models of the Lower Buntsandstein were discussed, stressing the possible simultaneous interaction of allochthonous and autochthonous processes. Moreover, the tectonic overprint of the Central European Basin system during the Early Triassic should be taken into account. The presented results suggest that the Lower Buntsandstein cyclicity of the CEB cannot serve as a basis for astrochronological analysis."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554523","journalIssue":{"objectId":"661f99c44097075339a719ff","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"f09deed7-132a-461a-82ec-da5131a630b9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"252-292","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2095383624000026?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70934a878c28a0473a69f7","name":"Anna","lastName":"Becker","uuid":"589174073F08EB9CF774D8471101E82F9B335B76430ACD77A4146CAC3DCE9A48763619ABD7653B9F5F600EA5DC44EB1A3B991FAFED06C9442970475240C3B0D4","orcidId":"0000-0001-6255-4007","documentHash":"25d684a7-bcab-4c87-86e4-87147d84549f"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jop.2024.01.002"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Miastenia - diagnostyka","Serce - fizjologia","Ciśnienie krwi"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","uid":"b_b7HPtUTCJYlxfss9Ssv-A","uuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","parentUuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","rootUuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","name":"Uniwersytet Mikołaja Kopernika w Toruniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709237878c28a047391cfc","5e7093ba878c28a0473afde4","5e7091ff878c28a04738e568"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Association of Cardiac Autonomic Responses with Clinical Outcomes of Myasthenia Gravis: Short-Term Analysis of the Heart-Rate and Blood Pressure Variability","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c754","mniswId":"10517","title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2077-0383","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"11fb906d-8d54-4e42-be05-fb426fe7219b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-27","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"661f9948409707626368877a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709425878c28a0473b717a","5e7092bf878c28a04739bee7","5e7091ff878c28a04738e568","5e709237878c28a047391cfc","5e7093ba878c28a0473afde4","661fa27d409707626368ed74"]},"issue":"13","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>Introduction: The aim of the study was to assess cardiac and autonomic function in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) and to explore its relationship with disease outcomes. Methods: Thirty-eight patients with an MG were enrolled (median age 40.5 years; median disease duration 5.5 years). Cardiovascular parameters, baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), spectral indices of short-term heart rate (HRV), and systolic blood pressure variability (SBPV) were compared with age- and gender-matched controls (n = 30). Cardiac autonomic function was assessed during the response to standing (tilt) and deep breathing tests (expiration/inspiration ratio-E/I). Results: HR and BP responses to the tilt test were similar in both groups. MG patients, as compared to controls, were characterized by altered SBPV at rest, significantly reduced HR response to the deep breathing test (p &lt; 0.001), increased sympathovagal balance after tilt (delta LF/HF-RRI, p = 0.037), and lower values of BRS (p = 0.007) and hemodynamic parameters, i.e., cardiac index, index contractility, left ventricular work index, at rest and during tilt. There was no association between disease duration and autonomic parameters. Disease severity, as determined by MGFA (Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America) corrected for age and sex, was an independent predictor of diminished vagal tone (E/I ratio) and increased sympathetic response to tilt (delta LF/HF-RRI) as measured with HRV. Lower BRS was associated with greater disease severity and older age. Hemodynamic parameters were predominantly predicted by age and sex. Conclusion: Our results confirm cardiac autonomic dysfunction among MG patients with predominant parasympathetic impairment. Clinicians should consider evaluation of autonomic balance in MG patients with, or at risk for, cardiovascular disease.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554525","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/11/13/3697","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661fa27d409707626368ed74","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Rzepiński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b4568e4c-c91b-4028-ac49-8f338d19a1d4"},{"objectId":"5e709425878c28a0473b717a","name":"Monika","lastName":"Zawadka-Kunikowska","uuid":"DA21FFB226AEFE33023B659DF4CC978C26EB551E52F6A01E6EAD256A67A18654E23078EBFA73AAD5822078AC6974094812B7B21E6F1A3F31F92A8A8F4ABFD585","orcidId":"0000-0003-3861-7113","documentHash":"b0acf102-f62d-43a9-bcc3-081709d907bd"},{"objectId":"5e7093ba878c28a0473afde4","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Słomko","uuid":"495ABC419148B23719143AF93CD18DEC3D7C8BA17D9E1912C20D90B627B8E0E976F9AE8F346EA39D414177A34519897718721439B726E082A260FCBB35AA606D","orcidId":"0000-0002-8503-3172","documentHash":"fafc8394-b56a-4f56-9bbf-6e940c525f0b"},{"objectId":"5e7092bf878c28a04739bee7","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Tafil-Klawe","uuid":"0DB20E0987B10F149E7D1AE9869FBA550AED8B1DBB7D577A66DF60004DBC9226647D7580FD900DE4519956C6155A89E1A83701A6E8EC1DFFBBA0CEF701DA5AE8","orcidId":"0000-0002-2584-8476","documentHash":"1933c839-20e6-40b1-ad50-49a60bd31c6b"},{"objectId":"5e709237878c28a047391cfc","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Zalewski","uuid":"33611F36296149ECA19B796337526C9CB0B42E759B95BE331995DFACF5D99F746E476880C18C804B9AD9DC7378C9670648D45E5D453BDD4223FC3A77A92012FE","orcidId":"0000-0001-8453-7785","documentHash":"55389ec7-1a65-4245-a674-d6f32642897b"},{"objectId":"5e7091ff878c28a04738e568","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Klawe","uuid":"2B0D68CF21A544082AA2BEAA8DDD73B79FEA01810D538C024A814A4593D2B96DEF59974499158070E321E88A1A3B3FA8D6F99DAC8C06842A63AD7ACF50FEB2D6","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"27eda69e-1ec6-4d9e-a685-93f8e470544c"}],"doi":"10.3390/jcm11133697"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Agresja","sztuki walki"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"630f2d804097071f37ad3f66","doi":null,"title":"Żółć - gniew - furia :  medyczne i kulturowe aspekty na przestrzeni dziejów","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-67049-35-1","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://katalogi.bn.org.pl/permalink/48OMNIS_NLOP/1aot9i7/alma9912813192905606","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"fac83124-e4e5-49e0-bb3e-04d131ee72ba","publisher":{"objectId":"5d7765e5878c284eaa45d047","mniswId":"67800","name":"Wydawnictwo Episteme","documentHash":"b8c3ccc0-72ef-459b-8762-58482dd64177"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Dalekowschodnie sztuki walki regulatorem kontroli agresji","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"661fa316409707626368f54d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6040b71a9543c711bc6ea7e0","5e709344878c28a0473a6141"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059554527","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"269-278","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://katalogi.bn.org.pl/discovery/fulldisplay?context=L&vid=48OMNIS_NLOP:48OMNIS_NLOP&search_scope=NLOP_IZ_NZ&tab=LibraryCatalog&docid=alma9912813192905606","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6040b71a9543c711bc6ea7e0","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Suwała","uuid":"5F4F76BA914D5664B9B004DBDA311B5C66EDC78524A60AC22A4DFB239043841D6610D38555846D0F4E607201A4D5EEEC7336D9411DFBCA79CD575F8157214EA3","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c3123a8c-f6b0-45fe-982b-86df694a1513"},{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a6141","name":"Kosma","lastName":"Kołodziej","uuid":"2AD66E835D0B97B0DDC066DA79ACE55A6FD5E42FD811C268BE7C384700527968F35E178E749C7B1F9DA6FACE56E759EEC34DC4E76D02AC096AD5200992775186","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dad44d96-0fe4-440b-9fa6-f500c62c8287"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)","genes"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","parentUuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","rootUuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

The incidence of ASD is more prevalent in males compared to females, but the underlying mechanism, as well as molecular indications for identifying sex-specific differences in ASD symptoms remain unknown. Thus, impacting the development of personalized strategy towards pharmacotherapy of ASD. The current study employs an integrated bioinformatic approach to investigate the genes and pathways uniquely associated with sex specific differences in autistic individuals. Based on microarray dataset (GSE6575) extracted from the gene expression omnibus, the dysregulated genes between the autistic and the neurotypical individuals for both sexes were identified. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed to ascertain biological activities linked to the dysregulated genes. Protein–protein interaction network analysis was carried out to identify hub genes. The identified hub genes were examined to determine their functions and involvement in the associated pathways using Enrichr. Additionally, hub genes were validated from autism-associated databases and the potential small molecules targeting the hub genes were identified. The present study utilized whole blood transcriptomic gene expression analysis data and identified 2211 and 958 differentially expressed unique genes in males and females respectively. The functional enrichment analysis revealed that male hub genes were functionally associated with RNA polymerase II mediated transcriptional regulation whereas female hub genes were involved in intracellular signal transduction and cell migration. The top male hub genes exhibited functional enrichment in tyrosine kinase signalling pathway. The pathway enrichment analysis of male hub genes indicates the enrichment of papillomavirus infection. Female hub genes were enriched in androgen receptor signalling pathway and functionally enriched in focal adhesion specific excision repair. Identified drug like candidates targeting these genes may serve as a potential sex specific therapeutics. Wortmannin for males, 5-Fluorouracil for females had the highest scores. Targeted and sex-specific pharmacotherapies may be created for the management of ASD. The current investigation identifies sex-specific molecular signatures derived from whole blood which may serve as a potential peripheral sex-specific biomarkers for ASD. The study also uncovers the possible pharmacological interventions against the selected genes/pathway, providing support in development of therapeutic strategies to mitigate ASD. However, experimental proofs on biological systems are warranted."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059554530","journalIssue":{"objectId":"661f97e34097075339a702aa","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"2e3a08da-945c-43e4-915a-b3fdf66cd5ad"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00335-024-10036-5.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661f97e34097075339a702ad","name":"Shubham","lastName":"Dwivedi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cd248213-0701-4f37-9b84-1091c4c4ad30"},{"objectId":"661f97e34097075339a702ac","name":"Prabhash Kumar","lastName":"Jha","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"df89d7d2-d5ea-461f-9b71-4b3f3372e55c"},{"objectId":"661f97e34097075339a702ab","name":"Himani","lastName":"Nautiyal","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bbb46f2b-9068-4bdc-b28d-39e0d42b1bfd"},{"objectId":"61dcf9b97523403b69b16ad1","name":"Akanksha","lastName":"Jaiswar","uuid":"634A43CE68F0D778BC80C4E4F1C40D378DAB84C1BF2DEC8E434C31485FE9787AF2B7D26F166099904E13B6CC22C06B33983EE014E449E75D7EBA0D611A460140","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"54741abc-c5af-48a0-a291-1f6482c18e96"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00335-024-10036-5"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deda","uid":"btz9n5ZEfjQ8kaVG7tKm2Hw","uuid":"e711ee8e-d6f5-4f65-bd9b-29d4fe201466","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deda","parentUuid":"e711ee8e-d6f5-4f65-bd9b-29d4fe201466","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deda","rootUuid":"e711ee8e-d6f5-4f65-bd9b-29d4fe201466","name":"Instytut Gruźlicy i Chorób Płuc","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709264878c28a047394d3f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Zastosowanie leków roślinnych w chorobach układu pokarmowego – stanowisko ekspertów Polskiego Towarzystwa Fitoterapii – STAN FITO – Gastro","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"64f04bf6cf9a7471b0ea4096","mniswId":"201705","title":"Lekarz POZ/General Practitioner","doi":null,"issn":"2450-3517","eissn":"2450-4459","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"MINISTRY","editor":null,"documentHash":"9b7caaec-eb8e-43ed-9167-422086553e3d"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"661f76c84097075339a5360d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["661f76c84097075339a5360e","661f76c84097075339a5360f","661f76c84097075339a53610","5e709264878c28a047394d3f"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059554534","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"13-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/Zastosowanie-lekow-roslinnych-w-chorobach-ukladu-pokarmowego-stanowisko-ekspertow-Polskiego-Towarzystwa-Fitoterapii-STANFITO-Gastro-Czesc-I,98,52570,1,0.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"661f76c84097075339a53610","name":"J.","lastName":"Drobnik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b58982eb-fa83-4d4d-b28f-bdc0a891702f"},{"objectId":"661f76c84097075339a5360f","name":"G.","lastName":"Rydzewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ec7802ca-544c-4f08-abf4-8640ccca6725"},{"objectId":"661f76c84097075339a5360e","name":"M","lastName":"Krauze-Baranowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"55a6bebc-d8a4-406a-a7d5-07cd8109cd45"},{"objectId":"5e709264878c28a047394d3f","name":"ZBIGNIEW","lastName":"DONIEC","uuid":"01CE7F8EEF74B1CBC4C7EB91FA234777A4BAB83D0D8C203737666213F3023B14692258249F9FD81514538B5947AA8071B587749774ACED29C67E479B82200562","orcidId":"0000-0003-3896-1053","documentHash":"59bbdb97-f49f-46c6-b5f6-d6b020e5c664"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Rogówka - choroby","Diagnostyka"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Podstawowe patologie rogówki, cz.
