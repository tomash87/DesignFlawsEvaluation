We directly apply the general-relativistic hot flow model, KERRFLOW, to the archival BeppoSAX, NuSTAR, and Suzaku observations of these objects. Most of these data sets indicate that about 10–20 per cent of the accretion power is used for the direct heating of electrons; however, we find also indications for significant changes of the electron heating efficiency in some cases. Furthermore, all these X-ray data sets indicate rather strongly magnetized flows, with the magnetic field close to the equipartition with the gas pressure. Comparison of the model prediction with the Fermi/LAT data for NGC 7213 allows us to constrain the content of non-thermal protons to at most 10 per cent."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060194779","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"521","pagesFromTo":"2215-2224","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/521/2/2215/7074569","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65b0e0f440970719778d9159","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Wojaczyński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4136fe7f-c794-409a-a629-4fb3436467e6"},{"objectId":"5e70939e878c28a0473adda4","name":"Michał","lastName":"Szanecki","uuid":"03FA2494F26465DA3A764A488A627E9E532A61CF8930C792FB50D122944B59456D4E80BE60EA0D4E2B179ADB8A878385B5A9BEE549D2CD282282279CBE8E2075","orcidId":"0000-0001-7606-5925","documentHash":"beb9c53f-b472-4325-ae69-e22108c96c8a"},{"objectId":"5e709368878c28a0473a8df5","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Maciołek-Niedźwiecki","uuid":"B1FE2842839FD32EA4735F16D1074B1135DE9943146FD242B53546EC0B892692562906398F0901C840E735D4FE8347DC04E69CE63C989E97733E4979E65C8D84","orcidId":"0000-0002-8541-8849","documentHash":"86d2223c-bd3b-4aa6-8044-6c4a14e435ff"}],"doi":"10.1093/mnras/stad699"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["dojrzałość cyfrowa","otoczenie cyfrowe","big data","turystyka kulturowa"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["digital maturity","digital ecosystem","data tracking","cultural tourism"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3d","uid":"b2eiZUbb85g0FOaTA2KZtOw","uuid":"c7c10a2a-f381-4dc2-8511-53400ceb4a90","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3d","parentUuid":"c7c10a2a-f381-4dc2-8511-53400ceb4a90","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3d","rootUuid":"c7c10a2a-f381-4dc2-8511-53400ceb4a90","name":"Szkoła Główna Handlowa w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709265878c28a047394f53"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Koncepcja dojrzałości cyfrowej podmiotów rynku turystyki kulturowej","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d53878c28514547a620","mniswId":"485081","title":"Cultural Tourism Scientific Journal","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"1689-4642","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"7ffc8191-71ed-4d39-b0ac-2451721c0e7f"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"SEPTEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023,"releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":1},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65b81c154097073e10a569bd","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709265878c28a047394f53"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Pojęcie dojrzałości cyfrowej nie doczekało się jeszcze jednolitej definicji. Jeśli przyjąć, że termin ten określa adekwatną reakcję organizacji na zmiany zachodzące w otoczeniu cyfrowym, wdrażanie cyfrowych osiągnięć do procesów operacyjnych oraz rozwój kompetencji cyfrowych pracowników, to wydaje się możliwe i pożądane odniesienie tej definicji do podmiotów rynku turystyki kulturowej. Wymaga to operacjonalizacji definicji oraz sformułowania ram modelowych i narzędzi badawczych adekwatnych do charakteru działalności turystycznej. Zmiany zachodzące w obszarze kultury, nterpretacji dziedzictwa i kreowania wartości dla turysty kulturowego coraz częściej oparte są na rozwiązaniach cyfrowych. Sprzyjają im rosnące zasoby danych (big data) i postulowana ich otwartość (open data), wpływające na dynamikę rozwoju narzędzi zarządzania regionami/atrakcjami turystyki kulturowej i kreowania doświadczeń turystycznych. Przedmiotem artykułu jest sformułowanie definicji i ram pomiaru dojrzałości cyfrowej podmiotów rynku turystycznego oraz wskazanie obszarów wpływu cyfryzacji na jego zrównoważony rozwój. Na podstawie systemowego przeglądu literatury i wywiadów z przedstawicielami organizacji rynku turystycznego, opracowano formularz samooceny dojrzałości cyfrowej, adekwatny do charakteru działalności turystycznej."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060194788","journalIssue":{"objectId":"653b9f094097072fe528e041","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"3","number":"128","doi":null,"documentHash":"78727307-3cad-4ff9-9fe9-0da98a6899c9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://turystykakulturowa.org/ojs/index.php/tk/article/view/1422","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047394f53","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kachniewska","uuid":"7751F7A3B50FAF298AFE835C8580A07E5CC38D3FC653D4542C0F069C2611E7ECC1D49106D4C5E00F5D4EBB7BD78F98D64EAA77E0E45C858081C6456EFCB7C09F","orcidId":"0000-0003-3163-0868","documentHash":"d10a9af5-fb45-4474-862a-771d88e2a03f"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Public relations","ChatGPT","communication management","cybersecurity"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Commercially pure titanium grade 4 (TiG4) was subjected to a process of multi-rotational flat rolling (MRFR) that resulted in a refinement of the microstructure and an improvement in microhardness up to values comparable to those of the titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V. The biggest advantage of the MRFR processing performed was that it maintained the square cross-section of the titanium product, which gives the possibility of fabricating relatively large products with improved mechanical properties for biomedical applications. The objective of this research was to compare TiG4 after MRFR processing with TiG5 (Ti-6Al-4V) to assess the influence of the processing on the properties of pure titanium. The products obtained were characterized in microstructure and chemical composition, wettability, surface energy, roughness, and stiffness; by using light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy, contact angle measurements, optical profilometry, and atomic force microscopy. Bacterial and cell tests were conducted to consider the potential of the proposed methodology in biomedical applications. To this end, corrosion tests in Hank's solution were performed to simulate the conditions in the peri-implant environment."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060194833","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"970

Due to dynamic load changes, these receivers generate a number of disturbances that affect the quality of electric power. The most important disturbances include voltage fluctuations. It is also worth mentioning the asymmetry and deformation of the supply voltage curve. This article discusses the mutual interaction of receivers operating in parallel, operating stably, and devices with dynamic current consumption. Calculations based on model tests and the results of parameters characterizing the quality of energy, which were recorded in the line supplying the steelworks, are presented. The power supply conditions (power of the short-circuit network) were assessed to influence the degree of suppression of voltage fluctuations by loads with stable current consumption."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060194917","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/21/5360","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396b92","name":"ZBIGNIEW","lastName":"OLCZYKOWSKI","uuid":"46A5811FC0F3FBABA8993D10E3DD738DBC6FDDE94644C47EA89F665FB0379863B2D3ACFD459B7F57210234AC3502E76C095D23BB59BE7AB740EC5E4BE28C5538","orcidId":"0000-0003-4870-2485","documentHash":"0639c4c6-b25a-40fe-8948-42e144575c76"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17215360"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","parentUuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","rootUuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Efficient protection requires a vast repertoire of immune receptors, which is created by the V(D)J recombination process. There are multiple algorithms designed for the annotation of recombined T cell receptor (TR) sequences from traditional (short-read) RNA-Seq, however, none is adjusted for the long-read data. Here we intend to examine whether existing methods for TR sequences annotation using traditional RNA-Seq can be utilized for long-read sequencing data. ImReP, TRUST4, CATT and MiXCR algorithms were applied to data obtained by nanopore technology (PromethION). Adjustment of parameters was performed. The biggest number of CDR3 sequences was detected by the TRUST4 algorithm (20,599 unique TR sequences out of 73,904,478 total reads), representing 25% of the expected number of sequences. The distribution of annotated V and J genes was the same for MiXCR and TRUST4 algorithms and may be used to analyze the repertoire of V/J gene used in rearranged TR genes. Due to the high sequencing error rate of the analyzed sample (median read quality Q = 6.9), TR clonotype analysis is not suggested, and additional error correction steps are recommended for such analyses."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060197713","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"450-463","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67727b8efdbe831a387f9028","name":"Christophe","lastName":"Badie","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"de664174-a0df-4470-97ae-a5fcf4d9039a"},{"objectId":"67727b8efdbe831a387f9027","name":"Serge M.","lastName":"Candéias","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"af3a150b-da63-4c3e-ab99-c47bdaf7699a"},{"objectId":"5e709384878c28a0473abb32","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Mika","uuid":"684DD5DB1CA4622B47CEF2EFB07E15A899E3AE99CE04643E40B59D936EC39E1F2DA874302EB56D796FD05B541FE4F3A3515E17D513895EE9531AA7837DD7E84B","orcidId":"0000-0003-4615-784X","documentHash":"ab75ebcd-cd40-4106-8b42-a10b5c128488"},{"objectId":"5e709204878c28a04738eb73","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Polańska","uuid":"4BE2A95F8AAE2B7EF67C808E10C24DDCF8A1BFA65F690DF122E8E766045BF6279DF799881C846A3472C64CCBE9A58875B1D03C6A827F711DB301C5520F4E9208","orcidId":"0000-0001-8004-9864","documentHash":"900db5c0-bb73-456e-b8c3-cd7a4735324a"}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-07802-6_38"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["series resistance RS","temperature of photovoltaic system","operation of photovoltaic system","parallel resistance RP","open circuit voltage","V-A characteristic"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Each of these problems affects the operation of photovoltaic systems by reducing the power of the entire system. Some problems can be avoided during the design of photovoltaic systems. For example, when designing photovoltaic systems, it is possible to eliminate the shading of photovoltaic panels from surrounding objects. It is also necessary to look at the shading from neighboring photovoltaic panels when designing photovoltaic systems. It is necessary to calculate the inclination of the sunlight based on the position of the sun and calculate the distance between the two panels accordingly. However, some problems appear during the operation of photovoltaic systems. These problems can be partially eliminated. The magnitude of the series resistance can be eliminated by reducing the transition resistance throughout the system. The paper describes these problems and their possible solutions in practice. In the practical part, we focused on simulations and experiments in the field of photovoltaic systems (PV). The simulations focused on both the influence of temperature and the series resistance of photovoltaic panels on the production of electricity. The experiments were focused on the influence of various faults/defects on the power and V-A characteristics of photovoltaic panels connected in strings. The paper also discusses the impact of bypass diodes on the operation of photovoltaic systems and determines the need to use bypass diodes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060197720","journalIssue":{"objectId":"640976bc40970764f2f3701e","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"16","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"d514eaf3-4dc9-497b-8984-d1a7d5073dee"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/6/2576","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67728432fdbe831a3884161a","name":"Dušan","lastName":"Medved","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c1f9ab66-8ec2-4bc7-9ddf-ad8b03e4c8bb"},{"objectId":"67728432fdbe831a38841619","name":"Marek","lastName":"Pavlík","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a8243906-f962-4d72-bf0f-fc53ae6915c6"},{"objectId":"67728432fdbe831a38841618","name":"Michal","lastName":"Kolcun","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a9a20c07-cc1c-416f-82af-fe9659bb0be0"},{"objectId":"67728432fdbe831a38841617","name":"Zsolt","lastName":"Čonka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"664ce9c4-114a-4e22-84aa-53701d184f76"},{"objectId":"6512422940e3ff34f4c2fd54","name":"Lúbomir","lastName":"Beňa","uuid":"3EED34A806C9BD56462F05EF7EBB783BC6DD2D13CD37ECA00FEAA7306F9BD2426B99349CDCC9C51DD1ACBEFF6A1C9096D0DA315FA0384D1CF3360CB003FE7789","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"254ed4b8-5fca-4ca7-a3e3-4a0acdabb8e5"}],"doi":"10.3390/en16062576"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["the siege of Leningrad","literature for young people","fairy tale novel","graphic novel","individual memory","collective memory","postmemory"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922e878c28a047391503"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Pamięć, doświadczanie historii, literatura.

These are projects different in terms of genre and form, resulting from the sense of insufficiency of the methods used so far to talk about the blockade of Leningrad, going beyond the official discourse of historical politics. The works were created by the female representatives of the generation, for whom the reference point in writing about the siege is not the reality of their own biographical experience, but historical sources and the accounts of others. This connected the reflection on the content of the books with the issues of the functioning of individual memory, postmemory and collective memory.

Previous research on the processes of change in the energy sector highlight the necessity to implement business model innovations supported by digital transformation solutions. It is also clear that the process of implementation, particularly for SMEs, is associated with a high risk of failure. Based on research linking organisational culture and digitalisation, this article aims to explain how digital culture mediates the relationship between digital transformation and business model innovation in energy companies in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) countries.

article presents the Arab 'system' of human rights protection, centred around two acts: The Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam and the Arab Charter on Human Rights. Both documents are controversial in the Western world. Although the debate on whether human rights are universal or particularistic is not is new, two basic conclusions emerge from the analysis:1. there is a popular view among Middle Eastern countries, spread by Muslim jurists, that Islam was the basis for human rights and that the Prophet Muḥammad was their first promoter, thus human rights in Islam are obligatory rights by virtue of their divine origin and no human authority has the right to interfere with them; 2. therefore, any fundamental rights enshrined in international (UN and regional) treaties must be considered through the prism of Sharia. The article further discusses: The Arab Standing Committee on Human Rights), which is responsible for setting rules for cooperation between member states in the field of human rights; and the Arab League Human Rights Committee, established under Article 45 of the Arab Charter on Human Rights, and the unsuccessful attempt to establish an Arab Court of Human Rights. The conclusions summarise the findings and indicate that the Arab system of human rights protection is neither effective nor independent, and that the Arab world has a 'lesson to learn': to develop a complementary system of human rights protection and, moreover, to put these principles into practice. Whether there will be enough strength and resources and, above all, whether there will be a lack of political will to establish a system for the protection of human rights at all in a world where Islam is the dominant religion still remains unanswered."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060197754","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6661a9fb4097074fa1bd3769","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"4 (119)","doi":null,"documentHash":"bf09f92e-d765-42bf-8c60-c74a9e8bda92"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"4","pagesFromTo":"768 - 784","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://e-transformations.com/jeden_artykul_en.php?post-slug=archiwum_transformacje/2023/12/20231229105436343.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709277878c28a047396257","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Toumi","uuid":"BE99E58327DCDAA02598264E2583498A8E24A30B65C7DE8B8BA19EE62488410CDC28AD59639B1768830DB0C7494E1A0CF3BAC10AAD12F62015C6AFCE6683E9B9","orcidId":"0000-0003-3838-1315","documentHash":"f883644e-cca6-44f6-b1b2-42a66bc9982f"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-83-7908-274-2","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709231878c28a04739169d"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"MiroFor 2024.

book is an attempt at a monographic approach to the problem of the reception of 17th-century Dutch painting in modern literature. However, the author deals not only with contemporary works but also with the texts of 19th-century writers and critics, most often French, who shaped the so-called myth of the Dutch Golden Age. Readers learn the historically conditioned models of perception of 17th-century Dutch painting. The original achievement is the genre key, which is a consequence of the thesis on the mediation of the 20th-century reception of Dutch Golden Age painting in 19th-century European literature and art criticism. Contemporary writers are revising the concept of realism; they cannot talk about Vermeer’s View of Delft without referring to Proust’s petit pan de mur jaune. They read still lifes through Chardin and Cézanne or revive the myth of Rembrandt – a self-portraitist who analyzed himself. Also noteworthy is the section devoted to the little Dutch masters – Willem Dyster, Pieter de Hooch, Hendrick Avercamp, Hercules Seghers and Pieter Saenredam."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060197784","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":"2191-3293","series":"Polish Studies - Transdisciplinary Perspectives","translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb88f","mniswId":"47100","name":"Peter Lang Publishing Group","documentHash":"25640ebc-75c2-4776-b7ad-42f0cb589d89"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.doi.org/10.3726/b21486","numberInSeries":"44","authors":[{"objectId":"5e70938e878c28a0473acbc8","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Śniedziewska","uuid":"040EA8ECA2DD82FEF62A8A61DE8B813089D51048D3906868B7E25B30A9EDCCE5799C2307867E97D60E275F8DCAFDA9DF6309ED77B233A05756310271FB25DD3F","orcidId":"0000-0002-7390-5340","documentHash":"89ffa361-e838-4a3f-ac1f-bdbc6d78f6d4"}],"doi":"10.3726/b21486"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":"978-3-031-35172-3","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d0878c28a04739d3e5","5e709220878c28a0473903bc","5e709285878c28a047397390"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Advanced, contemporary control.

AstVs are stable in the environment, and their transmission is usually through the fecal–oral route or via contaminated water and food. Although direct zoonotic transmission was not confirmed, interspecies transmission events have occurred or have been indicated to occur in the past between wild and domestic animals and humans. They cause large economic losses, mainly in the poultry sector, due to gastroenteritis and mortality. In young children, they are the second most common cause of diarrhea. This study involved 166 intestine samples and pools of spleen, lymph node, and kidney samples collected from 352 wild animals, 52 pigs, and 31 companion animals. Astroviruses were detected in the intestine samples and were separately detected in pools of tissue samples prepared for individual animals using a heminested RT-PCR protocol. Amplicons were subjected to Sanger sequencing, and a phylogenetic analysis of 320 nt RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) fragments referring to known nt sequences of astroviruses was performed. Astroviral RNA was detected in the intestine samples and/or tissue pools of red foxes (nine positive intestines and six positive tissue pools), rats (two positive intestines and three positive tissue pools), a cat (one AstV detected in an intestine sample), pigs (eight positive tissue pools), and wild boars (two positive pools of spleens, kidneys, and lymph nodes). No astroviral RNA was detected in wild mustelids, dogs, or other small wild animals including rodents. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that the astroviruses detected during this study were mostly host-specific, such as porcine, canine, and rat astroviruses that were highly homologous to the sequences of reference strains. In one of two wild boars, an AstV distinct to porcine species was found with the highest nt identity to Avastroviruses, i.e., turkey astroviruses, which suggests potential cross-species transmission of the virus, as previously described. Here, we present the first detection of astroviruses in the population of wild animals, companion animals, and pigs in Poland, confirming that astroviruses are frequent pathogens circulating in animals in the field. Our study also suggests potential cross-species transmission of Avaastrovirus to wild boars; however, further molecular characterization is needed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060197797","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65a77aca4097071e0b852901","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"16","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"08b1f6fa-f27f-4a3f-8ae3-6ecf74fdadf2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"80","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/16/1/80/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65d7500140970704cae2c39d","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Kuczera","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"733c3c77-5883-41a3-a52c-12ed98adf308"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a660f","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Frant","uuid":"2AD73901C2B1BDDF66264197B4E2A40BB43C9F170B0D3D9252C79378D973DED6BA0DD7DB0E3F16FB50489E4717CA62BAE671805ED94AD0C5F9B3478EE3C561FE","orcidId":"0000-0002-7169-3735","documentHash":"b81b59e2-56af-4ed2-bfbe-bdf26cc5f824"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d5b","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Trębas","uuid":"885CCAC8AC667AF8F582B5915360E1D4F4E7323F2726CB9E438E293E06CD7E4408BBD732C34ED6B8FC5794227C0F8D2EEFD9D896825809D9265D1CF510497CF8","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"715908ba-b083-4b9d-8237-8eb5a6670919"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d46","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Smreczak","uuid":"F8B30A918C22AAD1AA7AE9C5D3FFDA47CF609511E7B465B3BCBAF192AC2D6E73CBFF8ADD21B9DEBE21AC0F4F803AD82290024E1D251CA1FB5298A962E7B5045D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0eb77885-82a5-455a-bf63-fa54b05c12cc"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d34","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Rola","uuid":"CA7CCA550D77B38C39C512D0BF1E1DD989B16A76C798CB003E76583649A413F1CC14D38A1D3A86639806ABD695B555AEFBBA4519ACEEB3448008E1F7F45415DE","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9968525a-6722-4aa3-9451-1d6ca31f42fa"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Orłowska","uuid":"31BF3815E53225FB0CCBD915D008C5800C01531C4DF23A9161299EACAECAACC43C5DEA5344E221B38BC386F46E015ADAD2196E2D56A8455B3D8E58853C8AB669","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"55bf4618-fd65-42f2-b46f-274ea3353e1c"}],"doi":"10.3390/v16010080"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","uid":"bt6mbuLY9Vpc_KWGkV1Lk4w","uuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709224878c28a047390934","5e709224878c28a047390923","5e7093d8878c28a0473b1d77"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The potential of utilizing cattle (cow) manure for biomethane production—an experiment for photofermentation","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1073","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-12-05","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6756c429fdbe8357172f94a9","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093d8878c28a0473b1d77","5e709224878c28a047390934","5e709224878c28a047390923","6772f871fdbe831a389ee56f","6772f871fdbe831a389ee570","6772f871fdbe831a389ee571","6772f871fdbe831a389ee572","6772f871fdbe831a389ee573","6772f871fdbe831a389ee574","6772f871fdbe831a389ee575","6772f871fdbe831a389ee576","6772f871fdbe831a389ee577","6772f871fdbe831a389ee578"]},"issue":"23","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article presents the current state of biogas (biomethane) production technology with an example of using cow manure from the perspective of photofermentation efficiency. In specialist farms, there is a problem of waste management in the form of manure; analyses were carried out on the photocatalysis process in order to be able to effectively produce biomethane based on monosubstrate solutions (manure). Cow manure was tested for its elemental composition in order to determine the suitability of this raw material for biogas production. The elemental composition was compared in material A, which was stored for 1 week (fresh sample, wet), and material B, which was stored for 1 month (old sample, dry). In material A and material B, the values were as follows: N: 3.18% and 3.34%; P: 0.403% and 0.492%; K: 1.267% and 2.336%; Na: 0.362% and 0.714%; Ca: 0.705% and 0.788%; and Mg: 0.737% and 0.907%. The quality of biogas produced in atmospheric conditions from cow manure (material A and material B) was assessed. An increase in CH4 production was observed with an increase in temperature. For material A, at a temperature of 22.5 °C, it was in the range of 11–14%; for a temperature of 25.5 °C, it was approx. 35%. For material B, despite small amounts (from 0% to 2%), a tendency to increase CH4 production with an increase in temperature was also observed. At 22.4 °C, it was in the range of 0–1%, and at 25.4 °C, it was about 2%. The novelty of this article is the development of an innovative method of using cow manure, indicating the development of the biomethane industry."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060197806","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"6119","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/23/6119","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6772f871fdbe831a389ee578","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Wałowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"38882877-01d1-4873-a80d-435721e43692"},{"objectId":"6772f871fdbe831a389ee577","name":"Serhii","lastName":"Korobka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8126a807-cfef-4684-af52-8efb09c380a7"},{"objectId":"6772f871fdbe831a389ee576","name":"Taras","lastName":"Stanytskyy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"53a5482b-a656-4323-bea4-3421e5d54254"},{"objectId":"6772f871fdbe831a389ee575","name":"Serhiy","lastName":"Syrotyuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"99fbbd48-e777-4a48-8c60-b69a5c0a0c0c"},{"objectId":"6772f871fdbe831a389ee574","name":"Jan","lastName":"Szymenderski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d64e9330-f6fa-49ae-af6a-9a51d1bd0c7c"},{"objectId":"6772f871fdbe831a389ee573","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Anders","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"114e5cb4-2cbb-47a6-9728-5f49412165d7"},{"objectId":"6772f871fdbe831a389ee572","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Dybek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2d7c9d17-d6a6-4048-afd3-d0bee9285088"},{"objectId":"6772f871fdbe831a389ee571","name":"Jakub T.","lastName":"Hołaj-Krzak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f24d0537-9cb9-47c7-b540-caaa51871d97"},{"objectId":"6772f871fdbe831a389ee570","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Borek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"28176006-0413-46bb-a55d-4e41c3506d10"},{"objectId":"6772f871fdbe831a389ee56f","name":"Anita","lastName":"Konieczna","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c47c3b55-a48e-4769-824c-c799df38c2a9"},{"objectId":"5e7093d8878c28a0473b1d77","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Klimek","uuid":"4E0611FBFAAC9896E351D9C29966B126BCC2AE0888E95135B0C423502CC7EB7E65D6CE6BA9C1BB7693A0E36B0D366D18D1254081FB294BF3CF15BDCE4733D9EE","orcidId":"0000-0001-6638-894X","documentHash":"1338b896-b663-42cd-bed6-08146c78a44b"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390934","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kapłan","uuid":"090223E35558918E88AE250A165AE5FC0DCC5A422C06C7C985CEE53074BC570E3778C13B08452D04AC10051527739D0399365739042664083894B3AFBD47D954","orcidId":"0000-0002-3833-9275","documentHash":"547354a0-1a08-46b8-97ae-35b415cad1c5"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390923","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Jarosz","uuid":"AC5072489FB3F6B23E8001FF2BB5E0599296E435E8EE1F819066E6844543AD7D81CAB0B580D532FCC8A103E1482CB78C542CE6BC6E03B0D70CEFC60C94E727BB","orcidId":"0000-0002-1561-4457","documentHash":"6d234a63-42f2-4ec6-a5a1-19c204d823d7"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17236119"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Pesticide residues","Pollen","Bumblebees","Bees","Risk assessment","Pesticide exposure"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709486878c28a0473bef2a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Application of 3D-printed pollen traps as a useful tool for exposure and risk assessment of pesticide residues on bumblebees","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775f8","mniswId":"3525","title":"CHEMOSPHERE","doi":null,"issn":"0045-6535","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"ca7a4227-9b2a-46cb-a2a2-53056fa5e040"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65d85d3a4097071e545e90d1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709486878c28a0473bef2a"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The study was designed to test the feasibility of using 3D-printed pollen traps for long-term monitoring of Bombus terrestris colonies' exposure to pesticide residues in pollen loads collected by them, along with an assessment of the resulting risks to the bumblebee's adults, larvae, and queens. Bumblebee colonies were placed in the vicinity of flowering orchards, winter oilseed rape, allotments, or home gardens for 6 weeks of the experiment. Pollen traps printed in 3D technology were installed in the hive inlets. The weight of bumblebee pollen loads obtained using pollen traps was in the range of 0.036–5.83 g. Pollen load samples were analyzed for residues of up to 261 pesticides and their metabolites by liquid and gas chromatography techniques coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS). Residues of 18 fungicides, 12 herbicides, 6 insecticides, and an acaricide were detected. Herbicide – pendimethalin, fungicide – thiophanate-methyl, and insecticide – chlorpyrifos-ethyl were the most commonly detected pesticides. Chlorpyrifos and thiacloprid residues were detected in pollen load samples in the next year after their ban from use as plant protection products in the European Union. The risk of acute or chronic effects was assessed as negligible or low, although the chronic risk of bumblebee queens to insecticide chlorpyrifos and the acute risk of larvae exposed to acaricide fenpyroximate could be interpreted as moderate. The risk of sublethal effects related to chronic exposure of adult bumblebees and queens to pollen loads contaminated by chlorpyrifos-ethyl and cypermethrin cannot be excluded. The risk of chronic toxicity or sublethal effects may be particularly relevant for bumblebee queens, especially during their foraging in the initial period of establishing a new colony."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060197810","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65d483e54097074f2860d72f","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"348","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"98e3ca31-52a1-411a-8058-8d9d81ee2950"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"348","pagesFromTo":"140748","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0045653523030187?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709486878c28a0473bef2a","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kiljanek","uuid":"7B8EE9A0E65E07520912836B1EE79CA197A21E4DC1CD1DF337A2F539C881566E8B7ED89405D31A6EE523CE4147368897A0A0017AD0DF9642E78CCFE22BEB224A","orcidId":"0000-0001-7222-0983","documentHash":"15e05adf-9642-4726-8587-72bd29897624"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.140748"},{"mainLanguageName":null,"keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Tom pokonferencyjny","affiliations":[],"type":"PROCEEDINGS","title":"39th International Business Information Management Computer Science Conference (IBIMA), 30-31 May 2022, Granada, Spain","mainLanguage":null,"journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65f97226409707626368ed4f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":null,"mniswId":null,"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"fullName":"International Business Information Management","shortName":"IBIMA","city":null,"country":null,"website":null,"isEdition":false,"documentHash":"6029aca7-ff4d-42fd-9ba3-6932a546725d"},"contributionOrder":{},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060197811","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":null,"mniswId":null,"startDate":"2022-05-30","endDate":"2022-05-31","fullName":"39th International Business Information Management Computer Science Conference","shortName":"IBIMA","city":"Granada","country":"ES","website":"https://dona.pwr.edu.pl/szukaj/default.aspx?nrsys=244379","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"14cec227-4910-4fef-9fa8-2a79f02dd5aa"},"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","uid":"bt6mbuLY9Vpc_KWGkV1Lk4w","uuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["615fad2875234017e0505e62"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Spirulina—an invaluable source of macro- and micronutrients with broad biological activity and application potential","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":null,"issn":"1420-3049","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"85ea3d3d-2670-4384-98ee-1b5b44edab21"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-11-15","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67404995fdbe832d853a499f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["615fad2875234017e0505e62"]},"issue":"22","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"With population growth expected in the near future and the planet’s limited resources, alternative food sources are already being looked for. In this context, spirulina is called the food of the future due to its rich nutritional composition. This blue–green alga is primarily a valuable source of protein (55–70%) containing all essential amino acids. In its composition, it also contains unsaturated fatty acids, minerals, vitamins, and pigments, including the valuable protein–pigment complex—phycocyanin. Due to its high content of complete protein and minerals such as iron and calcium, it is an excellent addition to diets, especially those of vegans and vegetarians. Despite several limitations to the use of spirulina, including its distinctive marine flavour, low consumer awareness, or relatively high price, scientists are attempting to enrich many food products with the microalga. This is supported not only by the improved nutritional composition of the fortified product but also by spirulina’s impact on sustainable food production. Therefore, this review aims to create consumer attention by presenting spirulina as a valuable and sustainable food source with health-promoting potential and great future significance."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060197813","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"5387","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/29/22/5387","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"615fad2875234017e0505e62","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Podgórska-Kryszczuk","uuid":"4000C016DF66C3E15DBD549308FF7934C1AEA110C64966A61507D9F47B806D787EB95A05BEE6F625F90151D6A88E4BED6CCE166551C0A58D784045F2BAD71374","orcidId":"0000-0001-7250-9357","documentHash":"6095df2e-ac40-4fd6-a97b-c54fc2d734b1"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules29225387"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bovine leukaemia virus (BLV)","extracellular vesicles","exosomal markers"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cad","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4f","5e709437878c28a0473b83ce"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Extracellular vesicles in cattle infected with bovine leukaemia virus: isolation and molecular analysis","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research","doi":null,"issn":"2450-7393","eissn":"2450-7393","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"33675167-d910-4a5c-a5d1-cd68fbd86b10"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"MAY","releaseDateYear":2024,"releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":1},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67124081fdbe836b555ec6ec","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d4f","5e709437878c28a0473b83ce","5e709342878c28a0473a5cad"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Exosomes are nanosized lipid bilayer membranous microvesicles, extracellularly released from a variety of mammalian cells. They mediate intercellular signalling by transporting several types of RNA, lipids and proteins and participate in the intercellular exchange of DNA, RNA, micro RNA, proteins and other components. These microvesicles are present in all body fluids in physiological and pathological conditions and reflect the state of the host organism. The aim of the study was the isolation and molecular determination of exosomes in blood and supernatant fluids of bovine dendritic cell cultures infected with bovine leukaemia virus (BLV). Material and Methods: Exosomes were isolated by ultracentrifugation from the blood sera, plasma and supernatant of bovine BLV-infected and uninfected control dendritic cell cultures and their presence was confirmed with scanning electron and transmission electron microscopy. Western blot analysis of the structural BLV glycoprotein 51 (Env) and protein 24 (Gag) and of the tetraspanin exosomal markers CD9, CD63 and flotillin-1 was undertaken in BLV+ and control BLV− cattle. Results: In exosomes of leukaemic cattle both BLV proteins and exosomal markers were detected. In healthy control animals only exosomal markers were determined. Conclusion: Proteins of BLV were released with exosomes and could be transferred into recipient cells as an alternative propagation route not requiring virus infection."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060197814","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"68","pagesFromTo":"189-198","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2024-0031","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709437878c28a0473b83ce","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Wasiak","uuid":"A60741B2F6C44684B8210C6BD88CE38D65085F1FEA69C024C4C683AD43FB6C5E3603FFD8A7EA6613888E258108EABBC0F2F5DA5B9D13E30D9BFCFA81627948F0","orcidId":"0000-0002-2279-5460","documentHash":"afe435e4-1c3d-46e2-8a2a-f6b817d9bd81"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d4f","name":"Maria","lastName":"Szczotka","uuid":"ADF16A0DC33C7E23F46E1C620BBE349C2AB6A18A9C9909107A228536F5F1742277D154D2DCD82C6537D2A8632E5C4391955675EADA516AAA2CDFD89BA5D564C5","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ebfccb1f-95d9-4d87-86f7-3bbcd1ac8dd1"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cad","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Kuźmak","uuid":"DCBC0C5773B0C346D5DBB40E3262D8E29184B62793C0D18E82B24E595E4F33FDCB74C41AEC4D6B60F253051482EC522138B936B5ED82B4345F33391A0BD19DAB","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b123658e-4d9a-4155-9ddf-df23aa13556a"}],"doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2024-0031"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["zespół","klasyczny klasyfikator","głęboka sieć neuronowa","wyszukiwanie informacji muzycznych","optymalizacja","algorytm ewolucji"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ensembles","classical classifier","deep neural network","music information retrieval","optimization","evolution algorithm"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6772965ffdbe831a38880839","5e709415878c28a0473b5e7c","6772965ffdbe831a3888083a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Evolvable hybrid ensembles for musical genre classification","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65bba0654097076263f9ca37","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c287715741752","mniswId":"556","startDate":null,"endDate":null,"fullName":"Genetic and Evolutionary Computations","shortName":"GECCO","city":null,"country":null,"website":null,"isEdition":false,"documentHash":"f104af8e-6c0a-4811-ab8c-38df263a5dd2"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709415878c28a0473b5e7c","6772965ffdbe831a38880839","6772965ffdbe831a3888083a"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The possibility of classifying musical songs according to their musical genre is becoming more challenging because of the millions of songs included in online databases.

Transforming gene levels to explainable pathways via single-sample enrichment algorithms is a leading analysis step in understanding cell heterogeneity. In this study, eight different single-sample methods were investigated and accompanied by gene level outcomes as reference. For all, their ability to cell separation and clustering accuracy was tested. For this purpose, six scRNA-Seq datasets with labelled cells and their various numbers were collected. PLAGE method shows the best cell separation with statistically significant differences to gene level and to six other tested methods. The clustering accuracy analysis also indicates that PLAGE is the leading technique in single-sample enrichment methods in scRNA-Seq.

The non-parametric analysis (Kruskal-Wallis test) was performed to determine if there were statistically significant differences between the level of work engagement and the level of organisational engagement of employees across four different generation groups. The multi-group SEM analysis was used for testing the differences in the impact of work engagement of different generations on organisational engagement. The study confirmed the hypothesis that work engagement has a positive impact on organisational engagement for all generations. Moreover, statistically significant differences were found between the level of work engagement and the level of organisational engagement across generations. This study expands current knowledge on the interrelationship between work engagement and organisational engagement. Further, the level of work engagement and organisational engagement revealed in the context of generations makes for a novel contribution to the topic of employees’ engagement in the perspective of

Emotions and stress affect voice production. There are only a few reports in the literature on how changes in the autonomic nervous system affect voice production. The aim of this study was to examine emotions and measure stress reactions during a voice examination procedure, particularly changes in the muscles surrounding the larynx. Material and Methods: The study material included 50 healthy volunteers (26 voice workers – opera singers, 24 control subjects), all without vocal complaints. All subjects had good voice quality in a perceptual assessment. The research procedure consisted of 4 parts: an ear, nose, and throat (ENT)‑phoniatric examination, surface electromyography, recording physiological indicators (heart rate and skin resistance) using a wearable wristband, and a psychological profile based on questionnaires. Results: The results of the study demonstrated that there was a relationship between positive and negative emotions and stress reactions related to the voice examination procedure, as well as to the tone of the vocal tract muscles. There were significant correlations between measures describing the intensity of experienced emotions and vocal tract muscle maximum amplitude of the cricothyroid (CT) and sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscles during phonation and non-phonation tasks. Subjects experiencing eustress (favorable stress response) had increased amplitude of submandibular and CT at rest and phonation. Subjects with high levels of negative emotions, revealed positive correlations with SCM max during the glissando. The perception of positive and negative emotions caused different responses not only in the vocal tract but also in the vegetative system. Correlations were found between emotions and physiological parameters, most markedly in heart rate variability. A higher incidence of extreme emotions was observed in the professional group. Conclusions The activity of the vocal tract muscles depends on the type and intensity of the emotions and stress reactions. The perception of positive and negative emotions causes different responses in the vegetative system and the vocal tract.

In the interwar period, Jan Emil Skiwski gained recognition as an outstanding literary critic. While the Nazis occupied Poland during World War II, as one of the few writers with ideological motives, he collaborated with the Germans, supporting their propaganda activities, including in the magazine “Przełom”. His attitude was met with general condemnation. After the war, the writer chose to emigrate, hiding behind a changed name, especially given that in communist Poland, he was sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment and loss of public rights. An interesting episode in his post-war biography is the friendship he developed with the German intellectual Jürgen Rausch during his stay in the Allied camp for prisoners of war in Italy.

The study aimed to check the errors of synchronisation and physiological response as a reaction of the subjects to metrorhythmic stimuli of synchronous and pseudosynchronous stimulation (synchronisation with an externally controlled rhythm, but in reality controlled or produced tone by tapping) Nineteen subjects without diagnosed motor disorders participated in the study. Two tests were performed, where the electromyography signal and reaction time were recorded using the NORAXON system. In addition, physiological signals such as electrodermal activity and blood volume pulse were measured using the Empatica E4. Study 1 consisted of adapting the finger tapping test in pseudosynchrony with a given metrorhythmic stimulus with a selection of preferred, choices of decreasing and increasing tempo. Study 2 consisted of metrorhythmic synchronisation during the heel stomping test. Numerous correlations and statistically significant parameters were found between the response of the subjects with respect to their musical education, musical and sports activities. Most of the differentiating characteristics shown evidence of some group division in the undertaking of musical activities. The use of detailed analyses of synchronisation errors can contribute to the development of methods to improve the rehabilitation process of subjects with motor dysfunction, and this will contribute to the development of an expert system that considers personalised musical

Thus, we have ranged the needs of combatants and concluded that the need to launch (or revive) own business is one of the really urgent ones. The entrepreneurial intentions of veterans are derived from social factors rather than financial reasons. Besides, they are related to unsatisfied needs in employment.

Nigdy nie można było mieć pewności, co stanie się choćby już za moment, ponieważ liczba niespodziewanych zwrotów akcji często przekraczała wszelkie życiowe prawdopodobieństwo. W tym tkwił jednak cały urok opowieści. <em>Historia Apoloniusza</em> zmodyfikowała ten wzorzec w znacznym stopniu, stawiając w centrum nie skromną zakochaną parę, a kilka rodzin, i to borykających się z dramatycznymi problemami, m.in. takimi jak kazirodcze popędy. Mroczny motyw z pewnością musiał przyciągać, ale powieść nie bazowała w żadnym wypadku na taniej sensacji. Nadzieja na zwycięstwo nad złem, humor i… kultura, która pozwoliła bohaterom przetrwać w nieprzyjaznym świecie, rozświetlały skomplikowane losy protagonistów i czyniły całe dzieło czymś więcej niż prostą historyjką dla spragnionych dreszczyku emocji\"."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060197891","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":"lat","editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":true,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb945","mniswId":"72500","name":"Wydawnictwo Naukowe Sub Lupa","documentHash":"7a75ed26-fbe4-4b8e-851a-aebc7013612c"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://sublupa.pl/pl/p/Historia-Apoloniusza-Krola-Tyru.-Ebook/437","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65de13574097076263d48515","name":"nieznany","lastName":"Autor","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5f0447f1-76cf-4b70-9c67-1d9a58a85d2b"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19","body mass analysis","maximal oxygen uptake","spiroergometry","long COVID"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","uid":"bOlskFaUnfFKSoLmo2Ab3kg","uuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","parentUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded1","rootUuid":"cc8219cc-e356-4b83-9197-f83de5089227","name":"Instytut \"Centrum Zdrowia Matki Polki\"","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e2878c28a04739ea8c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Predictors of Long-COVID and Chronic Impairment of Exercise Tolerance in Spiroergometry in Patients after 15 Months of COVID-19 Recovery","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c754","mniswId":"10517","title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2077-0383","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"11fb906d-8d54-4e42-be05-fb426fe7219b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-14","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67375269fdbe832d85b0e757","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092e2878c28a04739eaaf","67408764fdbe832d853b8813","5e7092e0878c28a04739e960","5e7092e2878c28a04739ea8c"]},"issue":"24","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: The aim of the study was to identify factors that may cause the presence of long COVID and to assess factors that affect chronic limited exercise tolerance in spiroergometry after one-year follow-up in patients who had recovered from COVID-19. Methods: Of 146 patients hospitalised in the Cardiology Department, 82 completed a one-year follow-up (at least 15 months post-COVID-19 recovery). We compared their conditions at initial screening and follow-up to analyse the course of long COVID and exercise intolerance mechanisms. Clinical examinations, laboratory tests, echocardiography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing, and body composition analysis were performed. Results: The patients, after one-year follow-up, had significantly higher levels of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT) (p = 0.03), left atrium diameter (LA) (p = 0.03), respiratory exchange ratio (RER) (p = 0.008), and total body water content percentage (TBW%) (p < 0.0001) compared to the 3-month assessment. They also had lower forced vital capacity in litres (FVC) (p = 0.02) and percentage (FVC%) (p = 0.001). The factors independently associated with a decline in maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) after one-year follow-up included the percentage of fat (OR 2.16, 95% CI: 0.51–0.77; p = 0.03), end-diastolic volume (EDV) (OR 2.38, 95% CI 0.53–0.78; p = 0.02), and end-systolic volume (ESV) (OR 2.3, 95% CI: 0.52–0.78; p = 0.02).

By means of the classical Lyapunov method, a new sufficient condition for exponential stability of our proposed population model through non-fragile control and impulsive biological control is established.

Johnson’s <em>The Unfortunates</em> (1969) and Anne Carson’s <em>Nox </em>(2010) are among the most formally inventive and materially unique literary responses to personal loss. The first novel-in-a-box in English literature, <em>The Unfortunates</em> is a poignant account of the premature death of Johnson’s best friend Tony Tillinghast. Also contained in a box, Carson’s elegy is printed on a 25-metre-long concertinaed scroll, which contains a collage of textual and visual fragments of various artefacts connected with Carson’s dead brother.</p>\r\n<p>This article considers the implications of certain visual and tactile properties of both works for their representation of loss and the work of mourning, as theorized by Sigmund Freud and Jacques Derrida. It argues that both the card-shuffle structure and the scroll format accentuate the ongoingness of mourning and convey scepticism about the possibility of any closure. The article also examines the significance of encasing the contents of both elegies in coffin-like boxes and the importance of their extensive use of fragmentation. </p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060197924","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"129-143","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.4467/20843933ST.23.014.18184","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093c2878c28a0473b05ab","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Drąg","uuid":"7FD46650127A7130389DEF70FE9585E4D92D153A78B0417A7DA0CFA069A680F160560FCFFA783FB16E7F8B5C03A64BF6CAF568C59F664A01EC5DD1A51A9EDE74","orcidId":"0000-0002-9089-2465","documentHash":"4b12a45d-f049-447f-bce1-25935b78060f"}],"doi":"10.4467/20843933st.23.014.18184"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["European Capital of Culture 2016","cultural participation","cultural attendance","evaluation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922e878c28a047391359","5e70922e878c28a0473914bb","5e709231878c28a047391692","5e7093c2878c28a0473b053e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Stability and change in patterns of cultural participation in the events of the European Capital of Culture Wrocław 2016","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478cd2","mniswId":"13586","title":"Leisure Studies","doi":null,"issn":"0261-4367","eissn":"1466-4496","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"15a6e94b-a667-4ee5-b43c-442c6f722455"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"638751c4409707771678f54d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922e878c28a0473914bb","5e70922e878c28a047391359","5e7093c2878c28a0473b053e","5e709231878c28a047391692"]},"issue":"6","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study analyses the extent to which the exposure to cultural events of the European Capital of Culture Wrocław 2016 resulted in more inclusive participation in culture. Drawing from the data from a representative survey of city and region inhabitants (N = 1000) , we examine the impact of the pre-existing habits of cultural participation on engagement in events offered during ECOC 2016. Relationships between the cultural habits of participants, their socio-demographic characteristics, and attendance at ECOC events divided into four categories (mass, ludic, artistic, niche) are analysed. The study indicates the role of the cultural habits preceding participation in ECOC as a determinant of involvement in cultural events. We found that people oriented towards cultural participation were more likely to attend diverse ECOC events. For people culturally oriented to leisure at home, a massive and diverse cultural offer was not enough to expand their interest beyond mass and ludic events. We conclude that – contrary to ECOC values emphasising egalitarianism and open access to culture and contrary to cultural policy goals aimed at broadening cultural participation – ECOC 2016 was a selective event, which can be considered more broadly as a foreseeable failure in achieving the cultural policy aims underlying ECOCs."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060197940","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"41","pagesFromTo":"847-861","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02614367.2022.2066712","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093c2878c28a0473b053e","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Banaszak","uuid":"6F11DD95403DF7BEA9AAD410B148475E7EE8CB2A443362C973F60BFE904885599C9BB715653B2878DCCC71A2CFC57384FA192FFB67FD50C5455F02667CDA2978","orcidId":"0000-0002-9733-0166","documentHash":"42a44706-01bd-444f-a148-f3d3926b0e2f"},{"objectId":"5e709231878c28a047391692","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Pluta","uuid":"D2DE18A9760EB5980BFDCBB06FB5531FF16B6B9D06E3055FB0A8E298C417B316C4567567F145C258728862B41944A90688CA1D82436F83229AA1DCAFDCE6AED4","orcidId":"0000-0003-2173-7469","documentHash":"79368b88-0581-44b7-a898-5f4cfa7c590a"},{"objectId":"5e70922e878c28a0473914bb","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kajdanek","uuid":"F22EC42CFF307AFA2307819B4941684F753F1951197C6806C548A9D9573CCDB0D9D8DEAD6C616F51846E5A1D3FD070B19C1DF1E9E0EDEC264A7F9813C909E35E","orcidId":"0000-0003-4264-0842","documentHash":"215f73f4-6c9e-4e79-8b04-315bbd88f4ab"},{"objectId":"5e70922e878c28a047391359","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Błaszczyk","uuid":"280AD130FC61488C5F9CEB0B853AF28A69742CFB51E64404959CC127723E8DD982D667E779F55A7B9B58D2B29ADF07A4597831603BF8FAC65DF98A2BB28CE0B8","orcidId":"0000-0002-5778-2723","documentHash":"99bff63f-5645-4d60-8750-91a05a7441b6"}],"doi":"10.1080/02614367.2022.2066712"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ERA5","GNSS","GNSS tomography","Radio occultations"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af7da"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Application of integrated GNSS tomography in observation study over the area of southern Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476edd","mniswId":"542","title":"Advances in Space Research","doi":null,"issn":"0273-1177","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"8ca0258d-c418-4548-8427-13ed4866a947"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-07-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6752ec65fdbe835717f15bcc","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6752ec65fdbe835717f15bcd","6752ec65fdbe835717f15bce","6752ec65fdbe835717f15bcf","5e7093b5878c28a0473af7da","6752ec65fdbe835717f15bd0"]},"issue":"8","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Despite the growing number of GNSS sites, GNSS meteorology still suffers from insufficient observational data. This deficiency is particularly evident in GNSS tomography processing in the lowermost part of the troposphere, where the highest variability of weather conditions is observed. To address this challenge, we propose an integrated tomography solution that uses both ground-based GNSS observations and radio occultation (RO) excess phase in the same tomography model. Our integrated approach benefits from improved geometry and increased number of observations. In order to verify presented methodology, we use 41 GNSS stations and 78 RO profiles gathered during four different high precipitation events over the region of southern Poland. The results are validated against radiosonde observations and WRF reanalysis. Our study indicates an enhancement in the representation of wet refractivity on the order of 20 to 30% RMSE decrease when RO are integrated into the tomography solution with the mean error of final integrated product equal 3.5 ppm."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060197942","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"74","pagesFromTo":"3654-3667","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.asr.2024.07.059","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6752ec65fdbe835717f15bd0","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Taszarek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f7aa582e-1072-4310-b5b0-7d5611a42fda"},{"objectId":"6752ec65fdbe835717f15bcf","name":"Witold","lastName":"Rohm","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"76082214-c60a-4ab6-bf1e-0e10af8cbea5"},{"objectId":"6752ec65fdbe835717f15bce","name":"Gregor","lastName":"Moeller","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"06b0d1e8-8ac3-4a54-93b4-f53503462939"},{"objectId":"6752ec65fdbe835717f15bcd","name":"Adam","lastName":"Cegła","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9f6c8020-05f5-4480-9c92-a1b823c5fc5c"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af7da","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Kryza","uuid":"B833CD302DA14D6ECA9653B2A163939596AD91495EF68D8625D7D9095DCCF50120739A7DE52627A88641CCAC52C1ECA86C0A0BCDCDD734E020AF37E900B2C1C1","orcidId":"0000-0003-0873-7560","documentHash":"37b97cfb-80ec-43f7-949d-ff9e46190906"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.asr.2024.07.059"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["energy transition and diversification","sustainable development goals","digital financial inclusion","COP26"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The SDGs include objectives related to sustainable energy consumption, the availability of sustainable energy, economic growth, sustainable development through technology, and climate change actions. This research employs novel econometric panel quantile regression and ordinary least square methods for benchmark estimations and pooled mean group for causality analysis. The empirical results indicate that energy transition and diversification, technological innovation, and foreign direct investment negatively correlate with CO2 emissions across all quantiles. Conversely, digital finance inclusion, energy consumption, and economic growth are the primary contributors to the environmental deterioration in the E-7 region. The PMG causality findings demonstrate a feedback effect for the indicators. Furthermore, our results are robust to alternative measures by Augmented Mean Group (AMG) and Common Correlated Effect Mean Group (CCEMG), which may assist policymakers in developing long- and short-term environmental protection initiatives. Based on the outcomes, we suggest that strategies to reduce carbon emissions and achieve the SDGs and COP26 targets should prioritize sustainable energy, and policymakers should enhance incentives for inclusive green funding. The findings recommend a comprehensive policy framework through which E-7 states may proceed toward reaching the SDGs (7-8-9-11-12 and 13) and COP26

We have used standard consecutive pre-whitening technique in some cases followed by time-dependent pre-whitening. We report new candidates for double-mode radial pulsations. However, majority of signals we have detected cannot be interpreted in terms of radial modes. We report 516 double-periodic stars with period ratios, P<SUB>x</SUB>/P<SUB>1O</SUB>, in the range 0.60-0.65. We study the properties of this class and implications for model explaining these periodicities. We also report 28 stars in which additional variability is of longer period, below radial fundamental mode, with median period ratio, P<SUB>1O</SUB>/P<SUB>x</SUB>, of 0.684. This class is an analogue of a class known in RR Lyrae stars. Hundreds of other signals were detected that cannot be attributed to radial modes or the above-mentioned classes. Statistical properties of these signals are analysed. We suggest that majority of these signals correspond to non-radial modes. In particular, a significant fraction can be attributed to non-radial modes of moderate degrees, tightly connected to a class with period ratios in between 0.60 and 0.65. In tens of stars, close to radial mode frequency, relatively large-amplitude and coherent signals are observed, which may represent yet another class. In 27 stars periodic modulation of pulsation was detected. Differences in additional frequency content between the two Clouds are discussed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060197952","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"519","pagesFromTo":"4010","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.519.4010S","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67653b95fdbe837ab154f83b","name":"M.","lastName":"Śniegowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f36ac532-4f4e-48ec-b16e-e3eb667cd20b"},{"objectId":"67653b95fdbe837ab154f83a","name":"M.","lastName":"Ochalik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"14a0e3d8-cee2-4c6a-9675-fdc459a8c229"},{"objectId":"60c2fce69543c72336543471","name":"Oliwia","lastName":"Ziółkowska","uuid":"6117E0CCDCA93E1AA292D1F98170746640F2DBA543F40FCDA6A85B097F948E9B6C16887D91D1F591C83F7613ECEDEC5D5D332A0E14D6E01A6ECED7DE65C75695","orcidId":"0000-0002-0696-2839","documentHash":"e5956653-69b0-4f47-84cb-1b2377eaad4c"},{"objectId":"5e70935e878c28a0473a8455","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Smolec","uuid":"8D4E270E106FDE818D22FDC2102FABCF3AEBE0019A1FA724ED774DCBB3F837619F205B124DD62FB1C89AEB7AB8FC05B9A1B481754383826018AD3B3AAF592DEA","orcidId":"0000-0001-7217-4884","documentHash":"61ad2765-08b5-4e6e-87a5-4276bcb4c063"}],"doi":"10.1093/mnras/stac3706"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","uid":"bt6mbuLY9Vpc_KWGkV1Lk4w","uuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709227878c28a047390afb","6773050ffdbe831a389f0099","5e709225878c28a047390ab9"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The impact of suspension fertilizers based on waste phosphorus salts from polyol production on the content of macronutrients in maize grown for green fodder","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d9","mniswId":"689","title":"Agronomy","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2073-4395","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ecde59b8-e697-42b5-b3f5-ad846db663c6"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-11-11","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67404950fdbe832d853a3757","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709225878c28a047390ab9","5e709227878c28a047390afb","6773050ffdbe831a389f0099"]},"issue":"9","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Mineral phosphorus is a non-renewable resource that is constantly decreasing due to intensive fertilizer production. In total, 90% of mined phosphate ore is used for fertilizer purposes, so the demand for phosphorus is the highest in this sector. In this respect, it is advisable to strive to close the phosphorus cycle. In addition, economically viable phosphate-bearing deposits are concentrated in just a few locations worldwide. This comes down to the fact that most countries are simply dependent on imports of this raw material. This and the growing amount of waste have contributed to the search for alternative sources of phosphorus. One example of such phosphorus-containing waste that has fertilizer potential is sodium–potassium phosphate waste from polyol production. This article describes the effect of suspension fertilizers based on polyol production waste on the content of macronutrients in maize intended for green fodder. Fertilizers containing only basic nutrients (NPK) and fertilizers enriched with secondary components (S, Mg) and micronutrients (Zn, Mn, B) were evaluated. The conducted studies confirmed the effectiveness of the tested suspension fertilizers. The content of macronutrients in the dry mass of maize was at a similar level compared with the results obtained in the control, in which Fosdar was used for fertilization, which confirms the suitability of these products for agricultural use."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060197957","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"2079","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/14/9/2079","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6773050ffdbe831a389f0099","name":"Paulina Elżbieta","lastName":"Bogusz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"acd8c59e-79cb-4858-983f-ccf2e03c801c"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390afb","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Muszyński","uuid":"905DD532899F669244C3FD62361EDB115D6CBC5997696B9020E366DBE97946B15797EAAB600E7FB44360000FDFE315F5CBBF87119D55E9361CC4B452FAE08A92","orcidId":"0000-0001-5514-0623","documentHash":"a484744b-13b8-46ba-85bd-64d927e38e9c"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a047390ab9","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Brodowska","uuid":"248E71123FC2B87DDA532347E605491DD4EAFA546C12FD003E449F0422D9172BCEBA7468933F1D8883D74FACF5FBFDDD5BEBEFB72C6ABDFDA6B171DE10C34983","orcidId":"0000-0002-3049-4975","documentHash":"b4905aaf-232e-4d02-ad63-efb84169dd49"}],"doi":"10.3390/agronomy14092079"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["siatkówka","diagnostyka medyczna","Angio-OTC","aktywne konturowanie"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["retina","medical diagnostics","Angio-OTC","active contouring"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65b0f9f140970719778e9319","doi":null,"title":"Automatyzacja procesów dyskretnych.

emergence of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought forth various clinical manifestations and long-term complications, including a condition known as long COVID. Long COVID refers to a persistent set of symptoms that continue beyond the acute phase of the disease. This study investigated the risk factors and the utility of spiroergometry parameters for diagnosing patients with long COVID symptoms. The 146 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with normal left ventricular ejection fraction and without respiratory diseases were included and divided into two groups: the group demonstrating long COVID symptoms [n = 44] and the group without long COVID symptoms [n = 102]. The clinical examinations, laboratory test results, echocardiography, non-invasive body mass analysis, and spiroergometry were evaluated. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04828629. Patients with long COVID symptoms had significantly higher age [58 (vs.) 44 years; p < 0.0001], metabolic age [53 vs. 45 years; p = 0.02)], left atrial diameter (LA) [37 vs. 35 mm; p = 0.04], left ventricular mass index (LVMI) [83 vs. 74 g/m2, p = 0.04], left diastolic filling velocity (A) [69 vs. 64 cm/s, p = 0.01], the ratio of peak velocity of early diastolic transmitral flow to peak velocity of early diastolic mitral annular motion (E/E’) [7.35 vs. 6.05; p = 0.01], and a lower ratio of early to late diastolic transmitral flow velocity (E/A) [1.05 vs. 1.31; p = 0.01] compared to the control group. In cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), long COVID patients presented lower forced vital capacity (FVC) [3.6 vs. 4.3 L; p < 0.0001], maximal oxygen consumption measured during incremental exercise indexed per kilogram (VO2max) [21 vs. 23 mL/min/kg; p = 0.04], respiratory exchange ratio (RER) [1.0 vs. 1.1; p = 0.04], forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) [2.90 vs. 3.25 L; p = 0.04], and a higher ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC%) [106 vs. 100%; p = 0.0002]. The laboratory results pointed out that patients with long COVID symptoms also had a lower rate of red blood cells (RBC) [4.4 vs. 4.6 × 106/uL; p = 0.01]; a higher level of glucose [92 vs. 90 mg/dL; p = 0.03]; a lower glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimate by Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) [88 vs. 95; p = 0.03]; and a higher level of hypersensitive cardiac Troponin T (hs-cTnT) [6.1 vs. 3.9 pg/mL; p = 0.04]. On the multivariate model, only FEV1/FVC% (OR 6.27, 95% CI: 2.64–14.86; p < 0.001) independently predicted the long COVID symptoms. Using the ROC analysis, the FEV1/FVC% ≥ 103 was the most powerful predictor of spiroergometry parameters (0.67 sensitive, 0.71 specific, AUC of 0.73; p < 0.001) in predicting the symptoms of long COVID. Spiroergometry parameters are useful in diagnosing long COVID and differentiating it from cardiovascular disease."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060197978","journalIssue":{"objectId":"64b54f824097071d4729e784","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"12","doi":null,"documentHash":"49eb3902-3f54-4279-ab50-4d37bf6c2dda"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/12/4160","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67408762fdbe832d853b8805","name":"Ibadete","lastName":"Bytyci","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d4aa335c-f138-4f78-aa3e-b854e82d7d0f"},{"objectId":"67408762fdbe832d853b8803","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Gryglewska-Wawrzak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"da0b7bf9-6876-41d0-b11e-62aa4ed524d6"},{"objectId":"5e7092e2878c28a04739eaaf","name":"Agata","lastName":"Sakowicz","uuid":"D870C866A8208AA363A949D9806D0AC7B8F73CA1075F90D5685BD8D6AEBBDEC4C89409CFDD7488C36C5A41FD8313064F5EEE8D4B1EFC3A9D17D1DD41528B3B8C","orcidId":"0000-0002-5083-2046","documentHash":"e00f208a-4b7c-4234-83ac-e5fc1c483042"},{"objectId":"5e7092e2878c28a04739ea8c","name":"Agata","lastName":"Bielecka-Dąbrowa","uuid":"D0F393DDAB7467C2BC5C8B3D0BF9ACCEA086D9623346F3735F447ECD7D88A2D8523B3602A8617CC9D91F58C615D2A1B36ED821D415D8AE482291C9B05B119E82","orcidId":"0000-0001-6666-3999","documentHash":"6d1fac70-cd18-4685-bbee-f65903d9f1de"},{"objectId":"5e7092e0878c28a04739e960","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Banach","uuid":"68B01DE963E856688B79EF95809B4608F3108276D6BAC030CC0B692BF60BDC13297F6EFBE2240F624F5681B3DBA155344ECAA8EE50DB71E703B1CD603F94D3C0","orcidId":"0000-0001-6690-6874","documentHash":"a27f579b-d7c8-4074-b7d4-265d207dc2a7"}],"doi":"10.3390/jcm12124160"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["diagnozowanie"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["testowanie","sterownik przemysłowy","system SCADA"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

One of the tasks in the ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) procedure is the classification of oocytes according to the stages of their meiotic maturity. Oocytes classification traditionally is done manually during their observation under the light microscope. The paper is part of the bigger task, the development of the system for optimal oocyte and embryos selection. In the hereby work, we present the method for the automatic classification of oocytes based on their images, that employs DNN algorithms.\r\nResults: \r\nFor the purpose of oocyte class determination, two structures based on deep neural networks were applied. DeepLabV3Plus was responsible for the analysis of oocyte images in order to extract specific regions of oocyte images. Then extracted components were transferred to the network, inspired by the SqueezeNet architecture, for the purpose of oocyte type classification. The structure of this network was refined by a genetic algorithm in order to improve generalization abilities as well as reduce the network’s FLOPs thus minimizing inference time.

The proposed machine learning (ML) based classification system is derived for a broad class of industrial control closed loops based on the proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller. Apart from a high accuracy of the classification of the closed loop performance, the proposed RO-CPA system is derived to meet the requirements of low computational complexity and low memory usage. These requirements allow for practical implementation of RO-CPA in devices with low computational and memory resources, such as industrial programmable logic controllers (PLC) operating in manufacturing systems or embedded autonomous systems with dedicated PID-based control loops. This paper shows the rigorous ML-based design of the proposed RO-CPA system and the results of the validation of its classification accuracy. Additionally, an example of a practical implementation within a PLC in the form of a general purpose library function block is presented and the final experimental validation is made using a part of laboratory heat exchange and distribution setup."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198025","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"146","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494623007081","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67726a99fdbe831a387a26b1","name":"Bogdan","lastName":"Gabrys","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9e6f0cb4-968d-4ae9-8fde-c8ebfc33f3aa"},{"objectId":"67726a99fdbe831a387a26b0","name":"Thanh Tung","lastName":"Khuat","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f2e111c4-31e9-42be-b586-9b983c533394"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6e57","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Grelewicz","uuid":"39B23A76A3BD06899E3B5B4B75CF42B1CD7B212EDEAAE4C25E6ACA51739BA76C2AD7AD6041E4C64D676DACB2D5511B256502D13CEC99BBA418CF28F0C2439CDA","orcidId":"0000-0001-9529-984X","documentHash":"b9f04f16-bb2b-4399-aafe-8efe7aa33a09"},{"objectId":"5e70937d878c28a0473aae00","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"6843462AB3EB5D998B3CDB8B9F794F5150D7AE58C76BB584BE4FBC0CAE5E022B51A4CEF986BA097D46D1F6C66CE39FFBD6AE4D000E0000D1D1D249E49A9F720E","orcidId":"0000-0002-6201-2782","documentHash":"b7c8964c-b863-45ca-b283-3ef011f2147a"},{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a047396002","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kłopot","uuid":"4CB122346AACF1E9BCCBD04C257B66102E0DEE6F9EF0E03679E203B2D422C504BB2CDEA6A07DEB11F929AC4018FBB3EB82795B4AB0F8E8506936A12B58877BCB","orcidId":"0000-0003-1247-5399","documentHash":"80070673-15f4-400a-964b-96dc4130bae0"},{"objectId":"5e709221878c28a047390466","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Czeczot","uuid":"26CD3FA300B8CD4417D2E155EF7A82BC47E38B0D63CC84BEE6AFDC954ECDF3084A1F0EE693AC0CAC1481973E57CAD09F2955E464A2CE52F69110F132FC38897F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5996-6967","documentHash":"e151336c-ef0d-4f93-9fa2-2917e32a5b76"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.asoc.2023.110690"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","uid":"bt6mbuLY9Vpc_KWGkV1Lk4w","uuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709330878c28a0473a4a45","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f81","5e709224878c28a047390958"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The levels of cortisol and selected biochemical parameters in red deer harvested during stalking hunts","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-2615","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"cf012089-3ed8-4dde-a05c-d5b280240cb4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-04-04","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"660ff6024097076263f8c6ba","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709330878c28a0473a4a45","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f81","5e709224878c28a047390958","6772f7bffdbe831a389edf49"]},"issue":"7","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"As a reactive species, the red deer is sensitive to both negative exogenous and endoge-\r\nnous stimuli. An intensive hunting period may have a particularly negative impact on game ani-\r\nmals. The aim of this study was to determine the plasma cortisol level and biochemical parameters\r\nin 25 wild red deer (Cervus elaphus) harvested during stalking hunts in correlation with the sex and\r\nage of the animals. The mean cortisol concentrations in the stags and hinds analyzed in this study\r\nwere similar (20.2 and 21.5 ng/mL, respectively). Higher HDL cholesterol values were found in the\r\nblood of the hinds than in stags (p < 0.05). Similarly, the mean levels of LDL cholesterol, lactate\r\ndehydrogenase, and alanine aminotransferase were higher by 21%, 16%, and 42%, respectively, in\r\nthe blood of the hinds. In contrast, the levels of alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and aspartate\r\naminotransferase were higher in the stags (by 30%, 49%, and 36%, respectively). There was a neg-\r\native correlation of the cortisol concentration with urea and bilirubin and a positive correlation\r\nbetween cortisol and aspartate aminotransferase in the stags (p < 0.05). In turn, a negative correla-\r\ntion was found between the cortisol and urea levels in the hinds (p < 0.05). In summary, the stress\r\ncaused by stalking hunts and the characteristic behavior of red deer during the mating season had\r\nan impact on chosen biochemical parameters.

Viticulture in so-called cool climate regions faces a number of weather and climatic extremes that directly or indirectly damage the grapes and so the wine. A suitable option is to use the structural and technical implementation of vine trellises—training systems, canopy management, and pruning methods which can help the plant withstand various extremes. At the same time, it is essential to choose trellis design training systems that growers can maintain and that support the appropriate quality of the grapes. Viticultural regions of warmer climate are strengthening the shading potential of training systems. Even so, the central viticultural areas withstand highly variable extremes of previous vintages with numerous shortcomings in the shading potential of trellis design. Meanwhile, the cool climate regions tend to use a trellis design with a simple canopy and easy sunlight exposition to reach the maximum solar contribution."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198042","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1966","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/14/11/1966","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67730520fdbe831a389f0413","name":"Pavel","lastName":"Pavloušek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"db565177-8c0e-4d19-96c4-c5dfd2787253"},{"objectId":"67730520fdbe831a389f0412","name":"Richard","lastName":"Danko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ec91cff0-da3f-4931-9485-22b6743bc986"},{"objectId":"5e7093d8878c28a0473b1d77","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Klimek","uuid":"4E0611FBFAAC9896E351D9C29966B126BCC2AE0888E95135B0C423502CC7EB7E65D6CE6BA9C1BB7693A0E36B0D366D18D1254081FB294BF3CF15BDCE4733D9EE","orcidId":"0000-0001-6638-894X","documentHash":"1338b896-b663-42cd-bed6-08146c78a44b"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390934","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kapłan","uuid":"090223E35558918E88AE250A165AE5FC0DCC5A422C06C7C985CEE53074BC570E3778C13B08452D04AC10051527739D0399365739042664083894B3AFBD47D954","orcidId":"0000-0002-3833-9275","documentHash":"547354a0-1a08-46b8-97ae-35b415cad1c5"}],"doi":"10.3390/agriculture14111966"},{"mainLanguageName":"niemiecki","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-3-339-13546-9","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709232878c28a047391749"]}],"type":"BOOK","title":"Modifikationen der Prädikat-Argumentstruktur.

A pivotal component of postoperative care is rehabilitation, aimed not only at improving the clinical condition but also at influencing the patient’s functional profile. In a study conducted at the Clinic of Thoracic Surgery and Respiratory Rehabilitation in the Regional Multispecialist Center for Oncology and Traumatology of the Nicolaus Copernicus Memorial Hospital in Lodz, the effectiveness of rehabilitation intervention was assessed in 50 patients (n = 27 M, n = 23 F) postlobectomy due to early stage nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health—ICF Rehabilitation Core Set was used to evaluate the functional profile, the modified Laitinen scale for pain assessment, and the modified Borg scale for breathlessness evaluation. Additionally, lung-expansion time was monitored. The significance level of the statistical tests in this analysis was set at α = 0.05. The study employed an analysis of the normality of the distributions of the numerical variables, reporting of variable distributions, estimation of differences between groups, estimation of differences within groups, estimation of the independence of categorical variables, and regression analysis. The research confirmed that rehabilitation partially improves the functional profile of patients and reduces the sensation of breathlessness postsurgery. The study highlighted the need for future research with a larger number of participants and an extended observation period to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of rehabilitation on patients after lung lobectomy procedures."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198056","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65522c6c40970757f3d3557b","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"22","doi":null,"documentHash":"eb0bab48-bb8a-4d33-a39b-de52a1bcba2a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/22/6995","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67408272fdbe832d853b8734","name":"Józef","lastName":"Kozak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9bd6cbd3-1f3c-4c95-8014-1dbbf256c4fd"},{"objectId":"67408272fdbe832d853b8731","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Polis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"248f145f-28bc-4aea-9a73-97b6c8d80b70"},{"objectId":"67408272fdbe832d853b8730","name":"Ireneusz","lastName":"Pieszyński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"afd3758d-df2b-4ec9-9bf1-631b11733b93"},{"objectId":"67408272fdbe832d853b872f","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Pryt","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4af2dcc2-3672-44dc-aabc-537eb5ead67b"},{"objectId":"67408272fdbe832d853b872e","name":"Artur","lastName":"Fabijan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a3354845-2482-4df4-9648-5fc9d69d300b"},{"objectId":"67408272fdbe832d853b872d","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Zawadzka-Fabijan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8a0f0a78-2d5f-4353-bcb5-d8f4b1173d1f"},{"objectId":"5e7094ea878c28a0473c6ce3","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Łochowski","uuid":"F69943341404A5AE5683563C1A445CC1FB89E60E316A5F73EDD6773BE31F516619DBE1E88E441DC8BCD104E0F946E995A28329EB2392513DE0E6F2B5BF842613","orcidId":"0000-0002-4899-2200","documentHash":"617a67f6-d4dc-4336-ba59-27034753bb6f"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d6b","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Zakrzewski","uuid":"4CA0677A30743D9933C9C424D1E591A406C5379061E85D342FF0248953CA3E79B916EC63CFCC3240F1ACD6E3374CB78962702AACDA7987A0491757DBA21F1D1F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5454-1783","documentHash":"67f4ff93-38c6-48ba-8feb-cda9dbc04351"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d1a","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Nowosławska","uuid":"8875799752E4142855F25E81AE196EE68413104B2F12B63D5FF60DDD1B9130F2458B6DD4DAD648F0B976BB4DA7F12D7B5E3DFBD91D4483BC435F902B0226AEFF","orcidId":"0000-0002-2024-8906","documentHash":"837b744e-fba4-47de-97ee-0f3bff9b7335"},{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a0473976e5","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Kujawa","uuid":"55D78DE9268317A5251BF2287DFE903922E51A14D4D61AC9C9C137DB2D95C2C71683EB273A6D1224FE88B6C7C605177446BF4C58A3161FA3CC820C52350ADF80","orcidId":"0000-0003-1309-2728","documentHash":"6ff1170b-5204-4128-aceb-5a1c35e8a821"}],"doi":"10.3390/jcm12226995"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["problem

In this paper we investigate the problem of determining optimal routes and loading of one type, assuming constraints imposed on the load capacity of the vehicle, declared customer needs and working time of drivers. As an input data we take PKN ORLEN stations with AdBlue available from the distributor located in Poland, We adopt the simulating annealing algorithm (SA) developed in Matlab to the problem and present exemplary results.

Therefore, developing an analytical model of friction is difficult. In this article, the CatBoost machine learning algorithm, newly developed by Yandex researchers and engineers, is used for modelling and parameter identification of friction coefficients for three grades of deep-drawing quality steel sheets. Experimental tests to determine the friction coefficient were carried out using the strip drawing method with the use of a specially designed tribological device. Lubrication conditions, normal force, and the surface roughness of countersample surfaces were used as input parameters. The friction tests were conducted in dry friction and lubricated conditions with three grades of oils with a wide range of viscosities. Different transfer functions and various training algorithms were tested to build the optimal structure of the artificial neural networks. An analytical equation based on the parameters that were being investigated was created to calculate the COF of each material. Different methods of partitioning weight were employed for the expected COF to assess the relative importance (RI) and individual feature’s relevance. A Shapley decision plot, which uses cumulative Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values, was used to depict models for predicting COF. CatBoost was able to predict the coefficient of friction with R2 values between 0.9547 and 0.9693 as an average for the training and testing dataset, depending on the grade of steel sheet. When considering all the materials that were tested, it was discovered that the Levenberg–Marquardt training algorithm performed the best in predicting the coefficient of friction."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198069","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67576009fdbe8357174575ee","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"124","number":"7-8","doi":null,"documentHash":"75ff0204-c42d-4cf3-8800-52fcd9e98bab"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"2229-2259","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00170-022-10544-1","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67576009fdbe8357174575f0","name":"Sherwan Mohammed","lastName":"Najm","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"916f353e-e93f-42c9-97ed-f08d007d6003"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d60b","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Trzepieciński","uuid":"B1173B4E25A04EF20A9FC72135EA66107445195FB931A6F929E34828CBA837AE85B5284995C35F3192186D9A1A95198DD9965EC89FB78C1E42ABBEFD475C5341","orcidId":"0000-0002-4366-0135","documentHash":"819127f8-0b2e-43f0-ae91-077e24078b38"},{"objectId":"5e709270878c28a047395ba5","name":"MAREK","lastName":"KOWALIK","uuid":"2981DAB7CA018AE53D445539909347718F25A2897638E64D8E0E2C3EA8ACA26D2EC0588525F8EE800EB1B2A5FDF44E2C2AB03B05D5340EEEB0561C034A700EBB","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7b78a925-20cf-41e4-b6b0-c24d0d1e0662"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00170-022-10544-1"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["złamanie","kobiety","osteoporoza","przewidywanie złamań"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fracture prediction","osteoporosis","fracture","women"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709274878c28a047395f5f","5e709221878c28a0473904de"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Optimal fracture prediction thresholds for therapy onset, established from FRAX and Garvan algorithms: a longitudinal observation of the population representative female cohort from the RAC-OST-POL Study","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454771ac","mniswId":"1686","title":"Archives of Osteoporosis","doi":null,"issn":"1862-3522","eissn":"1862-3514","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"6add4816-48a5-46e5-9bc3-ca2d477a7710"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-11-16","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"674ce159fdbe8357171009fb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709274878c28a047395f5f","5e709221878c28a0473904de","6772a34ffdbe831a388b932c","6772a34ffdbe831a388b932d","6772a34ffdbe831a388b932e"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The study shows that the use of unified cutoff thresholds to identify high fracture risks by two popular calculators-FRAX and Garvan-leads to a significant discrepancy between the prediction of fractures and their actual prevalence over the period of 10 years.

However, the physico-chemical nature of nanosubstances makes it necessary to determine not only the possibility of their use, but also the potential hazards that may be caused by those substances. One such hazard is fire safety. Nanoparticles may cause the risk of explosion, the occurrence and development of fire in an industrial plant. The results of research conducted on a selected sample of manufacturers of products used in fire protection indicated, among others, of the inefficiency of knowledge related to national and EU regulations (containing specific requirements) that can and/or should be applied and implemented by entrepreneurs. Additionally, legal regulations that define\ndirections of activities in industrial areas do not consider all aspects related to nanosubstances. It is therefore necessary to initiate a discussion and indicate the necessary actions that would allow the identification of a threat stemming from the presence of nanoparticles and the use of nanotechnology during various activities in industrial plants.

The eggs were examined on the day of laying and on days 14 and 28 of storage. The microbiological quality of the shell and contents of the eggs and the foaming properties of the egg white stored in cardboard and plastic packaging as well as the sensory characteristics of the eggs stored in both types of packaging after hard-boiling were examined on all evaluation dates. The type of packaging in which the eggs were stored was shown to influence the microbiological quality of the egg contents. Eggs stored in plastic packaging, on days 14 and 28 of storage, contained more bacteria in egg contents than eggs stored in cardboard packaging (p < 0.05). The type of packaging in which the eggs were stored did not have an effect on the foaming properties of the egg white (p > 0.05) or on the sensory characteristics of the eggs after hard-boiling. Irrespective of the type of packaging, the foaming properties of the egg white and the sensory characteristics of the eggs after hard-boiling deteriorated with storage time. The effect of temperature on egg quality was found.

The controller is designed by using a simplified model of the VRFB system. The flow rate of electrolytes is the manipulated variable and the charging or discharging current is a disturbance. The unmeasured state variables (vanadium ions concentrations) and state of charge of the VRFB are estimated by measuring open-circuit voltage. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the NMPC under different operating conditions: when VRFB is balanced and its simplified model is perfectly known, when VRFB is imbalanced and some of its model parameters are not accurately known, and in presence of measurement noise. In all these cases the predictive controller ensures very good tracking performance and rejection of disturbances."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198136","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"62","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352152X2300302X","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67726d51fdbe831a387ce3df","name":"Seshagiri Rao","lastName":"Ambati","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aabc6cea-a2ed-4952-8bd4-b9db6e888d70"},{"objectId":"5e7093c1878c28a0473b03b9","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Skupin","uuid":"42F5AF86488C47D66873D2EE64433DBCC56A3DDB59F2B074638265DA84F473BFE80FC980BECE2367E326C4906D965B693FE13B0A636C632E50F460EE72E16F83","orcidId":"0000-0002-9281-1577","documentHash":"0ab4021a-fed6-4dbe-a6e9-8496ba0f61c5"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.est.2023.106905"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Polański","Godard","Morin","lata 60.

However, in many small passerines, brood parasitism may also play an important role in territory occupancy. Settlement decisions are made under time pressure, especially for late migrants. An example of late migrants is the red-backed shrike Lanius collurio, a species wintering in sub-tropical Africa, which serves as a host for the common cuckoo Cuculus canorus and arrives in territories a few days later than their brood parasite. We expected that arriving red-backed shrikes avoided territories with common cuckoo presence. Then, we tested how experimentally provided artificial playback calls of the common cuckoo and woodpigeon (treated as control) affected the probability of red-backed shrike settlement. In the breeding season 2021, we observed 279 red-backed shrike territories to assess the effect of playback of common cuckoo calls on their host presence. Moreover, we adopt information on shrike territories collected in previous years to establish territory quality, measured by occupancy pattern over years. Each of these places was also checked for the presence of corvids, which are predators of shrike nests. We did not find difference with lower preference of shrikes towards cuckoo calls and to pigeon calls Columba columbus, what suggest the human presence and manipulation in the territories during experiments with recorders should be incorporated as an important factor to understanding shrikes’ settlement behaviour. What is interesting we found no negative effect of corvids (jay Garrulus glandarius) in control territories. However, shrike territories where cuckoo calls were emitted and where the presence of corvids was found were less likely to be inhabited by shrikes. Therefore, territory quality, human presence enhanced by nest predators, is an important factor affecting host–parasite interactions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198156","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"91","pagesFromTo":"550","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24750263.2024.2348710","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6772f7b8fdbe831a389ede86","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Jerzak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"68bf05c9-54cc-4938-8998-0c2d71231dff"},{"objectId":"6772f7b8fdbe831a389ede85","name":"Anders Pape","lastName":"Møller","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e916255b-9052-49e6-96f5-9d827cdabe44"},{"objectId":"6772f7b8fdbe831a389ede84","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Kwieciński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"399f5a1e-dde5-4888-8e1b-145734c1b40f"},{"objectId":"6772f7b8fdbe831a389ede83","name":"Tomasz Stanisław","lastName":"Osiejuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cf5d2a01-5ac4-41db-ad3b-b95ea62d205b"},{"objectId":"6772f7b8fdbe831a389ede82","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Jankowiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1da30ff5-5ca6-49f3-9a66-225df26aa940"},{"objectId":"6772f7b8fdbe831a389ede81","name":"Artur","lastName":"Goławski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5e624d27-64bd-474c-9450-14806c8bd702"},{"objectId":"6772f7b8fdbe831a389ede80","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Tryjanowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e2c490b8-e83d-4eca-95ae-813ecef144cc"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390915","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Grzywaczewski","uuid":"162558E2C6AAE0955CF502AD942847409E78967169C22ABDACDFB376537F4C35488AED08F43AFBCB5C4471421CD806464B573F57CAC43A94221D73667DDE1C99","orcidId":"0000-0003-1136-0768","documentHash":"8214bc6e-2f91-4995-a887-cac37247fe6c"}],"doi":"10.1080/24750263.2024.2348710"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["European Union GDPR privacy rights fundamental rights personal rights"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet Warszawski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602dec669543c7410626e834","602f89559543c7410626f5b7"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The right to privacy and an implication of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe: challenges to the companies","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c788","mniswId":"10672","title":"Journal of Contemporary European Studies","doi":null,"issn":"1478-2804","eissn":"1478-2790","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"7b97c197-408e-4a7c-9bba-091695edb5c4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"OCTOBER","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63450eec4097077ad4d502db","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602f89559543c7410626f5b7","602dec669543c7410626e834"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article traces the European Union (EU)'s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and implication in the Europe. In the era of global digitalisation, the right to respect private life, communication and the home has become a matter of protection. Protecting the right to privacy is a responsibility of a state which includes privacy of personal information, e.g. birth, messages, phone call and number and emails. Likewise, this study explains EU concern's about its citizens' privacy and the recent inclusion of the GDPR for the protection of natural persons. The article aims to explore individual fundamental rights and implications in the digital age, as well as cooperation data rules between companies and public bodies. At the same time, questions arise about the rightful implication of GDPR and the right to privacy of the public through protection, especially from tech companies.

The variety of plastics, their chemical structure, physicochemical properties, as well as the influence of environmental factors on their decomposition generate countless cases for analysis in the laboratory. The search for methods to reduce unnecessary laboratory analyses is a necessary action to protect the environment and ensure economic efficiency. In this study, machine learning techniques, specifically the methodology of artificial neural networks (ANNs), were employed to predict the leaching of contaminants from microplastics. The network's development was based on laboratory test results obtained using gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC–MS). The conducted research revealed the significant utility of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) - type networks, which exhibited correlation levels exceeding 95 % for various predicted values. One comprehensive ANN was developed, encompassing all the parameters analyzed, alongside individual networks for each parameter. A common network for all factors enabled for satisfactory results. Temperature and holding time had the greatest influence on the values of parameters such as the electrolytic conductivity of water (EC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). Correlation results ranged from 0.94 to 0.99 for EC, DEHP and DOC between the model data and laboratory data in each set of training, test, and validation data. The conducted research demonstrated that ANNs are a valuable machine learning method for analyzing and predicting pollutant emissions during the decomposition of microplastics."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198173","journalIssue":{"objectId":"64e4723640970741dcc5e03f","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"904","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"c3ea874e-b7d9-4516-8a40-7bc131c30aab"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969723054815?dgcid=author","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67728466fdbe831a38842c34","name":"Henrique","lastName":"Pizzo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ca22a292-5be0-4ba4-8067-a394d25ed497"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d546","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Pochwat","uuid":"919EF138994879CDF26CBE18537D8955313BBB839BAFC2A97CBC44769EBA5158A8BB6D63F2090045949D1139554DB0EF191FB62171E5375392057580624E784C","orcidId":"0000-0003-3190-9551","documentHash":"4124a913-9fa8-48c2-9301-98e9fe56bf16"},{"objectId":"5e7092b8878c28a04739b69d","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kida","uuid":"73D4FBF8C061EEB0AEC85E6563A0519D20127DB99D94A1C78AB5D62C5E8287B777D28A36428D98D1114DA32C0CF243AA2080F442EF9C139D6F7936F74C870BD1","orcidId":"0000-0003-1744-4014","documentHash":"66604140-6026-4c79-bd98-6b5de21c80d8"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b5a0","name":"Sabina","lastName":"Ziembowicz","uuid":"4DB84493DA6B82D7F909E28BD7476D12E9089B4B159C312D78786420A5ACD8264E095C038511DF8025377F3E71D61B8034FC5017C99618A89F8B274152320741","orcidId":"0000-0002-8032-5168","documentHash":"c9da0d1c-5d22-4878-b176-2e071eb33a55"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166856"},{"mainLanguageName":"niemiecki","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922e878c28a047391466","5e7091ff878c28a04738e588"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Die Beschwörung der Vergangenheit.

The criterion for the possibility of development of processes of the self-organization of subsystems of the second level shows that in a real irreversible process there is a decrease in the flow of mechanical energy. The paper considers three cases of the possibility of developing the processes of self-organization of subsystems of the second level on the example of the tribosystem “crankshaft-insert” for the operating conditions of a diesel engine 10D100. It was determined that in order to reduce the wear rate of the tribosystems of diesel engine it is necessary to provide the flow of the energy-mass transfer process on their contacting surfaces of friction by the gradients of chemical potentials and dislocation density of the interacting materials. The obtained expression is the criterion of possibility of development of processes of the self-organization of subsystems of the second level which indicates that the system would lose the stability, if the density of mobile dislocations or the wear rate of the tribosystems of diesel engine increases."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198187","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ec9ad94097076b4a8c9fe8","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"13","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"d065efa9-12ed-4a17-a844-e797d7339538"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-33015-3","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67728433fdbe831a38841a2b","name":"Sergey","lastName":"Myamlin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"338372b4-cb69-44da-a0c0-427c959baaf7"},{"objectId":"5ebee3be752340254fc4422a","name":"Denys","lastName":"Baranovskyi","uuid":"88EA9ACF399C7731071B2C181F64E2F5561C414C94C03E460E214CF3FC621B4F70BCFB70ED3D026A2A2E560963BDA140F324163ECFA1B3710F62448F9986897F","orcidId":"0000-0002-6516-2794","documentHash":"21902eaa-5765-40c0-8c3d-99f2c9bec4e3"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-33015-3"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["rabies","North-Eastern European RABV","central European RABV","vaccine-induced"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cc4","5e709342878c28a0473a5d46"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Determination of the rabies virus variants circulating in Poland in 2021–2023 and their phylogeny with analysis of the strains in the Mazowieckie and Podkarpackie voivodeships","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478bd7","mniswId":"13155","title":"Journal of Veterinary Research","doi":null,"issn":"2450-7393","eissn":"2450-7393","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"33675167-d910-4a5c-a5d1-cd68fbd86b10"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"JUNE","releaseDateYear":2024,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"671242e5fdbe836b555f1519","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["671242e5fdbe836b555f151a","5e709342878c28a0473a5cc4","5e709342878c28a0473a5d46"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Rabies is endemic in Europe and red foxes are the vector and reservoir of the rabies virus (RABV). Based on\nclassification established in the early 1990s, four variants of the rabies virus have been distinguished in Europe. Rabies broke out\nin January 2021 in the Mazowieckie voivodeship in central north-eastern Poland. The virus spread rapidly, reaching\nthe Świętokrzyskie voivodeship in the central southern part and the Lubelskie voivodeship in the eastern part in the next months.\nNine rabies cases were reported in the Podkarpackie voivodeship in south-eastern Poland between 2021 and 2023, mainly in red\nfoxes but also in dogs and wildcat. The aim of the study was the identification of RABV variants in wildlife and domestic animals\nin Poland between 2021 and 2023. Material and Methods: The study involved 157 animal brains tested positive for rabies using\na fluorescent antibody test. From 10% w/v brain homogenates, RNA was isolated and full-length RABV genomes were high-\nthroughput sequenced with an RABV-enriched approach. Complete genomes of RABV isolates were phylogenetically analysed\nand the variants were estimated. Results: Molecular and phylogenetic studies revealed 147 (93.6%) of the RABV strains out of\n157 which had rapidly spread in the wildlife of the Mazowieckie, Świętokrzyskie and Lubelskie voivodeships to be Central\nEuropean strains. Nine RABVs (5.7%) detected in foxes, a wildcat and a dog in the Podkarpackie voivodeship were identified\nas North-Eastern European. A vaccine-induced rabies case was detected in a red fox in the Lubelskie voivodeship in May 2023.\nConclusion: Central European and North-Eastern European RABVs were circulating in Poland between 2021 and 2023."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198190","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"68","pagesFromTo":"175-180","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2024-0032","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"671242e5fdbe836b555f151a","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Ciołek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cd2c830f-375c-4073-869d-b21d254b4bc6"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d46","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Smreczak","uuid":"F8B30A918C22AAD1AA7AE9C5D3FFDA47CF609511E7B465B3BCBAF192AC2D6E73CBFF8ADD21B9DEBE21AC0F4F803AD82290024E1D251CA1FB5298A962E7B5045D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0eb77885-82a5-455a-bf63-fa54b05c12cc"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cc4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Orłowska","uuid":"31BF3815E53225FB0CCBD915D008C5800C01531C4DF23A9161299EACAECAACC43C5DEA5344E221B38BC386F46E015ADAD2196E2D56A8455B3D8E58853C8AB669","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"55bf4618-fd65-42f2-b46f-274ea3353e1c"}],"doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2024-0032"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["nauczanie","informatyka","model komputerowy","chmura obliczeniowa","przetwarzanie bezserwerowe","platforma jako usługa","PaaS"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["teaching","computational science","computer model","cloud computing","serverless computing","platform as a service","PaaS"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67729873fdbe831a3888560f","67729873fdbe831a3888560e","67729873fdbe831a3888560d","67729873fdbe831a3888560c","67729873fdbe831a3888560b","67729873fdbe831a38885612","67729873fdbe831a38885611","67729873fdbe831a38885610","5e709206878c28a04738eba8"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Cloud as a Platform for W-Machine Didactic Computer Simulator","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65bba06f4097076263f9ca6d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c2877157418c4","mniswId":"952","startDate":null,"endDate":null,"fullName":"International Conference on Computational Science","shortName":"ICCS","city":null,"country":null,"website":null,"isEdition":false,"documentHash":"9690889e-bedf-4a40-a0bf-ea4bccddb401"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709206878c28a04738eba8","67729873fdbe831a3888560b","67729873fdbe831a3888560c","67729873fdbe831a3888560d","67729873fdbe831a3888560e","67729873fdbe831a3888560f","67729873fdbe831a38885610","67729873fdbe831a38885611","67729873fdbe831a38885612"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Effective teaching of how computers work is essential for future computer engineers and requires fairly simple computer simulators used in regular students’ education.

The aim\nof the study is a comparative analysis of the readiness of manufacturing enterprises, taking into\naccount their size, in terms of implementing the principles of the circular economy. Considering\nthe developed readiness model for the introduction of the circular economy, the following\nresearch questions were created:\n1. How do manufacturing enterprises assess the economic viability of the circular\neconomy?\n2. How does the external environment affect the pace of introducing the circular economy\nin enterprises?\n3. What is the technological, infrastructural, financial, and competence readiness of the\nstaff in terms of introducing the circular economy?\n4. What practices related to the circular economy are already introduced, which are\nplanned for introduction, and which are not considered in enterprises?\nDesign/methodology/approach: The method of analysis of subject literature and the\nquantitative method were applied, using the survey technique. The survey was conducted using\nthe CAWI technique.\nFindings: The key findings pertain to the role of external and internal factors in determining\nthe readiness to implement circular economy practices in business operations. Research\nindicates that although many companies have a positive attitude towards the circular economy,\ndiscrepancies exist between their declarative scope and the level of implementation of good\nbusiness practices in manufacturing enterprises. Standards such as BS 8001 can play a pivotal\nrole in promoting the circular economy. Hence, state institutions should increase the availability\nof information on ISO standards and simplify certification procedures. The government,\nregulatory bodies, and the private sector must collaborate to enable the full implementation of\nthe circular economy model. Large corporations have more financial resources, which can\nfacilitate the implementation of CE practices, while small businesses are more constrained in\nterms of funding. Due to their visibility, large companies feel greater social pressure to adapt\nto CE principles. Despite environmental pressures, many companies do not feel strong\ncompetition or market pressure to accelerate their adaptation to the CE model. However, both small and medium-sized, as well as large enterprises, recognize the economic viability of\nthe circular economy.\nResearch limitations/implications: The following directions for further research have been\nproposed, including the development of measurement tools for Sustainable Development Goals\n(SDGs) alignment, analysis of the impact of SDGs on innovation, and the study of the role of\nleaders and organizational culture. There is a need for further exploration of the influence of\nregulations and public policies on SDGs alignment.\nPractical implications: The circular economy has practical implications for changes in\nbusiness models, resource management, strategy, and corporate marketing activities. It also\nrecommends the development of tools for assessing the level of implementation of CE\nprinciples in enterprises and promoting pro-environmental attitudes among consumers.\nSocial implications: The circular economy has the potential to influence social attitudes and\nbehaviors by promoting more sustainable consumption and production practices, which in turn\nmay affect the quality of life and the balance of ecosystems. Actions in the field of the circular\neconomy can also impact public and industry policy.\nOriginality/value: The article proposes a research model that takes into account various factors\ninfluencing the readiness of enterprises to implement circular economy practices, allowing for\nthe identification of key barriers in the decision-making process by owners and managers of\nmanufacturing companies in the aspect of changes bringing the company closer to the\nintroduction of CE principles. This model can be valuable for researchers and practitioners\ninterested in sustainable development, as well as governmental institutions wishing to support\ntransformations towards CE."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198226","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65c369694097074c89dd8dc8","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"189","doi":null,"documentHash":"e09b7fe7-4c29-4f1a-8923-ffb6c5dbe4f3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"473-493","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.29119/1641-3466.2023.189.30","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"616644a875234017e052cae1","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Piskorz","uuid":"B357632FC8F0805C026B9B3A64EA8EDA2333552762C19336FD977EE801AC589235DECF0EE500570CD46A2DFFBD374DC580494EC6A1CEF87911C36569E967728C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"df2f4086-ee0e-471e-81f1-8dceff4c1dd8"},{"objectId":"5e7092f8878c28a0473a03f9","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Sitko-Lutek","uuid":"3CE5753C48E041FDE7138AF59EF48F830C71FBD19614993B5AC74E19FBFFB20BE30FD7A86886A508A0B9DC0DAB4BE8135BD88F081BF3CB94E9F5DF151D106CB2","orcidId":"0000-0002-3073-1184","documentHash":"a9f611d3-2c52-4d3c-9184-35254bdb1e46"}],"doi":"10.29119/1641-3466.2023.189.30"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["uczenie federacyjne","konserwacja predykcyjna","inteligentna produkcja","sztuczna inteligencja","zużycie zasobów","rekurencyjna sieć neuronowa"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["federated learning","predictive maintenance","smart production","artificial intelligence","resource consumption","recurrent neural network"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67729859fdbe831a38885504","67729859fdbe831a38885503","5e709415878c28a0473b5e7c","5e7094e4878c28a0473c62bd","5e709282878c28a047397017"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Resource consumption of federated learning approach applied on edge IoT devices in the AGV environment","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65bba0f74097076263f9cbc1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c2877157418c4","mniswId":"952","startDate":null,"endDate":null,"fullName":"International Conference on Computational Science","shortName":"ICCS","city":null,"country":null,"website":null,"isEdition":false,"documentHash":"9690889e-bedf-4a40-a0bf-ea4bccddb401"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709415878c28a0473b5e7c","5e7094e4878c28a0473c62bd","5e709282878c28a047397017","67729859fdbe831a38885503","67729859fdbe831a38885504","67729859fdbe831a38885505","67729859fdbe831a38885506","67729859fdbe831a38885507","67729859fdbe831a38885508"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Federated learning is a distributed machine learning method that is well-suited for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) as it enables the training of machine learning models on distributed datasets. One of the most important advantages of using Federated Learning for Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) is its capability to optimize resource consumption. AGVs are typically resource-constrained systems and must operate within tight power and computational limits. By using Federated Learning, AGVs can perform model training and updating on-board, which reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted.
