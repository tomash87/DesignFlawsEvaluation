Some assumptions of Johnson-Mehl-Avrami and Kissinger models were showed to be inadequate when describing kinetics of cold-crystallization of quench-cooled CBZ. Augis-Bennett, Ozawa and Mo models correctly outlined the nucleation and growth mechanism, however they were not able to distinguish between surface and bulk crystallization. Matusita model was the only one which properly described these two mechanisms and consequently was considered as the most versatile one. Quench-cooled CBZ displayed two different crystallization mechanisms for lower and higher heating rates. In the first case, surface crystallization was dominant, whereas in the second case – the bulk one. Activation energy was noticed to be heating rate, temperature and fractional extent of crystallization dependant."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058079936","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6229e5dd2467f024e7cb924e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"575","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"d327e38a-c6f5-4a79-b83c-3bbb14262ae5"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"575","pagesFromTo":"121198","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022309321005615?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"618353b97523400564d81fb2","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Dołęga","uuid":"EB2FB4B19D5F93AE7A4EF8F4A7529FC420F350E38F134C97F7B99C132AB812C15D99C70B1535B4B3A4277EF3F36CEF5DFD7EAF51402FC5FB0FD753C3FD71D3C5","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f543e348-46ab-4a09-aff1-dcdd498f2ab7"},{"objectId":"5e7092ff878c28a0473a0b50","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Zieliński","uuid":"F3A4AC0428C22905474E2D15E2F80D5679036E09EC104AA72FA70DEDFF7E41A96F19E99AA6A2D81CBFF786E14B7C50C66C7ED5C3B07A89D4295BF42E3E4795E0","orcidId":"0000-0001-5599-9673","documentHash":"a55177d5-e9ff-46e9-9b14-23862b21d5d8"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2021.121198"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["gospodarka współdzielenia","gospodarka współpracy","wspólna konsumpcja","gospodarka peer-to-peer","platformy cyfrowe","innowacje społeczne","systemy socjotechniczne","otwarty dostęp"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Collaborative Consumption","Collaborative Economy","Peer-to-Peer Economy","Digital Platforms","Sharing Economy","social innovation","socio-technical systems","open access"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-3-030-86896-3","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3d","uid":"b2eiZUbb85g0FOaTA2KZtOw","uuid":"c7c10a2a-f381-4dc2-8511-53400ceb4a90","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3d","parentUuid":"c7c10a2a-f381-4dc2-8511-53400ceb4a90","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3d","rootUuid":"c7c10a2a-f381-4dc2-8511-53400ceb4a90","name":"Szkoła Główna Handlowa w Warszawie","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebee54a752340254fc4493c"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"The Sharing Economy in Europe: Developments, Practices, and Contradictions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":413,"publicationPlace":"Cham","translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61ec4b492467f079a09498f7","editors":[{"objectId":"662b519f40970762633f4848","name":"Gabriela","lastName":"Avram","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b2cd778c-cb98-41e7-b483-875b3116032a"},{"objectId":"662b519f40970762633f4847","name":"Cristina","lastName":"Miguel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"46b8ff63-be61-456d-b629-dc6248760d15"},{"objectId":"662b519f40970762633f4846","name":"Vida","lastName":"Česnuityte","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c04b4f71-0942-42fe-bd62-e4f8ec4fa7dd"},{"objectId":"5ebee54a752340254fc4493c","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Klimczuk","uuid":"DBCDE1FB1D66877DEC25457970A15020F26FD52FD4F8168CAFB141D4D955B06188E285667F6F3DD5367FD3152AF144FD68F1F618CA3DBF7322FD780A62EF0D7D","orcidId":"0000-0002-8072-1152","documentHash":"db0fdffd-c29f-4606-9332-b69dd9a9bd08"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["5ebee54a752340254fc4493c","662b519f40970762633f4846","662b519f40970762633f4847","662b519f40970762633f4848"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This open access book considers the development of the sharing and collaborative economy with a European focus, mapping across economic sectors, and country-specific case studies. It looks at the roles the sharing economy plays in sharing and redistribution of goods and services across the population in order to maximise their functionality, monetary exchange, and other aspects important to societies.  It also looks at the place of the sharing economy among various policies and how the contexts of public policies, legislation, digital platforms, and other infrastructure interrelate with the development and function of the sharing economy. The book will help in understanding the future (sharing) economy models as well as to contribute in solving questions of better access to resources and sustainable innovation in the context of degrowth and growing inequalities within and between societies. It will also provide a useful source for solutions to the big challenges of our times such as climate change, the loss of biodiversity, and recently the coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19).

yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase is an assembly of 28 subunits of 17 types of which 3 (subunits 6, 8, and 9) are encoded by mitochondrial genes, while the 14 others have a nuclear genetic origin. Within the membrane domain (FO) of this enzyme, the subunit 6 and a ring of 10 identical subunits 9 transport protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane coupled to ATP synthesis in the extra-membrane structure (F1) of ATP synthase. As a result of their dual genetic origin, the ATP synthase subunits are synthesized in the cytosol and inside the mitochondrion. How they are produced in the proper stoichiometry from two different cellular compartments is still poorly understood. The experiments herein reported show that the rate of translation of the subunits 9 and 6 is enhanced in strains with mutations leading to specific defects in the assembly of these proteins. These translation modifications involve assembly intermediates interacting with subunits 6 and 9 within the final enzyme and cis-regulatory sequences that control gene expression in the organelle. In addition to enabling a balanced output of the ATP synthase subunits, these assembly-dependent feedback loops are presumably important to limit the accumulation of harmful assembly intermediates that have the potential to dissipate the mitochondrial membrane electrical potential and the main source of chemical energy of the cell."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058079953","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"220","pagesFromTo":"iyac007 (1-15)","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/220/3/iyac007/6512059?login=false","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"657c1d724097072a41635d3f","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Binko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ef66bdcf-5b0a-4ce4-8e99-040787b046cd"},{"objectId":"622f4c192467f016697d0c60","name":"Anna M.","lastName":"Kabala","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"92cab73a-becb-49a1-8af6-8af5739bd683"},{"objectId":"622f4c192467f016697d0c5f","name":"Jean-Paul","lastName":"di Rago","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"40c81bef-16d4-47d1-a1bf-c77a881306a9"},{"objectId":"622f4c192467f016697d0c5d","name":"Déborah","lastName":"Tribouillard-Tanvier","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fce64568-ff5b-41d4-826f-423319c37528"},{"objectId":"622f4c192467f016697d0c5c","name":"Lars M","lastName":"Steinmetz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0d32aef0-557b-48bd-a844-6f17448fd404"},{"objectId":"622f4c192467f016697d0c5b","name":"Sharon H","lastName":"Ackerman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3de14838-5606-49a0-a071-4fd1e85f6789"},{"objectId":"622f4c192467f016697d0c5a","name":"Hubert D","lastName":"Becker","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"04437bff-a958-4a39-95b2-48172d801dea"},{"objectId":"622f4c192467f016697d0c59","name":"Marine","lastName":"Bouhier","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ddb42eee-20cc-4fd8-842c-0a95970f2c09"},{"objectId":"622f4c192467f016697d0c58","name":"Kewin","lastName":"Gombeau","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d818ec48-b531-4862-bcc7-7d0843b94c69"},{"objectId":"622f4c192467f016697d0c57","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Skoczen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9f2eaf7f-3a9f-4a67-a03f-8af0e36e3bc8"},{"objectId":"622f4c192467f016697d0c55","name":"Alain","lastName":"Dautant","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d4a5186f-3aa1-48f1-aa7a-66512f4bed0c"},{"objectId":"622f4c192467f016697d0c54","name":"Camille","lastName":"Charles","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"13380861-dc9d-4690-b47e-7f2cc11586ff"},{"objectId":"622f4c192467f016697d0c53","name":"François","lastName":"Godard","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"75fbd4bc-3412-49aa-a4df-897945712731"},{"objectId":"60c2fd6f9543c72336543621","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Baranowska","uuid":"687533EB6B2D84EA9C6A7D42DC099F503AE15EB32F9C4D436458AA7BD5BC215693AC501E647332D2F7316CE35B8D69A247473D8F9433B7466C512F02A5C2BF24","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ea2094c0-856c-4370-a46f-c34c0b01e5a8"},{"objectId":"5e7093bb878c28a0473afea0","name":"Róża","lastName":"Kucharczyk","uuid":"B55BDCB96171371FC5E308C0670CD6A5D97C36DEEF98B75C075E89BD449367AAF9DC9731D91BBD203C1D112568C1392B9E628D1432CD22CA4261A15140E2A4C1","orcidId":"0000-0002-8712-7535","documentHash":"0ababb6e-bdbf-4e41-af6f-fe30820b68da"}],"doi":"10.1093/genetics/iyac007"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ischemic stroke","biomarker","therapeutic target","proteomics","liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

So far, the radiopharmaceuticals used in this approach have been based on the endogenous agonist of NK1R, Substance P or on its close analogues. Herein, we used a well-known, small molecular NK1R antagonist, L732,138, as the basis for the radiopharmaceutical vector. First, 14 analogues of this compound were evaluated to check whether extending the parent structure with linkers of different lengths would not deteriorate the NK1R binding. The tested analogues had affinity similar to or better than the parent compound, and none of the linkers had a negative impact on the binding. Next, five DOTA conjugates were synthesized and used for labelling with 68Ga and 177Lu. The obtained radioconjugates turned out to be fairly lipophilic but showed rather limited stability in human plasma. Evaluation of the receptor affinity of the (radio)conjugates showed that neither the chelator nor the metal negatively impacts the NK1R binding. The 177Lu-radioconjugates exhibited the binding characteristics towards NK1R similar or better than that of the 177Lu-labelled derivative of Substance P, which is in current clinical use. The experimental results presented herein, along with their structural rationalization provided by modelling, give insight for the further molecular design of small molecular NK1R-targeting vectors."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058079968","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61fa5df02467f013ba91dd47","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"23","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"777a1283-1b7b-4880-b166-d90fbed20095"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"1214","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/3/1214/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61ee68cd2467f068913c830d","name":"Paweł K.","lastName":"Halik","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0657-3793","documentHash":"87c6d111-708e-4a73-8241-330f8eff8f97"},{"objectId":"61ee68cd2467f068913c830c","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kosińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"faaed94e-02dd-4ebf-b5f6-5a57981e6677"},{"objectId":"5e70948d878c28a0473bf725","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Matalińska","uuid":"717482983C323DEA1B4D420E26E24DAB8D7DA178D5477076F88A05D46E9C28F186DD3A4AE5F708727DFEE62B9359A755196C6EB1DF07DECC72D3A6451666D347","orcidId":"0000-0003-0837-7171","documentHash":"26b04b24-507b-4320-ba69-b58e5bfacfd3"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5ab9","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Gniazdowska","uuid":"F9A07190AAC4C072C48192957E16F7F5EE4FA73980E6D5F02056F4CA461596AE4B73FDB81EBA2A24B7CA898264ADA6EFC44A34EDF3DEAECC0FD68F6B7A54431D","orcidId":"0000-0001-7446-1115","documentHash":"15332ac1-0f8a-4014-bf72-4f99ff708b73"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b58ba","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Koźmiński","uuid":"93A79789C445E76571D7DE00E6B7807C0528F81BBA4C9A176ADD1CDF1B79DFD3DB74CFA5F5B9146C4D72723986768F7E1537166BDF3B6989F22DCD20E7169DF2","orcidId":"0000-0003-0471-6949","documentHash":"d890ee1d-6006-49b7-91dc-4bd94d41d8c9"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473a9ef0","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Lipiński","uuid":"0A26A266AEABE99E92125BAA150EBFAFF3F0896A216497E92AE72AA0451BF78638F6BCB1D0182E2B43B019D1506A66744765BD7DAF0D8F6604A6ABD482529D35","orcidId":"0000-0002-8364-7955","documentHash":"33ec05f8-1c58-4bc5-a512-524ad609a751"},{"objectId":"5e70927d878c28a0473968fb","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Misicka-Kęsik","uuid":"8B9BE6568A6744020B06584A1C96947F2302A482C949F1A539EE99311B1FF2C3145E1002A6A1912B7C0EA344994CFE69DDFA4524C7311FB5335C0E0A0EF3A1F5","orcidId":"0000-0001-7446-2396","documentHash":"a39cc187-ef56-4d47-a996-f8503cff711a"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms23031214"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Quantum many-body systems","Matrix product state","Site-independent matrix product states","Compressed quantum many-body state secret sharing"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091d1878c28a04738b26a","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"CSIRO","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709469878c28a0473bc6ea"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debd","uid":"bIPOz_WiDWR0kK88nqXox3A","uuid":"6c713100-70da-4346-9836-92ba3723e52a","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debd","parentUuid":"6c713100-70da-4346-9836-92ba3723e52a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debd","rootUuid":"6c713100-70da-4346-9836-92ba3723e52a","name":"Instytut Podstaw Informatyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709469878c28a0473bc6ea"]},{"id":"622618d62467f0548a0360e5","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Southwest University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["622618d62467f0548a0360e9"]},{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f9e3","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Deakin University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["622618d62467f0548a0360eb"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Dynamic and compressed quantum many-body state secret sharing based on site-independent matrix product states","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c28514547948f","mniswId":"16926","title":"Quantum Information Processing","doi":null,"issn":"1570-0755","eissn":"1573-1332","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"8719645b-ee92-4cf9-972f-28df12bf1eea"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"622618d62467f0548a0360e4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["622618d62467f0548a0360e9","5e709469878c28a0473bc6ea","622618d62467f0548a0360eb"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Tensor network states, in which tensor networks are used to encode the coefficients of a state wavefunction, have been proposed for the study of quantum many-body systems. The most common tensor network state is matrix product state (MPS). Furthermore, we can change the tensor in an MPS but not the quantum state it represents (that is, we only change its mathematical representation, not its actual physical quantity). Most importantly, MPS can be faithfully compressed. However, a dynamic and compressed quantum many-body state secret sharing scheme has yet to be proposed, which is important in practical settings. Therefore, based on the characteristics of site-independent matrix product states, we focus our attention in this paper on the scenario where the shared quantum state is large, but quantum storage resources are limited, and the number of participants can be dynamically adjusted to fill this gap and develop a dynamic and compressed quantum many-body state secret sharing scheme. The notable features of our scheme are that (i) the quantum secret state is faithfully compressed, (ii) the dynamic property is achieved by tensor contraction, tensor addition, and tensor subtraction of MPS form corresponding to the change in the number of quantum participants and the shared quantum many-body state update or quantum participant’s replacement, (iii) our scheme allows for the sharing of a large volume of quantum data in an inherently multipartite way, and (iv) the amount of quantum storage required by participants can be reduced exponentially."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058079975","journalIssue":{"objectId":"622618d62467f0548a0360ed","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"21","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"64d3c324-c77d-47c7-8049-09a12903f016"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"21","pagesFromTo":"83: 1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11128-022-03420-0.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"622618d62467f0548a0360eb","name":"Lei","lastName":"Pan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"79075141-8568-434b-a223-6348545870ec"},{"objectId":"622618d62467f0548a0360e9","name":"Hong","lastName":"Lai","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ec93651b-6d03-43a9-8be7-29cfd6f78f21"},{"objectId":"5e709469878c28a0473bc6ea","name":"Józef","lastName":"Pieprzyk","uuid":"59FC38C58DF5CDA2BACB6E2881766965B4FA25CEEE0EC6F6DBDB59046EE76AB7DFA2EA5BCFAD5209F8733CF755AE8E744EE0581E5A6735D6E100CDA61284A860","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"82a4d249-64c0-486d-9a7d-8ef71ccddf06"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11128-022-03420-0"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["recenzja","rewitalizacja, tereny poprzemysłowe"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","uid":"b1CAWFlsJj7f886P9BWoCUQ","uuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","parentUuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","rootUuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","name":"Uniwersytet Radomski im.

The main purpose of this study was to analyse the effects of oral administration of 3 and 6 mg/kg of caffeine on a battery of physical tests associated with judo performance. Ten highly trained national-level judoka (6 men and 4 women, age: 24.1 ± 4.7 years, body mass: 73.4 ± 12.9 kg, 15.1 ± 5.2 years of judo training experience, 2.6 mg/kg/day of habitual caffeine intake) participated in a randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled and double-blind experiment. Each judoka performed three identical experimental sessions after: (a) ingestion of 3 mg/kg of caffeine (CAF-3); (b) ingestion of 6 mg/kg of caffeine (CAF-6); (c) ingestion of a placebo (PLAC). After 60 min for substance absorption, participants performed the following tests: (a) bench press exercise with 50% of the load representing one-repetition maximum (1RM), including three sets of three repetitions; (b) bench pull exercise with 50% of 1RM including three sets of three repetitions; (c) countermovement jump; (d) maximal isometric handgrip strength test; (e) dynamic and isometric versions of the Judogi Grip Strength Test. In comparison with PLAC, the ingestion of CAF-3 and CAF-6 increased peak bar velocity in the bench press exercise (1.27 ± 0.11 vs. 1.34 ± 0.13 and 1.34 ± 0.15 m/s, respectively; p < 0.01) and mean bar velocity in the bench pull exercise (1.03 ± 0.15 vs. 1.13 ± 0.13 and 1.17 ± 0.15 m/s; p < 0.05). Only CAF-6 increased mean bar velocity in the bench press exercise when compared with PLAC (0.96 ± 0.09 vs. 1.02 ± 0.11 m/s; p < 0.05). Both CAF-3 and CAF-6 significantly increased the number of repetitions in the Judogi Grip Strength Test (17 ± 10 vs. 20 ± 10 and 20 ± 10 repetitions; p < 0.05). There were no differences between PLAC and caffeine doses in the remaining tests. The pre-exercise ingestion of 3 and 6 mg/kg of caffeine effectively obtained meaningful improvements in several aspects associated with judo performance. From a practical viewpoint, the selection between 3 or 6 mg/kg of caffeine may depend on previously tested individual responses during simulated competition."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058080003","journalIssue":{"objectId":"621cce712467f05c96102e26","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"19","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"ab9774db-07b5-4b3f-826f-68625e5f36ce"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/5/2868/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62288ea32467f0086c9ce790","name":"Juan","lastName":"Del Coso","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5785-984X","documentHash":"bbf6c96b-d572-4357-8922-7fdc19dd7cd7"},{"objectId":"62288ea32467f0086c9ce78f","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Komarek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"823d9674-05ff-4ed6-89ed-8adebf349e4c"},{"objectId":"62288ea32467f0086c9ce78d","name":"Robert","lastName":"Krawczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"862c4d29-fe5c-4849-af27-18ed1045fbf6"},{"objectId":"5e70943c878c28a0473b8a1c","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Kostrzewa","uuid":"02C91A0D9B1B26E930D6F062977DFE29E770B5D290C2237D4FB613859FAE745590E32B462631E40098874BA308AA6FB4EF604FACA0631F02B41AF1F9AB251CFC","orcidId":"0000-0003-2209-0839","documentHash":"9b671844-4a21-4b02-8884-2b72272303e1"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473a9e44","name":"Michał","lastName":"Krzysztofik","uuid":"09B2064AE9D43D6879AE4A67450FA0D08BAB72E52E4AF7A9A3DB21E8CD0D9CFC18B7AC9B5AAE86C4E27C827622E08E19B2338B2B52FF2D1BCD34B4FF452320EC","orcidId":"0000-0003-2797-8431","documentHash":"eb9c811f-81a8-4d79-9155-53e811b9c5f8"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d25","name":"ALEKSANDRA","lastName":"FILIP-STACHNIK","uuid":"9D80769DE4AE94F78A0B1A5CCCBFA91EEBDD4EC26E82724C281CD76ACACFAEF2982D5CF53180DBEE9814748E2D678A4561536F166C752EB25D706F87FE979CA7","orcidId":"0000-0003-2008-6158","documentHash":"1fc0b46e-d4dd-4e49-b8e7-0a16ff1f9f1e"},{"objectId":"5e709307878c28a0473a1702","name":"Michał","lastName":"Wilk","uuid":"2EF16B2353C928DDF54B6456D12569DCEE8D6D16DC9A820453D4A0A3933F4AD334C6064BD80DBF61030316AD633479BCE6C823297B6B3DD38B57953BC79084E4","orcidId":"0000-0001-5799-6337","documentHash":"3d597b00-b764-4084-9fa7-13b911863f7c"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19052868"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Zinc oxide","Magnesium oxide","Quasi-ternary alloys","Interdiffusion","Nanomaterials","TEM"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","uid":"btSYdQGYDtmYBdiC2rKR_nQ","uuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","parentUuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","rootUuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","name":"Instytut Fizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ad878c28a0473c17a6","5e709386878c28a0473abd6d","6013f14e9543c74f831551ad","5e7094ad878c28a0473c17a4","5e7094ad878c28a0473c1767","622f09832467f016697ba1a3","5e709472878c28a0473bd377","5e7094ac878c28a0473c161e","5e7092ba878c28a04739b8cf","5e7092b1878c28a04739adc4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Structural analysis of the ZnO/MgO superlattices on a-polar ZnO substrates grown by MBE","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477156","mniswId":"1525","title":"Applied Surface Science","doi":"","issn":"0169-4332","eissn":"1873-5584","websiteLink":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/applied-surface-science","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"803a82fb-a3ac-4527-b90f-633878a81469"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"622f085c2467f016697b9e6c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094ad878c28a0473c17a4","5e7094ad878c28a0473c17a6","5e709472878c28a0473bd377","5e7094ad878c28a0473c1767","5e7092ba878c28a04739b8cf","5e7094ac878c28a0473c161e","622f09832467f016697ba1a3","5e709386878c28a0473abd6d","6013f14e9543c74f831551ad","622f0ec32467f016697bccad","622f085c2467f016697b9e78","5e7092b1878c28a04739adc4"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The analysis of heteroepitaxially grown ZnO/MgO superlattices on a-oriented ZnO substrates was described. The influence of unalike natural crystalline structures of ZnO and MgO on the interface’s abruptness and retaining wurtzite crystallinity was studied. Wurtzite structure was found to be retained in the MgO thin barriers up to 1.5 nm, but creation of nonuniform biaxial strains and some interdiffusion of Mg from barriers to ZnO QW’s seemed to be inevitable. The complex strain/composition heterogeneities can be explained by the difference of vapor pressure between Mg (p = 1.93 Pa) and Zn (p = 0.22 Pa) elements at growth temperatures and high mobility of Mg atoms, which are gladly incorporated into ZnO matrix. As a result, a subtle three monolayers in size ZnMgO film was created at the interfaces, which was partly responsible for retaining the wurtzite structure of coherently grown MgO layers."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058080007","journalIssue":{"objectId":"622f085c2467f016697b9e7b","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"587","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"e88f5942-d894-4b0e-9fd8-53ef7e5a1f44"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"587","pagesFromTo":"152830-1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0169433222004081?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"622f0ec32467f016697bccad","name":"Sérgio","lastName":"Magalhães","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b79eaf61-b70c-47da-b824-3b63d103235d"},{"objectId":"622f09832467f016697ba1a3","name":"Jan","lastName":"Dyczewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b4fb774d-891b-439c-9bfd-96c367150cf9"},{"objectId":"622f085c2467f016697b9e78","name":"E.","lastName":"Alves","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ea26d0e7-f28a-471f-9cfa-6264f29aa69d"},{"objectId":"6013f14e9543c74f831551ad","name":"Serhii","lastName":"Kryvyi","uuid":"462EADFCF091B81E39AA14D8C52A45A7915BD41D17946350D92BFCA4A9B4AD5A05B331B35A0655E36A2A5D770A800078B8207453F8F8D1CB7EAF31ACFA020D32","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5bb32163-8849-4fc0-8f01-4eee9d3f9f24"},{"objectId":"5e7094ad878c28a0473c17a6","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Wierzbicka","uuid":"19249368F992ABC6356CFEDC797FEA9CB993048BEC641FEC4B9C5248CC22B77441836F1613C403BEE9B1D84009330022547FF20D474E0C597F16F5504F95007F","orcidId":"0000-0003-1379-5941","documentHash":"b6af9d13-f697-463b-ae78-6ef843d5efcc"},{"objectId":"5e7094ad878c28a0473c17a4","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Stachowicz","uuid":"316FA41AC59A98C7F8311A6495A7AE59F27628DFDB10AC94D70EE713357455B4599A2C198D26553258A37C0E7C292E0CF53A8023B8C67D26B3E3261A59C0833E","orcidId":"0000-0002-9768-0860","documentHash":"db5459d6-2d2f-40de-9f37-845f5b01b3d6"},{"objectId":"5e7094ad878c28a0473c1767","name":"Mieczysław","lastName":"Pietrzyk","uuid":"407126F7CB775EB4664195701B8CD3FCB3E181314A88E9ED690284639366FEE04B3D7DE5744CC5EA3AB6FA2AC621038FA9041E8BBF9945B11A107368CBD37E58","orcidId":"0000-0001-8384-9090","documentHash":"afc598b5-afd1-4162-9292-baef77a70695"},{"objectId":"5e7094ac878c28a0473c161e","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Dynowska","uuid":"16931EC1FF78AF5AFB91010A36473944C89F4B72C4D701A48D7368F71387CE15994E7CC7539D7B5A1074D271FEB7F577B0CDE90A7BE546EC7AF3BE711A86C721","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e8eaff25-7c8d-420a-bed0-8954b50e5230"},{"objectId":"5e709472878c28a0473bd377","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Sajkowski","uuid":"740FA7BE78D77C6DEFE3A0F63891BC9E7333DE6BAAF075CFAE2A2665896EED166B80A12093F3B76C312398E50F142107A18B56D12F2BE2212BE23ECCD5710106","orcidId":"0000-0002-7136-1634","documentHash":"be2c05c0-2421-43f2-ae53-0a4fff0b3526"},{"objectId":"5e709386878c28a0473abd6d","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Morawiec","uuid":"D35932A094FF6A75B5F2F1B295754792FCC30FB6C7A227E1CC037E271BFE5792D4264D129B882F4B3D709835469C0517B3C98256B1B1217B29D0331B4BB0F79B","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"920e8b4a-1412-43fb-8f38-a3ebde9d060e"},{"objectId":"5e7092ba878c28a04739b8cf","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Dłużewski","uuid":"EBF4FD34FCC08C883A27795F5EA98830F307598AE89F8F24A08CD3603AAD97BB2160B848247290EABB9746C866D97BBC2060B7CEC0FE4EAA0B1101B64F4C6FCE","orcidId":"0000-0002-4153-6309","documentHash":"0e61fccf-836b-4a66-94a0-5053cf55ba54"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739adc4","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Kozanecki","uuid":"18ED60D105AFDF14A5A5F772C1358705FAFE1EE42AE751EFE166B5F55F23508A95223E5C30AFDD5C6D480E2E0B7B2782BC3BFDBBFF8A0B7C804060B8CED1655B","orcidId":"0000-0002-6023-1412","documentHash":"3ab8e9f7-e472-456a-b616-3bee8dff28e2"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.apsusc.2022.152830"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["epidemic","COVID-19","crisis","public health","threat","coronavirus"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62286fef2467f0086c9bf863","doi":null,"title":"System ochrony praw człowieka w Europie w czasach wyzwań pandemicznych.

Ribavirin serves as a model molecule because it possesses a broad-spectrum antiviral effect against RNA viruses, which are expected as emerging viruses. The choice of monomers enables to stabilize the pre-polymerization complex and to synthesize biocompatible polymers. Predictive studies as well as experimental works conclude similar results on best ribavirin:monomers ratios. Thus, materials exhibit high selective cavities toward ribavirin. These affinities allow to show release profiles drastically different from the non-imprinted ones at two temperatures. The imprinted materials show a sustained profile able to release antiviral for more than 24 h. The hydrogels obtained are biocompatible with model cells retained, human lung epithelial BEAS-2B cells. Cell viability is excellent and pro-inflammatory response is insignificant when imprinted polymers are incubated with cells. Finally, viral tests carried out on Influenza A infected lung cells show that imprinted delivery systems delivering 1 to 3 µg of antiviral have the same efficiency as a medium containing 30 µg mL-1 of active agent. As a very interesting result, the molecularly imprinted polymers as drug delivery systems allow to increase the local concentration of antiviral, to improve their delivery when its bioavailability is low."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058080055","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62260ce42467f0548a0346bb","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"22","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"c9c90223-f0f1-4bf6-9246-ee9d72c30591"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"2100291","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/mabi.202100291","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62260cca2467f0548a034505","name":"Luigi A.","lastName":"Agrofoglio","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"07a2c8d4-23c3-43ec-8383-75e70b42de4c"},{"objectId":"62260cca2467f0548a034504","name":"Mustapha","lastName":"Si‐Tahar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d7097761-926b-43ee-b0f5-a61395cf0fb0"},{"objectId":"62260cca2467f0548a034503","name":"Benjamin","lastName":"Carbonnier","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1052345d-4dfc-407a-9ecc-6d0a29ff853e"},{"objectId":"62260cca2467f0548a034502","name":"Pierre","lastName":"Degardin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f3bd2c75-bbdf-4198-bd2a-324fec867d99"},{"objectId":"62260cca2467f0548a034501","name":"Virginie","lastName":"Hervé","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"19566069-9244-4acc-a3a9-2e6b3eda2a3d"},{"objectId":"62260cca2467f0548a034500","name":"Virginie","lastName":"Vasseur","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4b280595-1b56-4a17-b0c7-ce3c7080885f"},{"objectId":"62260cca2467f0548a0344fe","name":"Patrick","lastName":"Favetta","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5849-001X","documentHash":"66d0183c-3357-4f51-a5dd-13e09d18b3a1"},{"objectId":"62260cca2467f0548a0344fd","name":"Mohamed G.","lastName":"Ayari","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1a6a4040-428a-45cb-ad43-b936a2fa5583"},{"objectId":"5e7094d6878c28a0473c4f5f","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Warszycki","uuid":"6EAB6587DB484B7004001E74F4DA48408FA72C0CBB82418E12FDD5318B6618D0E5176E606208FC2B233FAE3EE97CC96FC75AE9341D59CB44DA92622723C19223","orcidId":"0000-0002-2393-4709","documentHash":"0a88a9f5-b858-42f4-8544-2da9c9bb7014"}],"doi":"10.1002/mabi.202100291"},{"mainLanguageName":"niemiecki","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6200ce322467f06fa432fe30","doi":null,"title":"Translation Landscapes : Internationale Schriften zur Übersetzungswissenschaft.

study compactness and boundedness of embeddings from Sobolev type spaces on metric spaces into\n\nspaces with respect to another measure. The considered Sobolev spaces can be of fractional order and some statements allow also nondoubling measures. Our results are formulated in a general form, using sequences of covering families and local Poincaré type inequalities. We show how to construct such suitable coverings and Poincaré inequalities. For locally doubling measures, we prove a self-improvement property for two-weighted Poincaré inequalities, which applies also to lower-dimensional measures.\n\nWe simultaneously treat various Sobolev spaces, such as the Newtonian, fractional Hajłasz and Poincaré type spaces, for rather general measures and sets, including fractals and domains with fractal boundaries. By considering lower-dimensional measures on the boundaries of such domains, we obtain trace embeddings for the above spaces. In the case of Newtonian spaces we exactly characterize when embeddings into\nspaces with respect to another measure are compact. Our tools are illustrated by concrete examples. For measures satisfying suitable dimension conditions, we recover several classical embedding theorems on domains and fractal sets in Rn."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058080099","journalIssue":{"objectId":"622f8aa02467f016697dbcce","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"282","number":"11","doi":null,"documentHash":"76c5cb71-d014-4375-a4b8-59a1a1e19f65"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"282","pagesFromTo":"109421, 1-47","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0022123622000416?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"622f8aa02467f016697dbccb","name":"Jana","lastName":"Björn","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1238-6751","documentHash":"165352ab-465d-424e-8431-748f4cdf9234"},{"objectId":"5e709356878c28a0473a79a7","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kałamajska","uuid":"1178BD398E5D4E919B1CC2D3C35A74ACA7D14F9F653C16CBBE705333C85C5FD8E81E72595A59707A35B1D1B0BA1F4FFEA4BF89AD65B3B9370E4FAB1179D14F11","orcidId":"0000-0001-5674-8059","documentHash":"e6a36d9c-1499-48cb-8831-43d8c91c03c1"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jfa.2022.109421"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["astronautics","astrodynamics","terminal astroballistics","hydrocode","warheads","modeling and simulation","rock material asteroid","network-centric system architecture","space missions","navigation","planetary defense modeling"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","uid":"byIMgWh_9RUyyDH3dMzNDyw","uuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna im.

This paper is intended to support international efforts to improve the planetary security of Earth. The work covers three areas of knowledge: astronautics, astrodynamics, and astroballistics. The most important part of the presented article is dynamic, contact combat modeling against small, deformable celestial bodies. For these purposes, the original, proprietary hydrocode of the free particle method (HEFPM-G) with gravity was used. The main aim of combat is to redirect potentially hazardous objects (PHOs) to orbits safe for Earth or destroy them. This concept’s first task is to find, prepare, and use dynamic three-dimensional models of the motion of celestial bodies and spacecraft or human-crewed spaceships in the solar system’s relativistic frame.

This polymer exhibits high hydrogen bond acidity and was designed to be used as a sensor layer in gas sensors. The description of the synthetic route of the PMFOS has been divided into two main stages: the synthesis of the functional substituent 4-(but-3-en-1-yloxy)-2,3-difluorophenol, and the post-polymerization functionalization of the polysiloxane chain (methylhydrosiloxane-dimethylsiloxane copolymer) via hydrosilylation. The synthesized material was subjected to instrumental analysis, which confirmed its structure. The performed thermal analysis made it possible to determine some properties important for the sensor application, such as glass transition temperature and decomposition temperature. The results showed that PMFOS meets the requirements for materials intended for use in gas sensors based on acoustoelectric transducers."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058080127","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6231d2bf2467f05185353d80","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"5d61ec84-8e58-4db5-b65d-207b596a4707"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1147","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/14/6/1147/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094d2878c28a0473c483a","name":"Michał","lastName":"Grabka","uuid":"3251B0175FE23FDFED5E57DAB479EB28EB81CCF6E7AA277EF198FF2ADB2CB08969337BA41E48F5BD4333D7E90A940E7120885F9B50A2B3D54ABC7347A7AD6BBA","orcidId":"0000-0003-4997-2364","documentHash":"7efc233c-3652-4e37-a178-de7257087c75"},{"objectId":"5e709428878c28a0473b74c2","name":"Michał","lastName":"Czerwiński","uuid":"533D93668562EF49E7DCE74D4A8F2288F812F1DF69E707DA0DB8D2466A9F53C058C011E9053F2E4F50FBC4D45E000E75E33726CBE85A86391B15C1FFAC60B3DC","orcidId":"0000-0002-9961-535X","documentHash":"8e755d3f-a266-40ad-b04a-4e97d47b4227"},{"objectId":"5e7092a5878c28a047399ce5","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Kula","uuid":"A8332706FF16FEA9A9D54558FD36DD80E87F029DA0089257E8E73ACFDD381D7FF7DCFAE66BBE1A106C349C7C4BB2D425210515B164F64F095A07C3D1D1B26F9F","orcidId":"0000-0002-7862-7968","documentHash":"ef81f658-c0bd-4c41-8bc6-3634424630be"},{"objectId":"5e7092a5878c28a047399cce","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Szala","uuid":"2ED8A5888E1C7F886272CC5A817B074724FD51A052D13AB0983E849BDDDC08A72DA8B474FE7EFCD711FF7E571DF052FCCB9782D031465375DADA7675BF688577","orcidId":"0000-0002-6928-2689","documentHash":"b276b7f8-50b3-4ec3-a007-4a4cc4aca82d"},{"objectId":"5e7092a5878c28a047399ca6","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Jasek","uuid":"45B57F0FBB5BF20DAD9C6680BF9E92BBC3E0E5735B8DF9B34496825753BADE5B2116D6EE0AE7237D99AA380C092DFD01AC9BDD16927281B93E1552A66ABABD2E","orcidId":"0000-0002-5098-4218","documentHash":"22a52726-c4f3-483a-a8f9-a1d1ea40b1be"}],"doi":"10.3390/polym14061147"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-91-513-1318-4","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Polsko-szwedzkie spotkania po roku 1918 : literatura – język – kultura","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":309,"publicationPlace":"Uppsala","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"623045b62467f034a5d4e006","editors":[{"objectId":"623045b62467f034a5d4e008","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Slyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6bad2eb4-f006-477b-beff-e451284ae62e"},{"objectId":"5e7092b6878c28a04739b34a","name":"Janina","lastName":"Gesche","uuid":"435E24304ED29729E8490FFA3A3878EEF2D4D2E151F259340EED8553714F2C04087C98E832E44CD3C1A19A55AF7ECB34C02A2F84A434FF54E1F11666F9DAF059","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"04b943a8-6166-4284-9379-8bff45c1fb67"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["5e7092b6878c28a04739b34a","623045b62467f034a5d4e008"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Kontakty polsko-szwedzkie mają wielowiekową tradycję i przebiegają na wielu płaszczyznach: politycznej, gospodarczej, naukowej, jak również kulturowej i literackiej.

The course of such, redox processes usually require either the presence of a metal catalyst that changes its oxidation state during oscillations, or a catalytic role is played by the intermediates formed from the reactants. Since the discovery of the first oscillatory chemical reaction that took place in a homogeneous phase, many other oscillatory processes have been discovered. One of the most extensively studied and best understood oscillating processes is the Belousov–Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction, which in its original version involves the oxidation of organic compounds with bromate ions and catalyzed with redox metal catalyst. It is well-known that oscillations in the BZ process are mainly due to complex, multistep reduction processes of bromate ions, which allow positive and negative feedback loops to develop in kinetic mechanisms in a manner that destabilizes the steady-state. In line with this finding, removal of the metal catalyst under appropriate conditions allowed the oscillations to persist, and in this way, a wide class of uncatalyzed bromate oscillators (UBOs) was discovered. In such systems, various organic substrates can be used, e.g., phenols and anilines, as well as non-aromatic compounds, which upon oxidation form stable semiquinone radical intermediates that are capable of substituting the role of a redox catalyst.

we demonstrated that AgI can directly replace ZnII in zinc fingers (ZFs). The cooperative binding of AgI to ZFs leads to a thermodynamically irreversible formation of silver clusters destroying the native ZF structure. Thus, a reported loss of biological function of ZF proteins is a likely consequence of such replacement. Here, we report an X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) study of AgnSn clusters formed in ZFs to probe their structural features. Selective probing of the local environment around AgI by XAS showed the predominance of digonal AgI coordination to two sulfur donors, coordinated with an average Ag−S distance at 2.41 Å. No Ag−N bonds were present. A mixed AgS2/AgS3 geometry was found solely in the CCCH AgI−ZF. We also show that cooperative replacement of ZnII ions with the studied Ag2S2 clusters occurred in a three-ZF transcription factor protein 1MEY#, leading to a dissociation of 1MEY# from the complex with its cognate DNA."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058080154","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"61","pagesFromTo":"1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202116621","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65560ea140970749a8185e04","name":"Béla","lastName":"Gyurcsik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d1a7218c-58e7-4056-9df4-d4c5e14f1e31"},{"objectId":"65560ea140970749a8185e03","name":"Bálint","lastName":"Hajdu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"733be4fd-a484-47e6-b1bd-caad53342c3d"},{"objectId":"65560ea140970749a8185e02","name":"Aurélien","lastName":"Deniaud","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9c24eb36-282a-46fc-8b40-b459259c6b1d"},{"objectId":"65560ea140970749a8185e01","name":"Giulia","lastName":"Veronesi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1ac12ac1-aad7-4017-b751-fcbcca7a77d6"},{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f33","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Bal","uuid":"BC7547A83D7C3DD2ECEFDEED4DED5E66E72E5CACBBF3368EA0E443422B3520C41AA3020383EB2D27DFDE1A7722CAA1DB1746E39FC5D5B9999A9BA2411C512C6F","orcidId":"0000-0003-3780-083X","documentHash":"1c7f75d0-84b1-4a49-a88f-bb5c2f7fc2c2"},{"objectId":"5e7093da878c28a0473b1eb8","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kluska","uuid":"C318808B08434FFAFDFF6C888502C748CF9B0BF4811D5FCC4CF81815CB1F5D09A07B588D73CB63A0A0F85DB326F8C20A153AFB0167B68661C09005CC61AAA728","orcidId":"0000-0002-7055-1145","documentHash":"be0eab88-6d4c-4ce9-9287-f1500e42571d"},{"objectId":"5e70922f878c28a047391543","name":"Artur","lastName":"Krężel","uuid":"B9D2A5A84C66F4B6D17103F16A44DE8515B079D734077E466577D5696FCFE95D56ABDBFFE5E0B774026B2CEDBF5EFC60EB0D9309A2074B3AB47DBCD2BB5C0F2C","orcidId":"0000-0001-9252-5784","documentHash":"2339af98-437b-4876-b932-4c2f840a94de"}],"doi":"10.1002/anie.202116621"},{"mainLanguageName":"wiele języków","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-966-7530-59-4","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Маркетингові комунікації в сучасному мінливому середовищі","mainLanguage":"mul","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":"Київ","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"622b518f2467f040f244ccd7","editors":[{"objectId":"622b518f2467f040f244ccd9","name":"Є.

The primary gas\npollution concern is CO2, CH4, and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Environmental catalysis plays a pivotal\nrole in NOx mitigation (DeNOx). This study investigated, for the first time, a collection of ceramic\nfoams as potential catalyst support for selective catalytic NOx reduction (SCR). Ceramic foams could\nbe an attractive support option for NOx removal. However, we should functionalize the surface of\nraw foams for such applications. A library of ceramic SiC, Al2O3, and ZrO2 foams ornamented with\nnanorod ZnO and TiO2 as W and V oxide support was obtained for the first time. We characterized\nthe surface layer coating structure using the XPS, XRF and SEM, and TEM microscopy to optimize\nthe W to V molar ratio and examine NO2 mitigation as the SCR model, which was tested only\nvery rarely. Comparing TiO2 and ZnO systems reveals that the SCR conversion on ZnO appeared\nsuperior vs. the conversion on TiO2, while the SiC-supported catalysts were less efficient than Al2O3\nand ZrO2-supported catalysts.

aim of the present study was to analyze the impact of cheese fragmentation and packaging on the dynamics of water–fat serum released from pasta filata cheese made from cow’s milk and its mixture with sheep’s milk. The addition of sheep’s milk reduced the amount of leachate from the vacuum-packed cheeses and did not cause as much loss of gloss as in the case of cow’s milk cheeses. This was also reflected in the microscopic images of the cheese samples. Consumers showed less acceptance of cow’s milk pasta filata cheeses than cheeses made with a mixture of cow’s and sheep’s milk (they had the same fat content, acidity, hardness, and oiling-off, but better stretching). The data describing water–fat serum release from pasta filata cheese within 24 h of unpacking was modeled with the use of the feed-forward artificial neural networks, whose architecture is based on Multi-Layer Perceptron with a single hidden layer. The model inputs comprised four independent variables, including one quantitative (i.e., time) and the other qualitative ones, which had the following states: type of raw material (cow’s milk, cow-sheep’s milk), way of sample portioning (whole, quarters, slices), packing method (vacuum packed and packed in brine)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058080181","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61ee75342467f068913d308e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"11","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"74f4943d-7af8-4e64-8257-02deff670da0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"296","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/11/3/296/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602f6e3b9543c7410626f497","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Biegalski","uuid":"8834D592732C396A6F7A74A6BA75AE0628E0A6909EFA8E78BE24D40E5DBEDE4D7E24658396AD86C4D85892801FF39112481AA0792F98CF814091212147F6701C","orcidId":"0000-0001-5749-7300","documentHash":"33b4ed82-4610-4e5a-bb54-48e4a1f75d3a"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a648c","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Wawrzyniak","uuid":"96F5A7321610C0D16E561818EC71A794727A15907D31E0AF0D4063ED09550B4E4FD0A0487081D94CDC97B339C0D353F6A8BCE43FCE41E385D07BCE7E65776C8B","orcidId":"0000-0002-6720-891X","documentHash":"93946d17-8f2b-4c2d-92f4-fc14e5bd4133"},{"objectId":"5e709345878c28a0473a622d","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Cais-Sokolińska","uuid":"D7812E3613083175BD23533B1A10AE9AE00974EAFB6A6FE6076A9329E74C4CC01D7F989E348D87852CB7521812D15B985BA521B72099771C0383603498E4784E","orcidId":"0000-0003-1174-1915","documentHash":"46eaea00-cf14-4342-8521-8886961f2e85"}],"doi":"10.3390/foods11030296"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ketamine","morphine","neuropathic pain","buprenorphine","mirogabalin","oxycodone"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c1878c28a0473b040b","5e70925e878c28a047394815","5e7093de878c28a0473b2354"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Mirogabalin decreases pain-like behaviours and improves opioid and ketamine antinociception in a mouse model of neuropathic pain","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceed","mniswId":"15947","title":"Pharmaceuticals","doi":null,"issn":"1424-8247","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"56669e7d-d4d7-4326-aa65-87a9099a9b18"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-15","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6228ac152467f0086c9d9c3b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64cd2ff24097077ac1dd54cb","64cd2ff24097077ac1dd54cc","64cd2ff24097077ac1dd54cd","5e7093de878c28a0473b2354","64cd2ff24097077ac1dd54ce","64cd2ff24097077ac1dd54cf","64cd2ff24097077ac1dd54d0","5e7093c1878c28a0473b040b","5e70925e878c28a047394815"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Neuropathic pain remains a difficult clinical challenge due to its diverse aetiology and complex pathomechanisms, which are yet to be fully understood. Despite the variety of available therapies, many patients suffer from ineffective pain relief; hence, the search for more efficacious treatments continues. The new gabapentinoid, mirogabalin has recently been approved for clinical use. Although its main mechanism of action occurs at the α2σ-1 and α2σ-2 subunits of calcium channels and is well documented, how the drug affects the disturbed neuropathic interactions at the spinal cord level has not been clarified, which is crucial information from a clinical perspective. The findings of our study suggest that several indirect mechanisms may be responsible for the beneficial analgesic effect of mirogabalin. This is the first study to report that mirogabalin enhances the mRNA expression of spinal antinociceptive factors, such as IL-10 and IL-18BP, and reduces the concentration of the pronociceptive substance P. Importantly, mirogabalin improves the morphine-, buprenorphine-, oxycodone-, and ketamine-induced antinociceptive effects in a neuropathic pain model.

The results are based on the 113 discharges performed in the plasma-focus PF-24 device operated with D2, Ar and (100%-x)D2+xAr mixtures, with Ar pressure fractions x ≈ 3–60% (mole fractions). The constant initial total pressure is about 2.9 mbar and the constant initial pressure of Ar is 1.2 mbar. Each experimental discharge was simulated individually using the 5-phase Lee model code to carry out the fitting procedure of the total discharge current waveform. The results from these 113 computed discharges fitted to the corresponding 113 experimental discharges show that the increase of the effective atomic number of the gas mixture increases the probability of occurrence of plasma radiative compression phenomenon. Relatively weak radiative compression was found for part of the discharges in 15–60% range of Ar mole fractions and in Ar, while the stronger radiative compression occurred for part of discharges in Ar only. This is because there was too little total x-ray line radiation emission during the equilibrium pinch lifetime related to the very small amount of swept up mass and the low current flow through pinched plasma, represented by the decreasing values of model parameters as the Ar mole fraction increases. The results show that the main pinch parameters influencing the occurrence and strength of radiative compression are: total x-ray line emission yield, effective atomic number, initial pinch radius, initial pinch ion number density and initial pinch ion/electron temperature."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058080214","journalIssue":{"objectId":"622b37b82467f040f2447382","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"182","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"039cce81-3d0e-4aa9-9cd1-9e7030edeff5"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"182","pagesFromTo":"110118","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969804322000215","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"622b37b82467f040f2447380","name":"S.H.","lastName":"Saw","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"99522251-32b3-4ff2-8daa-6f7f7677d833"},{"objectId":"622b37b82467f040f244737e","name":"S.","lastName":"Lee","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1598-0879","documentHash":"1fa9c687-e6ae-45e9-a33a-9401cd0745dc"},{"objectId":"622b37b82467f040f244737c","name":"M.","lastName":"Akel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cb3b3124-376e-433a-9ca4-62e702cdcc94"},{"objectId":"5ed7126a7523404d1000e8b5","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Marciniak","uuid":"62F03032A056AC12C88714A7AFC045CFDB7A4A44426A27BFCF899E2B7B62C69C78D505878E2BC030F010CD14C03C7374772B3EC63D061E7FCA09C5C9DA6ACA9D","orcidId":"0000-0001-7841-2142","documentHash":"cebfa2d1-30ad-4647-8845-b0c77275e895"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a73","name":"Marek","lastName":"Scholz","uuid":"11C87DFB0456A6251E0009F7B6D8C03B548B87CC1DB665C3B42BFB245EE158E8047B27770E03CD5F8B49879929EB5F4EB5DA5195D92FC6BE104E262E94A8B14A","orcidId":"0000-0002-7330-1782","documentHash":"6c4a6496-4360-4fc3-b857-4551febbc74b"},{"objectId":"5e7092cf878c28a04739d276","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kulińska","uuid":"8589CC164A0F00CD0AF75B266FE25FEA4539DDDB276B433CB086455D3437407204C26FE97BC0FE3EA7159BFE3160CAFB8735937A78843A0A66E6320E771C8014","orcidId":"0000-0002-7396-0841","documentHash":"b0401443-54cb-4e93-accb-df99e0beabc4"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.apradiso.2022.110118"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["inclusion; school; pupils; parents; teachers; PE teachers; well-being"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"608135d42467f0276870e0c9","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Instytut Nauk o Sporcie, Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

This opens unique prospects for material processing with X rays. However, any fundamental and applicational studies are in need of computational tools, able to predict material response to X-ray radiation. Here we present a dedicated computational approach developed to study X-ray induced transitions in a broad range of solid materials, including those of high chemical complexity. The latter becomes possible due to the implementation of the versatile density functional tight binding code DFTB+ to follow band structure evolution in irradiated materials. The outstanding performance of the implementation is demonstrated with a comparative study of XUV induced graphitization in diamond."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058080236","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1551","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-04775-1","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"622b2ebc2467f040f243faca","name":"Thomas","lastName":"Frauenheim","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4910a63e-a25f-4512-ae0a-1b37969a0a60"},{"objectId":"622b2ebc2467f040f243fac9","name":"Bálint","lastName":"Aradi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1b4c5d2e-8071-4dbe-b7b0-c1dc9e351a16"},{"objectId":"622b2ebc2467f040f243fac8","name":"Michal","lastName":"Stransky","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"09072db9-63a5-426b-83d9-647904b6a8a2"},{"objectId":"607658d99543c745d80e5ca3","name":"Vladimir","lastName":"Lipp","uuid":"6A9F33E1144401CE490F1888BCE380A4110E4E6ADB428BC9CD0843C55861CAAD489521DF4213B828012C2FCFA7437AD23581006BB83E5C84EEDE2EE91AA0B695","orcidId":"0000-0002-5828-2296","documentHash":"04c639e5-3f3b-4452-8d4b-e2cd998d7b7a"},{"objectId":"5e7094f5878c28a0473c7eb6","name":"Victor","lastName":"Tkachenko","uuid":"9570A0EFEE5F690180C903479800FBB8088CA832359E05D4E18E07828D414430B57A13C12F5A6F09D8AC9E222230D71C871BFFAA7210ED75AE1E4676BAC2E876","orcidId":"0000-0002-0245-145X","documentHash":"8313849b-46a5-45dc-821c-9a1d56095f24"},{"objectId":"5e7092cf878c28a04739d2b0","name":"Beata","lastName":"Ziaja-Motyka","uuid":"2F065653D563FFA25584369CCCF2731ECD9037B4555D87F2172CA99D97FD2B1D48BD26215F10AF1BCA7B7BADE30D0F3D761DE58E49D7CE985DF8B461DDB4E86F","orcidId":"0000-0003-0172-0731","documentHash":"f09378fe-66fe-47ac-84b4-9a0c2135cc52"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-022-04775-1"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["covid-19","pandemia","coronavirus","przekrój stop zwrotu","obligacje skarbowe","zmienność"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19 pandemic","coronavirus","Policy responses","Government bonds","Sovereign bond","Term spread","Term structure","Interest rates"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Term spreads and the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from international sovereign bond markets","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477ccb","mniswId":"6595","title":"Finance Research Letters","doi":null,"issn":"1544-6123","eissn":"1544-6131","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"40f30245-e4ef-44f6-aceb-0e36eba0c72e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-04-05","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2021,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"622737832467f01c211e6008","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ac878c28a0473aed7e","6409ac9d40970770356c04f1","6409ac9d40970770356c04f2","6409ac9d40970770356c04f3"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the term structure of interest rates.

The aim of this work was to develop a prediction model for FIT Treadmill Score (“FIT” refers to Henry Ford ExercIse Testing (FIT) Project) that only depends on easily accessible somatic data and smoking without the need to perform the exercise test anymore. The study comprised 146 men with a negative cardiological history, aged 26–60, with desk-jobs. By means of regression analysis it was tested to what degree obesity-related indices as well as smoking cigarettes allow for determining the measure level of mortality risk, without the necessity of performing an exercise test. The following independent variables were entered into the linear regression model: age, BMI, Fat%, waist circumference (WC), waist to height ratio (WHtR) as well as smoking. Statistically significant factors were singled out from among them. The obtained model accounts for a significant part (over 87%) of the variability of the mortality risk measure among the tested population. Based on the value of the standardised regression coefficient β, it can be stated that age is the factor that mostly determines the mortality risk measure, followed by the WHtR and smoking. The simplicity of the worked-out model and, resulting from it, the possibility of its common application should enable better health monitoring of working-age men with regard to cardiovascular disease occurrence and, related to it, mortality risk, thereby improving the quality of public health management."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058080241","journalIssue":{"objectId":"621cce712467f05c96102e26","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"19","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"ab9774db-07b5-4b3f-826f-68625e5f36ce"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/5/2643","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"658f160c4097076c145d81b4","name":"Maria","lastName":"Zadarko-Domaradzka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b9f3924f-f0bd-4a9a-bfb8-e1e5b212fff5"},{"objectId":"658f160c4097076c145d81b3","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Barabasz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c055c3f-7829-4794-a049-085d2d6914be"},{"objectId":"658f160c4097076c145d81b2","name":"Emilian","lastName":"Zadarko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3d197fa2-ca57-4aee-a183-a4060aee3fed"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395254","name":"Marek","lastName":"Sobolewski","uuid":"D2DA90733D3521960960080A6C956608ECE28E733E9C9AF307AF121B87C077F66C69EEA930CEC1FD7A6DCFE38DE7C42DB4F0AFCCF93D199A189E3ADACA283915","orcidId":"0000-0001-6564-8877","documentHash":"12da6aed-9181-48af-ad04-31cc6a2d0074"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19052643"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["decision trees","vehicles","vibration","signal processing methods","self-diagnostic system"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f96a","uid":"bWloMXITqmA_jSriG1R5sgQ","uuid":"daecab56-4e6e-4b3f-8e0a-8013357bb435","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Wydział Inżynierii Lądowej i Transportu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70934f878c28a0473a6e76"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Diagnostics of the drive shaft bearing based on vibrations in the high-frequency range as a part of the vehicle's self-diagnostic system","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477a5b","mniswId":"5536","title":"Eksploatacja i Niezawodnosc","doi":null,"issn":"1507-2711","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"5f2688c4-6c96-48f7-a83e-7c08b1d689b3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6226916f2467f0548a052401","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70934f878c28a0473a6e76","5e7093a9878c28a0473aea33"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058080246","journalIssue":{"objectId":"627389094097072000598e90","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"24","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"b9e87693-5098-4a58-b355-d9bc46844203"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"70 - 79","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://ein.org.pl/sites/default/files/2022-01-09.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473aea33","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Komorski","uuid":"1D516F01BD2AD3E37748247CE8C94B8BFC3D86F805B3D63DDB14A6AE6B6199CDE264795E522895BEC245CD4D79B292643ADC491FECFEC4BDCB0CF590BD37E5EE","orcidId":"0000-0003-3213-3855","documentHash":"ae9d5585-3f21-4eac-b853-831f76ec4a49"},{"objectId":"5e70934f878c28a0473a6e76","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Nowakowski","uuid":"82D81D47F18787FCEED9EB5F3E4688C61267EEBBDCA2B19523F4862CAFBDB20AFD30014EE309E351A6A02272557452B4E43F465A57B3EA92BA2BA29542CCC18A","orcidId":"0000-0001-5415-7052","documentHash":"3243bb0a-a2c4-42bb-84d4-d48512f12625"}],"doi":"10.17531/ein.2022.1.9"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Tourette Syndrome","Tic","Chronic disorder","Pain","Pain intensity","Pain coping strategies"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","uid":"bqEBivGW4eOgmsFFDSCuw-g","uuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","parentUuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","rootUuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego i Sportu im.

A known ROS generator, pesticide paraquat (PQ), was indicated as an environmental substance potentially increasing the incidence of PD and is used to model this disease. We investigated if a combination of inflammation and oxidative stress in subthreshold doses would exacerbate the modelled neuropathology.\n\nMethods: We examined the late effects of acute or repeated peripheral inflammation induced by low dose of LPS (10 μg/kg, ip) on PQ toxicity in the rat nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, microglial activation markers and expression of major Lewy bodies proteins, α-synuclein and synphilin-1.\n\nResults: We observed that LPS increased, while PQ decreased body temperature and microglia CD11b expression in the SN. Single LPS pretreatment, 3 h before repeated weekly PQ injections (4×) slightly aggravated neuronal degeneration in the SN. Moreover, degeneration of dopaminergic neurons after weekly repeated inflammation itself (4×) was observed. Interestingly, repeated LPS administration combined with each PQ dose counteracted such effect. The expression of α-synuclein decreased after repeated LPS injections, while only combined, repeated LPS and PQ treatment lowered the levels of synphilin-1. Therefore, α-synuclein and synphilin-1 expression change was influenced by different mechanisms. Concomitantly, decreased levels of the two proteins correlated with decreased degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and with a normalized microglia activation marker.\n\nConclusions: Our results indicate that both oxidative insult triggered by PQ and inflammation caused by peripheral LPS injection can individually induce neurotoxicity.

In the case of hydraulic solutions, there are also some applications of AM technology related to topological optimization, anti-cavitation improvements, etc. An examination of all available research results shows that authors are using specialized tools and machines to properly prepare AM spare parts. The main aim of this paper is to analyze the influence of quick repair of the damaged slipper-retainer from an axial piston pump by using an AM spare part. Hence, it was prepared with a 100-h test campaign of the AM spare part, which covers the time between damage and supply of the new pump. The material of the slipper-retainer has been identified and replaced by another material—available as a powder for AM, with similar properties as the original. The obtained spare part had been subjected to sandblasting only to simulate extremely rough conditions, directly after the AM process and an analysis of the influence of the high surface roughness of AM part on wear measurements. The whole test campaign has been divided into nine stages. After each stage, microscopic measurements of the pump parts’ surface roughness were made. To determine roughness with proper measurements, a microscopical investigation was conducted. The final results revealed that it is possible to replace parts in hydraulic pumps with the use of AM. The whole test campaign caused a significant increase in the surface roughness of the pump’s original parts, which was worked with the AM spare slipper-retainer: (1) from Ra = 0.54 µm to Ra = 3.84 µm in the case of two tested pistons; (2) from Ra = 0.33 µm to Ra = 1.98 µm in the case of the slipper-retainer. Despite significant increases in the surface roughness of the pump’s parts, the whole test campaign has been successfully finished without any damages to the other important parts of the whole hydraulic test rig."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058080284","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/6/1995","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebeda7e752340254fc418cc","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Łuszczek","uuid":"380B9A85FE20C8DF1FC5715B28666C2C5CB6DFC4C5D4350630E3841F607041F7EF1B76DB8E5FB7DD0CFEFC85027C573E5E695AC73246EF69CAE8E8F255CE3E4F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6441-3881","documentHash":"349adced-2494-42af-b09d-bb10fd2268dc"},{"objectId":"5ebecab0752340226956f8ea","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Klimek","uuid":"9C9B1D600B6F38C366DC4189B884B189D7E1C4875795816FF4C9DF42BB0B3D81443BFFC4CC797941BCCE3B4E85CE5CDFCF1C8642640C799F9BBD69FE09FF37C5","orcidId":"0000-0002-2669-1087","documentHash":"364381e5-5e85-4428-9b48-bfa071570096"},{"objectId":"5e709390878c28a0473ace8c","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Małek","uuid":"F1564F77B1B204F94BAFA7E480B3C9372506C65B2CBA389970E6928802462E8496F62DDCD135B93316D4287AA78934848BF04A12A5BDA74A983E70F87F1350F4","orcidId":"0000-0001-5086-3574","documentHash":"3d8057fd-52eb-47b0-83d6-3ad04ce3c3c8"},{"objectId":"5e70930c878c28a0473a1d6c","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Kluczyński","uuid":"A0BE04B257DB849480238ADD015FB4B4CE158DFE0CEF9552BE3E4B9C401A94B79F4BD63395F6D460E655293EE59F4F1F664FD227186A1B33A1C94E8470FBD5FC","orcidId":"0000-0002-6058-965X","documentHash":"2569dd81-630d-4d86-8589-c33d83df0d61"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a0473994b5","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Grzelak","uuid":"E9564761C15144BAF05ED3E8D4E0B3C8AF4B49E0B62A905A085169212D3E2014BED64CAC7FEA20E11697B9241A42FB87154ED5B03433E36DD5FC5288AF620E86","orcidId":"0000-0003-0675-1983","documentHash":"33f49ad9-f27b-430b-ac72-4403007531f1"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398ece","name":"Adam","lastName":"Bartnicki","uuid":"AB8B12D3ECCD788DC17F09169599DC1025C1ABE143E810D93DB756BA01A6B22C2CFBE21F56C2D40533CCE9FDA21DF00AB6542B076EA218175290AC76EBC9B7A3","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"055e71d3-5bd9-45d4-a8e3-f5d709f006dc"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15061995"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Modeling of the Drying Process of Apple Pomace","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-3417","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"976d1e86-5dd0-4e19-9276-7114f4dea573"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"622f2e062467f016697c70af","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["622f2e062467f016697c70b1","5f506a1b752340073806a8cc"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>Understanding biological materials is quite complicated.

Both analyzed Mg alloys were processed by conventional symmetric and asymmetric rolling (i.e., Differential Speed Rolling—DSR). The microstructure and texture were examined by EBSD and XRD, whereas the mechanical behavior was investigated by uniaxial tensile tests. DSR processing led to more effective grain refinement of both TZ61 and AZ61 sheets. However, a high fraction of Mg2Sn phase precipitates in the TZ61 sheets hindered grain growth what resulted in their smaller grain size as compared to AZ61 sheets. DSR processing lowered also the basal texture intensity in the TZ61 and AZ61 sheets. A unique basal poles splitting was observed for the as-rolled TZ61 alloy, while AZ61 alloy exhibited a typical single-peak basal texture. Finally, the reduced grain size and weakened basal texture by DSR processing caused increase of plasticity of the annealed TZ61 and AZ61 sheets. Nevertheless, the annealed AZ61 sheets showed higher uniform elongation and strength (as compared to TZ61 ones), which has been attributed to their significantly lower texture intensity and greater ability to strain hardening.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058080296","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15030785","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65c9fab140970762634b202c","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Jóźwik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d2cc4c25-a726-4aff-8774-ae1e3126ed1d"},{"objectId":"65c9fab140970762634b202b","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Majchrowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"73a1afe1-f70e-4602-b5dc-006c82898c87"},{"objectId":"5e70946c878c28a0473bca12","name":"Witold","lastName":"Chromiński","uuid":"F4A1411F9C3CC8B6D0CC1E8B5A2FCAB62F879D4D3B5D54567CD23C67404AB68BA6CA610B213FE0EC9A27DBAC871F6E1837252BD40335FE3E7D936BE9C98D47BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-5345-7667","documentHash":"2edb84d1-882b-4b9c-8efe-859ad37311b1"},{"objectId":"5e7093d0878c28a0473b13f7","name":"Bogusława","lastName":"Adamczyk-Cieślak","uuid":"B20278DCD209882A5B1F692F9359911549207C8C61645792E7E0947923019F873570F669763FC4BCA6094F0C679876E13C92A456070060E46BB0D24A2D76A707","orcidId":"0000-0002-1209-0256","documentHash":"0ecbff37-a1a2-41aa-a9c7-b3abd0ce5a92"},{"objectId":"5e7092e5878c28a04739ee1a","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Pakieła","uuid":"31D9886AF4A53AB269C00533CFF2305E26DE0FC8513E1A0FFAB34A3D19B940BCE1E42F11958BDC50B8ED9A8337D42A41188091003360D67B3EC3B9E839FA6B70","orcidId":"0000-0003-2825-5526","documentHash":"51c3bf27-8dfa-44ca-918d-c62efd8d1fbd"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15030785"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["silicones","silanes","silicon oxides"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":"9783110643671","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e4","uid":"b2N_4mCWY4MZQR859ZyUYfQ","uuid":"d4b4e046-1c04-4e25-87d9-c751702f5048","parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e4","parentUuid":"d4b4e046-1c04-4e25-87d9-c751702f5048","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a0473856e4","rootUuid":"d4b4e046-1c04-4e25-87d9-c751702f5048","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Instytut Włókiennictwa","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709269878c28a047395415"]}],"type":"BOOK","title":"Silicon-Based Polymers and Materials","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":424,"publicationPlace":"Niemcy","translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6228a1a92467f0086c9d7634","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709269878c28a047395415"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Silicon based materials and polymers are made of silicon containing polymers, mainly macromolecular siloxanes (silicones).

To determine section resistance, the nonlinear material law for concrete in compression is assumed according to Eurocode 2, taking into account the effect of concrete softening. It adequately describes the concrete behavior of RC members up to failure. The idealized stress–strain relation for the reinforcing steel is assumed. For the ring cross-section subjected to bending with axial force and for areas weakened by an opening, normalized resistances have been derived by integrating corresponding equilibrium equations. They are presented in the form of interaction curves and compared with the results of testing conducted on RC eccentrically loaded columns. Furthermore, the ultimate normalized bending moment has been derived for the RC rectangle subjected to bending without axial force. It was applied to the cross-sectional analysis of steel and concrete composite beams consisting of the RC rectangular core located inside a reversed TT-welded profile. Comparative analysis indicated good agreements between the proposed section models and experimental data. The objective of the paper is the dimensioning optimization of the considered cross-sections with the fulfillment of structural safety requirements."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058080315","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/5/1957/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092cf878c28a04739d349","name":"Marek","lastName":"Lechman","uuid":"17D96969D178ECCD8180ECA89A3636F9040FC13F6AA6CE3D9731A09D28F6659E636059E553E2B960E68AECD03D59B2090FCE133FD3158E178D3A4F60A3C95442","orcidId":"0000-0003-1380-2881","documentHash":"49d25f72-2c82-4da8-813c-02294fbb2e9a"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15051957"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Endometrioma","Lipidomic","FT-IR","PCA","PLS","VIP"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","uid":"bdkLR6wGCrp59lwUjwb_dMA","uuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","parentUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","rootUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","name":"Instytut Fizyki Jądrowej im.

There is no certain serum marker for the diagnosis of endometriosis. This study aims to research the correlation between the amount of peaks corresponding to proteins and lipids with the volume of endometrioma and determine the chemical structure of blood serum collected from women suffering from endometriosis patients with endometrioma and healthy subjects using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. FTIR spectroscopy is used as a non-invasive diagnostic technique for the discrimination of endometriosis women with endometrioma and control blood sera. The FTIR spectra of 100 serum samples acquired from 50 patients and 50 healthy individuals were used for this study. For this purpose, multivariate analyses such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Partial Last Square analysis (PLS) with Variables Importance in Projection (VIP), and probability models, were performed. Our results showed that FTIR range 1500 cm<sup>-1</sup> and 1700 cm<sup>-1</sup> and around 2700 cm<sup>-1</sup> – 3000 cm<sup>-1</sup>, regions may be used for the diagnosis of endometriosis. Also, we find that proteins and lipids fraction increase with the volume of endometrioma.

It is well known that the universal model of cell-membrane structure is the lipid bilayer, which constitutes the environment for integral and surface membrane proteins. Thus, much attention has been given to the study of the organization and properties of these structures concerning both experimental and theoretical aspects. As systematic examinations are impeded by the complexity of the natural membranes, the best approach to conduct detailed physical and chemical studies of biological membranes is to use simplified well-defined model lipid membranes. These models can be used to obtain information on the properties of real biological membranes and associated electrochemical reactions. Among the most commonly used are liposomes, planar lipid membranes, membranes on solid substrates, and lipid monolayers on the free surface."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058080370","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61f3d38a2467f061bc104c27","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"c493d7a9-2fcb-45b9-95b4-69b009798079"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"248","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0375/12/2/248/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709213878c28a04738f85f","name":"Monika","lastName":"Naumowicz","uuid":"11BCF7871E97C753C094C0C978EFF07E7D17D3F5BAF29DC27C6617F254F6BCC5ED83CBB3902D64DA5942FD2130BA0B097894F93FF964B4F0F25DB06E1B2D93BF","orcidId":"0000-0001-5229-1805","documentHash":"5a3a076a-327a-4b69-9a77-872f1a924b69"}],"doi":"10.3390/membranes12020248"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["potato","drought","drought stress tolerance","yield","machine learning"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","uid":"bmfkTgrYux51kKuOA70Q27Q","uuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","parentUuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","rootUuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","name":"Instytut Hodowli i Aklimatyzacji Roślin - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fd878c28a0473b4818","5e709400878c28a0473b49d3"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","uid":"bQp8ITDzg_V-1GFpvOVvvtg","uuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","parentUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","rootUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","name":"Politechnika Opolska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a4878c28a0473ae55c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Classification of Potato Varieties Drought Stress Tolerance Using Supervised Learning","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-3417","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ff202409-59bf-494e-82ae-6802b8fb2444"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-12","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62287adf2467f0086c9c2f8b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093fd878c28a0473b4818","5e7093a4878c28a0473ae55c","5e709400878c28a0473b49d3"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The presented study was aimed at investigating the variability for drought tolerance among potato cultivars. To achieve this, the stability of drought tolerance of potato cultivars under different water regime conditions was inspected during 11 years of consecutive experiments. The data on 50 potato cultivars’ responses to drought stress, based on the morphological features of plants, i.e., leaf and stem mass and size of the assimilation area, have been collected. The tuber yield, as well as calculated plant tolerance indexes and Climatic Water Balance for each growing season, were analyzed. The studied cultivars were later assigned into one of three tolerance groups for soil drought. The highest linear relationship was found between the mass of leaves and stems and the tuber yield but was found too weak to raise any conclusions. Thus, the ensemble learning models have been evaluated and returned better performance results, and the final classifier is the implementation of extreme gradient boosting. The final classifier of the 96.7% accuracy, which used several measured potato parameters (Relative yield decrease, Stem mass, Maturity, Assimilation area, Leaves mass, Yield per plant, calculated Climatic water balance, and indices: MSTI and DSI) that could distinguish the different tolerance groups were evaluated in the study."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058080378","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/4/1939","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b49d3","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Zarzyńska","uuid":"FD18E191A4E77511EB656C945F341B92A3A1353B2B55883BF35001EA453983B8751CEC2F8E6A2FF32FC1F8AA35FBD744AB7889FADACC2116DFDD319A9DC913E3","orcidId":"0000-0002-8747-2785","documentHash":"b1cc1d55-0873-4a24-b519-0098fae049e2"},{"objectId":"5e7093fd878c28a0473b4818","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Boguszewska-Mańkowska","uuid":"381CFA06887E23FE70114EA406C2171E45AB64CE7C2A69E9DDAEA1ABE1CC5D797EADE165CF8373F88245B6CD8977F37D4D161A63EACD304CF85C5849544E7529","orcidId":"0000-0002-2815-7507","documentHash":"9840416d-7c54-4f1a-ae01-23a48e440256"},{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae55c","name":"BOGDAN","lastName":"RUSZCZAK","uuid":"93EFC4C6F755D52E1BC37A02798E1717CB83A6B8E12C85B24C9A7D932697E5B6418F7291C2E519FE3524DDF503D4ECC18C9129D694502F6FB217B7396587BFDD","orcidId":"0000-0003-1089-1778","documentHash":"c7a3af68-7883-4704-a0cb-214ae6142c67"}],"doi":"10.3390/app12041939"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709344878c28a0473a61f9","5e709347878c28a0473a6443","5e709346878c28a0473a6335","5e7093a6878c28a0473ae752","5e709347878c28a0473a641f"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","uid":"bmfkTgrYux51kKuOA70Q27Q","uuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","parentUuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","rootUuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","name":"Instytut Hodowli i Aklimatyzacji Roślin - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fd878c28a0473b488c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Assessment of Antimicrobial Properties of Phenolic Acid Extracts from Grain Infected with Fungi from the Genus Fusarium","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":null,"issn":"1420-3049","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"8615ffac-9999-41cd-9658-bd5ed633cde5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-07","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6231a2072467f05185345073","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093a6878c28a0473ae752","5e709347878c28a0473a641f","5e709344878c28a0473a61f9","5e7093fd878c28a0473b488c","5e709346878c28a0473a6335","5e709347878c28a0473a6443"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Problems related with biological contamination of plant origin raw materials have a considerable effect on prevention systems at each stage of food production.

This study evaluated the antimicrobial action of phenolic acids extracts obtained from both naturally infested and inoculated with microorganisms. For this purpose a total of 24 cereal cultivars were selected, including 9 winter and 15 spring cultivars. The analyses showed a bactericidal effect in the case of 4 extracts against Micrococcus luteus (ML), 14 extracts against Pseudomonas fluorescence (PF), 17 extracts against Escherichia coli (EC) as well as 16 extracts against Proteus mirabilis (PM). It was found that 3 out of the 24 extracts showed no antibacterial activity. In turn, fungicidal action was observed in the case of 17 extracts against Fusarium culmorum (FC) (NIV), 16 extracts against FC (3AcDON), 12 extracts against Fusarium graminearum (FG) (3AcDON), while 12 other extracts showed antifungal action against FG (NIV) and 19 extracts against Fusarium langsethiae (FL). Based on the conducted analyses it was found that grain of small-grained cereals exposed to fungal infection is a source of bioactive compounds exhibiting antimicrobial properties. It was observed that the qualitative and quantitative profiles of polyphenols vary depending on the cereal cultivar. This extracts may be used to develop an antimicrobial preparation applicable in organic farming."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058080386","journalIssue":{"objectId":"621df3822467f06798e19629","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"27","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"77e1d5b8-5340-4fcb-bdb6-7ed6aba85477"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"1741","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/5/1741/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093fd878c28a0473b488c","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Góral","uuid":"C85DC0954B57788A31F486A6CEDA6691BDA5B5CAE7336B6DCB1FB44945AEBF93334BADAE3697DCAC1A5CBFDEECF24841B1B57D42C7AE8DBA3691ED4F3E3B59DC","orcidId":"0000-0001-9130-6109","documentHash":"200513e0-de2f-4dc1-b107-8c1223a69b5d"},{"objectId":"5e7093a6878c28a0473ae752","name":"Anna","lastName":"Przybylska-Balcerek","uuid":"FD028685D64F6D3DDB5DB322BFEBB748BDE89D59C3F5A3B72AAA3E6E3C6E2E9C34355CC26DF1BA7252C962BA63E5F9EEAD5E0A27D36291525955C55664400D8C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0481-6416","documentHash":"1a1d809c-97d0-4729-994f-cf531b96ee0d"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6443","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Stuper-Szablewska","uuid":"89458AD33E90F7D5DA9FFF004F3ED6F9D46DD48F28D476632DF610494D078B410E9A695A0F8B865E8D5320F2B388403A8BCDD94A880E282F730324D9B26CDFC3","orcidId":"0000-0002-9011-8592","documentHash":"4c7eab1d-0090-4e50-a0ef-5e15d76ef13b"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a641f","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Szablewski","uuid":"DABDF95B3C9D44CA2EADC955C209C3C39E0D7B187A17449B14D35C834F55F271626F03A960C73EF6E094EF9EE160B878AE77D97777EE7DCB14F4CE0D22E80C5F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6076-8095","documentHash":"265568ef-0520-45d1-8ee8-29d19822d918"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a6335","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Kurasiak-Popowska","uuid":"541F2810A797DAC76274D6EED85ECBC9570192FB621B62F4D24067C020EDC0A042ADBCD41D147E57D2C59784EEB85EDEA16F496FA45E07C25FD320A357F86F34","orcidId":"0000-0002-2214-406X","documentHash":"c890ba30-77ae-40e0-a537-04ef8e478126"},{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a61f9","name":"Renata","lastName":"Cegielska-Radziejewska","uuid":"117859058E31AB8D52FCF638636E8150FB78BBD13C6BEE320F8B45FB54D0AD64D01DAE917D41ABD7E7E70F3CB03D882B314AFB7A2B8E12F46C6DA7DDC124AE51","orcidId":"0000-0002-3554-5276","documentHash":"8a4b55dd-929f-402f-9bc5-2461eb2fbb7b"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules27051741"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["accretion","accretion disks","radiation mechanisms: non-thermal","BL Lacertae objects: individual: RBS 2070","OJ 287","Mrk 501","S5 0716+714","methods: data analysis","X-rays: galaxies"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","uid":"bdkLR6wGCrp59lwUjwb_dMA","uuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","parentUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","rootUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","name":"Instytut Fizyki Jądrowej im.

In this work, we explored statistical properties of the X-ray variability in the blazars S5 0716+714, OJ 287, Mkn 501 and RBS 2070 using the archival observations from the XMM-Newton telescope between the period 2002–2020. Several methods of timing and spectral analyses including fractional variability, minimum variability timescale, power spectral density analyses and countrate distribution were performed. In addition, we fitted various spectral models to the observations as well as estimated hardness ratio. The results show that the sources are moderately variable within the intra-day timescale. Three of the four sources exhibited a clear bi-modal pattern in their countrate distribution revealing possible indication of two distinct countrate states, that is, hard and soft countrate states. The slope indices of the power spectral density were found to be centered around 0.5. Furthermore, the spectra of the sources were fitted with single power-law, broken power-law, log-parabolic and black-body+log-parabolic models (the latter only for OJ 287). We conclude that for most of the observations log-parabolic model was the best fit. The power spectral density analysis revealed the variable nature of PSD slopes in the source light curves. The results of this analysis could indicate the non-stationary nature of the blazar processes on intra-day timescales. The observed features can be explained within the context of current blazar models, in which the non-thermal emission mostly arises from kilo-parsec scale relativistic jets."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058080409","journalIssue":{"objectId":"622b38f72467f040f24475d3","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":"510","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"a1a12d1e-a64a-430f-af3a-1f7e482f1233"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"510","pagesFromTo":"5280-5301","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/mnras/advance-article/doi/10.1093/mnras/stab3738/6481631","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"622b38f72467f040f24475d1","name":"Zdeněk","lastName":"Stuchlík","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"990b2d0e-4774-4f7a-b0c7-59e680b95407"},{"objectId":"622b38f72467f040f24475d0","name":"Rajesh K","lastName":"Bachchan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f0e1340b-59cd-4699-b455-bf5403bc920a"},{"objectId":"622b38f72467f040f24475cf","name":"Suvas C","lastName":"Chaudhary","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b6f8980a-14fd-4741-8458-35037ffbd02b"},{"objectId":"622b38f72467f040f24475ce","name":"Adithiya","lastName":"Dinesh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1c03c54c-122b-4dce-952e-9e716af447a4"},{"objectId":"622b38f72467f040f24475cd","name":"Radim","lastName":"Pánis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5f4335e7-f30b-48dd-9954-77b167902019"},{"objectId":"622b38f72467f040f24475cc","name":"Niraj","lastName":"Dhital","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bc8d6fee-7400-45ec-b526-e5e19d3e78ca"},{"objectId":"622b38f72467f040f24475cb","name":"Tek P","lastName":"Adhikari","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c0883974-44d7-47c8-9143-a028b2c59e40"},{"objectId":"622b38f72467f040f24475c9","name":"Maksym","lastName":"Mohorian","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7453-2945","documentHash":"2e911911-770e-41a6-af5f-cc794bbc59f4"},{"objectId":"5e7094e9878c28a0473c6bb9","name":"Gopal","lastName":"Bhatta","uuid":"134D3E8CC42EFD623A1D8867E9DD64108CBE855A8F8AADBFDDF5D546E0FB1F252C27AF407759A67A2ECB25CB67559F71AB48CDD6FFD3B5F633CF8A986DB1B332","orcidId":"0000-0002-0705-6619","documentHash":"5f61a854-02eb-48b4-b2bd-48681da3b409"}],"doi":"10.1093/mnras/stab3738"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"61bd2d052467f07b6b6a4d67","doi":"10.4324/9781003144403","title":"The Digital Transformation of Healthcare : Health 4.0","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"9780367700508","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://kataloguek.cyfronet.pl/lib/item?id=chamo:101119&theme=uek","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"13f1e2fe-8d5e-4f21-a2d2-28de01e6972c","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb75f","mniswId":"2100","name":"Routledge","documentHash":"64cc346c-fb88-4618-a71a-f3105e672a66"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Law and Health 4.0","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"622b77602467f01c2139fa1d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709213878c28a04738f961"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058080417","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://kataloguek.cyfronet.pl/lib/item?id=chamo:101119&theme=uek","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709213878c28a04738f961","name":"Ambroży","lastName":"Mituś","uuid":"1FC40C6CD78C58B5856B1731AE7051FEACA1A6FA99527A06F2BD095011D163F16B9A77B9073B7C43A04EDA3E1CDEA952FB515F2BD8D549260B31BCF803F670BA","orcidId":"0000-0002-4546-3370","documentHash":"6c8bf119-b02d-4661-97c1-3f5ae0560e9c"}],"doi":"10.4324/9781003144403-12"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Monte Carlo radiation transport codes","Nuclear models","Neutron dosimetry","CR39","Proton therapy"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","uid":"bdkLR6wGCrp59lwUjwb_dMA","uuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","parentUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","rootUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","name":"Instytut Fizyki Jądrowej im.

Many pregnant women avoid or severely limit PA, leading to complications before and after delivery. This study elucidated the precise effect of each moderator variable on prenatal physical activity (PPA) by examining demographic factors, the PPA-related health belief level (HBL), and the current PPA level. The health belief model (HBM) in conjunction with the international prenatal physical activity questionnaire was used. The HBL in pregnant parous women (PPW) (3.42) was significantly higher than that in nonpregnant nulliparous women (NNW) (3.06). The PPA level in pregnant nulliparous women (PNW) (5.67 metabolic equivalent-hours per week (MET-h/week)) was lower than in the PPW (6.01 MET-h/week). All HBM dimensions (except for perceived barriers) were positively correlated with exercise expenditure in both PNW and PPW. According to the regression tree, participants in PNW aged ≤ 23 years with annual household incomes > CNY 100,001–150,000 had the highest energy expenditure (10.75 MET-h/week), whereas participants in PPW with a perceived benefit score of >4 had the highest energy expenditure (10 MET-h/week). The results demonstrated that the HBL in all groups was acceptable, whereas the PPA level was lower than the recommended PA level. In both PPW and PNW, the HBL was most strongly correlated with exercise expenditure. There is an urgent need to organize public-interest courses to alleviate household expenditure, raise the HBL about PPA in pregnant and NNW, and ensure personal health in the context of COVID-19."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058080441","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"3283","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/6/3283/htm","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"622b35582467f040f2441545","name":"Juan","lastName":"He","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"10a75421-3220-4441-ba32-2effec0c7767"},{"objectId":"622b35582467f040f2441544","name":"hongli","lastName":"yu","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8364-2081","documentHash":"2505a10e-6142-4a0a-a01b-2280ffa9e68e"},{"objectId":"5e70920c878c28a04738f17a","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szumilewicz","uuid":"5B103EED37ACB99B176A3ED6E03F672C38AD9B7AE8652BA222008AC60EFDF7BFDC3D8AB966D754117E8A0F44E0A04111BCA28D7025E64C2E443C94D617721D48","orcidId":"0000-0003-3777-5697","documentHash":"38ea620a-4420-4746-8215-264b210b3f99"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19063283"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["electrochemical and biomimetic deposition","FTIR","hydroxyapatite","monetite","SEM"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Some Aspects Concerning Titanium Coverage with Hydroxyapatite","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454771a4","mniswId":"1678","title":"Archives of Metallurgy and Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1733-3490","eissn":"2300-1909","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"31465388-e059-45ef-8709-2d30e94e9e8e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2022-02-14","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"622b118b2467f040f2433c16","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["622b118b2467f040f2433c17","622b118b2467f040f2433c18","622b118b2467f040f2433c19","622b118b2467f040f2433c1a","622b118c2467f040f2433c1b","622b118c2467f040f2433c1c","5e709202878c28a04738e819"]},"issue":"Iss.2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Generally, the metallic implants do not exhibit any bio-integration properties in contact with bone tissues. To improve the interfacial properties of metallic implants in contact with bone, the coatings with thin biocompatible films are used. Two methods to coating titanium implants with hydroxyapatite are described. The first is a two phase method, where by cathodic polarization is deposed a monetite film followed by an alkaline treatment when the monetite is converted to hydroxyapatite. The second method is a biomimetic deposition on an alkaline activate titanium surface, using a five time more concentrated simulated body fluid (5xSBF). After deposition this samples was drying at 120℃ and was sintered at 700℃ for three hours. Optical microscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) were used to characterize structure, morphology and compositions of the deposed films. In this study, electrochemical deposition and biomimetic deposition of hydroxyapatite are compared."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058080451","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.67","pagesFromTo":"521-527","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.imim.pl/files/archiwum/Vol2_2022/17.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"622b118c2467f040f2433c1c","name":"Liliana","lastName":"SACHELARIE","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8f114c49-f3d8-47af-badc-14fe40a72480"},{"objectId":"622b118c2467f040f2433c1b","name":"Andrei

community-acquired pneumonia.\n\nMaterials and methods. The study was carried out in the period 2017–2020 based on the therapeutic department of the Municipal non-profit enterprise “City Clinical Multidisciplinary Hospital No. 25” of Kharkiv City Council. The study involved 34 adult patients with CAP aged 18 to 80 years (mean age 36.5±10.3). The control group consisted of 20 apparently healthy individuals (mean age 39.5±12.5). Levels of IL-17, IL-1Ra, TGFβ1, visfatin, adiponectin were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\n\nResults. Levels of IL-1 Ra and IL-17 in the group of patients with САP were 3.77±0.24 and 33.08±0.10 pg/ml, respectively. In the PРI group, the level of these indicators was probably higher (p<0.05) and was 2.53±0.13 and 28.17±0.53 pg/ml. The level of TGFβ1 in the group of patients with CAP was 24.54±0.55 ng/ml and was slightly higher than in the group of AHI (26.33±0.62 ng/ml). No differences were found between adiponectin levels in the AHI group and patients with CAP, as in the case of visfatin levels. The disappearance of relationships in the system of normal regulation of the inflammatory process between one pair of cytokines and their appearance between other pairs indicates a violation of regulatory mechanisms in patients with community-acquired pneumonia.\n\nConclusions. The identified characteristics of the cytokine profile reflect the end of the phase of active inflammation in the lungs and the beginning of the phase of compensatory reactions. The findings suggest the importance of studying the cytokine profile in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, which will help to develop new approaches to predict the course of pneumonia, ways to correct metabolic disorders that develop in this condition, and will help identify risk groups for this pathology"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058082741","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623312012467f0713d54b6eb","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"1 (46)","doi":null,"documentHash":"4056fd6a-3c6f-492b-8c07-0bdaf4b01117"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"12-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/sr_med/article/download/252919/250314","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6233128f2467f0713d54bbd3","name":"Vladyslav","lastName":"Bereznyakov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7818-4864","documentHash":"7097fd6a-2d4f-4eb3-a0da-376722dfd31f"}],"doi":"10.15587/2519-4798.2022.252919"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-3-030-77305-2","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70926a878c28a04739549f"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Perspectives in Dynamical Systems I: Mechatronics and Life Sciences","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":0,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":null,"translationFromPolish":null,"bookProjectNCN":null,"bookProjectFNP":null,"bookProjectNPHR":null,"bookProjectUE":null},"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61e12d562467f00328bef466","editors":[{"objectId":"5e70926a878c28a04739549f","name":"Jan","lastName":"Awrejcewicz","uuid":"103EA917B58E01C1F593DF24C576FFD4FBF3436F72AD84C759F1A1648333353D4BECA58E82B006A00E93EB6A8B5246D625EC7115D2825CBACC4DCD1412FBCAA4","orcidId":"0000-0003-0387-921X","documentHash":"04649a28-4b5e-49d6-a30d-55a401fd06fa"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["5e70926a878c28a04739549f"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058082801","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-77306-9"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["small cell lung cancer","small biopsy sample","expression of p16ink4A","CD117","pathomorphosis"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61a4e2272467f00d7da76541","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Kharkiv Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623316a72467f0713d54deef","623316a72467f0713d54def1","623316a72467f0713d54deed","623316a72467f0713d54deee"]},{"id":"5e7091d6878c28a04738c1e3","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"V.

The tumor specimens were divided into 3 groups: 1) 25 biopsy samples of small cell lung cancer before treatment; 2) 25 samples of small cell lung cancer procured from autopsies of patients, who underwent chemotherapy; 3) 15 biopsy samples of other lung tumors histologically similar to SCLC. All tumor samples were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE). Immunohistochemical study performed with 5 primary antibodies: CD56, p16ink4A, TTF-1, CD117, Ki-67.\n\nResults. TTF-1 was positive in all small cell lung cancer, lung adenocarcinomas and atypical carcinoids. Expression of CD56 was positive in 100 % of tumors from 1st group and 92 % of these tumors had more than 25 % of positive tumor cells. Expression of p16ink4A was significantly higher in 1st group than in the 3rd one (р<0,001). The stepwise logistic regression was used for finding the best markers for differential diagnosis of small cell lung cancer in small biopsy samples. The next combination of markers was chosen: TTF-1/CD56 (score 2–4)/p16 ink4A/CD117 (sensitivity – 80 %; specificity – 86.67 %; р<0,001) where “score 2–4” means expression of CD56 more than in 25 % tumor cells. Expression of Ki-67 was higher in the 2nd group compared with the 1st one (р<0,001).\n\nConclusion. Evaluation of p16 expression can be used as additional marker for differential diagnosis of small cell lung cancer. The following combination of markers: TTF-1/CD56 (score2-4)/p16 ink4A/CD117 could be useful in diagnosis of small cell lung cancer in small biopsy samples and in the choice of targeted chemotherapy.

The present work aims to investigate the alteration of temperature on surface properties and behaviour of three algal species using the complementary surface methods (electrochemical and atomic force microscopy). The results showed that the temperature-induced response of algae is species-specific due to the structural features of the cell envelope. Wall-less algae experience the largest nanomechanical and chemical change, while algae with silicified walls show the pronounced chemical change in the degree of hydrophobicity. Alterations of surface properties suggest a molecular modification of the algal barrier and cytoskeletal rearrangements due to a change in cell size, while algal morphology reveals no change. The physiological activity of cells showed a different organisation of released extracellular substances in the form of fine fibrillar structures, aggregated particles, and dense networks. Both types of algal responses, physiological activity, and molecular modification of the cell barrier determine the cell adhesion and motility. This study highlights the role of surface properties in cell-substrate and cell–cell interactions, which is important for the understanding of algal behaviour at natural interfaces and the mechanism of algal biofilm and aggregate formation in aquatic systems under the

These galleries are heavily used by the common lizards and young sand lizards. We discuss the possible advantages of such beetle-created habitats for reptiles: antipredator refuges, hibernation sites, thermoregulatory behaviour, and preying activities.

Hence, a more consistent and robust optimization technique will be considered in obtaining the optimized results. This paper presents the optimization process of the Two-Stage Worm Gearbox with the objective function of minimizing total gearbox cost. Ten main design parameters are chosen as input parameters for evaluating their impacts on the response of the partial gear ratio u2. In this study, the simulation experiments were used, which do not need cost to perform all potential tests. In order to do this, a 2^(10-3) model and using 1/16 fractional model were selected due to the limitation of the built-in function in Minitab@18. Moreover, the screening experiments are purposely used to determine the number of parameters, which has a minor influence on the response. Compared to using the Taguchi technique, the model of 2^11 corresponding to L32 or 32 tests is a simple method to achieve the objectives.\n\nThe results show that Total gearbox ratio exhibits the biggest effect on the response compared to others. Furthermore, the interactions between these factors to the remaining are significant. The high reliability of the proposed model is verified by simulation experiments. The random tendency of data shows that u2 is not crucially influenced by other than the input parameters. The data in versus order prove that the response is not varied to the time factor. Moreover, the coefficients of adjusted R2 and R2 are both greater than 99 %, it can be concluded that the proposed regression model is appropriate. The proposed optimization process in this study is reliable and the optimal design method can provide a useful reference on performance improvement of other worm gears."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058082990","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623355402467f0713d5675a0","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"1

correlation exists between the stature and various lower limb dimensions and to further derive regression formulae for estimation of stature from various lower limb segments.\n\nMaterials and methods: the study was conducted on medical students age ranged between 18 to 28 years, which comes chiefly from north-west part of India. Only the subjects willing to participate in the study and given their written informed consent were included in the study group. The students having any obvious physical deformity were excluded from the study. Correlations between various lower limb parameters and stature were determined by using the Pearson’s correlation test. Sex-specific linear regression equations for stature estimation were developed using the lower limb measurements. The multiple regressions equations were produced based on various combinations of the parameters by stepwise regression analysis.\n\nResults: the Pearson’s correlation in combined group showed good correlations between lower limb parameters and stature. There was no statistically significant difference between known stature and estimated stature by using paired T-test for both right and left side in a group consisting of both sexes and in males (p>0.05).\n\nConclusion: from the parameters, lower limb length and foot length had shown strong positive correlations with stature in the north-west Indian population"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058083015","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623312012467f0713d54b6eb","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"1 (46)","doi":null,"documentHash":"4056fd6a-3c6f-492b-8c07-0bdaf4b01117"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"37-43","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/sr_med/article/download/252808/250318","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623317ba2467f0713d54e3a9","name":"Aravindan","lastName":"U","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-9305-4259","documentHash":"ce869612-2fb1-4be0-b1da-709bbd022d36"},{"objectId":"623317ba2467f0713d54e3a8","name":"Sandeep","lastName":"Dara","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-1939-3302","documentHash":"cd34a4a6-b529-47de-b28b-2c43080313ac"},{"objectId":"623317ba2467f0713d54e3a7","name":"Ashish","lastName":"Tyagi","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6581-3633","documentHash":"30680b45-fb96-42a5-9b99-d8042a969a8b"},{"objectId":"623317b92467f0713d54e3a6","name":"Hitesh","lastName":"Chawla","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7649-1921","documentHash":"3a732cc0-7dc3-458e-88a1-b7cd4d699af6"}],"doi":"10.15587/2519-4798.2022.252808"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0f","uid":"br7hcJFLf6iH-raneJQQ4Eg","uuid":"ca2a2d0a-202a-4189-8c9c-3f9d36488fba","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0f","parentUuid":"ca2a2d0a-202a-4189-8c9c-3f9d36488fba","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0f","rootUuid":"ca2a2d0a-202a-4189-8c9c-3f9d36488fba","name":"Instytut Technologiczno-Przyrodniczy -

The phase sequence upon cooling and subsequent heating is reported. Influence of double fluorination of the molecular core on the phase transitions and physical properties is discussed in comparison with the previously reported single-fluorinated glassformer 3F7HPhF.

oral cancer is presumably caused by genetic factors and exposure to substances derived from cosmetics and disinfectants. Triclosan (TCS) is widely spread in many consumer products and oral care products. Since TCS can affect DNA methylation, which is one of the key mechanisms of gene expression that may lead to cancerogenesis, it is necessary to study this mechanism in oral cell carcinoma. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of TCS on metabolic parameters, oxidative stress, gene expression, and DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation in the SCC-15 cell line. The experiments have shown TCS toxicity to SCC-15 cells only in the highest concentrations of 50 and 100 µM. TCS in a wide range of concentrations increases ROS production and caspase-3 activity. Our experiments have shown that TCS in the nontoxic concentrations of 10 µM exerts an impact on SOD2 mRNA expression and SOD activity in the SCC-15 cell line. Finally, our experiments have demonstrated that 6-h treatment with TCS decreases the mRNA expression of DNMT3A and DNMT3B. After 72-h exposure to TCS, an increased level of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine was observed in the SCC-15 cell line, but it was abolished by the NAC treatment. However, it is very likely that these results can be an effect of TET enzyme activity, especially in the case of the decrease in 5mC and the increase in 5hmC after the 48-h exposure to TCS, which was accompanied with a decrease in the mRNA expression of DNMT3A and DNMT3B."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058083063","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6246ecea2467f0368b8b0721","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"149","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"266e157e-fe01-4495-a6e9-01fd797d27eb"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"149","pagesFromTo":"112815","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332222002037?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623347462467f0713d564847","name":"Monika","lastName":"Bar","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3289-1218","documentHash":"71e9d70c-09f8-46aa-804f-9624db220b4d"},{"objectId":"5e70944b878c28a0473b9e29","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Szychowski","uuid":"FC042440A22E72E57E2CA97775DBFF0E4CD8C2FAAED8153A01E8C74781207917A580E2A5E678BA11208EA60DCDACC25941E99CDC37D7591281921D07D8B33247","orcidId":"0000-0003-2207-1160","documentHash":"2012dcce-5d21-4850-bb5f-159e373fce38"},{"objectId":"5e709447878c28a0473b979f","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Skóra","uuid":"3F9FC8F5DD3B4372A00F92675A087C4011BAA7467BD77F7CBAFFF7D84BA2A4EE37ED41AD90B314CB8765CB6174374AF0BAA58DB44FCFCF43548F3881002A6935","orcidId":"0000-0001-7833-9985","documentHash":"b988abdb-1355-461c-954c-6bd26abf3453"},{"objectId":"5e7093a1878c28a0473ae173","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Piechowiak","uuid":"DE73AB761096A5277F06FC8D9B6900FEDF63C1E8F147D394AE3090DFD30821467C761E8CF98010602F4465E5305EEDD5EA3C4BFA7F2666DA3B10BCF37EFF0D39","orcidId":"0000-0001-5579-1629","documentHash":"d7e05bd9-f79a-4fd4-ac88-7133d761e4d7"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.biopha.2022.112815"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sulfonylurea","bis(ammonium)","phenoxy acids","herbicide","HILs","weed resistance"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee9","uid":"btl1TUFZ-RmtE1VFT09EDlQ","uuid":"f68cdefe-93d4-402f-94e1-bd2ef1f8616a","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee9","parentUuid":"f68cdefe-93d4-402f-94e1-bd2ef1f8616a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee9","rootUuid":"f68cdefe-93d4-402f-94e1-bd2ef1f8616a","name":"Instytut Ochrony Roślin - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942c878c28a0473b78dc"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Dicationic Herbicidal Ionic Liquids Comprising Two Active Ingredients Exhibiting Different Modes of Action","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478434","mniswId":"10058","title":"JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY","doi":null,"issn":"0021-8561","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"d95c98f7-2898-49db-8083-08123d9eaee4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62330e512467f0713d548cd4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62330e512467f0713d548cd6","62330e512467f0713d548cd7","62330e512467f0713d548cd8","5e70942c878c28a0473b78dc","5e7093b9878c28a0473afc54"]},"issue":"8","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the framework of this study, dicationic herbicidal ionic liquids (HILs) containing tetramethylene-1,4- bis(decyldimethylammonium) and dodecylmethylene-1,12-bis(decyldimethylammonium), including two different herbicidal anions exhibiting different modes of action, were synthesized and characterized. One herbicide incorporated into the HILs was a tribenuron-methyl belonging to ALS inhibitors, while the second herbicidal anion was a synthetic auxin that acts as a growth regulator, namely 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate (2,4-D), 2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)propionate, (2,4-DP), 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetate (2,4,5-T), 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetiate (MCPA), 2-(4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)propionate (MCPP), and 4-chlorophenoxyacetate (4-CPA). The obtained products were found to be unstable and decomposed, which can be attributed to the presence of an additional methyl group within the sulfonylurea bridge of the tribenuron-methyl. The synthesized HILs exhibited good affinity with polar and semipolar solvents, with ethyl acetate and hexane as the only solvents that did not dissolve the HILs. Greenhouse tests demonstrated that most of the obtained HILs were more effective than the reference herbicide containing tribenuron-methyl. The length of the alkyl chain in the cation also influenced the effectiveness of the HILs. Better effects were observed for dodecylmethylene-1,12-bis(decyldimethylammonium) cations compared to tetramethylene-1,4-bis(decyldimethylammonium). Therefore, the novel dicatonic HILs showed to integrate the advent of the combination of the different herbicides into a single molecule, enhance herbicidal efficacy, and reduce the risk of weed resistance due to the various modes of action of the applied treatment."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058083115","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62330e512467f0713d548cdc","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"70","number":"8","doi":null,"documentHash":"b639e4b2-0827-404b-8832-22b7f8020cfc"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"70","pagesFromTo":"2545

approaches to surgery.\n\nMaterials and methods. Quality of life assessments of hysterectomy with opportunistic salpingectomy for uterine fibroids were performed in 160 women of reproductive age, who were divided into two groups: I – 90 patients with vaginal access, and II – 70 patients with abdominal access. The control group included 50 women with asymptomatic fibroids of reproductive age. The diagnostic algorithm included a physical examination, ultrasound examination of the pelvic organs, assessment of urogenital dysfunction questionnaire using the MOS SF-36 questionnaire; to identify signs of vegetative changes in Wayne, to assess general fatigue, physical and mental fatigue MFI-20 was performed using a standardized POP-Q system.\n\nResults. The leading violations of quality-of-life parameters are general somatic symptoms 107 (66.9±6.0 %), psycho-emotional disorders 89 (55.6±6.7 %), genitourinary and sexual disorders 39 (24.4±3.0 %). Among the most common somatic ones – complaints of headaches, edema and fluctuations in blood pressure. The dominance of asthenic, anxiety and depressive disorders among psycho-emotional disorders has been established. The diagnosis of “organic asthenic disorder” was established in 47 (52.2±9.7 %) and 39 (55.7±7.3 %), respectively, in the groups of examined patients. Vaginal hysterectomy causes more increase in the proportion of urogenital disorders 25 27.7±8.3 %) compared to control – 7 (14.0±4.8 %) (p<0.05). An ultrasound examination showed a 2.25-fold increase in ovarian volume one month after the hysterectomy, and a reduction in ovarian tissue volume in both study groups 2 years after surgery.\n\nConclusions. Hysterectomy with opportunistic salpingectomy affects the parameters of quality of life. The leading violations of quality-of-life parameters are general somatic symptoms, psycho-emotional disorders without statistically significant difference in groups, but the indicators are better in group I. The minimal effect on ovarian function and size was determined – 2 years after surgery, there was a decrease in ovarian tissue volume in both study groups, but statistically significant – in the second group (3.12±0.7 cm3, p<0.05) against the data control (5.82±1.7 cm3). Although the results showed a more frequent manifestation of pelvic floor descent in vaginal access, quality of life parameters were higher in these patients. Given its safety, efficiency and cost-effectiveness, it is advisable to choose it as a method of choice"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058083175","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623312012467f0713d54b6eb","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"1 (46)","doi":null,"documentHash":"4056fd6a-3c6f-492b-8c07-0bdaf4b01117"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"25-30","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/sr_med/article/download/252941/250317","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6233158a2467f0713d54caae","name":"Svitlana","lastName":"Markitanyuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bf78ba09-15f1-453e-bde6-364f67d1b599"},{"objectId":"6233158a2467f0713d54caad","name":"Yaroslav","lastName":"Vitovsky","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3035-6895","documentHash":"840fc000-e2c0-4dca-b877-7e512baa8370"},{"objectId":"6233158a2467f0713d54caac","name":"Iryna","lastName":"Ventskivska","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7685-5289","documentHash":"365368de-d23a-484c-b680-de65a36568f9"},{"objectId":"6233158a2467f0713d54caab","name":"Olha","lastName":"Proshchenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2187-4562","documentHash":"dd2fd886-f399-4681-9c98-e3afaa3b1c5c"}],"doi":"10.15587/2519-4798.2022.252941"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fungiform papillae, Taste buds, Ruminants, Bison bonasus hybrid, Cattle, European bison, 3Dreconstruction"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602f76929543c7410626f4ee","5e709346878c28a0473a62de","5e709400878c28a0473b4a0c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Three-dimensional characteristic of fungiform papillae and its taste buds in European bison (Bison bonasus), cattle (Bos taurus), and Bison bonasus hybrid","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454773ef","mniswId":"2654","title":"BMC Veterinary Research","doi":null,"issn":"1746-6148","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"f977ba83-3af4-4914-8c77-f05fa2013fd3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-07","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61e135152467f00328bfab46","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602f76929543c7410626f4ee","5e709400878c28a0473b4a0c","5e709346878c28a0473a62de"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058083203","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e135162467f00328bfab4c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"18","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"4193b97a-6889-4332-99f3-7387205b9b6f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12917-021-03111-5.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602f76929543c7410626f4ee","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Plewa","uuid":"0D7DC787EFF4DFC59FE8F4F75F22D35018CE9203FE87EEA42C8D506273CB8036A2F67EA961A286B59A3D4B319A9FC5F2FB3DA86CB7465E6A815054EB1111BA70","orcidId":"0000-0001-7611-9305","documentHash":"abcacba9-fa3e-45bc-8957-f7f3506e1660"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4a0c","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Skieresz-Szewczyk","uuid":"97C96B7A3E7AAB1EEE7864B944348B516413C7C7D74A6540322F9520A1D9BAE27359BFCC6A8F31842E0C0018034DC2107E504FB562EADD0861B3FB596458689F","orcidId":"0000-0003-1031-3425","documentHash":"bcc4bf02-94fd-45b3-b25e-01fca44fb1bf"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62de","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Jackowiak","uuid":"BFA89AFC959F33B4EF525E5C2DC4DEB1DB6B09DD69FA393D9B30C7E91D84EFAD668D555DAE562BD4DC1308ED973A557BAA976CA76210045F69E5D258EF8B6405","orcidId":"0000-0001-5167-8215","documentHash":"c091f276-022a-4023-8819-c2da6ecab765"}],"doi":"10.1186/s12917-021-03111-5"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Glycine max.

The aim of this study was to assess the productivity of two soybean cultivars depending on the applied N doses of mineral fertilizers  and seed inoculation with B. japonicum. The study showed that on average, for both cultivars, the soybean yield was most favorably affected by the combined use of inoculation and nitrogen fertilization (increase in seed yield by 42%, protein yield by about 28%). The application of mineral nitrogen at the dose of 30 or 60 kg•ha−1 allowed the increase in the seed yield by about 17% and protein content by about 14% compared to the control. Inoculation of soybean seeds with B. japonicum increased the yield of soybeans by about 20%, proteins by about 10% compared to the control, and inoculation of Hi®Stick Soy favored a better yield than Nitragina. Inoculation of seeds with Nitragina or Hi®Stick Soy and fertilization with mineral nitrogen increased the content of protein and fiber in seeds of both soybean cultivars, as well as reduced the amount of ash and fat.

Therefore, treated wastewater should be conveyed to suitable places and adopted for different uses. This study presents an empirical relationship between the Darcy-Weisbach and Hazen-Williams equations for four types of pipe material (ductile iron, GRP, concrete, and plastic) by using WaterCAD Version 8i. Two hydraulic models were developed to estimate the head loss in pipes by using different diameters: first, using pipe diameters from 800 mm to 1,200 mm for a flow rate of 1.16 m3/s, second, adopting pipe diameter from 1,600 mm to 2,000 mm for a flow rate of 4.63 m3/s. The study results are the head loss values obtained from the Darcy-Weisbach and Hazen-Williams equations, which were used to correlate them using IBM SPSS Statistics. The correlation coefficient between both equations turned out to be 0.991, 0.990, 0.990, and 0.990 for ductile iron, GRP, concrete, and plastic pipe materials. Additionally, the relationship between head loss and pipe diameter is negatively proportioned for both equations. Also, both head loss equation results are the same. The head loss values in the Darcy’s equation were higher for ductile iron and GRP materials, while being lower for concrete and plastic materials for both models. Selecting concrete or plastic pipes to convey treated wastewater is better than other pipe materials. Another conclusion is that the pipe diameter affects the head loss magnitude irrespective of the kind of equation whether Darcy-Weisbach or Hazen-William equation. Finally, this relationship is very useful for designers in converting the head loss values obtained using these equations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058083321","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623355402467f0713d5675a0","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"1 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"c338b7d6-75f4-4465-9dc8-c82700e22216"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"36-43","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/251385/250634","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62336c392467f0713d57455d","name":"Musa Habib","lastName":"Alshammari","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9538-3870","documentHash":"7ddc92d8-ec45-479d-ae35-1a5f8c4eca7d"},{"objectId":"62336c392467f0713d57455c","name":"Larisa","lastName":"Zhuravleva","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1660-9385","documentHash":"da6b0832-1864-4ea9-8c1b-6db5a1db738a"},{"objectId":"62336c392467f0713d57455b","name":"Hayder","lastName":"Algretawee","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2983-1134","documentHash":"1c5d6f36-c25b-4e99-9a72-0fc42798151f"},{"objectId":"62336c392467f0713d57455a","name":"Nazira","lastName":"Dzhumagulova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0586-9464","documentHash":"fd4a5f93-1d2c-49ce-bc32-e8491f943072"},{"objectId":"62336c392467f0713d574559","name":"Layth Saeed","lastName":"Abdulameer","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-5317-4299","documentHash":"5398c488-5f66-4d01-be07-d31fc2604735"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.251385"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["image classification","mapping","HySpex","SVM"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df16","uid":"bGsGbkZIR0c31dlpYIgFXJA","uuid":"76b7738a-266e-4ba8-acb5-41abd6ab009a","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Geografii i Studiów Regionalnych","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f0878c28a0473b3a60","5e70936f878c28a0473a9884","5e709358878c28a0473a7b10"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Mapping Invasive Plant Species with Hyperspectral Data Based on Iterative Accuracy Assessment Techniques","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454794f5","mniswId":"17167","title":"Remote Sensing","doi":null,"issn":"2072-4292","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"05b1e2d5-d1a7-4a36-8bf2-d32e29113bc3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-23","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6233010b2467f0713d5436f6","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093f0878c28a0473b3a60","5e70936f878c28a0473a9884","5e709358878c28a0473a7b10"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Recent developments in computer hardware made it possible to assess the viability of permutation-based approaches in image classification. Such approaches sample a reference  dataset multiple times in order to train an arbitrary number of machine learning models while assessing their accuracy. So-called iterative accuracy assessment techniques or Monte-Carlo-based approaches can be a useful tool when it comes to assessment of algorithm/model performance but are lacking when it comes to actual image classification and map creation. Due to the multitude of models trained, one has to somehow reason which one of them, if any, should be used in the creation of a map. This poses an interesting challenge since there is a clear disconnect between algorithm assessment and the act of map creation. Our work shows one of the ways this disconnect can be bridged. We calculate how often a given pixel was classified as given class in all variations of a multitude of post-classification images delivered by models trained during the iterative assessment procedure. As a classification problem, a mapping of Calamagrostis epigejos, Rubus spp., Solidago spp. invasive plant species using three HySpex hyperspectral datasets collected in June, August and September was used. As a classification algorithm, the support vector machine approach was chosen, with training hyperparameters obtained using a grid search approach. The resulting maps obtained F1-scores ranging from 0.87 to 0.89 for Calamagrostis epigejos, 0.89 to 0.97 for Rubus spp. and 0.99 for Solidago spp."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058083327","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61c9e46a2467f00f2d6517b2","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"9d70f07f-4d35-4e38-a625-d231da99b6e3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"64-83","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/1/64/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093f0878c28a0473b3a60","name":"Anita","lastName":"Sabat-Tomala","uuid":"EEBA0089495ACAD17F5ED1F6CB83E8B35AE6DB96EC9F5BFCD65BE8C6AD6BECBEDD0661D81E3073AF20F7CE86114B2CFE75DA69FF82F1EC0B47C4B98295A8EBA6","orcidId":"0000-0001-8954-5047","documentHash":"1459dafc-cc0f-4c07-8d3c-abb97028acf1"},{"objectId":"5e70936f878c28a0473a9884","name":"Edwin","lastName":"Raczko","uuid":"571119F284F6E82D543B58BFEB912C478458EB9875D532F634CDC93253A23A2BD179FD4A965504830651A8B4745F8B01DB3B2320BA2D843D0F58EA3E88AB9033","orcidId":"0000-0003-4843-9955","documentHash":"1e1e24f9-acfe-44c6-a89c-00319a4b5dee"},{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7b10","name":"Bogdan","lastName":"Zagajewski","uuid":"867837FC267E4FF7794393628DCC8953D896F96104572B26758BE97AF5E51D79F0F27671AD130922B0CC8416399E69A111597A5ADA98CBDCC32F9CDC648ACDFA","orcidId":"0000-0001-7882-5318","documentHash":"edea597e-ad60-4c89-8973-d9b450271f7b"}],"doi":"10.3390/rs14010064"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623319c82467f0713d54e5cb","635c90287523405a7dcc91ed","623319c82467f0713d54e5cc","5e7092ec878c28a04739f43e"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","uid":"bdr9ULwzniE7t58cxXEQlsQ","uuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","parentUuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debc","rootUuid":"58116c2f-c920-4223-979e-e0a5b37b4d26","name":"Instytut Paleobiologii im.

VEOR addresses shortcomings in well-established machine learning methods with an emphasis on numerical performance. Its characteristics include (1) derivation of classification probability; (2) objective selection of classification features that maximize Cohen’s kappa coefficient (κ) derived from iterative “leave-one-out” cross-validation; (3) reduced sensitivity of the classification results to imbalanced classes; (4) smoothing of the classification probability field to reduce noise/mislabeling; (5) numerically efficient retrieval based on a pre-computed look-up vector (LUV); and (6) separate parametrization of the algorithm for each discrete feature class (e.g., land cover). Within this study, the performance of the VEOR classifier was compared to other commonly used machine learning algorithms: K-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, Gaussian process, decision trees, random forest, artificial neural networks, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis. Firstly, the comparison was performed using synthetic 2D (two-dimensional) datasets featuring different sample sizes, levels of noise (i.e., mislabeling) and class imbalance. Secondly, the same experiments were repeated for 7D datasets consisting of informative, redundant and insignificant features. Ultimately, the benchmarking of the classifiers involved cloud discrimination using MODIS satellite spectral measurements and a reference cloud mask derived from combined CALIOP lidar and CPR radar data. The results revealed that the proposed VEOR algorithm accurately discriminated cloud cover using MODIS data and accurately classified large synthetic datasets with low or moderate levels of noise and class imbalance. On the contrary, VEOR did not feature good classification skills for significantly distorted or for small datasets. Nevertheless, the comparisons performed proved that VEOR was within the 3–4 most accurate classifiers and that it can be applied to large Earth Observation datasets."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058083457","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61eeb19c2467f0689144f088","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"620da02c-2abd-4e51-a024-ce5fe723fa25"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"378","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/2/378/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70943c878c28a0473b88d2","name":"Jan","lastName":"Musiał","uuid":"1DF666530A14A23C6EB40C9BE4BEB87770C5678982191D63BA92051761BDDF57AA0CB799AC10D60380E42C3D1EFE2008670E43C35264E5547F92EBF7EC59F17B","orcidId":"0000-0002-0034-7827","documentHash":"9e43596a-3580-45b4-9e09-0ad1f2ddd2f5"},{"objectId":"5e7093fb878c28a0473b45b2","name":"Jędrzej","lastName":"Bojanowski","uuid":"B7F616ADD6AE3D59B870E86EC17FE88CB74446862F8D1FF03EA54B6D62EBD0CBB048DDDCAAFFCCF560DAA439A62B8F630A1997D05BAFEA6D642940F2582F6F69","orcidId":"0000-0001-8460-4183","documentHash":"1e4bb85a-72a3-4848-8b3b-dfab55867ac4"}],"doi":"10.3390/rs14020378"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Coleoptera","phylogeography","pests","primeval forest relicts","dead wood","forest"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922e878c28a0473914b9","5e709232878c28a047391715"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec5","uid":"bi0054EFyZHNUwKK3x5HmqA","uuid":"8cc45ab7-e9f8-4e3b-ac7b-5dd9a6fe481d","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec5","parentUuid":"8cc45ab7-e9f8-4e3b-ac7b-5dd9a6fe481d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec5","rootUuid":"8cc45ab7-e9f8-4e3b-ac7b-5dd9a6fe481d","name":"Instytut Systematyki i Ewolucji Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623b06a02467f01c219bd5b5","5e7093f9878c28a0473b4456"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","uid":"bk6a4u9UDD_o3fTovGAeczg","uuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","parentUuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","rootUuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","name":"Instytut Badawczy Leśnictwa","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924c878c28a047393417","5e7092ee878c28a04739f5c0","5e70934c878c28a0473a6a84"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A review of saproxylic beetle intra- and interspecific genetics: current state of the knowledge and perspectives","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c115","mniswId":"6355","title":"European Zoological Journal","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2475-0263","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ac27a0bd-0adf-45bf-84c4-e224e50a2640"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-25","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"623b06a02467f01c219bd5b2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922e878c28a0473914b9","5e709232878c28a047391715","623b06a02467f01c219bd5b5","5e7092ee878c28a04739f5c0","5e70934c878c28a0473a6a84","5e70924c878c28a047393417","5e7093f9878c28a0473b4456"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Forests are important habitats that harbor high biodiversity and have great economic value to humans. These ecosystems depend on saproxylic organisms, which play a crucial role in the decomposition of the main substrate of forests – wood. The highly important group of saproxylic organisms are beetles, with numerous species that are either of conservation concern (rare and threatened) or have economic value (“pests”). This review summarizes what is known about intra- and interspecific genetic information on species or populations of saproxylic beetles. A search of the literature yielded 110 articles published in 57 journals. The majority of molecular research has focused on “pests” (82 articles on 59 species), with fewer studies of the “non-pest” beetles (28 articles on 40 species, including 10 relicts of primeval forests). Most studies concerned Palearctic and Nearctic taxa, with only a few articles on beetles from (sub)tropical forests. Members of 11 families, 38 genera and 99 species were the subject of molecular studies. The majority of studies (71%) were conducted on beetles associated with conifers. Genetic metrics were found to have different overall values in “pests” and the “non-pest” species. Analyzes resulted in identification of units or either conservation (15 cases) or taxonomic (33) value, the discovery of hybridization (4), invasion routes, and common phylogeographic patterns with the localization of glacial refugial areas. This article is the first comprehensive summary of what is known about the history, present-day diversity, and relationships of highly important group of saproxylic beetles based on molecular studies. “Pests” found to be much wider studied than threatened taxa. A list of species that should be the subject of future molecular studies was provided along with a rationale. Finally, methodological and objective deficiencies in previous studies were characterized."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085650","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"89","pagesFromTo":"481-501","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/24750263.2022.2048717","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623b06a02467f01c219bd5b5","name":"M.","lastName":"Gronowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0219cf3a-2854-4203-b786-0052fa383fe3"},{"objectId":"5e7093f9878c28a0473b4456","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Kajtoch","uuid":"11391FFDD012E31734C94625B7636006240197AC03D2652E680DAB4C732EC59C8EC55624B63D67F3FDACAA4650421DB9F5F5A6F2EE4DBB9E9E47C9FDE5C56617","orcidId":"0000-0001-7345-9400","documentHash":"b1b8385c-d669-4a4e-89a2-45b8ad7db851"},{"objectId":"5e70934c878c28a0473a6a84","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Jaworski","uuid":"540CE7450CA627528770FC25E4D50E53BF4DE84156C0B6160EDDA0042E328B3BA4329A4214D1E9193ED0333A146EAD5622B2971058889F013FF9119302536900","orcidId":"0000-0002-9663-0407","documentHash":"dd4b4990-0f16-4a7e-b561-fb8b47f14298"},{"objectId":"5e7092ee878c28a04739f5c0","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Plewa","uuid":"6551FE8EAD77B86D59533C66DF0FB994C5742FF69FF0701E1D051860CB335674F2F622122F07EB0DDDA3B9E9C2015392B8071E2F52EFFE9BB179FC7DD2776B3F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6227-3037","documentHash":"36bdd637-509c-4024-b905-f171cbe30946"},{"objectId":"5e70924c878c28a047393417","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Gutowski","uuid":"9172490BD233935933850BD5A767DE9273F0908F511001392EAAAECBF30E7CA1A14136DED61E45BF2CC2FF5FB5D2EE7257C237698A9D699421932F09F458C127","orcidId":"0000-0002-5085-2557","documentHash":"6ad7e704-3334-4533-8ce7-38e9d27434ab"},{"objectId":"5e709232878c28a047391715","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Smolis","uuid":"C41D5B5EB8FE66CAC5D98113B5885B8BCC219F2A197CC548061D3FDEA28C345A8CDF36BD259F7A64FBB4294F6C3DDC868BB4D47A99EC04E30850819B950878DC","orcidId":"0000-0002-8117-0268","documentHash":"72a600fb-d3ab-484b-a9ec-3cf5bd96ea77"},{"objectId":"5e70922e878c28a0473914b9","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Kadej","uuid":"26B0634DDFADDFD1203BC72324B34FB7AFDB3F60FD82DE8BD00BF98E70A78A6C6CE322C6A8E3E9CD92D18F0BD861DC3579A8AC229B6136AC333207D2488C56C1","orcidId":"0000-0001-5983-0402","documentHash":"98035301-fea8-4b1c-9cd8-2dd2b4f7bb55"}],"doi":"10.1080/24750263.2022.2048717"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["entropy management concept","quality of management processes","project management","project success","network model"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5f01b84dad49b345d141c5e2","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Odessa National Maritime University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623b2d622467f02a86c62ad2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Development of a method for assessing the quality of project management processes based on the entropy approach","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a5c9","mniswId":"1002078","title":"Technology audit and production reserves [ Технологический аудит и резервы производства ]","doi":null,"issn":"2226-3780","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b2ddb9ee-c11c-4559-bf8e-ac90b931d78e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-31","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"623b2d622467f02a86c62ad0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["623b2d622467f02a86c62ad2"]},"issue":"4(63)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The object of this research is to assess the quality of project management processes. The conducted research is aimed at developing a method for assessing the quality of project management processes in accordance with modern requirements for management and its results. The study is based on the entropy concept of management, and entropy is considered as an integral indicator for assessing the quality of management processes, characterizing the «controllability» of the project and «confidence» in certain results of the project.\n\nIt is proposed to use information entropy as an indicator of management quality, which is understood as the ability to assess and minimize, through preventive or adaptive measures, uncertainty or negative impact from outside and inside on the project, that is, to ensure the success of the project.\n\nThe main factors influencing the level of entropy of the project are determined. It is substantiated that the role of management is to counteract entropy and create such conditions for the implementation of the project, under which its level tends to be acceptable. Only under this condition can the quality of management be defined as «high level» or «sufficiently high level». A scale for assessing the entropy level of a project is proposed, which is substantiated by experimental studies of the entropy level of various projects.\n\nThe concept of «entropy index» of the project is introduced into consideration, as a relative indicator of the level of entropy of the project. The proposed approach is illustrated on the example of a specific project, which substantiated the adequacy of the results of applying the approach to the logic and experience of project implementation, and also demonstrated the practical applicability of the approach for assessing the level of project entropy and management quality.\n\nThe results obtained make it possible to assess the quality of management processes at each stage of the project life cycle in order to identify problems early; and also form a theoretical basis for the further development of tools to ensure and improve the quality of project management processes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085655","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623b1a0d2467f02a86c5df37","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"4

industrial development of cities is the main cause of the destruction and degradation of natural resources around the world. Urbanization negatively affects the species composition of plants, the atmosphere and soil cover of areas of populated areas of large cities of the World. Tree plantations are the main mechanism for stabilizing the ecological situation in large cities and arid territories of the countries of the World.\n\nIn this regard, in order to obtain a large number of genetically identical plants using their micropropagation, it is necessary to automate the main stages of this technological process.\n\nThe result of the study is the creation of an adaptive phalanx gripper of a robotic complex for automating the technological process of handling operations. That will have a positive effect on solving the urgent problem of planting greenery in large cities and areas of arid territories not only in the Republic of Kazakhstan, but also in other countries of the World and represents a fundamentally new approach to solving the environmental problems of the Earth.\n\nThe article substantiates various options for structural-kinematic schemes of the robot gripper, taking into account the stochastic conditions of its interaction with the overloaded object. Mathematical methods have been created for the selection and justification of the geometric, structural-kinematic and dynamic parameters of grippers for overloading plant microshoots and their computer 3D models. Software has been developed for modeling the functioning of a remotely controlled physical prototype of a mobile robot with an adaptive gripper for reloading microshoots from a transport tank to a cargo tank."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085665","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6237120d2467f0495b042233","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"7 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"1b2964f3-519e-44e5-843c-363b353cdf2a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"48-58","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/253135/250808","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62371afe2467f0495b043599","name":"Altynay","lastName":"Primbetova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6770-7671","documentHash":"a45818ad-50c6-40c9-92d7-269ad4e640e5"},{"objectId":"62371afe2467f0495b043598","name":"Aidarkhan","lastName":"Kaimov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9737-9605","documentHash":"360b95bd-1c11-405b-93dc-4f1da015f718"},{"objectId":"62371afe2467f0495b043597","name":"Talgat","lastName":"Kaiym","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3806-5606","documentHash":"44539e2b-5de5-43c3-996d-dd536259eb16"},{"objectId":"62371afe2467f0495b043596","name":"Suleimen","lastName":"Kaimov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4255-6926","documentHash":"bf998ec0-61e2-4bb8-a5ef-eeb52d0e8129"},{"objectId":"62371afe2467f0495b043595","name":"Amandyk","lastName":"Tuleshov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-9775-3049","documentHash":"a26d834e-5b6b-4f57-93a2-9ed6ff0d76db"},{"objectId":"62371afe2467f0495b043594","name":"Yerzhan","lastName":"Syrgaliyev","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1911-1072","documentHash":"f0801d16-4ef8-47f4-9e35-bc1208172abe"},{"objectId":"62371afe2467f0495b043593","name":"Abylay","lastName":"Kaimov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4363-142X","documentHash":"2a16dc1e-b5bc-47df-a778-bcdddc3f5c29"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.253135"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA1ODA4NTY2NQ=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
