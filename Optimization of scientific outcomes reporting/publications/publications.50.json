The extensive use of traditional preventive measures comprising toxic chemicals has become more problematic due to severe ecotoxicological challenges. To address this issue, engineered nanoparticles (NPs) with their distinct physical and chemical properties has gained scientific attention and can help plants to confront environmental challenges. Despite their ameliorative and beneficial effects, toxicological concerns have been raised about NPs. The recent development of biogenic NPs (bio-NPs) is getting attention in agriculture due to their diverse biocompatibility, better functional efficacy, and eco-friendly nature compared to the recalcitrant NPs, providing a promising strategy for increased crop protection against biotic and abiotic environmental stresses, with the ultimate goal of ensuring global food security. This review summarizes the recent advances in the engineering of bio-NPs with particular emphasis on the functions of bio-NPs in protecting plants from biotic and abiotic environmental stresses, delivery and entry routes of NPs to plant systems, nanotoxicity, and plant physiological/biochemical responses to nanotoxicity. Future perspectives of bio-NP-enabled strategies, remaining pitfalls, and possible solutions to combat environmental challenges via advanced nanotechnology to achieve global food security and a sustainable agricultural system are also discussed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058146409","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6267cf1440970720eb520f2e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"93da245f-1c17-4c1d-a303-42320ae7abeb"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10408398.2022.2046543","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6267cf1440970720eb520f2c","name":"Fengming","lastName":"Song","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5bb3e198-2a5c-4467-8d73-bb13ec0c4b33"},{"objectId":"6267cf1440970720eb520f2b","name":"Dayong","lastName":"Li","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"92179ef3-ba37-47c3-a9a5-b92a576eb51a"},{"objectId":"6267cf1440970720eb520f2a","name":"-","lastName":"Azizullah","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"149d71de-20c5-45c1-ac66-d0833fc09c51"},{"objectId":"6267cf1440970720eb520f29","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Shahid","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9c96faf4-f530-4d08-9918-6dbc38bfed01"},{"objectId":"6267cf1440970720eb520f27","name":"Usman","lastName":"Ijaz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a9558666-88e7-4391-9816-b084ca41ff07"},{"objectId":"6267cf1440970720eb520f26","name":"Temoor","lastName":"Ahmed","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5a89b89a-eef1-477e-b2b9-314a9c39e916"},{"objectId":"6267cf1440970720eb520f25","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Noman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0dd13713-f6b5-46bb-8c38-b80258cdc2f4"},{"objectId":"61d3bf387523401fc110782c","name":"Amir","lastName":"Hameed","uuid":"E255FDEFA24C3030CB21C0DD8B8B562EBC246E95CACDD93DE38F28945D21CC0980103AE0C422556B2F6B9A7E4688641E956476A7442442B5E841A58FB5FBC1FD","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cfd862e7-2e68-464c-80f3-0dbcb354b630"}],"doi":"10.1080/10408398.2022.2046543"},{"mainLanguageName":"ukraiński","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["criminal offenses against traffic safety and transport operation","regional distribution features"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61af7aac2467f044f4edd25c","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Yaroslav Mudryi National Law University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62cbde3a409707746ec5263c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The regional distribution features of traffic safety or transport operation rules violations by persons who drive vehicles (Article 286 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine)","mainLanguage":"ukr","journal":{"objectId":"5e7187e446e0fb0001d14443","mniswId":null,"title":"ScienceRise: Juridical Science","doi":null,"issn":"2523-4145","eissn":"2523-4153","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"f5933e10-55ec-4614-a505-4846f5546593"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62cbde3a409707746ec5263a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62cbde3a409707746ec5263c"]},"issue":"2(20)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article is devoted to the regional peculiarities of the distribution of violations of traffic safety rules or operation of transport by persons driving vehicles (Article 286 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine).

Analysed data included 325 performances of teams led by dismissed coaches (DC), 313 of teams led by new coaches (NC), and 580 of teams led by unchanged coaches (UnC). Variables, such as average number of collected points, total distance (TD), total distance per minute (TD/min), high-speed running (HSR), sprinting and number of high-intensity runs (NHIR), were analysed in the last 15 games of DC and 15 matches of NC. These periods were divided into 3 blocks out of 5 matches (5-match blocks). NC collected a significantly higher number of points than DC (p = 0.015), whereas average points collected by UNC were significantly greater than DC (p < 0.001 and NC (p = 0.012). TD and TD/min for DC were significantly lower (p < 0.001) compared with both NC and UnC, whereas significant differences in HSR (p = 0.003) and NHIR (p = 0.03) were identified between DC and NC.

Increasingly, this characteristic is determined using the laser diffraction method (LDM). Theoretical assumptions of LDM are, i.a. the spherical shape of the measured particles and their random orientation. These criteria are often not met. 3D prints were used to test the impact of shape on LDM PSD and to monitor particle flow with high-speed camera. It can be noticed that when the shape of the examined particles differs from a spherical shape, PSDs obtained with the use of LDM are burdened with an error that is difficult to estimate. Moreover, the more the aspect ratio value deviates from unity, the more the distribution shifts towards larger particles. It was noticed that in the case of cylinders there were no particle rotations in about 70% of cases. A lack of rotation was also observed for hemispheres—in about 16% of cases. Minimization of the errors resulting from the influence of the shape (and the related lack of rotation) of the measured particles on the obtained results may be achieved by designing the measuring cell of the diffractometer in such a way that rotation would be forced."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149083","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c7e03e4097077330cabbbe","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"30b25442-747c-4c3c-af73-98341b497a9f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"241–248","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40571-022-00489-3.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709485878c28a0473bed87","name":"Cezary","lastName":"Polakowski","uuid":"4AF7AB8EF2AC2432569D60766819D89ED25AA65497D1B2C52A8541C0F64AA7D229198BADACED8D80373D8811311347320A06E50D45663662C7E8A74A0B816B02","orcidId":"0000-0002-1658-8334","documentHash":"437d41d6-c4d9-4bb0-97ef-7030545b287c"},{"objectId":"5e709433878c28a0473b800f","name":"Agata","lastName":"Sochan","uuid":"A495E78853A967BB8F1243BB969357B5923B30FF87B473265E35DB3E58C4ABB5175D8B0C443E0D08AA182AF24CFCD383637B65036ECCDE02C3795FD957AAD24E","orcidId":"0000-0002-1987-0220","documentHash":"2593889d-30d9-4e24-a77e-c34a162be389"},{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b4243","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Ryżak","uuid":"3F37303D436DA666687B1EB086A7FD37A30A41C51CCCF5E3FF03C90F982EB0945AE1B4E79734058522B7238FE370084923DE7BF84C2E68DA0A724E627CB803D2","orcidId":"0000-0002-6400-5375","documentHash":"da5a258e-c5d6-450c-9f2f-ea84ae7ac45d"},{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b4234","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Bieganowski","uuid":"E7F82A31E688F9179FDA762D38D72BF6B2257BBE73779947DD0E9F62E9A1EF0B03DAF6DFA72C5298E3AC2F7C6884F87627C8F33BC61B22793EA223129170C251","orcidId":"0000-0002-3571-3241","documentHash":"2631b862-2d97-46f8-b59f-359a0df2942c"},{"objectId":"5e7093de878c28a0473b2399","name":"Michał","lastName":"Beczek","uuid":"9A82135E0FC8A69D58A5432CE000A30C814D9877D8F7D042C86627397887658A2E68A000044462C2716875F2E42DB971A3CD1D54855C4591C09C74A5B9CFB570","orcidId":"0000-0002-8851-0982","documentHash":"97de4dbb-a59b-44a5-8eeb-b9ec93bd14bb"},{"objectId":"5e7093de878c28a0473b2395","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Mazur","uuid":"A027A527910D028E84AB1F0861DC97B3BE36C2671CFD6A94554E4D864EF6CF3B04FCD0C85AC354DAEA2D3B0E24C83C06061BF14FAAA7D809CCFB47AA645C6DED","orcidId":"0000-0002-5520-3863","documentHash":"d2ee989c-19ef-49fd-98ac-68c84278420f"}],"doi":"10.1007/s40571-022-00489-3"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Mechanochemical

The stimuli-responsive substances are the mostprominent candidates for developing sophisticated nanomachinery.Especially, photo- and thermoresponsive systems have gainedmuch attention in recent years as elegant solutions for drugtransportation, information storage, biomaterials, and materialengineering. However, to this day, only a limited number ofmolecular domains display triggered and reversible self-organ-ization at the water-oil interface. Among various substancesfunctionalized with responsive moieties, the donor-acceptorStenhouse adduct (DASA) stands out as an exciting but poorly explored tool in the toolbox of materials science. After beingilluminated with a green light, the compound changes its coloration and polarity. This state can be reversed by increasing thetemperature. The study presents the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) decorated with a DASA-containing ligand that canundergo on-demand, light-triggered, and thermoreversible self-organization at the water-oil interface. The layer of the nanoparticleslocked at the interface can be successfully cross-linked, either by a dithiol molecule or via copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azidecycloaddition (CuAAC). The latter option results in a composite with semiconducting properties. The research has the potential toimpact the delivery systems for catalysis and the development of programmable materials with electroactive properties."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149106","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c587b54097074de228515a","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"126","number":"16","doi":null,"documentHash":"020c4f2d-10c1-4590-911c-c5a211adcfa9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"126","pagesFromTo":"7096-7106","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c00084","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473afeed","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Fiałkowski","uuid":"1C26E79E9EB8F34650F31105B6CF183CD092FEC5FF6880B2BE0052C47B15B5DCFC9882182D7FA3313C72FCBC5B1AE2D3E1915CED064C74CD21663F9D21F32AAB","orcidId":"0000-0003-1529-2539","documentHash":"8aa183e2-f661-4718-bf0e-a59b7091f68f"},{"objectId":"5e70938b878c28a0473ac6d1","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Bończak","uuid":"C9CF64DD69F437F68ADC88042449758EDAB0FBFED5919D083B81D041CD3175B9BC73BF8CE3BD3EED7552EAC50D2AF5BA1D0980E854B77D4C1C7A5C1D2261D966","orcidId":"0000-0002-6581-7420","documentHash":"21268306-0066-4e34-8b95-4b97a81ec913"}],"doi":"10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c00084"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["akrecja","rentgenowskie aktywne jądra galaktyk","czarne dziury Kerra"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["accretion","X-ray active galactic nuclei","Kerr black holes"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Improved Model of X-Ray Emission from Hot Accretion Flows","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547723b","mniswId":"1990","title":"Astrophysical Journal","doi":null,"issn":"0004-637X","eissn":"1538-4357","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b6dd4b52-08ee-4b62-b195-3b6207fef891"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62cd336b4097073c6e2d121b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709368878c28a0473a8df5","5e70939e878c28a0473adda4","657c855d4097076c14ab59a9","657c855d4097076c14ab59aa"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We have developed an improved model of X-ray emission from optically thin, two-temperature accretion flows, kerrflow, using an exact Monte Carlo treatment of global Comptonization as well as with a fully general relativistic description of both the radiative and hydrodynamic processes. It also includes pion-decay electrons, whose synchrotron emission dominates the seed photon yield at $\\dot{M}/{\\dot{M}}_{\\mathrm{Edd}}\\gtrsim 0.1$ in flows around supermassive black holes. We consider in detail the dependence of the model spectra on the black hole spin, the electron heating efficiency, the plasma magnetization, and the accretion rate, and we discuss the feasibility of constraining these parameters by analyzing X-ray spectra of nearby low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. We note some degeneracies that hinder precise estimations of these parameters when individual X-ray spectra are analyzed. These degeneracies are eliminated when several spectra from a given source are fitted jointly, which then allows us to reliably measure the model parameters. We find significant differences with previous spectral models of hot-flow emission, related with the computational methods for Comptonization. Finally, we briefly consider and discuss the dependence on the viscosity parameter and on the outflow strength."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149108","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"931","pagesFromTo":"1-7","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac6c8b","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"657c855d4097076c14ab59aa","name":"Fu-Guo","lastName":"Xie","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c7d30272-0504-4646-a025-aef5a48df6ed"},{"objectId":"657c855d4097076c14ab59a9","name":"Andrzej A.","lastName":"Zdziarski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dc58a644-8574-41a9-ad48-1e8287282e85"},{"objectId":"5e70939e878c28a0473adda4","name":"Michał","lastName":"Szanecki","uuid":"03FA2494F26465DA3A764A488A627E9E532A61CF8930C792FB50D122944B59456D4E80BE60EA0D4E2B179ADB8A878385B5A9BEE549D2CD282282279CBE8E2075","orcidId":"0000-0001-7606-5925","documentHash":"beb9c53f-b472-4325-ae69-e22108c96c8a"},{"objectId":"5e709368878c28a0473a8df5","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Maciołek-Niedźwiecki","uuid":"B1FE2842839FD32EA4735F16D1074B1135DE9943146FD242B53546EC0B892692562906398F0901C840E735D4FE8347DC04E69CE63C989E97733E4979E65C8D84","orcidId":"0000-0002-8541-8849","documentHash":"86d2223c-bd3b-4aa6-8044-6c4a14e435ff"}],"doi":"10.3847/1538-4357/ac6c8b"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["innowacje społeczne","pandemia COVID-19","studium przypadku"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["social innovation","pandemic COVID-19","case study"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de35","uid":"bbhWY-GzmS7IoRMQpyKKYhw","uuid":"ea6c2a5f-cea7-406c-84ca-cb69452fa94e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de35","parentUuid":"ea6c2a5f-cea7-406c-84ca-cb69452fa94e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de35","rootUuid":"ea6c2a5f-cea7-406c-84ca-cb69452fa94e","name":"Uniwersytet Bielsko-Bialski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70946d878c28a0473bccb8"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Innowacje społeczne - przykład praktyczny","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"61d557ec580ac28cb94dcdee","mniswId":"201508","title":"Systemy Wspomagania w Inżynierii Produkcji","doi":null,"issn":"2391-9361","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WCN","editor":null,"documentHash":"9d039f38-f378-49cd-892b-8b7881a2fcaf"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62c7da844097077330caa92f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70946d878c28a0473bccb8"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the study is to present a practical example in the field of social innovation.

The abovementioned prerequisite does no longer function as justifying pre-trial detention on its own. It has to be connected with the content of Art. 258 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as well as the principles of minimalism, necessity and proportionality.

The study was conducted in the Białowieża Glade. Tree species were classified individually and then divided into two groups: those that will reach a height of 5 m in the future and those that will not (grey willow, hawthorn). Hyperspectral (reduced with MNF transformation) and ALS−based features were used for classification with the SVM algorithm. Classification accuracy based on ALS data was better than that of hyperspectral data for indi− vidual species but similar for the two species groups – 95.5% (Kappa 87.5%). Information about species and height was used to perform the classification of a fishnet layer into ‘forests’, ‘potential forests’ and ‘non−forests’, with an accuracy of 96% (Kappa 87.7%). A map of forests and potential forest vegetation was created in the form of a thematic map, taking into account height, canopy cover, area of the complex and land use.

Previous studies have considered this zone, which originated on the North Gondwanan margin, as part of a Late Carboniferous to Triassic magmatic arc associated with the subduction of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean beneath Eurasia. Magmatism has been regarded as representing one continuous or two separate stages occurring under different tectonic settings. We present new LA-ICP-MS U-Pb zircon ages together with field, petrographic and geochemical studies of variably deformed granites from the Sakar Batholith and Levka Pluton of the Sakar Unit in the Strandja Zone. The new U-Pb ages from Sakar Batholith (ca. 306 Ma) and Levka Pluton (ca. 319 Ma) demand a re-evaluation of previously published U-Pb crystallisation ages from these magmatic bodies. The U-Pb age reported for the Levka Pluton also provides an upper age limit for the timing of Variscan metamorphism. The Late Carboniferous to Early Permian magmatic evolution of the Strandja Zone displays a strong resemblance to that of the Sredna Gora Zone. Both units, probably together with Serbo-Macedonian Metamorphic Complex and Sakarya Zone, were part of the metamorphic core of the Variscan

relationships between birds and invertebrates are very diverse and often extend beyond the host-parasite interaction. Birds can be vectors of some arthropod species and their nests are a specific microhabitat inhabited by mites and springtails. However, the phenomenon is not well described in Antarctica. The aim of this article is to compare the arthropod communities inhabiting the nests of three species of birds and relate observed differences to the biology and ecology of the nest building bird species (i.e., living in colonies or in pairs) as well as the nature of the nest (i.e., nest lining or lack there off). Outcomes include determining the scale of the threat to birds from parasites, as well as to information concerning the ecology (microhabitat preferences) of the arthropod species. The study was conducted in the vicinity of the Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station by comparing the arthropod concentrations in nests of three bird species: Southern Giant Petrel (Macronectes giganteus), Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae) and South Polar Skua (Stercorarius maccormicki). Four mite (Acari) species and five springtail (Collembola) species were found in the collected material. None of these species are parasites. The most numerous were Hydrogamasellus racovitzai (Acari, Mesostigmata), Alaskozetes antarcticus (Acari, Oribatida) and Cryptopygus antarcticus antarcticus (Collembola). The results indicate (e.g. the Shannon index, evenness, non-metric multidimensional scaling method, one-way multivariate permutation analysis of variances, Kruskal–Wallis test) significant variability in community composition and individual abundance in the nests dependent on the bird species. Furthermore, that this variability depends on the biology and ecology of the bird species."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149149","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"45","pagesFromTo":"1035–1044","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64059099409707703557ba06","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Skarżyński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"11064f45-c893-4a4d-97d8-3fdcf0a26ac3"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a64bf","name":"Bogna","lastName":"Zawieja","uuid":"DEF4150108C40975CEB8D7439E113FC328E3F563DD194CB3E14175CB9F10263716DFA2D26F4EDE8182266467E6E96A3B2AF405D89878C4751F50EC9755036604","orcidId":"0000-0003-3137-3478","documentHash":"6a43d67a-f5c3-4901-bf7f-eef12a563bac"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62e0","name":"Dariusz J.","lastName":"Gwiazdowicz","uuid":"045E3192F2CFA4037E22DA4DDF1CCD4E37B613968EB74F4C73D04C0F954D4A8F034A28220F142EB339D12DE5B32963584DA460CC93E462BF1C5CD8594E7D1249","orcidId":"0000-0002-0064-2316","documentHash":"be594b4c-df94-452e-8ab9-0eddedf79089"},{"objectId":"5e7092ef878c28a04739f797","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Niedbała","uuid":"47A71CF8304CE3427C7AB4A9C27BB21899E7D8572C1BA02FA66388BFC6A162F2FE6C5573FCBBCDB247BCC999B1EE4D7741A1464855606DD2AEC1240A2302617A","orcidId":"0000-0003-3772-0493","documentHash":"55a2ab0f-d152-4c8e-96cc-1bed9f678962"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00300-022-03052-1"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["targeted therapy","Lagrange-Euler FEM analysis","aggregation design","drug delivery","inner ear","magnetic nanoparticles"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70934f878c28a0473a6ecc","5e7093a9878c28a0473aeae7","5e7093a9878c28a0473aeae6"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Computational methodology for drug delivery to the inner ear using magnetic nanoparticle aggregates","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547779b","mniswId":"4235","title":"Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine","doi":null,"issn":"0169-2607","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"646025e7-6028-4662-89be-b21af0c342b6"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62c533a54097075e7ccc4e5d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70934f878c28a0473a6ecc","5e7093a9878c28a0473aeae6","5e7093a9878c28a0473aeae7","62c533a54097075e7ccc4e62"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background and objective: The main goal of the proposed study is to improve the efficiency of the ear treatment via targeted drug delivery to the inner ear, i.e. the cochlea. Although pharmacotherapy has been proposed as a solution to prevent damage or restore functionality to hair cells, the main challenge in such treatments is ensuring adequate drug delivery to the cells. To this end, we present a methodology for the evaluation of the magnetic forces needed to move magnetic particle nanorobots (abbreviated as MNP) and their aggregates through the cochlea round window membrane (RWM). Methods: The FEM - Lagrangian-Eulerian approach (Abaqus software) was used to determine the specific parameters of movement of the nanoparticles crossing the RWM. This method results in a high consistency of FEM simulations and in-vivo experimental results in regards to the required magnetic force during the movement of spherical nanoparticles with a given viscosity ηave. Based on the analysis of the experimental studies found in subject literature, the sizes of the MNPs and their aggregates able to cross RWM with and without the application of magnetic force FM have been determined. Results: The present work accounts for both the experimental and theoretical aspects of these investigations. Presented research confirms the definite usability of the Lagrange-Euler method for the precise determination of the required magnetic force value FM to control the accelerated motion of MNP aggregates of complex shapes through RWM. It is possible to determine the predominant parameters with a precision of less than 5% for single-layer aggregates and spatial aggregates crossing the RWM. It can be concluded that the MNPs and their aggregates should not be larger than 500–750 nm to cross the RWM with high velocities of penetration close to 800 nm/s for magnetic forces of hundreds 10−14 Newtons. Conclusions: The proposed Lagrangian-Eulerian approach is capable of accurately predicting the movement parameters of MNP aggregates of irregular shape that are close to the experimental test cases. The presented method can serve as a supplementary tool for the design of drug delivery systems to the inner ear using MNPs."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149151","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c533a54097075e7ccc4e70","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"221","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"08f0f285-1b74-47f8-9f19-3114bacdd91d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"221","pagesFromTo":"106860-1 - 106860-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260722002425?pes=vor","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62c533a54097075e7ccc4e62","name":"Antoine","lastName":"Ferreira","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a2ef2e47-4648-4fc5-b04a-b014f25e46ac"},{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473aeae7","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Wilczyński","uuid":"D358166DFDB6301F8F82CD2757DDC44798B7AD7B862D8B4938EE00DD8265830CF6CDCB98C01629CE916D774B0578E7C65D0418FDDB1BFA30672F0BD3CD365CC7","orcidId":"0000-0003-1758-6063","documentHash":"f62021c3-8859-4b1a-a94a-1e561dcebe92"},{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473aeae6","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Talaśka","uuid":"7F6178582D4794383B4E1ACE172061752234B891545D7327921AAFEE42CB8430E48B6B12096D611B4B19E73D7441833B9940DDCD0941B03CA4E6AECB7D6AD3DF","orcidId":"0000-0001-9736-9725","documentHash":"304cb589-09d3-4bca-8828-4dc0fc695720"},{"objectId":"5e70934f878c28a0473a6ecc","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Wojtkowiak","uuid":"37D4BB072FEBC98F1C3F4529C2FE5611B415A03CA514B1CA63F9A19C11B9C41E5D9E349868C2962BD88FAB92A0432351DE01FFEA4F3F7C487BF5D46B4F6CB20E","orcidId":"0000-0003-1334-1288","documentHash":"fd8d83d4-0514-4232-840f-f3601fae1dd1"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.cmpb.2022.106860"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Krzemionka","Pylica płuc","Pylica krzemowa","Polska","Choroby zawodowe"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee3","uid":"bnX0HoKbxpGTrsHNBITsQWQ","uuid":"bdc6f547-9a9a-42e0-baaa-e9556955346a","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee3","parentUuid":"bdc6f547-9a9a-42e0-baaa-e9556955346a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee3","rootUuid":"bdc6f547-9a9a-42e0-baaa-e9556955346a","name":"Instytut Medycyny Pracy im. prof. dr. med.

Material and Methods: The cases of all medically recognized pneumoconioses, including silicoses, certified as occupational diseases were studied. The records were extracted from the Central Register of Occupational Diseases, the only official Polish central electronic data base of occupational diseases. Results: During the period 2000–2019, 2066 confirmed cases of silicoses and 10 665 cases of other pneumoconioses including asbestosis and coal workers’ pneumoconiosis were reported to the Central Register of Occupational Diseases. Silicoses accounted for 12.8–21.2% of all pneumoconioses. The number of confirmed silicoses cases was growing along with the length of latency period and was the highest for the period of ≥40 years (513 cases). Over 70% of silicoses cases occurred after occupational exposure >20 years. The most workers who evolved silicosis were employed in manufacturing, predominantly casting of iron, mining and quarrying and construction. Conclusions: The number of confirmed cases of silicosis in Poland decreased in 2000–2019 but the disease still remains an important health problem. Prevention is crucial to reduce further disease incidence. The medical monitoring standards of exposed workers should be improved. Developing new diagnosing guidelines with the use of other imaging examinations, like high-resolution computed tomography, has to be considered. The analysis should contribute into the implementation of silicosis preventative programmes, both at the enterprise and national level."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149164","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c8181c4097077330cd0376","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"af9ab563-ff73-41bf-864f-71691f1c0bce"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://ijomeh.eu/pdf-147705-76303","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62c8181c4097077330cd0372","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Nowak - Pasternak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"abcf1607-86cb-4199-8f25-4004d5c50530"},{"objectId":"5e7094c5878c28a0473c3678","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Lipińska-Ojrzanowska","uuid":"FA5D1FE1FFFB8D3816463D0FA70AD909293E5F11FB72653A2EEFCF5D26B3E6734C39255B782E46E650E6E213CE2778506F67AFB5A15DD343BA34CA384849D868","orcidId":"0000-0001-8854-1095","documentHash":"48be2955-dc34-4da1-ad50-9339992dd107"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b576c","name":"Beata","lastName":"Świątkowska","uuid":"2010A03DD0B094A3EAE55F501F3A44F0C1554E4F3C00D79D52808B6B7FBE9AE83EDDF89D2AD3178090F759B682CF711F8294C81BBB2FA5A81164FCECD65207C2","orcidId":"0000-0003-3757-3868","documentHash":"c6b35215-b761-4e9c-8612-a041b7008410"}],"doi":"10.13075/ijomeh.1896.01950"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["migracje","migranci","Stare Juchy","Islandia"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":"9788366849624","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737ddd9","uid":"brSLXPVso2IWE01FTmuoK5g","uuid":"58bdce52-e319-4ebc-8565-cf242318e51c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737ddd9","parentUuid":"58bdce52-e319-4ebc-8565-cf242318e51c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737ddd9","rootUuid":"58bdce52-e319-4ebc-8565-cf242318e51c","name":"Collegium Civitas w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70932f878c28a0473a4893"]}],"type":"BOOK","title":"Islandory i nowowiejscy.

amount of green is relatively low in most cities. Often, the cause of this situation is urban policy which favours developers. Far-reaching urbanization results in various environmental and social problems. In those circumstances, a need for the wider revitalization and reorganization of urban space becomes even more important and necessary. Our article is a review. It discusses the significance of community gardens in Poland due to people’s limited access to private gardens and the growing development of housing estates in cities. In recent decades, cities have developed rapidly in Poland. However, this development was often uncontrolled because very compact building patterns were applied in new housing estates. As a result, in many places the urban tissue lacked common public space. Urban planners adopted a new approach to public goods, including green spaces, and reconsidered the development of cities. Common space was found to be fundamental for the development of the identity of individual neighbourhood groups and, consequently, for social changes. Community gardens are an example of changes introduced to the urban landscape as a consequence of considering common space significant. As a result, local residents can integrate and change their attitude to public space, which is perceived as part of the community. Users gain a sense of community, solidarity, and shared responsibility. The community garden becomes a reason for neighbourhood residents to integrate despite the fact that they may differ in their political views, background, and age. Community gardens are established in a similar way all over the world. However, there might be local differences in the legal system, people’s mentality, and access to land. Community gardens are a new phenomenon in Poland. They are established mainly in big cities, e.g., in Warsaw, Kraków, and Poznań. Community gardens have numerous advantages. Their users are physically active, and they are thus at lower risk of chronic and non-infectious diseases. They grow vegetables and thus change their eating habits. In addition, community gardens reduce stress. Due to gardening, users feel better, broaden their social contacts, participate in cultural events, and enrich their diet. This article shows how the intensive development of housing estates in Poland affects the availability of green areas. The advantages of community gardens in Poland and other countries, methods of plant cultivation and how community gardens functioned during the COVID-19 pandemic are discussed. With this short review, we want to broaden the knowledge about community gardens as their development in Poland is different than in other countries and to encourage their establishment due to the decreasing amount of green space and dense urban development."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149175","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62a8316040970742eed39fcd","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"c33ae7fc-a686-4cc3-87f9-2fff88c33bcc"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1447","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/6/1447/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62f28785409707569c0688e7","name":"Jagoda","lastName":"Łój","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"12d08c8c-eaca-4a0d-8e1d-fbf8660a81a1"},{"objectId":"5e7093c8878c28a0473b0ab3","name":"Roman","lastName":"Andrzejak","uuid":"C03B1B64D7384A43734DEF7AF59DB92118625022DDBAEB35F694DD17755D22F3B0097C577320B6CEC1C0F74774A2177DB8C3BEBCAC67FC703BC81A155EE9D514","orcidId":"0000-0002-5546-0560","documentHash":"6416afda-e553-4221-9fba-adea3e31986f"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62e8","name":"Beata","lastName":"Janowska","uuid":"1EF98A2889CDD342B58B8F1446C228F9A13CD31C59748DDA9B491A5032D6C6BDF3A64A0886B811FAC874D9472E0B3E3036FCEED561E3240E81D3A3C3A3CC926D","orcidId":"0000-0002-6871-9316","documentHash":"7e2e7aed-ec52-405b-8388-35f0857d8bd8"}],"doi":"10.3390/agronomy12061447"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"On Bohmit the Heretic.

Research on the peculiarities of the use of modern motivational tools by domestic employers in the pharmaceutical industry (including training and involvement of pharmaceutical specialists in social projects).\n\nMaterials and methods. An anonymous online survey in the Google Form was conducted from April 3, 2021 to November 1, 2021 on the social network \"Facebook\" (including in four pharmaceutical groups of this network). Methods: analysis, synthesis, and generalization.\n\nResults of the research. The main motivating factors of respondents and the main motivational tools used by employers in the pharmaceutical industry have been identified. The state of training and education during professional activities and the evaluation of their effectiveness by respondents have been studied. Professional and motivational-psychological trainings are in the lead in the ranking of educational projects (75.2 % of respondents). The methods of evaluation of pharmaceutical specialists used by employers in the pharmaceutical industry have been generalized. The attitude of respondents to the participation of employers in the pharmaceutical industry in social and charitable projects has been studied. Most respondents (67.5 %) positively perceives the participation of employers in social and charitable projects, for some of them this is a motivational advantage when choosing a place of work.\n\nConclusions. An online survey of 508 pharmaceutical professionals, conducted in a Google Form has allowed us to establish the features of current motivational approaches used today in pharmaceutical organizations and the attitude of respondents to them. It has been found that such motivational tools as trainings (innovative form of education) (55.1 %), as well as material forms of incentives (73.2 %) are widely used. At the same time, the main topics of the trainings are regarding the professional aspects of activity. An important factor in the life of a pharmaceutical organization is its social and charitable work, which forms a positive attitude towards it on the part of pharmaceutical professionals, and sometimes serves as a motivational advantage in choosing a place of work"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149180","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cbc2a9409707746ec41481","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"3(37)","doi":"","documentHash":"cc592ae9-8a9c-4817-8da7-aa8dc6ebeea8"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"19-26","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/sr_pharm/article/download/259784/256889","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62cbc513409707746ec42100","name":"Halyna","lastName":"Bilushchak","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1226-8050","documentHash":"07d4f482-6a47-4418-8eb5-9464efb12806"},{"objectId":"62cbc513409707746ec420ff","name":"Oleksandra","lastName":"Korniyenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6471-9300","documentHash":"d0be9fea-559a-49d3-ae01-473c101ef289"},{"objectId":"62cbc513409707746ec420fe","name":"Iryna","lastName":"Chukhray","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4122-2182","documentHash":"147cbfb8-3634-40e1-911b-10212fd731df"},{"objectId":"62cbc513409707746ec420fd","name":"Oksana","lastName":"Levytska","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8113-2587","documentHash":"39357284-8801-41ed-85da-1a92bc821748"},{"objectId":"62cbc513409707746ec420fc","name":"Iryna","lastName":"Horodetska","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0265-5505","documentHash":"1b4131c9-78a6-4bd8-a81c-2211cea247f9"}],"doi":"10.15587/2519-4852.2022.259784"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["evaluation","building simulation","occupant presence and actions models","documentation","occupancy and occupant behaviour models"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c1878c28a0473b0342"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Documenting occupant models for building performance simulation: a state-of-the-art","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478504","mniswId":"10361","title":"Journal of Building Performance Simulation","doi":null,"issn":"1940-1493","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"3bf63007-2469-4783-80c5-253c311a2d50"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62cbc9804097075e7c53244c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093c1878c28a0473b0342","62cbc9804097075e7c53244f","62cbc9804097075e7c532450","62cbc9804097075e7c532451","62cbc9804097075e7c532452","62cbc9804097075e7c532453","62cbc9804097075e7c532454","62cbc9804097075e7c532455"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The number of occupancy and occupant behaviour models developed for building performance simulation (BPS) has steadily increased for the past four decades. However, their use is still limited in practice. This is partly due to the difficulty in understanding their utility and to the challenges related to their implementation into BPS. Both problems can be attributed to the lack of a framework for their description and communication. In this paper, we fill this gap by introducing a framework to document occupant models, that represents the state-of-the-art of available information on the topic. The framework consists of four blocks (description, development, evaluation, and implementation) and can also be regarded as a guideline to help researchers communicate their models transparently. Based on a systematic review, we verify to which degree existing academic papers on occupant models meet the framework, thus providing a self-critical assessment of the state-of-the-art of occupant models’ documentation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149182","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cbc9804097075e7c532459","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"15","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"0edac48b-4aea-489b-92af-748dd7379fab"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"634 - 655","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19401493.2022.2061050","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62cbc9804097075e7c532455","name":"Elie","lastName":"Azar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c4163df0-5472-4015-b30d-45f92b147f5b"},{"objectId":"62cbc9804097075e7c532454","name":"Marcel","lastName":"Schweiker","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c26c728-2b6a-47e5-8e02-37ed0ee757c3"},{"objectId":"62cbc9804097075e7c532453","name":"Marika","lastName":"Vellei","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"003b6bf5-eee2-4141-b6ba-373e63825fad"},{"objectId":"62cbc9804097075e7c532452","name":"Christiane","lastName":"Berger","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"63cfdbc3-2697-4e1a-9d10-34ceee04b32e"},{"objectId":"62cbc9804097075e7c532451","name":"Ardeshir","lastName":"Mahdavi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"74193a23-bed9-42e1-853f-8338081c4d21"},{"objectId":"62cbc9804097075e7c532450","name":"Bing","lastName":"Dong","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"80ae312a-3486-4a75-ba09-e5cefc88d000"},{"objectId":"62cbc9804097075e7c53244f","name":"Salvatore","lastName":"Carlucci","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"92587962-aefd-47cb-8f4d-47738dfcecb3"},{"objectId":"5e7093c1878c28a0473b0342","name":"Karol","lastName":"Bandurski","uuid":"970304C8ADAEA8D2CB1B9A22440B3CA5380A4DF87A9F3595B1CE75B3A71E879E2B8A6BCF3F90C61ACEB35239AE12B6B7E6DC1C8E41224B77CEAB8D481257243C","orcidId":"0000-0001-8578-7233","documentHash":"8ce30dab-e596-4871-8197-415b2eb0f1b1"}],"doi":"10.1080/19401493.2022.2061050"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["OpenHAB","Raspberry Pi","inteligentny dom","Linuks"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e176","uid":"bu_pEE67a1BU39yobRpbYjQ","uuid":"813f25f1-a4eb-4a11-9146-4dcbb3861634","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wydział Elektroniki (Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna im.Jarosława Dąbrowskiego)","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62c5813b4097074de227dce5","5e7092a2878c28a047399afc"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"PROJEKT INTELIGENTNEGO DOMU Z WYKORZYSTANIEM OPROGRAMOWANIA OpenHAB","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"61b9ac0ead204581b62ebb4a","mniswId":"201251","title":"Elektronika - konstrukcje, technologie, zastosowania","doi":null,"issn":"0033-2089","eissn":"2449-9528","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"MINISTRY","editor":null,"documentHash":"cfc36e12-15f3-44f9-a01b-b9c0de5bd484"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62c5813b4097074de227dce3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62c5813b4097074de227dce5","5e7092a2878c28a047399afc"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article presents an example of how to make and configure a fragment of a smart home project.

The development of algorithms dedicated to RNA three-dimensional (3D) structures contributes to the\r\ndemand for training, testing and benchmarking data. A reliable source of such data derived from computational pre-\r\ndiction is the RNA-Puzzles repository. In contrast, the largest resource with experimentally determined structures is\r\nthe Protein Data Bank.

The article proposes a signal to control the gear ratio or the amount of additional propulsion torque coming from an electric motor. The innovative control signal in this application is the signal generated by the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) of the muscles of the upper limbs, transformed by the central processing unit (CPU) into muscle activity (MA) when using a wheelchair. The paper includes research on eight muscles of the upper limbs that are active when propelling a wheelchair. Asymmetry in the value for MVC was found between the left and right limbs, while the belly of the long radial extensor muscle of the wrist was determined to be the muscle with the least asymmetry for the users under study. This pilot research demonstrates that the difference in mean MVCmax values between the left and the right limbs can range from 20% to 49%, depending on the muscle being tested. The finding that some muscle groups demonstrate less difference in MVC values suggests that it is possible to design systems for regulating the gear ratio or additional propelling force based on the MVC signal from the muscle of one limb, as described in the patent application from 2022, no.

The peculiarities of ecotourism development in the period of globalization are considered and the insufficient involvement of nature protection territories and their potential for the development of domestic and international tourism is pointed out. The problem of poor implementation of sustainable tourism forms is singled out. The main accents of the relationship “urban society – holiday-maker (tourist) – environment” have been identified. A number of works of domestic scientists, legislative, normative- legal, strategic and program documents regulating tourist movement within the protected areas are analyzed. The essence and potential of the studied territory on the possibilities of ecological tourism development and preconditions for the functioning of ecotourism infrastructure have been revealed. The structural elements of ecotourism infrastructure have been singled out, namely: ecological and educational trails, tourist routes, visit-centers, information tourist points and centers, specially equipped zones, historical and culturalobjects, accommodation and catering establishments, etc. For example, a detailed analysis of the ecotourism infrastructure of the National Park “Synevyr” located within the Carpathian region of the Transcarpathian region has been given. On the basis of a thorough analysis the natural, historical and cultural attractions have been studied and the most popular tourist routes within the research area have been identified. In addition to interesting tourist sites (natural or historical and cultural), the current state of ecological trails and tourist routes, as well as the mode of their use has been determined. The main problems and limiting factors of tourism use are used and conservation of protected areas have been described. A detailed characteristics of the National Park “Synevyr” functioning has been given and the latest material of natural, historical and cultural attractions, ecological and educational trails and tourist routes have been collected and analyzed. It is proved that within the studied area the village Kolochava is the most popular tourist destination with proper infrastructure and information and advertising support.

The goal is to deposit the majority of metal dissolved in the electrolytic bath during a reasonable time (no longer than several hours) providing an acceptable quality of the deposits in terms of purity, surface roughness, compact and crack-free structure and mechanical stability. The electrodeposition is carried out from novel aqueous baths prepared by dissolution of a metal powder in a HNO 3 -free solution due to the limited availability of isotopically enriched nickel concentration of the metal in the bath is low or moderate. This factor combined with the requirement of deposition of all dissolved metal makes serious differences between the target deposition and regular industrial plating. The impact of the electrolytic bath pH and the plating current density is analysed in order to optimise deposition parameters. The pH was varied from 3.8 to 5.3 while the applied current density ranged from 30 to 240 mA cm −2 . Progress in the deposition process was analysed using in situ UV–vis spectroscopy while a scanning electron microscope was applied to study the morphology of the deposits. Optimal electroplating conditions, which allow relatively fast deposition (up to ca. 7.2 h) of good quality metallic deposits containing most of the metal present in the bath (≥ 95%), are suggested."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149303","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c5db674097074de22c4403","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"575df06b-1358-42a0-8eb9-994393ceaf15"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"26","pagesFromTo":"1761–1774","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10008-022-05194-y.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62c5db674097074de22c4400","name":"M.","lastName":"Próchniak","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2326-5242","documentHash":"ffab5afe-584d-4be0-a51c-fe427d255fd5"},{"objectId":"5e7093d5878c28a0473b18a5","name":"Michał","lastName":"Grdeń","uuid":"29B853592821B776FA01B009BC89A857A7290C9E8C2C5C41D510D73DC754E56E239482374156E79398A6DD59D0174E08804114D5D0CC2AF8FFBE9611A87E8860","orcidId":"0000-0002-5208-5822","documentHash":"abe74a6e-b120-4fbb-b803-453aeb665394"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10008-022-05194-y"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet

is an inherent factor in the inflammatory process and is important in the regulation of some immune cell functions, including the expression of mast cell pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. Hypoxia also influences cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Hyaluronic acid is one of the major components of the ECM that is involved in inflammatory and tissue regeneration processes in which mast cells play a prominent role. This prompted us to investigate the effects of hypoxia on the expression of hyaluronic acid receptors in mast cells and mast cell adhesion to this ECM component. We found that human LAD2 mast cells spontaneously adhered to hyaluronic acid in a CD44-dependent manner and that reduced oxygen concentrations inhibited or even completely abolished this adhesion process. The mechanism of hypoxia downregulation of mast cell adhesion to hyaluronic acid did not involve a decrease in CD44 expression and hyaluronidase-mediated degradation of adhesion substrates but rather conformational changes in the avidity of CD44 to hyaluronic acid.

decade 2021–2030 has been declared the Decade of Healthy Aging by the United Nations General Assembly, underlining that health is central to the experience of older age and the opportunities that aging brings. Self-rated health (SRH) appears consistent with the state of objective health, and therefore can serve as a simple core indicator of healthy aging. SRH can be affected by psychological and lifestyle factors, and by the developmental and sociodemographic context, which can directly and indirectly influence subjective health status. The aim of the present study was to establish the structure of the relationships between SRH, health-related behavior, subjective wellbeing, developmental tasks attainment and sociodemographic factors in the late-life period.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\nThe study group consisted of 340 Polish retired seniors, aged 61 to 94 (M = 70.75, SD = 6.48): 88 men (25.9 %) and 252 women (74.1 %). The respondents completed the following measures: 10-point numerical scale for SRH, Health-Related Questionnaire for Seniors, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Developmental Tasks Questionnaire for Seniors and a sociodemographic survey.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nThe group demonstrated a medium level of SRH and other variables. SHR was positively correlated with health-related behavior, wellbeing, developmental tasks attainment and perceived economic status, and negatively with age. Structural equation model revealed that health-related behavior, wellbeing, age and economic status have a direct influence on SRH. Developmental tasks attainment was found to predict health behavior, although no direct relationship with SRH was found.\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\nA broader understanding of healthy aging is achieved by considering the context of its factors. Psychological interventions should promote a healthy lifestyle and adapt it to the late life period to promote health among seniors."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149319","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"228","pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691822001664","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a047397a22","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Zadworna","uuid":"ED71F5F1A8330ECBC2FBB72925A1BFC9BC01823DA1E19906904F6F93E82889ED50309CEDD3C56A4174D86141B2B38A915AA87EACD208921A883F4BC4B879856F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0585-019X","documentHash":"a3adcf6e-0dce-4140-8049-77472ee15e26"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.actpsy.2022.103651"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["transdermal patches","composition","extract of white willow bark","sage extract of medicinal leaves","quercetin"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61a48c5d2467f00d7d8b34df","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Ukrainian National University of Pharmacy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62cbc479409707746ec41ce5","62cbc479409707746ec41ce6","62cbc479409707746ec41ce7","62cbc479409707746ec41ce8"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Experimental research on the development of the composition of the transdermal therapeutic system of anti-inflammatory action based on composition of natural substances","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa81c9aff2974850cc6b","mniswId":"29703","title":"ScienceRise: Pharmaceutical Science","doi":null,"issn":"2519-4844","eissn":"2519-4852","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"7c216be4-5906-49b5-8f7b-cc5236fb0b7e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62cbc479409707746ec41ce3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62cbc479409707746ec41ce5","62cbc479409707746ec41ce6","62cbc479409707746ec41ce7","62cbc479409707746ec41ce8"]},"issue":"3(37)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the work is to develop the composition of the transdermal therapeutic system of anti-inflammatory action based on active pharmaceutical ingredients of natural origin.\n\nMaterials and methods.

The massive development of phytoplankton is driven partly by the anthropogenic eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and the expansion of toxic cyanobacteria in planktonic communities in temperate climate zones by the continual increase in global temperature. Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) not only disturb the ecological balance of the ecosystem, but they also prevent the use of waterbodies by humans. This study examines the cause of an unusual, persistent bloom in a recreational, flow-through reservoir; the findings emphasize the role played by the river supplying the reservoir in the formation of its massive cyanobacterial bloom. Comprehensive ecosystem-based environmental studies were performed, including climate change investigation, hydrochemical analysis, and bio-assessment of the ecological state of the river/reservoir, together with monitoring the cyanobacteria content of phytoplankton. Our findings show that the persistent and dominant biomass of Microcystis was related to the N/P ratio, while the presence of Aphanizomenon and Dolichospermum was associated with the high-temperature end electric conductivity of water. Together with the increase in global temperature, the massive and persistent cyanobacterial bloom appears to be maintained by the inflow of biogenic compounds carried by the river and the high electric conductivity of water. Even at the beginning of the phenomenon, the reservoir water already contained cyanobacterial toxins, which excluded its recreational use for about half the year.

was created by God in the image of God (Gen 1,27) in a dialogue of love. The article, edited on the basis of the sources of Benedict XVI’s theology of creation, treats as the subject of analysis the qualitative interpretation of love revealed by God in the act of creation and present in the history of mankind with the passage of time until the fulfillment of the history of the world. God’s activity cannot be enclosed in the clasp of human logic, because mercy is its content. Man called by God to communion with Him is surrounded by caring merciful love that does not deprive him of freedom and decisions that do not always  correspond  to  God’s  logic.  Pope  Benedict  XVI  reveals  God  as  creator  consistently responsible for the gift of human life formed in love and oriented towards existential fulfillment by man. At the same time, he draws attention to the need, which created man must be guided by, to discover His presence in human existence with the commitment of man’s own free will. God’s love is the source of continual transformation into His image, to finally become one with Him. Man’s acknowledgment of this Truth and adherence to it with mind and heart is a guarantee of the realization of God’s plan of love."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149334","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cbffba409707746ec643f9","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":"7","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"8231657e-f968-4030-965f-386e7bc7640e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"7","pagesFromTo":"145-164","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"Benedict XVI’s perspective on the dialogue between the Creator’s love and creation"}],"publicUri":"https://std.uwb.edu.pl/index.php/std/issue/view/2/28","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70925e878c28a04739481f","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Proniewski","uuid":"B7768DA1005215755E84992A5579AD1FA63F6419DCA40FB6672463D0D679B618D75B1E1C40F0422FA51FAC569EA57B20013B7E835A97A0609C3C0F10606213FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-0382-3646","documentHash":"bfef4c32-1473-41d4-be02-4a317fa37143"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["innovation brokers","triple helix","counteracting barriers"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62cd44ab4097075e7c5bb937","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-00218-2","title":"Advances in Manufacturing III : Volume 3 - Quality Engineering: Research and Technology Innovations, Industry 4.0","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-3-031-00166-6","ismn":null,"issn":"2195-4356","url":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-00218-2","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"31fceaa6-e067-4bf5-ac15-82b2e185ffe8","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f1878c28a04739fa4b","5e7093a9878c28a0473aea47","5e7093a9878c28a0473aeaf7","5e7093a9878c28a0473ae947"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"The Triple Helix Concept in the Aspect of Counteracting Barriers in Science, Industry and the Public Sector","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62cd44f54097075e7c5bc6b4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f1878c28a04739fa4b","5e7093a9878c28a0473aeaf7","5e7093a9878c28a0473aea47","5e7093a9878c28a0473ae947","62cd44f54097075e7c5bc6ba","62cd44f54097075e7c5bc6bb","62cd44f54097075e7c5bc6bc"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this article is to present a set of barriers activities occurring in collaboration between scientists, business and infrastructure at the public sector level.

It is essential to transfer knowledge and technology from academia to industrial and social ground, highlighting and adapting solutions to some of the major problems related to industrial and societal challenges. The main goal is to create added value for the real economy. It is a particular challenge for companies with complex production technology (foundry, plastic processing, meld plastic working). In this respect, a special role lies in the good communication of the public sector, industry as well as modern universities focused on the willingness to cooperate.

To achieve a humorous effect, meme creators use various means, displaying unprecedented creativity. They often draw in-spiration from cult Soviet comedies by Leonid Gaidai, Georgiy Daneliya, Vladimir Menshov, Eldar Ryazanov,  Aleksandr  Sery  and  other  famous  directors.  This  article  is  devoted  to  the  analysis  of  intertextual connections in Russian internet memes related to the current COVID-19 pandemic. The intertextual references can be in the form of a frame from a Soviet comedy, a movie catchphrase, or both at the same time. Catchphrases can be used in the analysed internet memes in their original version, or they can undergo various modifications, such as the replacement of some components and/or  the  extension  of  phrase  composition.  The  fact  of  making  use  of  a  specific  movie  scene  or  catchphrase by meme creators proves that Soviet comedy is still deeply rooted in Russian culture. Soviet comedies begin to “live a new life” in internet memes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149342","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c3e46f4097077bbdbce51c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"47","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"260f6c6c-4866-497a-9dfe-8d4c4f452a7b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"47","pagesFromTo":"243-260","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pressto.amu.edu.pl/index.php/strp/article/download/34364/29750","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092eb878c28a04739f314","name":"Gabriela","lastName":"Wilk","uuid":"93F2FC6E116E0712510D2A9A07C8AB69FCAD3A9D33BB1F085A6D9B882FD20D52822A3E6EACF4D32D98E77701410FEE39139D07FC7C4C5FB39EBCC5BD31BB0A53","orcidId":"0000-0001-9112-5674","documentHash":"89a88a1f-7b6f-4dee-8646-d3d44bd198fa"}],"doi":"10.14746/strp.2022.47.1.16"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["social media","FSFI","BSMAS","sexual activity","female"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Chcąc w poprawny i świadomy sposób wykonywać działalność innowacyjną, zasadnym rozwiązaniem jest podjąć próbę realizowania procesów zarządzania ryzykiem. Jednym z przejawów takiej aktywności jest identyfikacja kluczowych czynników ryzyka (zagrożeń) oraz szacowanie poziomu złożoności zapewniania bezpieczeństwa przedsiębiorstwa. W opracowaniu skonstruowano dwa wskaźniki: (1) wskaźnik złożoności zagrożeń oraz (2) wskaźnik złożoności zapewniania bezpieczeństwa. Badanie miało przede wszystkim odpowiedzieć na pytanie – jak przedsiębiorstwa podchodzą do zapewnienia bezpieczeństwa, a także jakie zagrożenia są najważniejsze w kontekście zapewniania bezpieczeństwa? Próba badawcza liczyła 150 przedsiębiorstw innowacyjnych zlokalizowanych w Polsce, a respondentami byli właściciele lub menedżerowie odpowiedzialni za zarządzanie ryzykiem, procesy innowacyjne lub zarządzanie projektami.

Their role and importance are determined by the broadly understood specificity of innovative processes carried out in a given enterprise. In order to organize innovative activities in a correct and aware way, it is reasonable to try to implement risk management processes. One of the manifestations of such activity is the identification of key risk factors (threats) and estimation of the level of complexity of ensuring the enterprise’s safety. In the study, there have been constructed two indicators: (1) Threat’s Complexity Index and (2) Safety’s Assurance Complexity Index. The study has been primarily intended to answer the question – how enterprises realize the assurance of safety, as well as what threats are the most important in the context of ensuring safety? The research sample has consisted of 150 innovative enterprises located in Poland, and the respondents were owners or managers responsible for risk management, innovation processes or project management. The study has showed that both the complexity of threats to innovative enterprises and the complexity of ensuring safety in these entities are at a relatively high level."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149349","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"143-164","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092a8878c28a04739a19d","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Woźniak","uuid":"F56F3FBFB3E89AC324A57F78388F33692D3C60378B867B6C93D297794D987EF4657FF0BB60F41492EAA35D951A9AACC11A668A3DA64E863D22ABA05AC77CAF72","orcidId":"0000-0001-7592-0109","documentHash":"c35923e0-cac8-4fea-b468-7506eef4a827"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Minnesotaite","Thermal decomposition","Oxidation","Dehydrogenation","Banded iron formation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f9878c28a0473c8417"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Thermal decomposition of minnesotaite and dehydrogenation during Fe2+ oxidation, with implications for redox reactions in Banded Iron Formations","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775cf","mniswId":"3476","title":"CHEMICAL GEOLOGY","doi":null,"issn":"0009-2541","eissn":"1878-5999","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"17f2d5d6-f35a-4cd6-8991-c0a32fe91938"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62cb309a4097071cdd64e4a4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709297878c28a0473989d9","5e709291878c28a047398202","5e7094f9878c28a0473c8417","5e709298878c28a047398b2f"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The study of the thermal decomposition of Fe2+-phyllosilicates and –silicates plays a crucial role in understanding the redox processes contributing to the global iron and hydrological cycles. In contrast to the widely accepted model of oxidation by incorporation of oxygen, Fe2+ oxidation of phyllosilicates and silicates studied under laboratory conditions is driven by a thermally induced dehydrogenation reaction, which proceeds as follows: Fe2+ + OH- → Fe3+ + Or2- + ½ H2↑. The processes of oxidation in Banded Iron Formation (BIF), both before and after the Great Oxidation Event, are debated between biotic and abiotic, and/or primary and secondary oxidation. Most BIFs have undergone various grades of metamorphism, including thermal events that support secondary oxidation and which control redox conditions. Here, Fe2+-rich minnesotaite, (Fe2+Mg)3Si4O10(OH)3, a common Fe2+-silicate occurring in BIFs, from an unaltered and unoxidized unit of the Biwabik Iron Formation (Minnesota, USA), was selected to study dehydrogenation as a potential secondary oxidation reaction of Fe-silicates in BIFs. The sample was heated thermogravimetrically (TG) under dynamic and isothermal conditions up to 1050 °C in dry N2 and synthetic air. Volatiles that evolved during heating were measured by a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The transitional and final heating products were examined by Mössbauer spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). During the dynamic and isothermal heating, under inert and oxidizing atmospheric conditions, the minnesotaite structure underwent two reactions: dehydroxylation and oxidative dehydrogenation, producing H2O and H2 gas, respectively. Under dynamic heating in dry N2, dehydrogenation resulted in oxidation of ~16% of Fe2+ and ~0.09 wt.% H2 liberation. However, heating at 300, 350 and 400 °C for 48–80 hours in an inert atmosphere enhanced the progress of the reaction leading to the complete substitution of OH-Fe2+ by O-Fe3+, before dehydroxylation. When the sample was heated in synthetic air, despite high oxygen activity, oxidation by dehydrogenation occurredand the liberation of H2 in the presence of oxygen produced an excess of H2O at the sample surface. Dehydrogenation led to the formation of oxyminnesotaite, which is depleted in OH-, that showed greater thermal stability than Fe2+–minnesotaite. The final alteration products of minnesotaite (at 700–1050 °C) were hematite and maghemite when fully dehydrogenated in the presence of oxygen and ferric pyroxene and magnetite when the structure was partially dehydrogenated in the absence of oxygen. In this study, the mechanism of thermally induced oxidation of minnesotaite was thoroughly described and refers to the state of knowledge of thermal decomposition of other Fe-silicates and -phyllosilicates for the first time. Our results, together with other comprehensive studies regarding dehydrogenation, allows for a critical discussion of the reaction as one of the potential process of abiotic, secondary oxidation of Fe2+–silicates in BIFs to take place. A theoretical model of a dehydration sequence of minnesotaite during prograde metamorphism is proposed in the context of co-occurring dehydrogenation. A high Fe3+/Fet ratio corresponding to low OH/H2O content is diagnostic for dehydrogenated minerals; hence methodological and geological implementation may indicate and trace the reaction in geological environments."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149356","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cb309a4097071cdd64e4aa","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"601","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"7d1bc69b-7f5e-4a5b-a069-6165b040719e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"601","pagesFromTo":"120867","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://opus.us.edu.pl/info/article/USLc1839d89dcac47be9af0e4b5c43ed9cd/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094f9878c28a0473c8417","name":"Ashley","lastName":"Gumsley","uuid":"98475AFE2C98BBC2060D8E305E3BF0436FB6AFA0BAB59905301B05689F6822591786192ABC1F034A7264593EA02A60893B7087818BC8802D46189F90089B54A4","orcidId":"0000-0003-1395-3065","documentHash":"5085d534-6af4-412f-b966-b41f9aecf5ea"},{"objectId":"5e709298878c28a047398b2f","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Ciesielska","uuid":"5F6573A82599DFAC91CD15F81778440C27D361C53491E4CC306EA592F3C9F15BA5AF522E9DA387C5F80292B9374A808CEA1A9768BB6A308A09C85A248739435E","orcidId":"0000-0002-3749-5874","documentHash":"37d724e1-d7a0-476e-97d3-0e260d0bd436"},{"objectId":"5e709297878c28a0473989d9","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Lempart-Drozd","uuid":"491B760A368D7B7DD4411299D6D336F4F6EC2F5EB56EC32DC4B3C10E6E76C2A7BD3EDB5541185A1CD5AAAE3745BA173E4341211522A3CB053587404B4CB31E9A","orcidId":"0000-0001-7394-5951","documentHash":"0051ae92-e56b-4991-bdaf-500b86f67db9"},{"objectId":"5e709291878c28a047398202","name":"Artur","lastName":"Błachowski","uuid":"21ED226D4806D1B98AD5A2E93E147B1DC158832D5F8A2CB6791C65D00CCD917024A571AB18E3292F00B0970B27FF7F9130B2D939EB1463E580DE8F44731718ED","orcidId":"0000-0002-5591-5756","documentHash":"ef741259-fa66-48f8-b3d7-f2a384dd61a6"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.chemgeo.2022.120867"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet

To establish the main composition of allelochemicals and the activity of their aqueous extracts from sweet sorghum seeds – hybrids with high and medium sugar content ‘Sugargraze ARG’ (Argentina), ‘Sioux’ (USA) and ‘Ananas’ (Ukraine) on germination energy and seed germination of test crops (peas, clover).\n\nMethods. Allelopathic, physiological-biochemical, agrochemical and statistical methods were used. The allelopathic activity of extracts (water-soluble) from the seeds of the studied sorghum hybrids was determined by direct biotesting. The chemical component of allelopathically active substances was determined by extraction.\n\nResults. Aqueous extracts from sweet sorghum seeds of hybrids ‘Sugar­graze ARG’, ‘Sioux’ and ‘Ananas’ were found to have a high content of phytochemicals and at a concentration of 40 and 50% inhibited the germination energy and germination of pea and clover seeds by an average of 15–42%. Aqueous extracts of concentrations from 5 to 30% of the studied hybrids showed a stimulating and tolerant effect on the quality of seeds of biotest crops of clover and peas, as germination rates were at the level of control or 5–7% higher, i.e. showed the least allelopathic activity.\n\nConclusions. Sweet sorghum seeds have a sufficient number of allelochemicals, the specificity of which depends on varietal differences in the content of phenolic compounds (glycosides), tannins, acids and carbohydrates. The activity of the allelochemicals extracted from the seeds was weak in the stimulating effect and high in the inhibitory one. For water-soluble extracts from sorghum seeds, a sharp decrease in the manifestation of allelopathic activity is characteristic when their concentration decreases to 5–20%. Studies of water-soluble extracts of seeds at a concentration of 30–50% showed their high overall allelopathic activity, which was manifested in the inhibition of seed germination of biotest crops by 42%. The species-specific action of allelochemicals must be taken into account when sowing multicomponent fields, crop rotation planning, and the use of sweet sorghum as green manure."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149365","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cac85b4097071cdd63c43f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"18","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"93af0c9e-4519-471d-9bb7-596d5b3bf736"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"66-74","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journal.sops.gov.ua/article/download/257589/256661","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62cad2584097071cdd63d70d","name":"S.

They influence the development of plants and enable a yield-forming effect. An important feature of these preparations is that they are safe for the environment. They can be treated as substitutes for plant protection agents, which is especially important in the era of implementation of the European Green Deal, ordering the reduction of chemicalization of agriculture. The purpose of this paper was to compare the production and economic results of five methods of plantation care in Solanum tuberosum cultivation: on the first object (control), mechanical cultivation was used, and on the second, object the herbicide Avatar 293 ZC (1.5 dm3·ha−1), on object three, the herbicide Avatar 293 ZC (1.5 dm3·ha−1) and the biostimulant PlonoStart (2.0 dm3·ha−1), on object four, the herbicide Avatar 293 ZC (1.5 dm3·ha−1) and biostimulant Aminoplant (1.5 dm3·ha−1), and on object five, the herbicide Avatar 293 ZC (1.5 dm3·ha−1) and biostimulant Agro-Sorb Folium (4.0 dm3·ha−1). The research was conducted from 2018 to 2020 at the Agricultural Experimental Station in Zawady, central-eastern Poland. The results were analyzed, on average, for two Polish edible potato cultivars (Malaga and Oberon), and three years of study (2018–2020) were taken into consideration. The experiment was established as a two-factor experiment in three replicates on light soil in a spit-plot arrangement. A beneficial effect of herbicides and biostimulants on the yield and profitability of edible potato production was observed. An average increase of 33.2% in marketable yield was obtained. The gross margin increased by an average of 49.3%. The highest total yield, as compared to the control object, was obtained from object 5, where the herbicide Avatar 293 ZC with biostimulant Agro-Sorb Folium was applied, such as the greatest economic effect was achieved also in object no. 5.

It has reduced costs, increased productivity and accuracy of the implant manufacturing process. However, there are problems associated with assessing defects in the microstructure, mechanical and technological properties of alloys, both during their production by powder metallurgy and in the process of 3D printing. Thus traditional research methods of alloys properties demand considerable human, material, and time resources. At the same time, artificial intelligence tools create opportunities for intelligent evaluation of the conformity for the microstructure, phase composition, and properties of titanium powder's alloys. It provides new possibilities for the efficient production of biocompatible implants for various functional purposes. However, the accuracy of the methods and models used should be as high as possible. In this paper we designed a hybrid PNN-SVM (Probabilistic Neural Network-Support Vector Machine) high-precision approach for the intelligent evaluation of alloy properties for additive manufacturing of biomedical implants. We have proposed a new approach for extending the dimensionality of input data space by the outputs of the summation layer of the modified PNN topology. Subsequent classification based on the expanded dataset is performed using SVM. We conducted experimental modeling of the proposed approach using a data set on the properties of titanium alloys Ti-6Al-4V and Ti-Al-V-Zr. We have demonstrated a significant increase in the accuracy of the PNN-SVM scheme compared to the single classifiers that form it and other machine learning methods. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

The GRACE mission ended in October 2017, and 11 months later, the GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) mission was launched in May 2018. Bridging the gap between both missions is essential to obtain continuous mass changes. To fill the gap, we propose a new approach based on a remove–restore technique combined with an autoregressive (AR) prediction. We first make use of the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) hydrological model to remove climatology from GRACE/GRACE-FO data. Since the GLDAS mis-models real TWS changes for many regions around the world, we further use least-squares estimation (LSE) to remove remaining residual trends and annual and semi-annual oscillations. The missing 11 months of TWS values are then predicted forward and backward with an AR model. For the forward approach, we use the GRACE TWS values before the gap; for the backward approach, we use the GRACE-FO TWS values after the gap. The efficiency of forward–backward AR prediction is examined for the artificial gap of 11 months that we create in the GRACE TWS changes for the July 2008 to May 2009 period. We obtain average differences between predicted and observed GRACE values of at maximum 5 cm for 80% of areas, with the extreme values observed for the Amazon, Alaska, and South and Northern Asia. We demonstrate that forward–backward AR prediction is better than the standalone GLDAS hydrological model for more than 75% of continental areas. For the natural gap (July 2017–May 2018), the misclosures in backward–forward prediction estimated between forward- and backward-predicted values are equal to 10 cm.

Generation Z\n(Gen Z), whose representatives are now entering adult life, will play a key role in the implementation\nof this concept. The purpose of this study is to investigate the nature of the relationship between\nthe evaluation of smart mobility’s importance for a smart city and the attitudes and behaviours\nof Generation Z members in the context of sustainability, use of ICT, and their declarative and\nactual participation in smart city activities. The diagnostic survey method was used to achieve\nthe research objective. The authors designed the questionnaire based on a literature analysis. The\nresearch sample consisted of 484 representatives of Generation Z—students of universities located\nin a smart city, Lublin (Poland). The collected data was statistically analysed using the following\nmethods and statistical tests: Cronbach’s alpha, Pearson’s chi-square test for independence, symmetric\nmeasures: Cramer’s V, and the contingency coefficient. The analysis of the obtained research results\nconfirms that the conscious approach of Generation Z to sustainability has a significant and positive\nimpact on their evaluation of actions taken in the field of smart mobility for a smart city. A similar\nrelationship was confirmed with regard to the relationship between ICT use and smart mobility\nevaluation. The significant and positive impact of young people’s participation in smart cities on\ntheir evaluation of smart mobility solutions’ importance was not fully and unequivocally confirmed.\nIn conclusion, the Generation Z representatives’ awareness of the importance of sustainability and\ncaring for the natural environment was confirmed by their desire to be pro-ecological in the areas\nof smart mobility studied in the paper. Moreover, young people who constantly use the latest\ntechnologies see their huge potential for the development of smart mobility in cities. However,\ndespite the growing expectations of citizens’ active attitudes and their increasing participation in\nsmart mobility development, it seems that the representatives of Generation Z are not really interested\nin it. Their declarations of willingness to join various opinion-forming and decision making processes\ndo not actually transform them into active co-creators of smart mobility solutions. Changing this\napproach can be an educational, organisational and technological challenge for smart city authorities.\nThe obtained research results could be used as guidelines for facilitating the search for innovative\nsolutions in the area of smart mobility, improving the quality of life of smart city residents based on\nthe principle of sustainable development."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149397","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b30925409707737cf519c7","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"13","doi":null,"documentHash":"6d3d4e41-2f09-492c-9423-5a7dd3a0a115"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"4651","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/13/4651/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70927a878c28a047396588","name":"Kalina","lastName":"Grzesiuk","uuid":"9B98712ED31B892CE56A1274773474F67A4973DB91DD5F0BA084C6E96CD17E32A821CC59AC0D0CD2148D57BC3D314BA5433B5779513318E93FD7B2094594FE81","orcidId":"0000-0003-1513-1081","documentHash":"454574e6-94b1-46ec-882b-826041f59dcb"},{"objectId":"5e709276878c28a0473961b8","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Jegorow","uuid":"6AF50B7AC9DC43280CC9164223BD7357586090482E605B3D6F2E8BE60B8A914B2D6718263CE20973FD4BE5BBFA023EEC86EB2E84013A6A68A8C00CB6C05B32FB","orcidId":"0000-0002-0968-4109","documentHash":"ed544453-af11-4ca1-8a3f-6ae6df7dfa1e"},{"objectId":"5e709256878c28a047393fcb","name":"Monika","lastName":"Wawer","uuid":"497C943F2D6317C3612DC43086602D8B910C92670BA59530A6879D76EDB487585B63FBE480C933D9F9FD09F4ACD4EB117E60BC45F96149B6E4010E1A25000FEE","orcidId":"0000-0003-4970-4650","documentHash":"6f54b97d-0ff4-4e5c-af0f-0786706ad19b"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15134651"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["carrot","beetroot","potato","apple","organic production","pesticide residues","LC-MS/MS","GC-ECD/NPD"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Evaluation of Pesticide Residues Occurrence in Random Samples of Organic Fruits and Vegetables Marketed in Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"Foods","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2304-8158","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"0f59a8f0-a1f9-45c0-ba10-cec780ad3d19"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62c511634097074de221c4cc","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["643bbec04097076e1ead17f0","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2a7a","643bbec04097076e1ead17f1","643bbec04097076e1ead17f2","643bbec04097076e1ead17f3","643bbec04097076e1ead17f4","643bbec04097076e1ead17f5","643bbec04097076e1ead17f6"]},"issue":"13","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>In recent years, organic food, produced with the use of natural means and production methods, has been gaining more and more popularity among consumers. This is due, inter alia, to their belief that it is more abundant in health-promoting bioactive compounds and safer than conventional food. Consumers are increasingly aware of the harmfulness of plant protection products used in intensive agriculture, which are not allowed in organic production. At the same time, it is reported that a certain share of organic products on the EU market are contaminated with pesticide residues, which may raise consumer concerns and lead to a loss of trust in organic food. The aim of the present study was to investigate the problem of pesticide residues occurrence in random samples of organically produced fruits and vegetables (apples, potatoes, carrots, and beetroots) commonly used in the Polish households, and which are available directly from the organic producers in open markets in Poland. For simultaneous analysis of 375 pesticides, an LC-MS/MS system consisting of an Eksigent expert ultraLC 100-XL coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer QTRAP 6500 and GC Agilent 6890 N equipped with ECD/NPD system were used. Among the 96 vegetable and fruit samples studied, 89 samples (92.7%) were free from detectable pesticide residues, 7 samples (7.3%) of carrot (5) and potato (2) were contaminated, and in 1 of them (1.0%) the detected residues exceeded the maximum residue limit (MRL). None of the tested apple and beetroot samples were found to contain detectable residues. These findings are important for Polish consumers who look for high-quality organic food. However, the presence of detectable residues in a small proportion of the organic samples indicates a need to strengthen the monitoring of pesticides in organic crops, to educate farmers and to raise their awareness regarding the risks of unauthorized use of pesticides banned in organic farming, which can damage the reputation of the whole organic sector.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149400","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/11/13/1963","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"643bbec04097076e1ead17f6","name":"Bogusław","lastName":"Gnusowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7a3c44f5-425d-4207-aaef-19c8d9c50f8f"},{"objectId":"643bbec04097076e1ead17f5","name":"Rita","lastName":"Góralska-Walczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ba1c1492-fe78-46f9-bb7d-530b2a053baf"},{"objectId":"643bbec04097076e1ead17f4","name":"Klaudia","lastName":"Kopczyńska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6f51d33d-e2f6-464e-b86f-861ace726132"},{"objectId":"643bbec04097076e1ead17f3","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Hołodyńska-Kulas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c7ade730-2bcc-4cae-9707-cd350b7500dd"},{"objectId":"643bbec04097076e1ead17f2","name":"Anna","lastName":"Nowacka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ff0164b6-b0cf-48e2-8510-a38c4cb6fa7c"},{"objectId":"643bbec04097076e1ead17f1","name":"Jan","lastName":"Golba","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"05d6f461-d94e-4746-ae84-47b955a9af59"},{"objectId":"643bbec04097076e1ead17f0","name":"Renata","lastName":"Kazimierczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"35a7d2d8-1f79-4637-9346-ad27ef4b3f72"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2a7a","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Średnicka-Tober","uuid":"F1FD2658AD6E730D0542376EDD9E6F7A8FDB35AEAE02C71862181BE33EA892A5EFD7C884458D8AAAA43B4B1D123197BECBB2EFF8643FD1720625ABD26E43CB88","orcidId":"0000-0002-8143-2918","documentHash":"007af510-0205-454c-a6f6-8935ccfa01d3"}],"doi":"10.3390/foods11131963"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sustainable supply chain management","Tourism industry","Industry 3.5","AI heuristics for optimisation"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397064"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Application of Industry 3.5 approach for planning of more sustainable supply chain operations for tourism service providers","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478238","mniswId":"9087","title":"International Journal of Logistics Research and Applications","doi":null,"issn":"1367-5567","eissn":"1469-848X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"1fcd041a-6f7d-4dc3-926c-9f5c1eb2fabf"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62c5562a4097075e7ccc544f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709284878c28a047397064","659fa39b4097076c1449a4bc","659fa39b4097076c1449a4bd","659fa39b4097076c1449a4be","659fa39b4097076c1449a4bf"]},"issue":"11","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper addresses a tourist trip design problem and a tour route planning problem to improve the competitiveness of community tourism. The problem was investigated with the objective to maximise the total number of tourists interested in visiting multiple points of interest and several specific activities to receive a satisfactory service by matching their preferences. To solve this problem, a mixed-integer linear programming model was developed for small-size problems, while the modified differential evolution with K-variable moves and random variable neighbourhood search (MDE–RVNS) was developed to determine near-optimal solutions for real problems. To assist the tourism service provider to schedule and sequence the trip and route planning for the tourists, a tourism service provider scheduling and sequencing software based on the MDE-RVNS was designed and developed. A mobile application using the software has been planned for launching to assist tour route planning decisionmakers. This can help local tourism businesses to manage demands and ensure that the tourism revenue is evenly distributed in a tourism supply chain to enhance the well-being of local communities"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149402","journalIssue":{"objectId":"659fa39b4097076c1449a4bb","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"26","number":"11","doi":null,"documentHash":"8adda194-f6eb-4fbc-8c01-8e4cc8e11a65"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"26","pagesFromTo":"1578 - 1601","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13675567.2022.2090529","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"659fa39b4097076c1449a4bf","name":"Pawnrat","lastName":"Thumrongvut","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"12072f84-44ab-41d3-a827-78379700f113"},{"objectId":"659fa39b4097076c1449a4be","name":"Kanchana","lastName":"Sethanan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a42b9a3d-42c7-43c7-8420-eef1ff5025f5"},{"objectId":"659fa39b4097076c1449a4bd","name":"Rapeepan","lastName":"Pitakaso","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cf72e332-ddf0-44f8-8d7d-e87b74948b75"},{"objectId":"659fa39b4097076c1449a4bc","name":"Thitipong","lastName":"Jamrus","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"882aec4a-47b7-4933-b14e-3d8d613a8b71"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397064","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Golińska-Dawson","uuid":"33F40FE6DE59C64FC9BEBFA5224A1A10A150D22144623BE763AD4A84B679D8AEA759690192D7DF7BB4E61144FB75B100CBDF3258F1FA35E2451251F1BD883C24","orcidId":"0000-0002-5821-3805","documentHash":"0463c071-f947-4e54-9c36-8fd95a213f69"}],"doi":"10.1080/13675567.2022.2090529"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["dziennikarstwo sportowe","autokreacja","media sportowe","język sportu"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sports journalism","self-creation","sports media","the language of sports"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62bc23f24097070fda65c358","doi":null,"title":"Sport.

Pasta samples were prepared by dough lamination (tagliatelle shape) and dried at 55 °C until the moisture content was 11–12% (wet basis). Analyses of samples showed that the addition of BH caused an increase in fiber content in pasta from 4.31% (control pasta) to 14.15% (pasta with 20% of BH). Moreover, the brightness and yellowness of BH-enriched products were significantly decreased compared to the control sample, and the total color difference ranged from 23.84 (pasta with 1% of BH) to 32.56 (pasta with 15% BH). In addition, a decrease in optimal cooking time, as well as an increased weight index and cooking loss, was observed in BH-enriched pasta samples. Furthermore, BH-enriched cooked pasta had significantly higher total phenolic content and antioxidant activity but an unpleasant smell and taste, especially if the level of BH was higher than

Kolejno przeprowadzona została pogłębiona analiza zastosowania wyróżnionych instrumentów w warunkach Polski. Badania potwierdziły szerokie wykorzystywanie instrumentów legislacyjnych i ekonomicznych (cele, bezpośrednie regulacje prawne, poszerzona odpowiedzialność producenta, opodatkowanie), niewystarczające instrumentów informacyjnych (kampanie informacyjne, eko-znakowanie) oraz znikome organizacyjnych (ekologiczne parki przemysłowe, cyrkulacyjne zamówienia publiczne).

The  review  was  completed  using  analytical  frameworks;  primary  material  was compiled using the Science Direct database. The following four groups of potential instruments were identified and characterized: nodality, authority, treasure, and organ-ization-based. Subsequently, an in-depth analysis was performed in order to examine their implementation in Poland. The study revealed a broad spectrum of application of legislative and economic instruments (targets, direct legal regulations, extended producer responsibility, taxation). On the other hand, the application of information instruments was revealed to be insufficient (information campaigns, eco-labelling) and the applica-tion of organization-based instruments to be negligible (eco-industrial parks, circular public procurement). We argue that a comprehensive character of support is required. \nThis denotes the need for new, tailor-made policy instruments to be introduced. Finally, the article presents challenges for the policy mix in relation to the transition to CE, and suggests avenues for future research."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149422","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"31-58","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://czasopisma.kul.pl/index.php/ppe/article/download/13133/12321","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092f8878c28a0473a03fd","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Karman","uuid":"72C7FE0C297875052055E62F75915484A43D665DACD7C16EDAADE254974BFD9C53A3EC478ECF46006AAA75DC5602F4DFCF2394F3EB3CD1C235F8525D952737FD","orcidId":"0000-0001-7429-5938","documentHash":"5194aa81-7a72-462b-b287-236b2967bd81"}],"doi":"10.31743/ppe.13133"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["zrównoważony

While the core theoretical underpinnings of the construct are well-established and it is possible to observe a growing research interest in inducing real-time currents, especially in foreign language (FL) contexts, little is known regarding the specific factors contributing to the untypical longevity of DMCs, as the currents are believed to cover timescales of months or even years. The present study is therefore an attempt to fill the void in the DMC-related research. Following the initial phase of the investigation, which sought to identify prospective DMC cases amongst 247 students of a foreign language at private language schools, thematic analysis was applied to scrutinise the exact nature of DMC experiences identified. The investigation showed that the flow of motivational energy within the DMC superstructure might be occasionally obstructed by both mental and physical exhaustion and, thus, re-triggering mechanisms are required to maintain the intensity of motivational surges. Two primary factors contributing to the longevity of DMCs were identified, namely the growth of learners’ agency and the re-emergence of one’s superordinate goal."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149459","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c691b3409707208738c908","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"38","doi":"","documentHash":"9bef6e42-e30e-4a5e-96a7-b37510e5940d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"229-246","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://revistaseug.ugr.es/index.php/portalin/article/view/23596","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f4e","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Pietluch","uuid":"5062AD5E52147B7048F591ABC5C32FCF2C9913EF278E5CD98DB88F34AAB17B2CE4936D61B4E2D144EF6CE6EE9513E6BFB56A70CF09F0CB3709D159010252C314","orcidId":"0000-0001-8260-9001","documentHash":"fac21131-01ed-4a43-afd9-20622fa45d33"}],"doi":"10.30827/portalin.vi38.23596"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Land use efficiency","Cartographic modelling","Land consumption","Urbanisation","Spatial policy","Population growth"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1e4","uid":"bkbp2VYA4xopaIA4HrQlzTQ","uuid":"21621076-b7f2-4bc3-a5a5-e684c8630041","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wydział Inżynierii Lądowej i Geodezji","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709438878c28a0473b85d8","5e709256878c28a047393f80"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded9","uid":"bl7IPIHE8vXSaZNrXs7VQHQ","uuid":"542de6bc-375c-4170-a162-428803c53c16","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded9","parentUuid":"542de6bc-375c-4170-a162-428803c53c16","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded9","rootUuid":"542de6bc-375c-4170-a162-428803c53c16","name":"Instytut Geodezji i Kartografii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709264878c28a047394e41"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"TOWARDS INCLUSIVE AND SUSTAINABLE URBANIZATION.

This paper took Poland as the research area, CORINE Land Cover and statistical population data to assess changes and regional diversity of land use efficiency status from 2000 to 2018. Land use efficiency was measured using SDG11.3.1 indicator – ratio of land consumption rate to population growth rate (LCRPGR). Results show that in 2006-2018 the land consumption was more diversified than in the 2000-2006. The differences concern both the value of the indicator and the spatial differentiation between regions. In the years 2000-2006 more sustained population growth compared to built-up area expansion was observed in fourteen out of sixteen regions, while in 2006-2018 land consumption outweighed the demographic growth in as many as six regions. The changes in land consumption were influenced by the pursuit of the EU and Polish policies to achieve territorial cohesion and to increase the development of peripheral regions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149462","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"60e577762467f034022bfa27","mniswId":null,"startDate":"2022-06-20","endDate":"2022-06-25","fullName":"8th International Conference on Cartography and GIS","shortName":"8ICCGIS","city":"Nessebar","country":"BG","website":"https://iccgis2020.cartography-gis.com/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"6b21d5c8-cea4-4f6b-8a18-9eff9cecae37"},"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"17-24","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://iccgis2020.cartography-gis.com/8ICCGIS-Vol2/8ICCGIS_Proceedings_Vol2_(2).pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709438878c28a0473b85d8","name":"Beata","lastName":"Całka","uuid":"624B18D9D13E15A616F27F7B4B6BD302655A5165C44855608F15A66A5EA96926C976C47EAAA30502372F9ED90F7B628022CC71B583E921A050F501F75CE4AD6F","orcidId":"0000-0002-7147-0849","documentHash":"1abbbab2-dc8c-483a-8111-1a79225a9334"},{"objectId":"5e709264878c28a047394e41","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Dukaczewski","uuid":"8F89567AD2855E71DBA64D6F619C84C9DFFDEDA02C401E1F7D4C1CFECE3600FF56DF74CA6F285BBBD2A707CBF38D8F676478F7C1F1778B4A63953F83982F449E","orcidId":"0000-0002-9885-2257","documentHash":"70c8fceb-2588-4530-9745-96b476c352a4"},{"objectId":"5e709256878c28a047393f80","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Bielecka","uuid":"FCB1CD89765BFC42E7A2124D8ADCA00E1A02A3426B8F391E5B1A8F96A3AFD5425FA86DB097E217026D8654CCDD0A6B7DCB4952A78DAA7492484880B9432ED70F","orcidId":"0000-0003-3255-1264","documentHash":"a492c9af-e32d-45d6-9665-db2ab5953b1f"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Chrześcijańskie Stowarzyszenie Transhumanistyczne","transhumanizm"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Christian Transhumanist Association","transhumanism"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6284a4ca40970712d1b3dd8a","doi":null,"title":"\"Ite ad Ioseph\" (Rdz 41,55).

Government intervention in sugar markets significantly affects sugar production, consumption and trade. The GATT/WTO negotiations led to the commencement of the liberalization process in the EU sugar market, and initiated a number of reforms aimed at abolishing government support. Consequently, the sugar market in the EU has undergone considerable changes. Proper recognition of the directions of changes will contribute to reducing the difficulties of entities operating on the global sugar market.\n\nAim: The purpose of this publication is to present the forecasts made in 2017 regarding the main categories characterizing the EU sugar market and to verify their validity following the analysis of the actual data. The work uses the forecasts made for 2017–2020 based on empirical data collected from 1993–2016, and then verifies their validity when set against the real data.\n\nResults: The results of the research showed that statistical models are not able to predict correctly not only the forecasted values, but also the directions of their changes. The range of indicators of forecast errors was almost 40 percentage points, which reduced their credibility. The Pearson correlation index of over 0.7 indicated a significant correlation between the real data and the forecast values for the consumption or sugar beet harvest, while interpreting the discrepancy coefficient index, which did not exceed 1 for the forecast of the sugar production volume. This allows to conclude that this forecast shows the smallest differentiation in comparison to the actual data obtained."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149473","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62da58ea40970752a1f0331f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"21","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"60200040-939c-4f86-b328-353574c346a8"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"21","pagesFromTo":"297-315","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://apcz.umk.pl/EiP/article/download/37601/32614","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62cd618a4097073c6e304be0","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Urbanek","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-9545-6921","documentHash":"f7c202a7-b144-4848-9dda-4972fb58a179"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a047390abe","name":"Anna","lastName":"Budzyńska","uuid":"7C9CDA92B4A041D4CB7A8E86A1B2D355124B172C94757BD7C08DCEC6850474E2E8EDF6F45F305D7CA6AB158CEF0B1ED691DC2FF8DFE56785ADF110B53FE6E4CF","orcidId":"0000-0002-6959-0585","documentHash":"78957801-a7ce-49b9-8bea-73466ae96687"}],"doi":"10.12775/eip.2022.016"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","uid":"bk6a4u9UDD_o3fTovGAeczg","uuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","parentUuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","rootUuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","name":"Instytut Badawczy Leśnictwa","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092c4878c28a04739c4fd","5e70934c878c28a0473a6a84"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A novel method for assessing the threat to oak stands from geometrid defoliators","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d2e","mniswId":"6734","title":"FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT","doi":null,"issn":"0378-1127","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"37771705-8204-4376-a5d9-e8d43ad82b3e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62c69b324097072087394476","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c4878c28a04739c4fd","62c69b324097072087394479","5e70934c878c28a0473a6a84"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Oak forests are of great ecological and socioeconomic values but are declining in many regions due to abiotic and biotic factors, including crown damage by defoliating insects. In Europe, several geometrid species reach outbreak densities and are then able to cause severe oak defoliation. Prior to control measures, the threat posed by defoliators must be reliably assessed to limit the treated area and consequently to minimize the negative environmental impacts and the costs of the insecticide application. Few methods have been developed so far to assess the threat to oak forests from geometrids, most of which have proven to be unreliable and/or labour-consuming. In this paper, we present a new method for predicting crown damage from geometrid defoliators based on the density of their flightless females assessed with the use of collar traps installed on tree trunks. The studies were conducted in 2014–2020 in 68 oak stands in Poland. Using beta regression, we estimated the relationship between the density of geometrid females (from genera: Operophtera, Erannis, Agriopis, Alsophila and Apocheima) in collar traps and subsequent defoliation caused by their progeny (i.e. larvae). We then proposed threshold numbers of female density to predict different levels of defoliation and calculated the numbers of collar traps that would be required to detect the threshold density of geometrid females indicating expected defoliation >30%. The new method allows forest managers to monitor populations of different species and phenological groups of geometrids and predict the threat (expected defoliation) to oak forests from these insects."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149475","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c69b32409707208739447c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"520","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"6b0cb9ac-fab7-4798-95af-17bb6ccf90e8"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"520","pagesFromTo":"120380","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0378112722003747?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62c69b324097072087394479","name":"Hubert","lastName":"Jakoniuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"beb48fcd-1c3b-4c34-a3cd-88d98abf661e"},{"objectId":"5e70934c878c28a0473a6a84","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Jaworski","uuid":"540CE7450CA627528770FC25E4D50E53BF4DE84156C0B6160EDDA0042E328B3BA4329A4214D1E9193ED0333A146EAD5622B2971058889F013FF9119302536900","orcidId":"0000-0002-9663-0407","documentHash":"dd4b4990-0f16-4a7e-b561-fb8b47f14298"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c4fd","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Sukovata","uuid":"BBF1BA4BE50DB7A40D9F4534ABFE081011FE1FEACDBDB218B263CD28FC336DD33EA5C8EEAFFD81167F4F48988FA0837F54FA69176699C56444F98FDFFD765DA4","orcidId":"0000-0002-7542-8496","documentHash":"12df87e1-6634-405c-8598-5ef7fb10cb7d"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2022.120380"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet

The engine efficiency and durability depend on a variety of parameters. One of them is valve clearance. As has been proven in the paper, the assessment of the valve clearance can be based on vibration signals, which is not a problem in terms of signal measurement and processing and is not invasive into the engine structure. The authors described the experimental research aiming at providing information necessary to develop and validate the proposed method. Active experiments were used with the task of valve clearance and registration of vibrations using a three-axis transducer placed on the engine cylinder head. The tests were carried out during various operating conditions of the engine set by 5 rotational speeds and 5 load conditions. In order to extract the training examples, fragments of the signal related to the closing of individual valves were divided into 11 shorter portions. From each of them, an effective value of the signal was determined. Obtained total 32054 training vectors for each valve related to 4 classes of valve clearance including very sensitive clearance above 0.8 mm associated with high dynamic interactions in cylinder head. In the paper, the authors propose to use a convolutional network CNN to assess the correct engine valve clearance. The obtained results were compared with other methods of machine learning (pattern recognition network, random forest). Finally, using CNN the valve clearance class identification error was less than 1% for the intake valve and less than 3.5% for the exhaust valve. Developed method replaces the existing standard methods based on FFT and STFT combined with regression calculation where approximation error is up to 10%. Such results are more useful for further studies related not only to classification, but also to the prediction of the valve clearance condition in real engine operations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149485","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6278db684097077547e897ff","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"61","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"d9041a76-30b7-4a57-a401-3e07e343cec9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"61","pagesFromTo":"117 - 131","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.archivesoftransport.com/eaot/2022/01/008.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70934f878c28a0473a6e76","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Nowakowski","uuid":"82D81D47F18787FCEED9EB5F3E4688C61267EEBBDCA2B19523F4862CAFBDB20AFD30014EE309E351A6A02272557452B4E43F465A57B3EA92BA2BA29542CCC18A","orcidId":"0000-0001-5415-7052","documentHash":"3243bb0a-a2c4-42bb-84d4-d48512f12625"},{"objectId":"5e7092fc878c28a0473a0843","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Szymański","uuid":"4C2FF90546D9B39806B5D38B21227206812EB67B7A6ABBE85A483EC800DF8727630AEA544389E8B55588BF351DC21F14C5FAF6AF4533635FA989A6AA6AB45189","orcidId":"0000-0002-2784-9149","documentHash":"4e3c8459-1bd8-4ddd-9b19-06e81ebd841b"},{"objectId":"5e7092f1878c28a04739fa42","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Tabaszewski","uuid":"AC190E6521990207814DA41AC1E61149A7610EACFEC2899D88679943526C08D90CF0A65BB7482DB25961CB238BDC7897EA0C38304E716938B589A2791726B579","orcidId":"0000-0001-6215-8485","documentHash":"1ac1c992-92ba-45f8-a6de-9684f3ddd649"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","uid":"bk6a4u9UDD_o3fTovGAeczg","uuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","parentUuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","rootUuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","name":"Instytut Badawczy Leśnictwa","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ee878c28a04739f5a8","5e709490878c28a0473bfa04"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Insect assemblages associated with Pissodes castaneus (De Geer) on Pinus sylvestris L. trees","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454798ad","mniswId":"19199","title":"Sylwan","doi":null,"issn":"0039-7660","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"d9fa1a04-145f-47de-af55-07be89bdd96c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-26","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62c6956f409707208738ec8d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709490878c28a0473bfa04","5e7092ee878c28a04739f5a8"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In Poland, Pissodes castaneus (De Geer), the small banded pine weevil, is increasingly common in young Scots pine Pinus sylvestris L. stands weakened by various biotic (root diseases, deer) and abiotic (drought, hail, etc.) factors. In Europe, an increasing threat to young P. sylvestris stands by this pest has been observed since the early 2000s, most likely due to ongoing climate change. It seems that weakening of young trees by droughts may have contributed to the increase in pest numbers. The intensification of damage caused by P. castaneus, as well as the lack of effective protection methods, justified conducting research on the insects co−occurring with P. castaneus on P. sylvestris, with special emphasis on its natural enemies. The 3−5−year−old P. sylvestris trees colonized by P. castaneus were collected in 2015−2017 at three locations in Central Poland. All these trees were weakened mainly by drought. Their roots and stems were divided into sections according to their diameters and kept in the laboratory until the emergence of associated insects was complete. A total of 13 species of Coleoptera and 2 species of Hymenoptera were collected from the trees colonized by P. castaneus. Among the co−occurring insects (not trophically related to the pest), the Curculionidae family was most numerous, in which Pityogenes bidentatus (Herbst) dominated, with a proportion of almost 90% of the collected insects, followed by Pogonocherus fasciculatus (De Geer) (5% share) and Magdalis phlegmatica (Herbst) (2%). Only two co−occurring species were found in the fragments of the stems with a diameter >3 cm: Rhagium inquisitor (L.) and P. bidentatus. In stems <1 cm only Ernobius nigrinus (Sturm) and M. phlegmatica were observed. Most species (5) were observed in stems 1−3 cm in diameter: Phaenops formaneki Jacobs, Anthaxia quadripunctata (L.), Chrysobothris igniventris Reitt, P. fasciculatus, and P. bidentatus. P. castaneus occurred over the entire height of the stems. The share of natural enemies of P. castaneus was negligible – less than 3%. In this group of insects, the parasitoid Coeloides melanostigma Strand was the most numerous (1.4%), followed by the predators Crypturgus pusillus (Gyll.) and Corticeus linearis (Fabr.), both with 0.5% share. The results indicate that predatory insects and parasitoids have little influence on the number of P. castaneus. Several beetles and larvae of Hylobius abietis (L.) were reared from the roots of trees colonized by P. castaneus. This publication is the first report on the occurrence of this species on weakened but still living P. sylvestris young trees."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149497","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"166","pagesFromTo":"91-100","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"pol","title":"Owady współwystępujące z Pissodes castaneus (De Geer) na sośnie Pinus sylvestris L."}],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.26202/sylwan.2022008","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709490878c28a0473bfa04","name":"Robert","lastName":"Wolski","uuid":"1625E9F001692890957F167CA86CD8ECACF74DBD2609E56972258E742E9AFEBF0F13C99BEF245175447E6DC43EB6B2EC3AB3C4CB4103D5A217A15639FB5F557C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5651c48f-572f-4d90-b494-828853ef2532"},{"objectId":"5e7092ee878c28a04739f5a8","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Skrzecz","uuid":"45F0D45EB253840449C8EB816E7490196897D9B901A3E35BC2E73A76C45D7F0DBB4C152F140294F1D39AFE828AAD70959A500CA75B6F621D2601928E428BB864","orcidId":"0000-0001-8542-2779","documentHash":"c8f0122d-9195-410f-8686-22e80f0421a1"}],"doi":"10.26202/sylwan.2022008"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Herbicide, Terbuthylazine, Soil, Microbiota, Enzymes, Degradation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709227878c28a047390c40","5e70922b878c28a047390f64","5e709227878c28a047390c43","5e709227878c28a047390c20"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee9","uid":"btl1TUFZ-RmtE1VFT09EDlQ","uuid":"f68cdefe-93d4-402f-94e1-bd2ef1f8616a","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee9","parentUuid":"f68cdefe-93d4-402f-94e1-bd2ef1f8616a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee9","rootUuid":"f68cdefe-93d4-402f-94e1-bd2ef1f8616a","name":"Instytut Ochrony Roślin - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afc79"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Possibilities of restoring homeostasis of soil exposed to terbuthylazine by its supplementation with HumiAgra preparation","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477151","mniswId":"1520","title":"APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY","doi":null,"issn":"0929-1393","eissn":"1873-0272","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"a048b589-834d-41fd-8329-d472700efb24"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"JULY","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62cd37794097073c6e2d35db","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709227878c28a047390c43","5e70922b878c28a047390f64","5e709227878c28a047390c20","5e709227878c28a047390c40","5e7093b9878c28a0473afc79"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Terbuthylazine is an active substance of herbicides that has been commonly used in the European Union Member States and also on other continents. It has been included into the plant protection strategy as a substitute of atrazine. Terbuthylazine was expected not only to protect plants against weed infestation but also not to contaminate the natural environment. For this reason, a study was conducted to determine terbuthylazine impact on the counts of soil microbiota, the structure of bacterial and fungal communities, and activities of soil enzymes. In addition, the study evaluated the efficacy of soil supplementation with a HumiAgra preparation in terbuthylazine detoxification. Terbuthylazine was found to promote the development of Actinobacteria bacteria and to inhibit that of Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Gemmatimonadetes, and Proteobacteria. In addition, the terbuthylazine-treated soil offered favorable conditions for the development Ascomycota and Mortierellomycota fungal, but less beneficial ones for the development of Basidiomycota and Aphelidimycota. Terbuthylazine also contributed to changes in the activities of soil enzymes. Soil supplementation with the HumiAgra preparation stimulated the proliferation of organotrophic bacteria and actinobacteria, while inhibited fungal development. The preparation elicited a beneficial effect on Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, and Gemmatimonadetes bacteria, and an inhibitory effect on Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria, especially in the terbuthylazine-contaminated soil. In addition, it increased the OTU number of fungal belonging to Ascomycota, and reduced OTUs of fungal belonging to Mortierellomycota, Basidiomycota, and Aphelidimycota. Finally, its stimulated activities of all enzymes tested and effectively reduced terbuthylazine content in the soil. The study results enable concluding that terbuthylazine disrupted the soil homeostasis and that the HumiAgra preparation proved to be a better biostimulant of the enzymatic than microbiological

artykułu jest opis statusu i historii badań mediolingwistycznych w Polsce. Rozważania obejmują metodologie, w tym metody stosowane przez mediolingwistów, obiekt badań mediolingwistyki (praktyki komunikacyjne w mediach masowych, nowych mediach i mediach społecznościowych) oraz przedmioty jej badań (teksty tworzące gatunki, style i dyskursy). Metody badań: artykuł ma charakter teoretyczno-metodologiczny. Wykorzystując metodę deskrypcyjno-wyjaśniającą, przedstawiono w nim zaplecze badawcze lingwistyki mediów. Wyniki i wnioski: rekonesans pozwolił stwierdzić, że mediolingwiści w Polsce korzystają z metod badawczych znanych tradycji lingwistycznej – analizy ilościowej, analizy jakościowej, analizy treści – oraz tych, które z niej wyewoluowały: językowego obrazu świata, medialnego obrazu świata, analizy i syntezy tekstologicznej, analizy i syntezy genologicznej, analizy multimodalnej, dyskursywnego obrazu świata, analizy dyskursu. W artykule postuluje się następujący profil subdyscypliny: lingwistyka mediów to językoznawczo, w tym też semiotycznie zorientowana nauka o komunikacji za pośrednictwem mediów masowych, nowych mediów i mediów społecznościowych. W konkluzji stwierdza się, że niezależnie od tempa i kierunku rozwoju mediolingwistyki to tekst, w tym tekst multimodalny, jest wyjściowym przedmiotem analizy i podstawą do syntez. Oryginalność i wartość poznawcza: artykuł ilustruje aksjomat o fundamentach dyscypliny naukowej. Powszechnie wiadomo, że naukę tworzą ludzie – zorganizowani w pewnej przestrzeni i czasie – oraz obiekty ich badań. Naukoznawstwo uznaje, że o statusie dyscypliny stanowi wypracowana przez tych ludzi i dostosowana do obiektu badań metodologia. Ta zawiera zespół sądów teoretycznych, na których opierają się skuteczne metody, prowadzące do miarodajnych wyników. Te warunki teoretyczne w artykule są odnoszone do mediolingwistyki jako subdyscypliny filologicznej. Autorka przekonuje, że teoretycznym zapleczem lingwistyki mediów winny być nie tylko semantyka kognitywna i etnolingwistyka, ale także semiotyka, prasoznawstwo, pragmalingwistyka, socjolingwistyka, genologia językoznawcza, genologia multimedialna, stylistyka interakcyjna, stylistyka multimedialna, a z nowych aktualnych na rynku naukowym: lingwistyka dyskursu, lingwistyka koloru, komunikologia."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Scientific objective: The author undertook the description of the status and history of media research in Poland. The article covers methodologies, including methods used by media linguists, the research object of media linguistics (communication practices in mass media, new media and social media) and its research subjects (texts founding genres, styles and discourses). Research methods: The article is theoretical and methodological. It describes the research base of media linguistics and presents the descriptive-explanatory method. Results and conclusions: Reconnaissance allowed to determine that media linguists in Poland use research methods known in the linguistic tradition: quantitative analysis, quality analysis, content analysis; research methods evolving from it: a linguistic picture of the world, media-based picture of the world, textological analysis and synthesis, genealogical analysis and synthesis, multimodal analysis, discursive picture of the world, discourse analysis. The author posits the following sub-discipline profile: Media linguistics is a linguistic and semiotically oriented study of communication via mass media, new media and social media. In the conclusion the author states that regardless of the pace and direction of the development of media linguistics, the text, including the multimodal text, is the initial subject of analysis and the basis for syntheses. Originality and cognitive value: The article is an illustration of the axiom about the foundations of a scientific discipline. It is well known that science consists of people and their research objects organized in a certain space and time. Science recognizes that the status of a discipline is determined by the methodology developed by these people and adapted to the research object. This one contains a set of theoretical judgments upon which effective methods are founded that lead to reliable results. These theoretical conditions are referred to in the article as a philological subdiscipline in media linguistics. The author argues that the theoretical background of media linguistics should be: not only cognitive semantics and ethnolinguistics, but also semiotics, press studies, pragmalinguistics, sociolinguistics, linguistic genealogy, multimedia genealogy, interactive stylistics, multimedia stylistics, and new topical linguistics on the scientific market discourse linguistics, color linguistics, communicology."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149504","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cc0e0d409707746ec72f37","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"23","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"2b947141-e17a-4abf-b064-6b095ff369be"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"1101-1112","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"The Status, History, People, and Organizations of Polish Media Linguistics"}],"publicUri":"http://hdl.handle.net/20.500.12128/23463","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092ea878c28a04739f26a","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Loewe","uuid":"C5D2063BC96BF4A4F1508A7CCE87519CA5B7C82148C18C0F5760B8DFFF3205124151A6CD7EF2B557AC3BC318411A083F9CCC30B8C51D8E20CEF40D83ABB6BBB1","orcidId":"0000-0002-5959-8938","documentHash":"2042102e-3305-43bb-882c-e3760ed08da7"}],"doi":"10.33077/uw.24511617.sm.2022.1.674"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["nearest neighbour algorithm","greedt algorithm","swarm inteligence","combinatorial problems"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62cc0030409707746ec65209","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-09173-5","title":"Intelligent and Fuzzy Systems: Digital Acceleration and The New Normal - Proceedings of the INFUS 2022 Conference, Volume 1","year":2022,"volume":"1","isbn":"9783031091728","ismn":null,"issn":"2367-3370","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-031-09173-5.pdf","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"144a4262-8326-4e7f-ae40-565916c4a067","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"62cc01c4409707746ec663ba","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"General Tadeusz Kosciuszko Military Academy of Land Forces, Wroclaw, Poland","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924c878c28a04739355a","627488cd75234003501255a0"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Personalized Literature Selection System Based on the Nearest Neighbor Algorithm","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62cc01c4409707746ec663b9","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924c878c28a04739355a","627488cd75234003501255a0"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Greedy algorithms are a commonly used paradigm of combinatorial algorithms.

The complement system is an important branch of the innate immune response that can be activated via three distinct pathways (classical, alternative, lectin).

In this short review, we discuss the dual role of the lectin pathway of complement activation in human solid cancers, including those of the female reproductive system, lung, and alimentary tract, with emphasis on its cross-talk with other enzyme-dependent cascades. The complement system is an important branch of the humoral innate immune response that can be activated via three distinct pathways (classical, alternative, lectin), contributing to keeping/restoring homeostasis.

In the OpenStreetMap data quality research, objects consisting of the basic elements of land cover with polygon geometry type were used, which included 3 classes: buildings, surface water and forests. The test area for OSM data quality was three counties in Poland, differentiated by land cover and urbanization development.

To właśnie obecność konia sprawia, że jest to wyjątkowa i niepowtarzalna metoda terapeutyczna, dająca nowe i niespotykane w innych terapiach możliwości wpływania na stan psychofizyczny dzieci poddawanych terapii. Hipoterapia wymaga zaangażowania oraz wiary zarówno ze strony dziecka, rodziców jak i rehabilitantów i stosowanych przez nich metod. Nauczenie się jazdy konnej jest efektem ubocznym. Bodźce przemawiają do różnych sfer. Do jego ciała rozwijając motoryczność, spostrzegawczość rozwija również wrażliwość, zdolności do kontaktowania się z innymi i radzenia sobie, a także kształtują odpowiedzialność za siebie lub drugich. Ćwiczenia z koniem, a przez to zmęczenie mają swoją treść i sens, rozczarowanie czy frustracja w razie nieosiągnięcia zamierzonego celu nie są porażką, lecz dzięki żywemu partnerowi, jakim jest koń, stają się czymś wyjątkowym, pewną przemianą i bodźcem do zrozumienia własnych problemów oraz motywacją do dalszego działania. W niniejszym opracowaniu wykazano pozytywny wpływ metody wieloprofilowego usprawniania na rozwój poznawczy, emocjonalny i społeczny osób niepełnosprawnych z różnymi schorzeniami, a także ukażę jak duży wpływ na pacjenta posiada bliski kontakt z koniem. Hipoterapia według Ingrid Strauβ to jedna z metod rehabilitacji ruchowej na bazie neurofizjologii, prowadzona przy udziale konia. Poruszając się stępem, koń przenosi impulsy ruchowe i dzięki temu jest on swoistym medium (łącznikiem) terapeutycznym. Trening tułowia w siadzie oraz przemieszczanie się w przód w sposób typowy dla chodu człowieka prowadzą do osiągnięcia właściwych reakcji postawy; precyzyjne ćwiczenia koordynacyjne pozwalają na wybalansowanie ciała oraz trening równowagi. Celem hipoterapii jest wspieranie kompleksowej rehabilitacji dziecka dzięki wykorzystaniu wyjątkowych doznań, jakie daje człowiekowi kontakt z koniem. Zajęcia odbywają się z reguły od jednego do trzech razy w tygodniu i trwają około 30 minut, mogą być indywidualne lub grupowe i przeprowadzone są na ogół na terenie ośrodka jeździeckiego."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149526","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"146-156","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"Cognitive, emotional and social development children with disabilities under the influence of hippotherapy."}],"publicUri":"https://health.nuwm.edu.ua/index.php/rehabilitation/article/view/230/198","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62cbd1da409707746ec47c8d","name":"N.","lastName":"Nesterchuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c4a33c55-e618-4917-a5e5-347f4c4f3be1"},{"objectId":"62cbd1da409707746ec47c8c","name":"B.","lastName":"Kindzer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0cfa44d7-fee0-4480-aa55-8525547ff2df"},{"objectId":"62cbd1da409707746ec47c8b","name":"I.","lastName":"Grygus","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ac3fabec-004a-41f2-9965-b21afbd35ca5"},{"objectId":"62cbd1da409707746ec47c8a","name":"D.","lastName":"Kowalski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7db638d2-a6d9-4a6c-8417-4f424506d703"},{"objectId":"5e709404878c28a0473b4d3b","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Skalski","uuid":"E098E64C52C907FF7FFF6305D86E7360AC3A5C936BF54560478D8AF2040FD781004BAFB24FDD438F903D2F29D5E30BE36B5113C502BB1D16A1F53A270D6C4BC9","orcidId":"0000-0003-3280-3724","documentHash":"16d42828-7a11-4d6d-9f71-3240a4c0a568"},{"objectId":"5e709213878c28a04738f8c0","name":"Marek","lastName":"Graczyk","uuid":"43DBE23AD62F115F19EF456D033FBAF119B58777542A0472B10946A06DD975FED871985FE9AA3A824C20853D649572F2CB42D4A03CD092470FCE72084FE7F010","orcidId":"0000-0002-9979-1214","documentHash":"7cef53bd-3174-429e-91c1-9c91c12a7d5f"}],"doi":"10.32782/2522-1795.2022.11.17"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-67104-31-9","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Filozoficzno-kulturowe aspekty nauk humanistycznychx","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":336,"publicationPlace":"Lublin","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62cc0f60409707746ec77e92","editors":[{"objectId":"63e4bf934097076b4a1171fa","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Pomajda","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"21594da6-9c67-42b6-a420-5358c5d9f190"},{"objectId":"63e4bf934097076b4a1171f9","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Chodźko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dc726018-96e3-43c2-8c58-07756a52e9e4"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["63e4bf934097076b4a1171f9","63e4bf934097076b4a1171fa"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058149536","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"610809959543c70b144e702c","mniswId":"85900","name":"Wydawnictwo Naukowe TYGIEL Sp. z o. o.","documentHash":"0d57bd73-1897-49e3-a7d9-d36929fd7806"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://researchportal.amu.edu.pl/info/book/UAM78c65bf9f4794debb0a1211081f7a197/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Radar","Hail detection","4-cm hail","Vertically Integrated Liquid"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","uid":"bFhiVYWupXf-L0BTdpdX5dg","uuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","parentUuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","rootUuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","name":"Instytut Meteorologii i Gospodarki Wodnej -

The most useful of the numerous weather radar reflectivity indicators are automated hail detection algorithms and reflectivity criteria, which can be easily implemented in operational weather warning systems. Since the temperature at which large hail forms is known, the vertically integrated liquid water content (VIL) can be calculated for the corresponding temperature layer. This paper presents four new VIL-based hail indicators using hail formation temperatures determined by the isotherms from ERA5. We compared these indicators with the 8 km Constant Altitude Plan Position Indicator (CAPPI) and the Waldvogel hail detection method by linking the detected cells to ESWD reports. Based on the VILs, we aimed to determine which layer within the VIL integration was the most useful for large hail prediction. In the case of the VILs, the layer between −12 and −25 °C was the best for hail detection. We also analysed the lead times of these indicators to assess their potential for implementation in the operational warning system in Poland. Using data from the European Severe Weather Database and the Polish radar system, we found that most incidents involving very large hailstones were linked to supercell storms with distinctive reflectivity signatures. The best hail indicator was the Waldvogel et al. (1979) hail detection technique, which had a lead time of approximately 17,5 min. The VIL had a near-zero lead time."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058149537","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c7ff924097077330cbdcd7","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"274","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"903ba930-a54f-44e4-88fe-62cbfdc0ff40"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"274","pagesFromTo":"106185","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0169809522001715?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62c7ff924097077330cbdcd3","name":"Marek","lastName":"Zięba","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f0c73ff5-f7e9-4b70-ab54-33d4747a333c"},{"objectId":"62c7ff924097077330cbdcd2","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Pilorz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"964a3bd2-3b7a-42e8-a99e-b46fbba8a81e"},{"objectId":"5e70933d878c28a0473a5714","name":"Jan","lastName":"Szturc","uuid":"1D7F3301535148EA0D05AE9242C3152DFCEF1977D0392C0145077EB522B12081A647C16101C28DE4300EFF746CF8B6883C8227B82D51FF50B55F6C1AF1EFD730","orcidId":"0000-0001-6943-2352","documentHash":"37ba6494-23ec-4575-ad4d-356d9c12a09f"},{"objectId":"5e7092eb878c28a04739f3b1","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Łupikasza","uuid":"627F6A7B227A8D98C912114A8A9A436667607A1B381B2782CE5749BB175C1500410E98A8CD820CBF870E8BD9C9EF9E9F4FE621BF5634B8A1EFB9FE9F566FD24F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3910-9076","documentHash":"051e6841-ce85-416c-92dd-d65217116fb2"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.atmosres.2022.106185"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA1ODE0OTUzNw=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
