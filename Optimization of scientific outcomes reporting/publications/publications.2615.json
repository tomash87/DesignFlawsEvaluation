Secondary metabolites produced by alien plants may be allelopathic; if they enter the soil, they may be transported by agricultural activities, negatively affecting crop yield and biodiversity. It is unknown whether substances from different alien species in combination have a greater impact on crops and wild plants than if they are from only one of the alien species. In this study, we used a set of common garden experiments to test the hypothesis that mixed extracts from two common invasive species have synergistic effects on crops and weeds (defined as all non-crop plants) in European agricultural fields compared to single-species extracts. We found that both the combined and individual extracts had detrimental effects on the seed germination, seedling growth, biomass, and photosynthetic performance of both crops and weeds. We found that the negative effect of mixed extracts was not additive and that crop plants were more strongly affected by invasive species extracts than the weeds. Our results are important for managing invasive species in unique ecosystems on agricultural land and preventing economic losses in yield production."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661462","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c9446b4097074220cc9a4d","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"c67bc404-c55a-4843-9947-5a16b4a7fe91"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"22146","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-48421-w.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65843c304097075aba691122","name":"Johannes M.

This is a widely known poison but is also considered as a gasotransmitter. For most higher plants, microorganisms and animals HCN is toxic, especially at elevated concentrations. However, plants’ sensitivity to this compound is lower than animals’ due to the activity of an alternative oxidase in the mitochondrial respiration chain. All higher plants synthesize HCN as a co-product during the final step of ethylene biosynthesis, whilst some plant species release it from cyanogenic compounds, accumulated for diverse physiological purposes. This molecule is used as a toxic bomb against herbivores, as a source of nitrogen in N-deficient plants, or as a regulator of seed dormancy state. The toxicity of HCN is mainly due to the inhibition of the activity of several metalloenzymes: iron-containing enzymes, molybdoenzymes and enzymes that contain zinc or copper. HCN impacts cellular metabolism by modulation of the reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species levels, and via modifications of proteins (<jats:italic>S</jats:italic>-cyanylation, oxidation). The aim of this work is to describe the dual (toxic and signalling) mode of cyanide action in plants at a cellular level."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661469","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"705-719","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11101-023-09904-w","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6825048ffdbe83139258ee09","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Wal","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"693c1e6b-3d70-4784-b66c-ffca19a4a620"},{"objectId":"6825048ffdbe83139258ee08","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Tymiński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fce0def6-3801-4410-8d77-3a4316afb9fd"},{"objectId":"5e709463878c28a0473bc076","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Ciąćka","uuid":"C3CE312096B41548C5305664D583045066325F895A320310BD64481A5C3D1FD12685F0D712A96B924E20038BA6E6AAC7E96FF181B3B3121044BA2E3DDA4B7B08","orcidId":"0000-0003-1485-2901","documentHash":"2e1ae3e9-602d-4c9b-bceb-f595a2252123"},{"objectId":"5e709307878c28a0473a1735","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Staszek","uuid":"20C653319E4C65FC5C8C570C2F27CE6667492055BC7704D19E9997C3AB8A4478318E1AC95DAA8C259502CC6F4CA92F3FE091E53752FE759D16C10405E09CEE7A","orcidId":"0000-0001-8532-5151","documentHash":"c067e01d-3c5c-4779-b289-3a4e5eaa416a"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941bb","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Krasuska","uuid":"50697A680E1AB25C26EB9DB2AAC38767607822C1CB1DC6174E3FA5F53B5C170A0A514CE91015EE9101A5DA71BA0D48747516ECD7EAFF0246261FD7E9D43EFCA0","orcidId":"0000-0001-8373-4509","documentHash":"018da236-05da-4094-bbd3-521eb15336c3"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941b6","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Gniazdowska-Piekarska","uuid":"38657E5FFA3833B125B11FDCE3B97D9233BB194EF93457987900363FDCC63C8899A3D4EF8DC5F51AA1C454B1C33F2085A74375CD6238C532A4BE36ACD5B97D4F","orcidId":"0000-0003-0077-3743","documentHash":"4d9f80d8-6baf-4ac3-91f4-91d5def13762"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11101-023-09904-w"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"64ba53474097070998db6e8b","doi":null,"title":"Studia wspólne i podwójne.

to advances in the industrial development of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), much research has been conducted in recent years to get a better understanding of how plants respond to these light sources. This study investigated the effects of different LED-based light regimes on strawberry plant development and performance. The photosynthetic pigment content, biochemical constituents, and growth characteristics of strawberry plants were investigated using a combination of different light intensities (150, 200, and 250 μmol m−2 s−1), qualities (red, green, and blue LEDs), and photoperiods (14/10 h, 16/8 h, and 12/12 h light/dark cycles) compared to the same treatment with white fluorescent light. Plant height, root length, shoot fresh and dry weight, chlorophyll a, total chlorophyll/carotenoid content, and most plant yield parameters were highest when illuminated with LM7 [intensity (250 μmol m−2 s−1) + quality (70% red/30% blue LED light combination) + photoperiod (16/8 h light/dark cycles)]. The best results for the effective quantum yield of PSII photochemistry Y(II), photochemical quenching coefficient (qP), and electron transport ratio (ETR) were obtained with LM8 illumination [intensity (250 μmol m−2 s−1) + quality (50% red/20% green/30% blue LED light combination) + photoperiod (12 h/12 h light/dark cycles)].

It was demonstrated for the first time that BnTIP1 accumulation in oilseed rape roots is reduced under drought compared to wellwatered plants, and that this effect is intensified in plants supplemented with silicon. In addition, it was shown that silicon supplementation of oilseed rape increases catalase activity in the roots, which correlates with their high metabolic activity under drought and ultimately stimulates their growth. It was shown that silicon improves water balance in oilseed rape plants subjected to drought stress, and that an important role in these processes is played by tonoplast aquaporins. In addition, it was demonstrated that silicon reduces oxidative stress in roots under drought conditions by increasing the activity of catalase."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661480","journalIssue":{"objectId":"672a1749fdbe8378376ab5cc","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"46af1c1a-c3c5-4895-a8d3-e9081fe1ee48"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2024.1359747/full","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b6740","name":"Diana","lastName":"Saja-Garbarz","uuid":"49CD1C7E7C0EE239F8639F05A1EC923DD9C96D6D19FA32626D39C516AC5362944B16A39EE0D41297B2E9E502EAD00710DB7597418DE156FF885448A115E888FA","orcidId":"0000-0003-1177-4426","documentHash":"a71928ce-ddce-41c9-bf1d-3b150c702955"},{"objectId":"5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b88","name":"Marta","lastName":"Libik-Konieczny","uuid":"68E0F0823BFA6BB243B69BEAC7746CE8FB6D4D28207E1B34E232A46024C6F205E22B00B6FB939C138C926CA71825A3DDAB75AFF1E65ABC106C0728F529440059","orcidId":"0000-0003-0378-2960","documentHash":"668cb7b8-9929-41c5-b5a7-be932cb34905"},{"objectId":"5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b7d","name":"Franciszek","lastName":"Janowiak","uuid":"E1EC0975153D43DE186D2602CF33F99A88A82B3A75B262D6E09CD723588F0C8959E108ACE1ED50017117F5A3E589EAF4D007B453C4ACD4BFBA8EB89607191FFD","orcidId":"0000-0002-1095-8998","documentHash":"d09fbfa9-b711-40a2-aaf7-1abf84ef0171"}],"doi":"10.3389/fpls.2024.1359747"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709252878c28a047393b56"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Resilience-based transportation system planning optimization through dedicated autonomous vehicle lanes configuration","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454799bd","mniswId":"19745","title":"Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review","doi":null,"issn":"1366-5545","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"3a81d976-2079-4dc1-a37d-5becee2e8c25"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"68245b5dfdbe836c41b4da78","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["68245b5dfdbe836c41b4da7a","68245b5dfdbe836c41b4da7b","68245b5dfdbe836c41b4da7c","68245b5dfdbe836c41b4da7d","68245b5dfdbe836c41b4da7e","5e709252878c28a047393b56"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"During the transition phase when connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and human driven vehicles (HDVs) coexist on the road, it is essential to devise scientific lane management strategies for CAVs in enhancing the operational efficiency of the transportation system (TS). It is worth noting that most current studies do not incorporate the resilience requirements of the TS to effectively respond to seismic events in the planning process. In this study, a novel resilience-based planning optimization methodology through dedicated autonomous vehicle lanes (DAVLs) configuration is proposed in the form of bi-level structure. The optimal configuration scheme for generating DAVLs in the upper level has the optimization objective of minimizing the overall impedance of the TS while meeting the system’s resilience constraints. In terms of the lower level, it quantifies the TS’s functions, fully considering the impact of CAVs on the time value, fuel consumption, and link flow capacity. In order to balance the optimization performance and computational costs, a heuristic algorithm combining genetic algorithms and successive averaging method are integrated to solve the proposed bi-level programming model effectively. On this basis, the proposed methodology adopts a real-world large-scale transportation network regarding deterministic and stochastic earthquake damage scenarios. The sensitivity analysis outcomes show that the market penetration of CAVs and the predefined system resilience threshold have different mechanisms of actions on the optimal configuration strategy of DAVLs and the system performance of TS."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661481","journalIssue":{"objectId":"68245b5dfdbe836c41b4da79","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"194","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"e33aa9f7-07ee-4a6b-b1dc-dcd26fe29d74"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"194","pagesFromTo":"103939","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1366554524005301?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68245b5dfdbe836c41b4da7e","name":"Liz","lastName":"Varga","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e24957cb-7410-4be8-9748-67946ece38e6"},{"objectId":"68245b5dfdbe836c41b4da7d","name":"Yuchun","lastName":"Tang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"adef8fee-9991-4d86-832f-a5d438f5adb4"},{"objectId":"68245b5dfdbe836c41b4da7c","name":"Jingquan","lastName":"Wang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"00837972-3b34-4dc8-aec2-0dd2126642a5"},{"objectId":"68245b5dfdbe836c41b4da7b","name":"Zhiguo","lastName":"Sun","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"26060ee5-55a4-49f4-b0af-9733e2ba67a0"},{"objectId":"68245b5dfdbe836c41b4da7a","name":"Taiyi","lastName":"Zhao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ac506965-918a-48d1-bdf4-06558e704a32"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b56","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Skibniewski","uuid":"580D722D7EEE8D6940C6E4915CA33DF22384A8555BBDF5BEA599029E6C12FB15D0B6086C66B3E730A3FA25748049CB0DC86F3218802CA277A9F3786EE021A962","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a40bb734-c481-496d-8145-a8eadad6944b"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.tre.2024.103939"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","uid":"b-COLbcdAG-k5w4OvZzdVBg","uuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","parentUuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","rootUuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","name":"Narodowy Instytut Onkologii im.

The advantages of incorporating curcumin in these products include its antimicrobial properties, support for the activity of lactic acid bacteria, improvement in sensory characteristics, and shelf-life extension. Curcumin notably enhances antioxidant activity and acts as a natural preservative in cheese, cheese-like products, and butter. In ice cream and dairy desserts, curcumin contributes to attractive color formation and offers functional benefits such as antioxidant activity, photostability, and increased nutritional value. However, the use of turmeric extract, a common source of curcumin, presents challenges including low bioavailability, color instability, and the formation of insoluble precipitates. The application of specialized curcumin formulations with enhanced water dispersion, purity, and bioavailability can mitigate these issues, improve the product's technological properties, and ensure compliance with local regulations. This review highlights the importance of continued research and development to optimize the use of curcumin in dairy and milk-based products, offering valuable insights for scientists and food industry professionals."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661487","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"89","pagesFromTo":"5245-5254","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.17278","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6825084afdbe83139258fa9d","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Banach","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"749828e7-06c0-45e2-b9f2-77095caec8f9"},{"objectId":"6825084afdbe83139258fa9c","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Michałowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ba002733-f79e-4468-816e-95b930f43e94"},{"objectId":"6825084afdbe83139258fa9b","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Urbański","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dfe63658-00d1-438e-920b-6c0ab7b78565"},{"objectId":"6825084afdbe83139258fa9a","name":"Artur","lastName":"Mykhalevych","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6006ea23-6dfb-4550-bd76-e6ac6f0bdba0"},{"objectId":"6825084afdbe83139258fa99","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Buniowska‐Olejnik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bd8d71a0-0e8c-40b6-a2d1-342f71e6fb4d"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a0473921ef","name":"Anna","lastName":"Berthold-Pluta","uuid":"02BB73FE0301B049A4913EA25B06BD2FBBF49EC981BD198B1EE213A3FB9C2F5D49184BC757813B9BDBED13C9C5513F4F03D6357155842BC223F413083D4F3557","orcidId":"0000-0002-0822-2885","documentHash":"0706f1ec-e6e9-4fb1-bcab-31643db500e8"}],"doi":"10.1111/1750-3841.17278"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["apple clones","sugars","acids","phenolic content","flesh color","image textures","correlation"]}],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fb878c28a0473b45dd","5e709337878c28a0473a50c3","5e7094c3878c28a0473c3426"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The appearence of branched broomrape (Phelipanche ramosa L.

It is a non-invasive, label-free technique that allows high-resolution imaging. It enables the morphology of a living cell to be captured without chemical treatment, by using the refractive index (RI) as a contrast parameter to image internal structures. In this paper, we demonstrate that due to the fact that biological cells are highly heterogeneous structures, it is crucial to use full volumetric data to calculate the average RI values of biological samples and their organelles. To prove our point, we present tomographic reconstructions of 3 cell types: neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y, adenocarcinoma A549 and leukemia HL-60, from which we calculate the average RI value from the 3D volumetric data and compare it to the average RI values calculated from each 2D section."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661496","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"484-489","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://opg.optica.org/optcon/abstract.cfm?uri=optcon-2-2-484","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6408c28a7523405b4c2e3d15","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Mazur","uuid":"372AE4F7BCB5D159190A21E7FD0EFF685D3B31BCEDAC8BEB72AE2514FC6AD5F0230E160805F2A0D5304C8C2BC797D70AA7247E4E7D1DB257B169D5BE3A673B00","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d9595c72-9b36-47a1-a6e3-73e21ea598d4"},{"objectId":"602c9dec9543c7410626e0dd","name":"Maria","lastName":"Baczewska","uuid":"686A1DC855C512D8210C0E78290A9BB5EFE51E285354EC4025073DAE48A746364EC51389BB27BB550AEA439014BED967D385DC68B0C8C6B89D82B9B97DD15DE5","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b44ca107-0dce-47ea-b816-e0b803a7c4fd"},{"objectId":"5e7092e5878c28a04739ed82","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Krauze","uuid":"8D7A088CF964E64E54F7CA02CC78CFC8D8BB639EFB000802460134A4DA4B7BE074DFE851538A448AE3811F595BE225ADB66F6F89753101983F842BD92E3BAE3A","orcidId":"0000-0002-5248-3986","documentHash":"983a4641-2dee-436b-8738-b39430e7818f"}],"doi":"10.1364/optcon.481162"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["rynek kapitałowy","manipulacje w sprawozdaniach finansowych","model Beneisha","rynek NewConnect","Rynek Główny GPW"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Beneish model","WSE main market","manipulation of financial statements","capital market","NewConnect market"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df65","uid":"bYRtGzh9xym5GV9-ekXsSdA","uuid":"b213d6cd-40ee-48c3-a97a-bc79941abd65","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de19","parentUuid":"5011bcd5-dfb1-41ed-84b0-5bd51ce0832c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de19","rootUuid":"5011bcd5-dfb1-41ed-84b0-5bd51ce0832c","name":"Wydział Ekonomiczno-Socjologiczny","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602c99e59543c7410626e09a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Manipulacje danymi w sprawozdaniach finansowych spółek notowanych na GPW w Warszawie – ocena skuteczności modelu Beneisha","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa83c9aff2974850cd2a","mniswId":"497955","title":"Kwartalnik Nauk o Przedsiębiorstwie","doi":null,"issn":"1896-656X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"c043c662-d147-4db8-a9d6-30bb45d24272"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-11","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682440adfdbe83139256a4e5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602c99e59543c7410626e09a"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Celem artykułu jest zweryfikowanie skuteczności modelu Beneisha na polskim rynku kapitałowym.

Factors such as sociodemographic characteristics and health status determined their experiences. Understanding these dynamics is crucial, especially in the context of the Spanish health and education systems. The present study aimed to adapt and assess the psychometric properties of the AMICO scale in the context of nursing students in Spain. Methods: Cross-sectional descriptive study. The study was carried out in University Nursing Centers in Spain using a non-probabilistic snowball sampling method. The total sample consisted of 1197 nursing students. Sociodemographic variables were included, as well as questions related to general health and some more specific questions about COVID-19. For the reliability study, Cronbach’s alpha was calculated. An exploratory factor analysis using principal components and varimax rotation was applied, excluding items with loadings below 0.05. Results: In this study, 1197 nursing students residing in Spain participated, of whom 85% were female, with a mean age of 22.35 years. Despite 73.9% of the students being isolated due to exposure to COVID-19, they rated their general health positively (7.86). Females reported higher levels of anxiety. The AMICO scale revealed significant differences according to gender, health, and vaccination history, showing high reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.913). Conclusions: The two-factor structure of the AMICO scale was validated, confirming its suitability for assessing anxiety and fear among nursing students in Spain. The study revealed significant emotional distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among women, high-risk individuals, and those fully vaccinated. These findings accentuate the need for higher education institutions to implement targeted mental health interventions during public health emergencies. Future longitudinal research should examine the evolving psychological impact of such crises and the mitigating roles of quality of life, sleep, and physical activity."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661502","journalIssue":{"objectId":"681b477cfdbe8356ff0a66cb","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":"9","doi":null,"documentHash":"ff1b0690-665a-4d5e-828e-a59abd4ea5bf"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1058","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/13/9/1058/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68245c2efdbe836c41b5131d","name":"Javier","lastName":"Fagundo-Rivera","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ec75eb74-7f29-4dc5-8b6e-16ac93ea11cf"},{"objectId":"68245c2efdbe836c41b5131c","name":"Israel","lastName":"Macías-Toronjo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0eeaaa8b-630f-4be2-a19a-224366545d7a"},{"objectId":"68245c2efdbe836c41b5131b","name":"Murat","lastName":"Yıldırım","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"64fe7524-29b5-4f0f-ac75-5b72f9ffc90d"},{"objectId":"68245c2efdbe836c41b5131a","name":"Juan","lastName":"Gómez-Salgado","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0e510dac-6874-4d77-b8e2-6f71256c2d6f"},{"objectId":"68245c2efdbe836c41b51319","name":"Regina","lastName":"Allande-Cussó","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"496f2d88-d17a-4607-99ea-54ad85f977da"},{"objectId":"68245c2efdbe836c41b51318","name":"Cristina","lastName":"Morgado-Toscano","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2844d114-7493-44c3-8837-f302fd972f5b"},{"objectId":"68245c2efdbe836c41b51317","name":"Nadine","lastName":"Badillo-Sánchez","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"053f4d74-aed2-4fa0-adfe-cc2aa29d7173"},{"objectId":"5e70945b878c28a0473bb2ca","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Goniewicz","uuid":"7E62BF6A36BD1BCF2A7EE75EF1553225F6056FB0059E4DC5CE4669E3ACFF6FC7DE74D3969AD95180AC85B13EA44AC8627E401BD4DE6EBFA443D18F2BA2DE9CF4","orcidId":"0000-0003-4368-6850","documentHash":"c95df7f9-d1e0-429f-b5a4-2e6d3763c938"}],"doi":"10.3390/healthcare13091058"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["rynek kapitałowy","giełda","strategie inwestycyjne","uczenie maszynowe"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["investment strategies","stock market","machine learning","capital market","artificial intelligence"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df65","uid":"bYRtGzh9xym5GV9-ekXsSdA","uuid":"b213d6cd-40ee-48c3-a97a-bc79941abd65","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de19","parentUuid":"5011bcd5-dfb1-41ed-84b0-5bd51ce0832c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de19","rootUuid":"5011bcd5-dfb1-41ed-84b0-5bd51ce0832c","name":"Wydział Ekonomiczno-Socjologiczny","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709288878c28a047397648"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Using Machine Learning for Short-term Capital Investment in the Polish Stock Market","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a04f","mniswId":"200210","title":"Journal of Intercultural Management","doi":null,"issn":"2080-0150","eissn":"2543-831X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"a9e89144-0f4f-4720-ad16-500841430e70"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2024-03-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"68244c94fdbe83139256a76a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["68244c94fdbe83139256a76b","5e709288878c28a047397648"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objective\n\nThe main purpose of this article is to assess the potential implications of machine learning in making investment decisions when investing capital in stock markets.

One of the oldest food preservation techniques is drying. Furthermore, non-thermal food processing techniques such as pulse electric field (PEF) treatment can be used to support the drying process and change the properties of the obtained product. Thus, this study aimed to analyze the impact of pulsed electric field treatment on the hot air-drying and freeze-drying of poultry meat as well as on the quality of the dried meat. The PEF pretreatment and drying methods significantly altered the physical characteristics of the poultry meat. The PEF treatment enhanced the efficiency of freeze-drying by electroporation, reducing drying time and shrinkage. However, in the hot air-drying, the PEF-treated samples prolonged drying, potentially due to muscle structure damage and increased shrinkage. The pretreatment techniques affected the structure of the meat and positively influenced the higher porosity and lower shrinkage. Also, drying decreased the water activity and increased the dry matter content, which ensured the safety of the final product. The freeze-dried material exhibited a higher rehydration rate, improved hygroscopic properties, and better meat color compared to the hot air-dried material. Nevertheless, the selection of the process parameters, for both the pretreatment and drying process, is crucial to ensure a high quality of the dried meat product and should be selected carefully in order to guarantee that the highest quality of the dried product is obtained."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661509","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/5/1808","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682507b3fdbe83139258f761","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Matys","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"85d4750a-85c4-40f2-8764-d1993a57516a"},{"objectId":"682507b3fdbe83139258f760","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Karwacka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b02283c8-1c9a-4ad7-a7fd-7898b253b080"},{"objectId":"5e709487878c28a0473bf096","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Rybak","uuid":"23CE32C58512E32A4B96EAE0AE9ECB2BF23310D66D220B65BFBB79CD39E7F53ECA83523B7822465B1A3A51369BA847D9FDD6BA28CDC2F09E8BE6E1DD13CE7440","orcidId":"0000-0003-3595-0818","documentHash":"4fdd131f-d106-4642-a4be-de7994ac4305"},{"objectId":"5e70942a878c28a0473b775c","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Szymańska","uuid":"962110B3F43F41CC81BCC4EC2D30E31AE83B26C74C59E829BC33CD89FE9107E6C56705D05D5BA07D9E51AAC83ACAC6475FAADF368CC6512864C54A68388332CE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2760-9089","documentHash":"83162a4f-82fa-492e-882c-322358dfe921"},{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b66d0","name":"Artur","lastName":"Wiktor","uuid":"010FA8DE122350EBAD6F8A5062022838B6FEB5B2764C1582A1AAD62DC8DBE403926FE7E8B140F4750DA9C02F135814EFF2586301F745BD350DA7A1164E3AB545","orcidId":"0000-0003-4058-6010","documentHash":"f81f2de6-4a40-4a79-a412-0f00a3c570b2"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a04739221b","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Nowacka","uuid":"E85B587CB83FA262B33EC648A56233E393FCEE2E993B8374949D817101C99BFE915F89BFEA3B24894CF241C78C82241C2FCAD33FFB0DBE868B6365630E5D17A8","orcidId":"0000-0003-4689-6909","documentHash":"4ecb9480-c3af-4d13-9055-38f9ae2905e5"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a047392213","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Słowiński","uuid":"96ACD3DA259DC1D67F1607824E660E76FECCE13F8DE884A1E4AAA5EC842E81FC8567093FB5B08823CEDD8FC3227D2FFD316506EEB88E7669015B857808100938","orcidId":"0000-0002-5924-1277","documentHash":"845c49f2-66f2-4dd5-8916-695fd3d71e57"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a0473921dc","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Witrowa-Rajchert","uuid":"280E3A48FBDCD443419B808E81929077FDA5A14E56339600FF4B4352EFA5E4CBF460A0F9C12FA7AA717F25A4A358396EA7447AE40172F5930D37B19E5F038F1F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0937-3204","documentHash":"bac7465f-4ca1-4462-8f00-071ab8790a41"}],"doi":"10.3390/app14051808"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Lead isotopes","Risan","Riječani","Lead origin","Lead provenance","Roman objects","Objects origin","Montenegro"]}],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df17","uid":"bxvEdTB_rZDwTwDCxKD8MAA","uuid":"baafdd5c-15d8-49db-ac14-1067a5fabd1b","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Geologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70936e878c28a0473a95aa"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Determination of the origin of lead objects from Risan and Riječani (Montenegro) based on lead isotope analysis","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c6f3","mniswId":"10207","title":"Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports","doi":null,"issn":"2352-409X","eissn":"2352-409X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"9fb64fe7-613a-4206-9eac-bf040459a5e3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"68248838fdbe836c41b9039e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70936e878c28a0473a95aa","5e7094c9878c28a0473c3b11","5e7093f0878c28a0473b3aee","5e70947c878c28a0473be3dd","68248838fdbe836c41b903a0"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The determination of the origin of raw material is an important aspect of archaeological research. This study attempts to identify the sources of lead ores used to produce lead objects by communities inhabiting the Bay of Kotor and its surroundings between 3 BC and the Middle Ages. The objects come from archaeological sites in Risan and Riječani (Montenegro). Samples were taken from joints of columns and pedestals. One sample was identified as probably recycled, indicated by a significantly increased Sn content. Pb isotopes were measured and the results were compared with literature data for Roman mines from the areas of present-day Algeria, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Montenegro, Morocco, North Macedonia, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Serbia, Tunisia and Turkey. The results indicate the use of mainly Greek and/or Serbian or Bulgarian deposits. However, a good match to the North Macedonia deposits is also visible. There are also matches to individual deposits from Italy, Romania, Turkey and Tunisia. However, these directions seem less promising due to the long transport and the availability of

architectural design be automated? The development\nof CAAD tools led to the point where this question can be relevant. To\nprove that some branches of architectural design can be automatized to\na substantial extent we aimed at building a digital tool able to perform\nautomated preliminary design of residential building in the typology of\na point block (tower). The algorithmic process was split into three\nconsecutive stages corresponding to the traditional design method:\nmassing, floorplans layouts and apartments design. The workflow is\nlinear, with some form of feedback-loop-driven optimization. The\nresult of the study is an algorithmic tool in the Rhino + Grasshopper\nenvironment automatically proposing a point block of optimal size,\nposition and orientation on a given plot, dividing the floorplans into\nflats of optimal size structure and solving the flat layouts.

To understand the effect of high light intensity (HL) on the HL tolerance mechanisms in tomatoes, we examined the response of the photosynthesis apparatus of 12 tomato genotypes to HL. A reduced electron transfer per reaction center (ET0/RC), an increased energy dissipation (DI0/RC) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), along with a reduced maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (FV/FM), and performance index per absorbed photon (PIABS) were common HL-induced responses among genotypes; however, the magnitude of those responses was highly genotype-dependent. Tolerant and sensitive genotypes were distinguished based on chlorophyll fluorescence and energy-quenching responses to HL. Tolerant genotypes alleviated excess light through energy-dependent quenching (qE), resulting in smaller photoinhibitory quenching (qI) compared to sensitive genotypes. Quantum yield components also shifted under HL, favoring the quantum yield of NPQ (ՓNPQ) and the quantum yield of basal energy loss (ՓN0), while reducing the efficient quantum yield of PSII (ՓPSII). The impact of HL on tolerant genotypes was less pronounced. While the energy partitioning ratio did not differ significantly between sensitive and tolerant genotypes, the ratio of NPQ components, especially qI, affected plant resilience against HL. These findings provide insights into different patterns of HL-induced NPQ components in tolerant and sensitive genotypes, aiding the development of resilient crops for heterogeneous light

Objectives: to determine whether the COPD severity levels correlate with the sense of loneliness and dimensions of the sense of meaning in life.\nMethods: 144 patients with COPD during a period of absence of an infectious exacerbation were examined. The number of infectious exacerbations over the past year, the Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea score, the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score were determined as well as the feelings of loneliness using the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (DJGLS) and the sense of meaning in life using the Life Attitude Profile-Revised (LAP-R) questionnaire.\nResults: The age, the mMRC and CAT scores, the number of pack/years, as well as the number of infectious exacerbations during the year correlated positively with the feeling of loneliness. These variables (except for age) correlated negatively with the LAP-R scales apart from Existential Vacuum, which correlated positively. The subjects from the COPD severity group D (the most seriously ill people) had the highest level of loneliness, while it was the lowest in the subjects from group A (the least ill people).

The effects of these stresses tested separately are relatively well understood, but still little is known about their simultaneous effects on plants. Our research involved four single hybrids of maize differing in their degree of susceptibility to soil compaction and drought. We investigated the effects of low and high soil compaction under optimal irrigation (LI, HI) and under three-week long soil drought (LD, HD), on the gas exchange (Pn, E, gS, Ci) and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (F0, Fm, Fv, Fv/Fm), total leaf area (LA), leaf greening (SPAD), leaf water deficit (WD), leaf water potential (ψ) and membrane injury (MI). The plants experiencing high soil compaction (HI) showed a decrease in all parameters of gas exchange (Pn, E, gS, Ci), leaf area (LA), leaf greening (SPAD) and the maximal quantum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) in comparison with plants growing in non-compacted soil (LI). An increase was observed in the other fluorescence parameters, i.e., F0, Fm and Fv and leaf WD, ψ and MI in HI vs. LI variants. In the plants exposed to drought (LD, HD), the changes in the measured traits were greater, especially for the sensitive hybrids P-8400 and NS-3023, than for the plants from LI treatment. A significant interaction between the degree of stress susceptibility and relative trait change was observed for practically all of the measured features. Moreover, in the short recovery period after the end of drought, the measured traits in LD and HD plants did not fully return to the control level, especially in the case of the sensitive hybrids (P-8400 NS-3023). The physiological reaction of maize hybrids to soil compaction and/or soil drought indicated the genetically determined variability of tolerance to those stresses. Significant correlation between RTC and stress susceptibility indexes (S-SI) provided suitable criteria for the hybrid selection. Also, our results showed the plasticity and capability of maize hybrids to respond to environmental conditions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661538","journalIssue":{"objectId":"682445adfdbe836c41b2a91b","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"209","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"756bce07-ecea-4577-8f7f-fb4cca705a59"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"209","pagesFromTo":"689-704","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jac.12648","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682445adfdbe836c41b2a91d","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Grzesiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b13927f0-f623-4d57-95b5-2a02f99f691a"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b918f","name":"Anna","lastName":"Maksymowicz","uuid":"8241B19A1191887E8D6B16C595AB4B1CBE1948137F9DAA1FE639C9FA03CB5BBBF8C6F95A37AEA46B6B2F4C6B8981E9D59EF52850AB2FD7245484C3A1E4F83C14","orcidId":"0000-0001-5263-0184","documentHash":"2496d623-8d76-412b-8463-d0325f08064e"},{"objectId":"5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d8d","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Dziurka","uuid":"F896B30C172E4F7755870B94A25337DF78357B53DA86ECF7AE228A21E2A3F3EC87A81DAF92BD85AD8CDBC8E9DCD48CBF5B0BFC04EFCAF8C00ABCEEB3DFDF3E6E","orcidId":"0000-0003-4749-0935","documentHash":"8cd7c356-878b-4c90-8a89-e3e6ea36cc8d"},{"objectId":"5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b87","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Grzesiak","uuid":"586C7D776F6EE582438795652B553784FC957256E2BFAE854F81907449CB5149C95D15533442C034C7EB9C5E544D1E2EB1606EAB91437F6B14349B6D3D2318BA","orcidId":"0000-0003-0743-2095","documentHash":"3f357c1d-9cc8-446b-96f4-7b33b28bd222"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af7ff","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Ostrowska","uuid":"991A4FA3255BE98AD9C633A3602133E4F20864AC4A258B3E165BDEF4416F1D37B47CCBFD7A2D2151C2DDA356DE0E4A042ACA5AFBED561840B8A7AC1C3653232B","orcidId":"0000-0002-9611-6336","documentHash":"5f69c1b8-f77d-453b-9c66-95de2ebb4c55"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1a0b","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Hura","uuid":"BE2E4767958EBD60D259AA717DF6E24E77FCA8403B2A2D184EC71F55055C3BE5125FC7721F4BA946A90C94D85C54093EC80EA6C2E2401C15A20C2FA172F16673","orcidId":"0000-0001-5697-2886","documentHash":"b96f5aba-6b0a-4611-a997-84ba62b4159e"}],"doi":"10.1111/jac.12648"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093bd878c28a0473b002f","607e829d9543c73526c48970"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Ocelli: an open-source tool for the analysis and visualization of developmental multimodal single-cell data","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"61b9abddad204581b62eb839","mniswId":"30122","title":"NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2631-9268","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"faba65e0-f469-40cc-906f-125d28fa4d50"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"68248523fdbe836c41b8da81","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["607e829d9543c73526c48970","5e7093bd878c28a0473b002f"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The recent expansion of single-cell technologies has enabled simultaneous genome-wide measurements of multiple modalities in the same single cell. The potential to jointly profile such modalities as gene expression, chromatin accessibility, protein epitopes, or multiple histone modifications at single-cell resolution represents a compelling opportunity to study developmental processes at multiple layers of gene regulation. Here, we present Ocelli, a lightweight Python package implemented in Ray for scalable visualization and analysis of developmental multimodal single-cell data. The core functionality of Ocelli focuses on diffusion-based modeling of biological processes involving cell state transitions. Ocelli addresses common tasks in single-cell data analysis, such as visualization of cells on a low-dimensional embedding that preserves the continuity of the developmental progression of cells, identification of rare and transient cell states, integration with trajectory inference algorithms, and imputation of undetected feature counts. Extensive benchmarking shows that Ocelli outperforms existing methods regarding computational time and quality of the reconstructed low-dimensional representation of developmental data."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661539","journalIssue":{"objectId":"68248523fdbe836c41b8da82","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"7","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"3b6e4571-a0c4-4b6a-a828-ed0daade84dc"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"7","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/nargab/article-pdf/7/2/lqaf040/62903087/lqaf040.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"607e829d9543c73526c48970","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Rutkowski","uuid":"34AC5D3C95F6076911D4B907183F7143063982A0A04F16D93278A0FDD8880DF8C65943D483E58786BF4B74811827E391A05551844A16A92F4A9CBB38E64DE9DF","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f599f3b7-9937-486c-9922-7a5525fe33e1"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473b002f","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Tabaka","uuid":"63697FD3BAC09928F64280F5418390BE3D248F95AC2532A406A81FFDA2B3351C3C89A72952149CCABF5343B29938E60A387ABB4069187BF56A4F9F7573805C11","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ceceaf5b-e17d-4fcf-8907-5fa306db3dfe"}],"doi":"10.1093/nargab/lqaf040"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["FP-XRF","Petrol station dust","Environmental toxicology","environmental pollution","Hazardous elements"]}],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709325878c28a0473a3a41","6479542a40e3ff42bff4db69"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Hazardous Elements in Road Dust from Petrol Stations in Rzeszów (Podkarpackie, Poland): Toxicological Assessment Using Field Portable X-ray Fluorescence (FP-XRF) as ‘White Analytical Technique’","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c12d","mniswId":"6472","title":"Exposure and Health","doi":null,"issn":"2451-9766","eissn":"2451-9685","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"794ed639-b17e-479b-bf06-5deaa6e27696"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6798e161fdbe834383abf0cb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6479542a40e3ff42bff4db69","5e709325878c28a0473a3a41"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Samples of road dust (RD) from petrol stations (n = 20) located in Rzeszów (Podkarpackie, Poland) were analysed to find potential markers of traffic-related pollution. The level (μg/g) of: Mo, U, As, Hg, Th, Pb, Ni, Cu, Cr, Be, Sr, Zr, Zn, Mn and Fe were measured using field portable X-ray spectroscopy (FP-XRF) as a direct, rapid and ‘white analytical technique’. Our research demonstrated for the first time the utility of using FP-XRF for environmental toxicological assessment of RD from petrol stations. The qualitative and quantitative composition of the dust samples tested provides valuable research material for creating and updating regulations and finding pollution hotspots such as petrol stations. It was possible to find potential markers of traffic-related pollution (e.g., Zr and Fe forms of disk brakes or brake pads). Certain elements of the study give ambiguous signals related to fuel distribution and road traffic. They can come from various sources of environmental contamination. The adoption of evidence-based policies to minimise pollution, conserve the environment, and protect the well-being of people living or working near gas stations is anticipated to be aided by these findings for policymakers, regulatory authorities, and stakeholders. Incorporating toxicological risk assessment framework, this study pioneers the investigation of human exposure to hazardous elements in RD, an in-depth evaluation of both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health risks associated with such exposure including lifetime average daily dose. Our findings contribute novel insights into the environmental toxicology of urban areas, emphasising the need for tailored interventions to mitigate these risks."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661541","journalIssue":{"objectId":"68246628fdbe836c41b684b1","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"c0ef8b2d-4e5a-407c-897a-67ce57317edf"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"41-53","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12403-024-00644-6.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6479542a40e3ff42bff4db69","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Frydrych","uuid":"2754E7FF6F24B23C652F236B0607154ECC93D380BBE3F27BF06563F3539E277B6D56FBE672D4345EE106CE33400AB3104B523BDD81FD4B655E26074112ABD7A4","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1185e9ae-60ac-434f-8a7a-6c3e9dbe2a85"},{"objectId":"5e709325878c28a0473a3a41","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Jurowski","uuid":"FD42859D8A997A6BA37E4391C48B7138552B3CE3894A28059020497C512A1E6E3A6FCD7F33A6EAC1F0EAAABF8BEACB673100035B5A07B961D005B67D3973E102","orcidId":"0000-0003-0310-2849","documentHash":"793aa90c-93e4-44d6-b2d9-ba86c39462ec"}],"doi":"10.1007/s12403-024-00644-6"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Trichoderma","oat","heavy metals","cadmium","metallothioneins","phytoremediation"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","uid":"b_b7HPtUTCJYlxfss9Ssv-A","uuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","parentUuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","rootUuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","name":"Uniwersytet Mikołaja Kopernika w Toruniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67642bd3fdbe837ab144e7d3","5e7092c0878c28a04739bfd8","5f77e7c8085dcb410a25e899","5e7093e7878c28a0473b303c"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","parentUuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","rootUuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic metal that poses a severe threat to humans’ and animals’ health and lives. Plants can easily absorb Cd from the soil, and plant-based food is the main means of exposure to this hazardous element for humans and animals. Phytoremediation is a promising plant-based approach to removing heavy metals from the soil, and plant growth-promoting micro-organisms such as the fungi Trichoderma can enhance the ability of plants to accumulate metals. Inoculation of Avena sativa L. (oat) with Trichoderma viride enhances germination and seedling growth in the presence of Cd and, in this study, the growth of 6-month-old oat plants in Cd-contaminated soil was not increased by inoculation with T. viride, but a 1.7-fold increase in yield was observed. The content of Cd in oat shoots depended on the Cd content in the soil. Still, it was unaffected by the inoculation with T. viride. A. sativa metallothioneins (AsMTs) participate in plant–fungi interaction, however, their role in this study depended on MT type and Cd concentration. The inoculation of A. sativa with T. viride could be a promising approach to obtaining a high yield in Cd-contaminated soil without increasing the Cd content in the plant."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661544","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/13/15/2469","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67642bd3fdbe837ab144e7d3","name":"Sena","lastName":"Turkan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5d228654-2239-4fe1-b54b-a8dd77ecfd24"},{"objectId":"5f77e7c8085dcb410a25e899","name":"Wiktoria","lastName":"Konieczna","uuid":"8519560D477E5728ADFC9587BDED6AD8F36A9F4ACD4EAB0A26DD308A4A203257825651A0C10407E61C715B4AEB0D0797271E0DB0761E9938B506DB00A996ECF0","orcidId":"0000-0001-9638-3971","documentHash":"a31c7b22-2beb-4fba-9669-a15e6b5e2b2d"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5c6c","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Warchoł","uuid":"96C50C213364C636F181AB8D51BAF7D54BC1844F8C0FE66B80B47E5B3D24280420727B45E1BF0E2DC6316BDF1E9053073F82A99FB17A766EFBCA0E94D412D94C","orcidId":"0000-0003-3606-4869","documentHash":"89ecd230-5148-4dc5-9fc4-5f70e200b5b4"},{"objectId":"5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b89","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Skrzypek","uuid":"2FE6570FB916481FBD044405F2F659DBD3CFD39CE5F5A9F626C29557456B32924CA0ED373B92CD28276E256FB0040FC5C21EA384A09D6E8E4E05326289602963","orcidId":"0000-0003-3185-495X","documentHash":"206abb88-1f5d-4c30-b89f-cb14abfd9bd1"},{"objectId":"5e7093e7878c28a0473b303c","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Mierek-Adamska","uuid":"477537D435B915B162E4D379895B325A6DE71AFF185D15C6FD7AA2030A619C2E29D7F5FDBD63EA1F42D9AD73BDAAC9AAC8D8181C1ABEB182F90BC6656B69367D","orcidId":"0000-0001-8247-7328","documentHash":"95241c99-c3ce-4dcb-a4bf-b35c90ced125"},{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739bfd8","name":"Grażyna","lastName":"Dąbrowska","uuid":"CB8F223CAE00194B2E9C4A5BACF801A7D3FE60B5F1F62FD21318D4C5AD6C28FA6D678680075CED39DC8087B83156AC78B95F0096F3E0AD468DA14ACD74C28806","orcidId":"0000-0002-8300-3009","documentHash":"b689e32f-a36d-48e7-8623-cf7a41cc806d"}],"doi":"10.3390/foods13152469"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["health consequences","nurses","sleep","work specification"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","uid":"bWyeXRlH0huS_TwqiYk7m5Q","uuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","parentUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","rootUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6034781e9543c7410626fae2","5e7092ca878c28a04739ca63"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","uid":"b_ZPtKgtv4v90uInHkYp6dg","uuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","parentUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","rootUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Kochanowskiego w Kielcach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928e878c28a047397cc4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Sleep disturbances and health consequences induced by the specificity of nurse's work.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","doi":null,"issn":"1661-7827","eissn":"1660-4601","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e236e16e-7430-4ac3-800c-033637860e22"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-09","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"632d75a34097073ab8826557","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928e878c28a047397cc4","6572ed064097071b8e6e158b","6572ed064097071b8e6e158c","6034781e9543c7410626fae2","5e7092ca878c28a04739ca63","6572ed064097071b8e6e158d"]},"issue":"16","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Nursing staff working in a shift or night system are exposed to sleep disorders, which has a direct impact on the emergence of dangerous health consequences for them. Melatonin secretion is abnormal at night and the circadian rhythm is disturbed. The aim of the study was to assess the occurrence of sleep disorders and their consequences for the body in a group of representative nursing staff working in a shift and night system. Participants: The study was conducted among 126 nurses who are generally healthy, employed in health care facilities in the Małopolskie voivodship. Methods: The Athens Insomnia Scale consisting of 8 test items was used to obtain research material: falling asleep, waking up at night, waking up in the morning, total sleep time, sleep quality, well-being the next day, mental and physical fitness the next day, and sleepiness during the next day. As well as an original questionnaire. Results: The research showed significant negative consequences of shift work on the health of health-care workers. The subjects noticed symptoms related to the nervous system, such as increased nervous tension 53%, lack of patience in 62% of all respondents. As many as 85% pointed to the negative impact of shift work on their family life, 82% of all respondents on social life and 56% of all respondents on sex life. The other variables were not confirmed. Conclusions: Symptoms of insomnia are common among night-work nurses."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661546","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63047bcd40970739a761f724","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"19","number":"16","doi":null,"documentHash":"6fcf689c-4343-4220-b2a8-f7a2b280debd"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"[1-23], [poz.] 9802","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/16/9802","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6572ed064097071b8e6e158d","name":"Sabina","lastName":"Krupa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0ff20909-bc9e-4fb8-b657-1ff7a5932242"},{"objectId":"6572ed064097071b8e6e158c","name":"- Bereza Edyta","lastName":"Trzeciak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ee2cec9b-708d-4d1d-b116-149d651e6e2c"},{"objectId":"6572ed064097071b8e6e158b","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Maciąg","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c5c58d1-b793-49bc-8888-f53ed78fcd96"},{"objectId":"6034781e9543c7410626fae2","name":"Bartosz ","lastName":"Knap","uuid":"57D9F12301D657C11D29FA4A4EAB977DFE637288F917A4DB8690E127E771948A483A4F5146E09DBC00F16CF38BDB51E62C6455EFE064E97783D4A37900C28606","orcidId":"0000-0002-5161-3494","documentHash":"cf15ddc1-3626-47a6-81fb-c1d565e323b9"},{"objectId":"5e7092ca878c28a04739ca63","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Czop","uuid":"D794657426B6071760930885377ABA3F01C2E263FC8BA47768B0255B6CAF9AA2BA4EFE9858C0816C644AB8DD623EB79CE9C517F203860A05607AF75CE4F6099D","orcidId":"0000-0002-8113-5841","documentHash":"17dffdf8-f371-4798-ab04-259eb51abd8b"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397cc4","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Knap","uuid":"38A0F183BACBD9CDFA5ECA879BC9F5B7BC58138BBDF76CF662DAB4E3DE1F420F1228F0AE2BC7C65AF2B5B184A9DF73B59B08F9027270A46EF75F8CE8F52A5422","orcidId":"0000-0003-0425-7631","documentHash":"d6c3abfd-4514-4509-bddb-9881e29ab42c"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19169802"},{"mainLanguageName":"ukraiński","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet Warszawski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["65333a5e40e3ff51d51ed90d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Reconstruction of Family Memory: The way from oblivion to re-gaining of identity in Volodymyr Rafeyenko’s novels The Length of Days and Mondegreen: Songs about Death and Love","mainLanguage":"ukr","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f550","mniswId":"496901","title":"LITERARY PROCESS: METHODOLOGY, NAMES, TRENDS","doi":null,"issn":"2311-2433","eissn":"2412-2475","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"49729d44-45f0-4482-a507-62a7630b9763"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67817c7efdbe834a8116df0b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65333a5e40e3ff51d51ed90d"]},"issue":"24","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747261661548","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"50-59","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.28925/2412-2475.2024.24.4","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65333a5e40e3ff51d51ed90d","name":"Tetiana","lastName":"Grebeniuk","uuid":"7DFA8007DD31A2297AFD54F7444D549A80CFA7779CD505FCDAF35A68DBBD91969041CE2C87D92CC6707EAA50FAAD41C5505A5B9B88DA9A87F7F14E4E3DEE54F5","orcidId":"0000-0003-1910-5411","documentHash":"e6a49fd3-e400-4d1c-96e5-fae8fb20242c"}],"doi":"10.28925/2412-2475.2024.24.4"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Iris aphylla","in vitro","regulation of dormancy","seed germination","phytohormones","seeds"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","parentUuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","rootUuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

The low percentage of germinating seeds largely limits its generative reproduction. The germination tests confirmed deep dormancy of the Iris aphylla seeds. The dormancy was disrupted by isolation of embryos from seeds, which were further cultivated in vitro. The germination of isolated embryos proved the localization of endogenous inhibitors of germinating seeds of I. aphylla in the endosperm. The comparison of phytohormonal profiles of seeds, endosperm and embryos of I. aphylla and Iris sibirica, i.e. a species with a high percentage of germinating seed, revealed that the deep dormancy of I. aphylla seeds was associated with the balance between abscisic acid and gibberellins (ABA/GA), a significant predominance of ABA and a massive accumulation of salicylic acid. Isolation of embryos from seeds and their germination in growing medium in vitro is recommended as the most efficient method for I. aphylla propagation. Results of this study can be applied in conservation efforts of this attractive and important native

environmental factors that improve plant growth and development under nitrogen (N) constraint is essential for sustainable greenhouse production. In the present study, the role of light intensity and N concentrations on the biomass partitioning and physiology of chrysanthemum was investigated. Four light intensities [75, 150, 300, and 600 µmol m−2 s−1 photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD)] and three N concentrations (5, 10, and 15 mM N L−1) were used. Vegetative and generative growth traits were improved by increase in PPFD and N concentration. High N supply reduced stomatal size and gs in plants under lowest PPFD. Under low PPFD, the share of biomass allocated to leaves and stem was higher than that of flower and roots while in plants grown under high PPFD, the share of biomass allocated to flower and root outweighed that of allocated to leaves and stem. As well, positive effects of high PPFD on chlorophyll content, photosynthesis, water use efficiency (WUE), Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) were observed in N-deficient plants. Furthermore, photosynthetic functionality improved by raise in PPFD. In conclusion, high PPFD reduced the adverse effects of N deficiency by improving photosynthesis and stomatal functionality, NUE, WUE, and directing biomass partitioning toward the floral organs."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661559","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-14163-4","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68250504fdbe83139258f260","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Sierka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eda52f6a-5e5e-452e-b723-aa5aed4a5a5b"},{"objectId":"68250504fdbe83139258f25f","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Telesiński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a239be18-3c35-4cbb-8159-9d6712c1bb3f"},{"objectId":"68250504fdbe83139258f25e","name":"Fardad","lastName":"Didaran","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3062c070-bfdc-4e88-89c3-2aa773bd5559"},{"objectId":"68250504fdbe83139258f25d","name":"Aida","lastName":"Shomali","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"252911c2-8c11-4491-bf69-5c82db360f7a"},{"objectId":"68250504fdbe83139258f25c","name":"Soheil","lastName":"Karimi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cce91066-9737-4e04-9f22-49f3cbc8f69e"},{"objectId":"68250504fdbe83139258f25b","name":"Shirin","lastName":"Dianati Daylami","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"92ea5029-4acc-4a5e-b57c-309ff17c1487"},{"objectId":"68250504fdbe83139258f25a","name":"Sasan","lastName":"Aliniaeifard","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"06a50cb0-61e2-420d-b62a-f58317c5dec1"},{"objectId":"68250504fdbe83139258f259","name":"Sara","lastName":"Esmaeili","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"93d64c53-4208-4304-82bf-685fd2863104"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941bf","name":"Mohamed","lastName":"Kalaji","uuid":"E980832F46BD43DEC3B7BE0AF6953EFF6EFA2450F0F24597D0811CF571F4A5B08DE7D49F0E697901B7A39E422A74CF9108BC2BF9E4A67F966407BBFE73E43426","orcidId":"0000-0002-3833-4917","documentHash":"63337622-ec27-4520-9587-1f4a884fc748"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-022-14163-4"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","uid":"bwMFmWfr8KJtwNRmMdBB2Zg","uuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","parentUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deae","rootUuid":"456ee281-d8ed-49d6-9be7-4dab317610fb","name":"Instytut Informatyki Teoretycznej i Stosowanej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709245878c28a047392d1a","5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"What is the doggest dog?

The theory assumes that the degree of membership in a basic-level category is graded. As a result, some concepts are perceived as more central (typical) than others. The most typical category is called a prototype. It can be perceived as the clearest example of a category, reflecting the redundancy structure of the category as a whole. Its inverse is called an anti-prototype. Reasonable perception of prototypes and anti-prototypes is important for accurate projection of the world structure onto the class space and more human-like world perception beyond simple memorization. That is why it is beneficial to study deep models from the perspective of prototype theory. To enable it, we propose 3 methods that return the prototypes and anti-prototypes perceived by deep networks for a specific basic-level category. Additionally, one of our methods allows to visualize the centrality of objects. The results on a wide range of 42 networks trained on ImageNet (Convolutional Networks, Vision Transformers, ConvNeXts and hybrid models) reveal that the networks share the typicality perception to a large extent and that this perception does not lie so far from the human one. We release the dataset with per-network prototypes and anti-prototypes resulting from our work to enable further research on this topic."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661562","journalIssue":{"objectId":"68244365fdbe836c41b258d1","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"188","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"f15a108d-dd03-42f3-819f-7454288e6c9b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"188","pagesFromTo":"107425","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0893608025003041?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094cf878c28a0473c438a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Filus","uuid":"841272B3B75F8057208BE67A2738BFCE08342B23B3ADE812E1F7F5214FF7CE1D21A2A8EB19D8F3921DDB27B748BCCB7222D4F5C9B5CBA50089AD0F290F918226","orcidId":"0000-0003-1303-9230","documentHash":"d6326fb8-e01b-4053-ad74-9a0a83d9dcec"},{"objectId":"5e709245878c28a047392d1a","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Domańska","uuid":"4A1A11F10A925F650E6B59202EE7CBE9E2A25C68AF861B8CB2D7FF318E2B00DA7F4C678616ADC0C8082C8C1B0A3575CEC53207B122F0FC1DABD0F41341DD6884","orcidId":"0000-0002-1935-8358","documentHash":"f852ee1c-d3c4-48f8-9ff9-17b3e049a012"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.neunet.2025.107425"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Protein isolates","Anthocyanin encapsulation","Plant-based emulsifier","Agricultural by-products"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709386878c28a0473abe68","682507f9fdbe83139258f8b4","682507f9fdbe83139258f8b6","682507f9fdbe83139258f8b5","5e70929e878c28a0473993b1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The role of canola, black caraway, and wheat bran protein isolates in anthocyanin microencapsulation via double emulsions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780a6","mniswId":"8251","title":"Industrial Crops and Products","doi":null,"issn":"0926-6690","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"69c928da-6f6d-4d08-a63f-877d0f71a92f"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682507f9fdbe83139258f8b3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["682507f9fdbe83139258f8b4","682507f9fdbe83139258f8b5","682507f9fdbe83139258f8b6","5e709386878c28a0473abe68","5e70929e878c28a0473993b1"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study investigates the potential of protein isolates from canola (Brassica napus L. var. napus) (CC) and black caraway (Nigella sativa) (NS) oil cake and wheat bran (Triticum aestivum) (WB) as sustainable alternatives to traditional soybean isolates (SB) for anthocyanin microencapsulation in double emulsions, aiming to leverage agricultural by-products for sustainable food processing, potentially offering improved functionality for sensitive compound stabilization. The study discovered that NS concentrates considerably improved emulsion stability\n(ES) (75.89 %, 77.26 %, 85.09 %) in samples when compared to other isolates. SB produced the lowest (1.17 span) and most consistent droplet diameters. Each of the protein isolates under investigation exhibited commendable efficiencies in the encapsulation of anthocyanins. However, the isolates derived from soybean\ndistinguished themselves by achieving the highest encapsulation efficiency, suggesting that they possess intrinsic properties that may not be fully paralleled by the alternative protein sources examined.

The formation of a non-sticky gel at room conditions is crucial for their use. Gel formation and gel melting of carrageenan-based glazing gels (CGGs) with various sweeteners (trehalose, erythritol with stevia, maltitol, oligofructose, and nutriose with sucralose and acesulfame) were monitored during cooling-heating cycles using both the oscillatory rheology and the multispeckle diffusing wave spectroscopy (MS-DWS). In addition, rheological properties (shear viscosity of sols, the viscoelastic properties of gels, gel breaking strain) and texture properties (gel strength, elasticity and rupture force) were evaluated. The 12% addition of sweeteners resulted in a significant increase in gelling and melting temperatures by 2–6 °C compared to the sugar-free control sample (42 °C and 57 °C, resp.). MS-DWS, as opposed to oscillatory rheology, allowed determining of the characteristic temperatures at the beginning, middle and end of the phase transitions. The rheology gelling temperatures correlated best with the end of the gelation process, while the melting temperatures corresponded to the middle point temperature of the MS-DWS. Mechanical properties showed CGGs create a continuous gel structure characterized by a viscoelastic solid with comparable hardness and strength at small deformation, and greater elasticity compared to the sugar-free control sample. CGGs containing small molecule sweeteners formed stronger gels against rupture at large deformation than those ones with macromolecular structure. Sols of all CGGs were clear dispersions at 70 °C with Newtonian fluids characteristics and low viscosity (in the range of 9.3–10.9 mPas). These findings prove CGGs with various sugar-replaced sweeteners could be applied by hot spraying method and indicate how MS-DWS can be used to monitor gelation processes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661574","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"152","pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0268005X24002157?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68250802fdbe83139258f8f7","name":"Diana","lastName":"Mańko-Jurkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9fa68432-cc2a-4162-ad52-619a0e560f69"},{"objectId":"68250802fdbe83139258f8f6","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Górska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"add8cf19-1fd5-46b6-8900-944784de616d"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a047392210","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Domian","uuid":"1A5C7564EB741C596EE64E8D9366D49FAAB4D41D5FFA078598E4C2EBC211BEC09FF6174B9DF83BFB599A3D16E858071F569BF02C8B66349FB0D299AF14EE5011","orcidId":"0000-0001-6318-751X","documentHash":"71ceda41-2bae-4704-92e6-44ca390db60f"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.foodhyd.2024.109941"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["safflower plants","salinity stress tolerance","salicylic acid","Jasmonic acid"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709259878c28a0473941bf"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A comparison of Jasmonic acid and salicylic acid-induced salinity stress tolerance in safflower plants, particularly on sodium (Na) and potassium (K) nutrient contents","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454789c1","mniswId":"12321","title":"Journal of Plant Nutrition","doi":null,"issn":"0190-4167","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"2daae77c-ddf7-47c0-92fc-62dafd83de96"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65798aea4097070701980af9","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["682504d3fdbe83139258f085","682504d3fdbe83139258f086","682504d3fdbe83139258f087","682504d3fdbe83139258f088","5e709259878c28a0473941bf","682504d3fdbe83139258f089"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) are phytohormones that have a significant role in the induction of plant defense against different stress factors.

In the present study, we introduce the concept of utilizing 109Pd (T1/2 = 13.7 h) in the form of a 109Pd/109mAg in vivo generator. In this system, 109Pd emits beta particles of medium energy, while 109mAg releases a cascade of conversion and Auger electrons. 109Pd was utilized in the form of 15 nm gold nanoparticles, which were coated with a monolayer of 109Pd. In this system, the 109Pd atoms are on the surface of the nanoparticle, while the 109mAg atoms generated in the decay reaction possess the capability for unhindered emission of Auger electrons.\nResults\n109Pd, obtained through neutron irradiation of natural palladium, was deposited onto 15-nm gold nanoparticles, exceeding a efficiency rate of 95%. In contrast to previously published data on in vivo generators based on chelators, where the daughter radionuclide diffuses away from the molecules, daughter radionuclide 109mAg remains on the surface of gold nanoparticles after the decay of 109Pd. To obtain a radiobioconjugate with an affinity for HER2 receptors, polyethylene glycol chains and the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab were attached to the Au@Pd nanoparticles. The synthesized bioconjugate contained an average of 9.5 trastuzumab molecules per one nanoparticle. In vitro cell studies indicated specific binding of the Au@109Pd-PEG-trastuzumab radiobioconjugate to the HER2 receptor on SKOV-3 cells, resulting in 90% internalization. Confocal images illustrated the accumulation of Au@109Pd-PEG-trastuzumab in the perinuclear area surrounding the cell nucleus. Despite the lack of nuclear localization, which is necessary to achieve an effective cytotoxic effect of Auger electrons, a substantial cytotoxic effect, significantly greater than that of pure β− and pure Auger electron emitters was observed. We hypothesize that in the studied system, the cytotoxic effect of the Auger electrons could have also occurred through the damage to the cell’s nuclear membrane by Auger electrons emitted from nanoparticles accumulated in the perinuclear area.\nConclusion\nThe obtained results show that trastuzumab-functionalized 109Pd-labeled nanoparticles can be suitable for the application in combined β−—Auger electron targeted radionuclide therapy. Due to both components decay (β− and conversion/Auger electrons), the 109Pd/109mAg in vivo generator presents unique potential in this field. Despite the lack of nuclear localization, which is highly required for efficient Auger electron therapy, an adequate cytotoxic effect was attained."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661580","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"8","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ejnmmipharmchem.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41181-023-00212-4","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682504d7fdbe83139258f0b6","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Bilewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"401cfd02-c45d-4b43-892f-49dd99740340"},{"objectId":"682504d7fdbe83139258f0b5","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Żelechowska-Matysiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0634c680-a9f9-4abf-b13c-885a7f482e6b"},{"objectId":"682504d7fdbe83139258f0b4","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Majkowska-Pilip","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c13b412c-8f04-4c66-a609-2551d7f3d766"},{"objectId":"682504d7fdbe83139258f0b3","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Wawrowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f29f49f2-bfae-4fb5-b9c7-4d780d5374df"},{"objectId":"682504d7fdbe83139258f0b2","name":"Nasrin

The use of hydrogen is associated with the problem of its storage and distribution. Storing hydrogen in the gaseous state is energy-consuming, mainly due to the process of its compression. A much higher density of hydrogen can be obtained after its liquefaction. Hydrogen can also bond in chemical compounds, for example, in ammonia which contains 17.8% hydrogen by weight. The aim of the work was to examine the ammonia decomposition process in the plasma-catalytic system and to determine the effect of the process parameters on energy consumption. The applied catalysts allowed higher ammonia conversion than the homogeneous system. The lowest energy consumption, 593 kJ/molH2, was obtained for the 10% Fe/Al2O3 catalyst. The highest ammonia conversion (approx. 90%) was obtained using the 10% Co/Al2O3 catalyst."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661592","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"45","pagesFromTo":"1-7","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/dlibra/publication/149462/edition/132435","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68249ceefdbe83139258c837","name":"Maria","lastName":"Ogrodowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4fcc05be-33c7-4723-9426-690f067e1278"},{"objectId":"6350b2a9752340623bbeb307","name":"Michalina","lastName":"Perron","uuid":"B59C766DF49216AE5F1F8A37D8861D33AABAF90CCF516D7B2222A91F813917373148E18DC70BE42E80CB4283D765F21C1D30EF14B62C8917538E1CD24B461D9C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"06e68031-e768-4e57-9480-5f4c5449f241"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af265","name":"Michał","lastName":"Młotek","uuid":"5865EC6FEBCEBF6611C0C69F5D738607D583C07B6628185BC01F81C490E766FB7DDEF13F67C6B45D4F24E95B7A5DECDA21F34C57FF1C53DAEF77306ECE4FFBF6","orcidId":"0000-0003-4219-8476","documentHash":"d32e216f-5b3d-4fed-8fa5-276ea510e503"},{"objectId":"5e709327878c28a0473a3c35","name":"Bogdan","lastName":"Ulejczyk","uuid":"EA147F0E26D561045A60C2EAB09B067C95C7E62B8B9FF37DA320EC29A7EF48748579F98BD933E730A68AB034BDB541A8C6359CBF4593F61DFB0C0A14B70D563D","orcidId":"0000-0002-3794-3817","documentHash":"2204aa6f-3367-44e3-9b10-1b7e79087b2b"},{"objectId":"5e709327878c28a0473a3c1e","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Krawczyk","uuid":"8DD0F065EF5CB08CEFA392BB699016279153CE5B02FE2E316DF13D1D18EA0D2EE037B332D3930E91E2E5F47060DEDE32068FB77F986CCD697BEF000B49969AB0","orcidId":"0000-0003-4144-5906","documentHash":"eebc8601-7a9a-4cb6-bbd6-3a416b1eb441"}],"doi":"10.24425/cpe.2024.149462"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["willow","biomass","poplar","alternative lignocellulosic material","particleboard"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70923d878c28a0473923f5","682505a8fdbe83139258f3cf"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Selected Physical and Mechanical Properties of Particleboards Manufactured from Plantation Willow and Poplar Wood","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1944","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-08-16","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682505a8fdbe83139258f3cd","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["682505a8fdbe83139258f3ce","682505a8fdbe83139258f3cf","5e70923d878c28a0473923f5"]},"issue":"16","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This research focuses on producing particleboards from the biomass of plantation willow (Salix viminalis L.) and poplar (Populus spp.), aiming to explore their feasibility as sustainable materials for various applications. Fast-growing willow and poplar are known for their rapid growth and suitability for energy production. They present an intriguing alternative as raw materials with added value for particleboard manufacturing. This study investigates the selected mechanical and physical properties of the produced particleboards, considering parameters such as density profile, bending strength, modulus of elasticity, internal bond, water absorption, thickness swelling, and screw withdrawal resistance. The research results were also compared between different mass shares of willow and poplar particles in the particleboards. The results show that the panels produced entirely from the tested alternative raw materials had a modulus of rupture of 21.7 N mm−2 compared to 14.6 N mm−2 for the reference panels, with an internal bond of about 2.02 N mm−2 compared to 0.65 N mm−2 for the reference panels. The thickness swelling after 24 h of soaking was about 24.2% compared to 42.2% for reference panels. The findings underscore the promising potential of willow and poplar-based particleboards as eco-friendly alternatives in the construction and furniture industries, contributing to resource efficiency and carbon emission reduction efforts."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661594","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/16/4069","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682505a8fdbe83139258f3cf","name":"Anita","lastName":"Wronka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"03741b7b-92aa-4feb-8701-4331e55ff0d3"},{"objectId":"682505a8fdbe83139258f3ce","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Żabowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"29510cfb-0e9a-4930-a58c-34a9a5893ff5"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923f5","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Kowaluk","uuid":"68FBD120BB38A98CBB3EEA3BD6ED9F0498687633ADB279D51D69CAD676E465F0F6ED590B66AD118E477534CC7E2DEE92CB80B1E7A1B838ECEB1636F9AAA2E01E","orcidId":"0000-0003-1463-0540","documentHash":"99b518a0-3f6f-4b31-8930-dee3b8571abf"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17164069"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["red light","LEDs","Brassica oleracea var. acephala L.,","blue light"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709269878c28a0473953d2","5e709335878c28a0473a4ea7"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","parentUuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","rootUuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Among a large group of species, those from the Brassicaceae family, including kale, are very popularly grown as microgreens. Typically, microgreens are grown under controlled conditions under light-emitting diodes (LEDs). However, the effect of light on the quality of grown microgreens varies. The present study aimed to determine the effect of artificial white light with varying proportions of red (R) and blue (B) light on the morphological and photosynthetic parameters of kale microgreens with green and red leaves. The R:B ratios were for white light (W) 0.63, for red-enhanced white light (W + R) 0.75, and for white and blue light (W + B) 0.38 at 230 µmol m−2 s−1 PPFD. The addition of both blue and red light had a positive effect on the content of active compounds in the plants, including flavonoids and carotenoids. Red light had a stronger effect on the seedling area and the dry mass and relative chlorophyll content of red-leaved kale microgreens. Blue light, in turn, had a stronger effect on green kale, including dry mass. The W + B light combination negatively affected the chlorophyll content of both cultivars although the leaves were significantly thicker compared to cultivation under W + R light. In general, the cultivar with red leaves had less sensitivity to the photosynthetic apparatus to the spectrum used. The changes in PSII were much smaller in red kale compared to green kale. Too much red light caused a deterioration in the PSII vitality index in green kale. Red and green kale require an individual spectrum with different proportions of blue and red light at different growth stages to achieve plants with a large leaf area and high nutritional value."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661595","journalIssue":{"objectId":"654c892540970749a85af746","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"12","number":"3800","doi":null,"documentHash":"df93ab79-d1f3-489e-81b1-9d67799d1617"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67348902fdbe830349024fe4","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Spiżewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"34fd7fa7-df0f-48eb-a6a8-9f245ce88194"},{"objectId":"67348902fdbe830349024fe3","name":"Kingsley","lastName":"Chinazor Unegbu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7b221055-7795-4ab0-8745-bbf764396078"},{"objectId":"67348902fdbe830349024fe1","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Frąszczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7f51a324-daeb-4904-8a6d-f2afc7947040"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b918c","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kula-Maximenko","uuid":"0F36CBF6B64E8E31346435F928C8327A6E2A023E918BE0A34DA5AAE7E0520438C933CA49CFE3281DB226BC6443FDA266B21D36050EBAA16876FDC30BF0C9F09E","orcidId":"0000-0001-7100-877X","documentHash":"543d94d3-9bda-4e95-9f7b-0290090624e9"},{"objectId":"5e709335878c28a0473a4ea7","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Sosnowska","uuid":"4089A53C9BF0413A67EE8577FB9B77FBA0C36C149A527984746899AC3211D093FE482A29C2AF5ED78A3AF0265BB68367FC9CE81FED7DAEF73D2C3213CCB8AD06","orcidId":"0000-0002-1937-9749","documentHash":"7523ed8f-0fd0-4931-ab1c-fa9396793d4a"},{"objectId":"5e709269878c28a0473953d2","name":"Anna","lastName":"Podsędek","uuid":"0DE3EA1B61318ED4C73990E7995E7C2D64F234FD4DCA3E5A8643E081E84917428916D66D6EF2B6C38B3ADFC6F852AACFE3B60C93805F5AB3F11E9609236BA00F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6654-4818","documentHash":"99c9d4f7-aab8-43b5-be4b-d3acfe82fd11"}],"doi":"10.3390/plants12223800"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"624436502467f070c45dddc4","doi":"10.18778/8220-737-8","title":"Poeta ze średniowiecznej ekstazy.

This review describes the concept and method of reflex creeping in Vojta therapy. Additionally, this focuses on the mechanisms through which brainstem activation via reflex creeping affects locomotion and postural control. Proprioception stimulus input during reflex creeping in Vojta therapy affects the pontomedullary reticular formation of the brainstem and eventually affects the activation of the central pattern generator and propriospinal neurons through the reticulospinal tract. It can also induce antigravity movements through the lateral vestibulospinal tract. Reflex creeping in Vojta therapy is an intervention that unconsciously improves locomotion and postural control. The proprioception through the reflex creeping in Vojta therapy can improve posture and locomotion by activating the pontomedullary reticular formation of the brainstem."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661600","journalIssue":{"objectId":"659675574097074a39fff68e","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"39","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"df639bca-3e58-4e97-84d4-d943cd456053"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"39","pagesFromTo":"192-197","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/doi_ft/10.5114/ms.2023.129062","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65b26e0340970745ed222675","name":"Yun-Hee","lastName":"Sung","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"753bf18d-77d6-4d5e-8a2f-a4b9e652616d"},{"objectId":"65b26e0340970745ed222673","name":"Sun-Young","lastName":"Ha","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d34a9aee-0b2a-487d-b45f-0ef748dd22ff"},{"objectId":"5e70928c878c28a047397ba8","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Kiebzak","uuid":"24685A021A4CACBFC3B7638CEE14E82CC7D907D7180A41B9B45A3B54037043F1C4CBA22AD9D5F5ABE4C4F2A9E1D161D101013B5E6F506ECE07290A6E7625220F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6035-6568","documentHash":"29b7c538-1808-40be-9629-b07006f8fb4c"}],"doi":"10.5114/ms.2023.129062"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["tawny owl","central Poland","comparative osteology","small mammals"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70923d878c28a047392248"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Small vertebrates in the diet of the tawny owl Strix aluco (Linnaeus 1758) in the Garwolin Forest District","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"61b9ac24ad204581b62ebbab","mniswId":"201409","title":"Fragmenta Faunistica","doi":null,"issn":"0015-9301","eissn":"2391-5846","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"MINISTRY","editor":null,"documentHash":"b6fc9b21-b565-4a6d-aa24-58ec04d9f1bd"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-12-12","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682504a6fdbe83139258ef09","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["682504a6fdbe83139258ef0a","682504a6fdbe83139258ef0b","5e70923d878c28a047392248","682504a6fdbe83139258ef0c"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The diet of tawny owl Strix aluco was analysed in 10 sites within boundaries of Garwolin Forest District (1,428.9 km2) in Mazowieckie Voivodship (central and eastern Poland) in the years 2015-2022.

Therefore, the present study was aimed to investigate the efficacy of 5 μM SA and/or 10 mM Tre in improving the growth, photosynthesis, ion homeostasis, nutrient acquisition, antioxidant defense system and yield of mustard plants growing under sodium chloride (NaCl) stress (0, 50, 100 and 150 mM NaCl). The data showed that increasing NaCl stress concentration decreased growth, photosynthesis, membrane permeability, ion homeostasis and yield in a dose-dependent manner while increasing considerably enzymatic antioxidant enzyme activities, compatible solute accumulation, sodium ion and oxidative stress biomarkers linearly with increasing NaCl stress concentration. The spray of SA, Tre, and SA + Tre played diversified roles in enhancing NaCl stress tolerance in mustard at morpho-physiological and biochemical levels. The combined SA + Tre application proved best and completely neutralized the NaCl stress-induced suppression in growth, photosynthesis, ion homeostasis, nutrient acquisition and yield by significantly enhancing the activities of enzymatic antioxidants, compatible solutes accumulation, water status and membrane permeability, while reducing considerably osmotic stress, reactive oxygen species generation, lipid peroxidation, cell death and sodium uptake in mustard. The SA + Tre application enhanced relative water content by 23%, net photosynthetic rate by 48%, superoxide dismutase activity by 51% and seed yield per plant by 64%, while decreased superoxide anion content by 26%, sodium ion content by 36% and malondialdehyde content by 25% over 0 mM NaCl treatment. Our findings indicate that the co-application of SA + Tre can be a suitable approach to palliate the ill effect of NaCl stress in mustard plants."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661604","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"326","pagesFromTo":"1-6","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0269749123004694","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682504bffdbe83139258efd5","name":"Manzer H","lastName":"Siddiqui","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a52a0d51-fa0d-49ed-876d-97b3a2c8b173"},{"objectId":"682504bffdbe83139258efd4","name":"Firoz","lastName":"Mohammad","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"50a5bf22-8bd4-4ed5-8604-482e6964f84d"},{"objectId":"682504bffdbe83139258efd3","name":"Shaistul","lastName":"Islam","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"83e2fb3e-1729-4bc4-80da-1cbd914e1bdc"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941bf","name":"Mohamed","lastName":"Kalaji","uuid":"E980832F46BD43DEC3B7BE0AF6953EFF6EFA2450F0F24597D0811CF571F4A5B08DE7D49F0E697901B7A39E422A74CF9108BC2BF9E4A67F966407BBFE73E43426","orcidId":"0000-0002-3833-4917","documentHash":"63337622-ec27-4520-9587-1f4a884fc748"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121467"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Genetic mapping","QTL","Biotic stress","Erysiphe graminis","Secale cereale L","Fungus resistance"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","uid":"bsTIibl14j-FXDX1as_pUTA","uuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","parentUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","rootUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","name":"Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709302878c28a0473a100f","5e7092ab878c28a04739a4ff"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","parentUuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","rootUuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

While PM is one of the most important wheat leaf diseases globally, rye is highly tolerant to PM. It has been reported that in barley infected with PM, polyamine oxidase (PAO) activity related to the production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has increased, which may promote defense against biotrophic or hemibiotrophic pathogens. The current study aimed to assess the relationship between the segregation of the polymorphic marker for rye PAO (ScPAO) and the level of PM infection in plants. The genetic mapping in two interline populations shows that ScPAO is located on chromosome 7R. Further analysis comparing ScPAO location to mapped wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) PAO duplicates suggests the ScPAO homology with TaPAO6 or TaPAO7. A possible association of ScPAO from 7R with PM resistance is demonstrated in the recombinant inbred lines (RIL)-L population phenotyped for PM infection. Finally, three novel QTLs for PM resistance on the 7R chromosome of rye are detected."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661606","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6437a75d4097076e1e31ee4a","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"64","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"b26cf26b-f54f-46ba-a814-60f715fe8e36"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"65-70","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13353-022-00723-x","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67595a01fdbe8357175747f7","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Pałatyńska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ebb37eca-6d4e-483b-a080-ec940cf05de9"},{"objectId":"67595a01fdbe8357175747f6","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Góralska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"056702e6-d49c-4ae6-847d-4adf19e4f2c5"},{"objectId":"67595a01fdbe8357175747f5","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Wysoczański","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"73d3bb03-41f3-4f29-92b4-1e3c2de936da"},{"objectId":"67595a01fdbe8357175747f4","name":"Fatemeh","lastName":"Maghuly","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"46701aee-dc57-4b2b-aa86-0180113cd47a"},{"objectId":"5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b84","name":"Ilona","lastName":"Czyczyło-Mysza","uuid":"E6E2B66A49A03DD35444BA1226B8680933CFAEC563749F6BB5388291798F60CCA4F363FA1F64A20F686A6FA8DE2FCC792D0D0D6DDDD207CEDC29852EB51A34A6","orcidId":"0000-0002-9586-9272","documentHash":"6936c869-2877-42f7-b4de-7d8855addd4c"},{"objectId":"5e709302878c28a0473a100f","name":"Beata","lastName":"Myśków","uuid":"58674D820CEEF8E8B50DC25A7E9CF443642DD7A87EFD0378777765F3ECEEE4321C137920FF7198D435D69B8B4A23F163BD7EC6D722DAAFCF956F287CA7D9C2A5","orcidId":"0000-0001-5062-9841","documentHash":"324ec339-8192-49e4-82e4-87c04e8cd2f7"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a4ff","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Milczarski","uuid":"AC7AE6D262239F5D6709DED43E02CA26CE52BE6449D93089B119900E1ADCDDAEF7ED974E4054624D0950008A35CA380514729549F69454FBDE0889DA6070CC11","orcidId":"0000-0003-2622-8938","documentHash":"c7c9286d-8625-4d73-b07a-163d79a46719"}],"doi":"10.1007/s13353-022-00723-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Miller laryngoscope","Cormac–Lehane scale","Macintosh laryngoscope","glottis view","POGO scale"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A Comparison of Miller Straight Blade and Macintosh Blade Laryngoscopes for Intubation in Morbidly Obese Patients","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c754","mniswId":"10517","title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2077-0383","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"11fb906d-8d54-4e42-be05-fb426fe7219b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-01-24","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"681b2ccefdbe8359b33e6229","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709204878c28a04738eb55","5e7092e2878c28a04739eb3d","5e7092e2878c28a04739eb45","5e70920c878c28a04738f145","68243a9bfdbe83139256a3d1","68243a9bfdbe83139256a3d2","68243a9bfdbe83139256a3d3"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate whether the Miller blade laryngoscope could provide better visualization of the vocal cords in morbidly obese patients than the Macintosh blade laryngoscope. The secondary objective was to identify the patient-measured factors associated with better visualization of the vocal cords when using the Miller vs. Macintosh blade, as well as whether the application of external pressure might improve the visibility of the glottis during intubation. A prospective, observational study encompassing 110 patients with a BMI > 40 undergoing elective bariatric surgery and intubation procedure was performed. The evaluation of the vocal cords was performed according to the Cormack–Lehane scale and POGO scale in the same patient during intubation, performed with a Miller and a Macintosh blade laryngoscope, in a random matter. The following parameters were assessed: body weight, height, BMI, neck circumference, thyromental distance, sternomental distance, mouth opening, and Mallampati scale and their impact on visualization of the vocal cords using the Miller blade without the application of external pressure. The Miller blade provides an improved view of the glottis compared to the Macintosh blade measured with both the Cormac–Lehane scale (45 (40.91%) without external pressure application on the larynx, and 18 (16.36%) with external pressure application on the larynx) and the POGO scale (45 (40.91%) without external pressure application on the larynx, and 19 (17.27%) with external pressure application on the larynx). The application of laryngeal pressure improved the view of the glottis. Among the measured features, a significant improvement in the visibility of the glottis could be found in patients with a BMI over 44.244 kg/m2 and a neck circumference over 46 cm. To conclude, the usage of the Miller blade improves the visibility of the glottis compared to the Macintosh blade in morbidly obese patients. The recommendation to use the Miller blade in this group of patients requires further investigation, taking into account the effectiveness of the intubation.

The essential element of every XR environment, apart from the XR/3D content, is the domain knowledge encoded in the environment, which is expressed by the behavior of the content, including its autonomous actions and interactions with the XR users. Such knowledge covers the processes occurring in the environment, characteristics of its objects, and skills of the users. However, the available approaches to XR creation and usage focus on the sensory perception of XR, including its visual, haptic, and aural elements, and knowledge acquisition using human senses, but they do not enable knowledge acquisition based on automated reasoning and queries. It strongly limits the possibilities of knowledge discovery from XR, in particular on a massive scale in web based environments and repositories. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based model to 3D content behavior representation. The model permits generic representation of temporal properties of XR environments with domain terminology, which can be subject to semantic exploration with queries and reasoning. Our solution may contribute to broader and more efficient dissemination of knowledge using XR."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661611","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"121-138","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-43401-3_8#chapter-info","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63a12c397523402e061a7907","name":"Michał","lastName":"Śliwicki","uuid":"F24736958E2C8AE64C589F8D1310B442FF3A354E93BD960B302AF0DF16801169DE599B814747AE02FCBDE8DD11B445375F10CA8F8D3630DE23F64408C54FAD3F","orcidId":"0000-0002-1700-0416","documentHash":"47a3f5e2-1b8a-4e33-bc73-abe8050345aa"},{"objectId":"6115d9299543c757bc08285a","name":"Mikołaj","lastName":"Maik","uuid":"3C81243F42DFEA6A5D1F1D21A9BB359A0CDA42D90A3B05CE286D61B5774333C06D1C2CE2BEAE805556092498D07970EF45D78DBE479ABD6071508721F217D32E","orcidId":"0000-0002-9128-9617","documentHash":"4710db73-40e9-4a3f-9aae-b8ec91c2416c"},{"objectId":"5f0e79207523405869ccc28d","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Sobociński","uuid":"D9905D3B8055D676A7D9713D1BC8E6211EAD34BEAECC81BA636F5C02C962F5550EC8D39EAD4B50804E27B69846C43976C7936B9730CF3FC19C57B444F3FE0C8D","orcidId":"0000-0002-0529-252X","documentHash":"05d53923-06e5-426b-98d5-b3b23e71383d"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393adf","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Flotyński","uuid":"6C39E1AD432710E771077A2618B13156C60DBF120644AE8A6386BD9DBE0FE7BA81304DDB9C23540B5AD0093A8EAEA3DF52F3D5792879BF6B3465C9EF447CA123","orcidId":"0000-0001-5104-2022","documentHash":"77c47d15-cc07-4bf8-b975-a288a522520d"}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-43401-3_8"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Grassmann graph;","Conjugacy class of finite rank self-adjoint operators;","Graph automorphism;","Preserver problems"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","uid":"bvlnj9UhLKspSOqPkqrvdYA","uuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","parentUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","rootUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","name":"Uniwersytet w Białymstoku","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047390f2b","5e70922b878c28a047390f2a"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709217878c28a04738fcf4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Automorphisms of graphs corresponding to conjugacy classes of finite-rank self-adjoint operators","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478cf9","mniswId":"13654","title":"Linear Algebra and Its Applications","doi":null,"issn":"0024-3795","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"01dacaec-e939-4cc1-bd00-281ea498ec24"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-06-02","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"648724d44097077564aff5ce","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709217878c28a04738fcf4","5e70922b878c28a047390f2a","5e70922b878c28a047390f2b"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We consider the graph whose vertex set is a conjugacy class consisting of finite-rank self-adjoint operators on a complex Hilbert space H.

Three scenarios were considered using the following data sources: (1) RESONATE-2, (2) combined RESONATE-2/PHEDRA, (3) combined RESONATE-2/PHEDRA for 1L ibrutinib and PHEDRA for 1L CT/CIT-2L ibrutinib. Propensity score-based weights and inverse probability of censoring weighting were used to adjust for baseline (Scenarios 2 and 3) and time-dependent confounding (all scenarios), and to address potential biases.

Even though temperature is one of the most important abiotic stressors for plant development and production, a spike in the temperature may have disastrous repercussions for crop performance. Physiology and growth of two tomato genotypes ('Ahmar' and 'Roma') were studied in two growth chambers (25 and 45 °C) when gibberellic acid (GA3) was applied exogenously. After the 45 days of planting, tomato plants were sprayed with GA3 at concentrations of 25, 50, 75, and 100 mg L−1, whereas untreated plants were kept as control. Under both temperature conditions, shoot and root biomass was greatest in 'Roma' plants receiving 75 mg L−1 GA3, followed by 50 mg L−1 GA3. Maximum CO2 index, photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, and greenness index were recorded in 'Roma' plants cultivated at 25 °C, demonstrating good effects of GA3 on tomato physiology. Likewise, GA3 enhanced the proline, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels in the leaves of both genotypes at both temperatures. Foliar-sprayed GA3 up to 100 mg L−1 alleviated the oxidative stress, as inferred from the lower concentrations of MDA and H2O2, and boosted the activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase. The difference between control and GA3-treated heat-stressed plants suggests that GA3 may have a function in mitigating heat stress. Overall, our findings indicate that 75 mg L−1 of GA3 is the optimal dosage to reduce heat stress in tomatoes and improve their morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661621","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-15590-z","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6825050bfdbe83139258f2a5","name":"Rehab.

We examined the root anatomy of contact and long-distance exploration types in Pinus sylvestris and Quercus petraea, species with distinct ecological needs, across diferent soil horizons. Methods The diameter of ectomycorrhizal roots, the root absorptive traits i.e. proportion of cortex and mantle area, the percentage stele in the diameter, and the weighted average diameter of vessels (Ra) in the ectomycorrhizas were measured within ectomycorrhizas collected from organic and mineral soils across the soil profle. Results The absorptive traits varied along soil horizons, in which water and nutrient availability changed inversely. The proportion of cortex was associated with exploration type, but was not specifc to tree species. However, the ectomycorrhizal diameter and the percentage of mantle within the root forming contact exploration type of P. sylvestris showed no variation among soil horizons. In contrast, the soil horizon signifcantly infuenced all root anatomical traits in the contact exploration type of Q. petraea by enhancing the contribution of the absorption area of the root area, mainly in the illuvial horizon, but reaching the smallest value in the organic horizon. The Ra and the cell wall thickness of the vessels were strongly dependent on tree species. With increasing soil depth, Ra in Q. petraea increased, and stele proportion in root diameter decreased. Conclusion The results suggest that water acquisition traits difer among tree species, but traits associated with nutrient absorption (proportion of cortex and mantle area) within specifc soil horizons are closely related to the ectomycorrhizal exploration type."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661628","journalIssue":{"objectId":"667d6544fdbe830171767757","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"1256e011-67c1-449f-821e-7936e61e31ef"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11104-024-06971-6.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6824660bfdbe836c41b68015","name":"Lidia

are one of the most important sources for the discovery of new pesticides and drugs because of their chemical structural diversity and fascinating bioactivity as well as unique novel targets. Here, the effects of four mycotoxins, fumagillin, mevastatin, radicicol, and wortmannin, on photosynthesis were investigated to identify their precise sites of action on the photosynthetic apparatus of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Our results showed that these four mycotoxins have multiple targets, acting mainly on photosystem II (PSII). Their mode of action is similar to that of diuron, inhibiting electron flow beyond the primary quinone electron acceptor (QA) by binding to the secondary quinone electron acceptor (QB) site of the D1 protein, thereby affecting photosynthesis. The results of PSII oxygen evolution rate and chlorophyll (Chl) a fluorescence imaging suggested that fumagillin strongly inhibited overall PSII activity; the other three toxins also exhibited a negative influence at the high concentration. Chl a fluorescence kinetics and the JIP test showed that the inhibition of electron transport beyond QA was the most significant feature of the four mycotoxins. Fumagillin decreased the rate of O2 evolution by interrupting electron transfer on the PSII acceptor side, and had multiple negative effects on the primary photochemical reaction and PSII antenna size. Mevastatin caused a decrease in photosynthetic activity, mainly due to the inhibition of electron transport. Both radicicol and wortmannin decreased photosynthetic efficiency, mainly by inhibiting the electron transport efficiency of the PSII acceptor side and the activity of the PSII reaction centers. In addition, radicicol reduced the primary photochemical reaction efficiency and antenna size. The simulated molecular model of the four mycotoxins’ binding to C. reinhardtii D1 protein indicated that the residue D1-Phe265 is their common site at the QB site. This is a novel target site different from those of commercial PSII herbicides. Thus, the interesting effects of the four mycotoxins on PSII suggested that they provide new ideas for the design of novel and efficient herbicide molecules."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661630","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/12/3/665","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682504d5fdbe83139258f0a1","name":" Shiguo ","lastName":"Chen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7774bb46-c8c8-48a5-b094-78c4eef2ce68"},{"objectId":"682504d5fdbe83139258f0a0","name":"Reto Jörg","lastName":"Strasser","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7417d9a5-5d37-45dc-ad1d-b57a9d4a9411"},{"objectId":"682504d5fdbe83139258f09f","name":"Sheng","lastName":"Qiang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"348d5c14-b290-44e2-9cc4-1ae18dfae5c6"},{"objectId":"682504d5fdbe83139258f09e","name":"Xiaoxi","lastName":"Zhao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b4cd5d64-e751-420b-b319-1c04e2882962"},{"objectId":"682504d5fdbe83139258f09d","name":"Ying","lastName":"Chen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ad3a8c1c-9c66-4ca5-83b2-962f50b51b04"},{"objectId":"682504d5fdbe83139258f09c","name":"Yanjing","lastName":"Guo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0d7658c6-3fe3-4bc3-936a-6426e28a3cb9"},{"objectId":"682504d5fdbe83139258f09b","name":"Zhi","lastName":"Luo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"22886064-ab1c-4b75-90de-373dd9cc08a3"},{"objectId":"682504d5fdbe83139258f09a","name":"He","lastName":"Wang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ae482756-680c-4f54-bc3b-9b34b99a646b"},{"objectId":"682504d5fdbe83139258f099","name":"Mengyun","lastName":"Jiang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"725e4978-4fe4-42f4-bfe7-5b975746386b"},{"objectId":"682504d5fdbe83139258f098","name":"Jiale","lastName":"Shi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b9f6f715-e1fc-4644-8b87-5790e80f6dd0"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941bf","name":"Mohamed","lastName":"Kalaji","uuid":"E980832F46BD43DEC3B7BE0AF6953EFF6EFA2450F0F24597D0811CF571F4A5B08DE7D49F0E697901B7A39E422A74CF9108BC2BF9E4A67F966407BBFE73E43426","orcidId":"0000-0002-3833-4917","documentHash":"63337622-ec27-4520-9587-1f4a884fc748"}],"doi":"10.3390/plants12030665"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["water use efficiency","electron transport rate","photosystem II activity","fluorescence","gas exchange"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709259878c28a0473941bf"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Interactive effect of elevated CO2 and drought on physiological traits of Datura stramonium","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d6a","mniswId":"6863","title":"Frontiers in Plant Science","doi":null,"issn":"1664-462X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"63edd05b-dd39-481a-8e2f-46cd64784b8c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-26","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6825050efdbe83139258f2b2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6825050efdbe83139258f2b3","6825050efdbe83139258f2b4","6825050efdbe83139258f2b5","6825050efdbe83139258f2b6","6825050efdbe83139258f2b7","6825050efdbe83139258f2b8","6825050efdbe83139258f2b9","5e709259878c28a0473941bf","6825050efdbe83139258f2ba","6825050efdbe83139258f2bb","6825050efdbe83139258f2bc","6825050efdbe83139258f2bd","6825050efdbe83139258f2be"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations are known to influence the response\nof many plants under drought.

While drought stress had generally negative effects on the\naforementioned physiological traits of D. stramonium, it was found that\neCO2 concentration mitigated the adverse effects of drought and most of\nthe physiological parameters were sustained with increasing drought duration\nwhen compared to that with aCO2. D. stramonium, which was grown under\ndrought conditions, was re-watered on day 8 and indicated a partial recovery in\nall the parameters except maximum fluorescence, with this recovery being\nhigher with eCO2 compared to aCO2. These results suggest that elevated CO2\nmitigates the adverse growth effects of drought, thereby enhancing the adaptive mechanism of this weed by improving its water use efficiency.

An attempt was also made to assess minimal conditions for the development of soil microorganisms and mesofauna depending on the type of cover (reforestation/herbaceous vegetation/bare soil). Thirty sample plots were situated on three mainland categories–– i) plant cover vegetated mainly Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine stand category), ii) Betula pendula Roth (silver birch stand category), and iii) degraded area with bare soil (Bare_Central – in the central place of the plot and Bare_Edge usually 5.5 m from Bare_Central, Veg – 1 m from Bare_Edge). Basic soil chemicals (as pH, electrical conductivity EC, total sulfur S, total nitrogen TN, total organic carbon TOC), biological parameters (e.g. fungal and bacterial phospholipid fatty acids PLFAs, GRAM+, GRAM−, actinobacteria, total microbial biomass TM), and mesofauna density were analyzed to assess the level of contamination and colonization of the area by plants and soil fauna. The PLFA and the presence of soil microorganisms, always increased from a central point (Bare_Central) to an outer one (Bare_Edge) that was very close (about 1 m) to the vegetation (Veg). However, the highest biological parameters was found in Veg near the bare soil than in the stands with Scots pine. It was found that the highest microbiological biomass was positively correlated with the occurrence of vegetation. Mesofauna was limited by a high content of sulfur in the soil and high EC. Silver birch stands, through the larger and more favorable properties of plant litter, create conditions in which the growth of microorganisms is much greater than under Scots pine stands. On the other hand grasses area with single Scots pine was characterized by higher biological parameters than with the silver birch. In the plots with tree stands it was quite the opposite. To properly restoration this type of place, it is necessary to ensure the accuracy of the technical measures performed.

Traditional plant breeding is a time-consuming process that, depending on the crop, might take up to 25 years before an improved cultivar is available to farmers. This is a problematic technique since both beneficial qualities (such as pest resistance) and negative ones (such as decreased yield) can be passed down from generation to generation. In vitro cultures provide various advantages over traditional methods, including the capacity to add desirable characteristics and speed up the development of new cultivars. When it comes to oat (Avena sativa L.), the efficient method of plant regeneration is still missing compared to the most common cereals, possibly because this cereal is known to be recalcitrant to in vitro culture. In this review, an effort has been made to provide a succinct overview of the various in vitro techniques utilized or potentially involved in the breeding of oat.

Ecosystems of this kind date back to the Silurian (∼430 Ma) and in the Palaeozoic were built by now-extinct tabulate corals. Palaeozoic MCEs were recognized for the first time quite recently, and are still poorly known – only from isolated occurrences on the tropical shelves of palaeocontinents of Laurussia (Silurian, Middle Devonian), with a single example from Western Gondwana (Morocco, Middle Devonian). This study reveals a Lower Devonian (Emsian, ∼395 Ma) coral biostrome at Wee Jasper (New South Wales, Australia; Eastern Gondwana). The area has long been noted for its diverse, well- preserved fossil fish fauna, and the investigated beds, besides corals, are associated with many fish remains, mainly armoured fishes – placoderms. With about 70 species identified so far (placoderms, acanthodians, osteichthyans) this is the most diverse Devonian fish assemblage known to date. We identified a platy tabulate coral (a growth form adapted to low-light conditions) assemblage. Numerous anatomical features of corals (e.g., growth forms, corallite sizes) and fish (e.g., teeth adaptations for herbivory or durophagy) are directly comparable with modern taxa. Along with sedimentological data, the entire assemblage can be interpreted as a MCE. The description of the Wee Jasper MCE highlights numerous functional similarities between Palaeozoic and Recent mesophotic ecosystems, despite major taxonomical differences. Moreover, it suggests a broad distribution of MCEs on tropical shelves of Gondwana as early as the Early Devonian, evidencing proliferation of photosymbiotic, habitat-forming tabulate corals during the reef acme in the middle Palaeozoic. We propose the Wee Jasper MCE as the most complete Palaeozoic coral-fish ecosystem known to date."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661645","journalIssue":{"objectId":"68245445fdbe836c41b443fe","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"142","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"a8af84b0-cd54-4215-bf38-d1ad129ea239"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"142","pagesFromTo":"252-261","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1342937X25000887?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68245445fdbe836c41b44401","name":"Gavin C.","lastName":"Young","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f68860eb-a056-41e2-a2de-9923d71047ed"},{"objectId":"68245445fdbe836c41b44400","name":"John W.","lastName":"Pickett","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"76de7718-f4f6-4da0-b414-f74b48e5fc93"},{"objectId":"5e70935b878c28a0473a7e1b","name":"Mikołaj","lastName":"Zapalski","uuid":"722F8B574392DB467DBCDB1E0C6C414C4AE97261FA32E5BEBF35A7D036D2C348847CBE8EBCD947D8F7DD6900FBD8A2251780283A8F08E365D54E9C80A31C16EC","orcidId":"0000-0002-9853-3707","documentHash":"01b2b3e8-7c47-4f82-93fb-121e9b34f2b9"},{"objectId":"5e709355878c28a0473a7680","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Skompski","uuid":"A15E1684DFF72165E6EC3798615FA2E8D3AB8CC3A583E37418832CF970EE005C8DAA01CC38AE430219E6CB4482D66AA2F8ADFE250E2C7729FE53655FDCE0D3E0","orcidId":"0000-0002-8314-5533","documentHash":"b1e41a2c-b014-45bb-aed7-3f01c95b0096"},{"objectId":"5e709310878c28a0473a2361","name":"Błażej","lastName":"Berkowski","uuid":"D105E0A087A800F87579076FD607E6EDA7685B5B40E4E8B57FAFCB28F4426C121B653EA2C62C837957F8C37C3329AB90EB332E7A85CC124DC86E6148F3736341","orcidId":"0000-0001-7249-0182","documentHash":"4925d790-3eb7-4921-a67f-d5fac0a2098a"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.gr.2025.03.006"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["narzędzia statystyczne","wartość księgowa i rynkowa","analiza ekonomiczno-finansowa","GPW w Warszawie","akcje groszowe"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["penny shares","statistical tools","book and market value","economic and financial analysis","Warsaw Stock Exchange"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df65","uid":"bYRtGzh9xym5GV9-ekXsSdA","uuid":"b213d6cd-40ee-48c3-a97a-bc79941abd65","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de19","parentUuid":"5011bcd5-dfb1-41ed-84b0-5bd51ce0832c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de19","rootUuid":"5011bcd5-dfb1-41ed-84b0-5bd51ce0832c","name":"Wydział Ekonomiczno-Socjologiczny","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602c99e59543c7410626e09a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Analiza wartości rynkowej spółek groszowych notowanych na Giełdzie Papierów Wartościowych (GPW) w Warszawie","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a4dc","mniswId":"200486","title":"Studenckie Prace Prawnicze, Administratywistyczne i Ekonomiczne","doi":null,"issn":"1733-5779","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"205606fc-1fdd-4c2f-9503-f02f7a5e3c7c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2024-06-10","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682442dbfdbe83139256a566","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602c99e59543c7410626e09a"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Celem opracowania jest rozpoznanie wartości rynkowej spółek notowanych na GPW w Warszawie ze szczególnym uwzględnieniem tych podmiotów, których wartość księgowa na tyle przewyższa wartość rynkową, że ich akcje można uznać za groszowe.

The article includes own research, therefore the hypothesis was outlined that penny shares of companies listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, constituting their undervaluation in relation to the financial condition, create asig-nificant speculative buying signal for investors, causing an increase in the company’s value on the market in the long run. The conducted research includes an economic and financial analysis concern-ing the aspect of market value, as well as acomparative analysis and statistical measures. The obtained results showed that there was no clear speculative impulse to buy that would cause an increase in the company’s value on the market in the long run. However, despite the existing fluctu-ations in the studied areas, there is no basis for an unequivocal statement that the idea to invest in the so-called penny companies will be misplaced. At the same time, it should be borne in mind that this type of investment is associated with high risk, e.g. due to limited liquidity."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661648","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"47","pagesFromTo":"37-48","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://wuwr.pl/sppae/article/view/13967/14470","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602c99e59543c7410626e09a","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Lesiak","uuid":"F5672635FA993FA196467A53C238A3A053C11779283DE0318541F4E0CE933646310F4148863A9FF688A9083AF9F5F66B01B3C5AB920E091D51F4A5A345EC065D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e8af5746-5db2-4b01-8dd5-3bdea7d6967e"}],"doi":"10.19195/1733-5779.47.3"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["prusik, prusikowanie","szekla linowa","węzły samozaciskowe","węzły typu zaciskowego","węzły wspinaczkowe","wspinanie","zaczep cierny"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["clamp-type knots","climbing","climbing knots","friction hitch","prusik","prusiking","rope shackle","self-locking knots"]}],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Węzły wspinaczkowe typu zaciskowego na linach alpinistycznych oraz nowa szekla linowa - metody tworzenia i zastosowanie w technikach linowych","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"61b9ac03ad204581b62ebb25","mniswId":"201200","title":"Przegląd Włókienniczy - Włókno, Odzież, Skóra","doi":null,"issn":"1731-8645","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"2e2a646e-6897-4bf1-884a-b34321d57566"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"68247776fdbe836c41b7a508","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709200878c28a04738e680"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Przedstawiono konstrukcje wybranych węzłów wspinaczkowych typu zaciskowego, stosowanych do wspinania się po cięgnie lub cięgle.

Several new additions to the family of clamp-type knots are presented under the proposed names: “stopper clamp knot”, “corner loop” knot, and “single loop knot”. These can be created from a single, long rope without the need for cutting. Also discussed are designed and tested rope connectors, known as “flexible shackle” or “rope shackle.” Mathematical empirical formulas have been developed to estimate the length of the rope contained in a given knot. A developed mathematical formula for selecting ropes using clamp- -type knots is provided. The advantages and disadvantages of the presented knots are

diseases are one of the main factors limiting the cultivation of Capsicum annuum L. worldwide, causing yield losses of up to 80%. Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) is a prevalent virus affecting the quality and yield of pepper; however, the presence of other viruses has been also noticed. In this study, pepper fruits originated from retail chains, home gardens and greenhouses were analysed to determine the occurrence of viruses infecting sweet pepper crops in Poland. A total of 32 symptomatic and asymptomatic fruit samples were tested for the presence of: CMV, pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and potato virus Y (PVY). The presence of viruses in single and mixed infections, with a predominance of CMV, was confirmed. In addition, two symptomatic pepper samples that were negative in RT-PCR for common viruses were subjected to high-throughput sequencing and the presence of new viruses in Poland: bell pepper alphaendornavirus (BPEV) and pepper cryptic virus 2 (PCV2) in a mixed infection with other viruses was demonstrated. The presence of new viruses was verified in all tested samples and BPEV was the most prevalent. The phylogenetic analysis of the BPEV population showed that the Polish isolates are diverse and grouped within two clusters. Although BPEV does not pose a direct threat to pepper crops, its presence may cause changes in the physiology of the host, as well as may interact with other viruses in mixed infections."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661656","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"176","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682504e8fdbe83139258f174","name":"Beata","lastName":"Hasiów-Jaroszewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5b884302-cf69-4769-864b-4a20daf6a6c3"},{"objectId":"682504e8fdbe83139258f173","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Kaźmińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1838decb-1417-4db6-ad91-55e4666abc50"},{"objectId":"682504e8fdbe83139258f172","name":"Natasza","lastName":"Borodynko-Filas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0defc653-dc3a-4165-9629-571e803073fa"},{"objectId":"682504e8fdbe83139258f171","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Taberska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"940a9df5-3faf-47b0-b87d-a538421fbbc8"},{"objectId":"682504e8fdbe83139258f170","name":"Julia","lastName":"Minicka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"144f1ad5-1e65-478c-a9cf-33366c5b1ae8"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923a6","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Bartoszewski","uuid":"E07C76FACC8B4B9246E46D84EFCFC8031B384E5EA7DFFF790CEB794863183C004A59823F429282691D44BAE3BAB565C0F4D9A5C5BF8BCB15D5296C976FEA38E2","orcidId":"0000-0002-6197-770X","documentHash":"c5417dc6-62d0-4f08-a4e3-80bf246ac37b"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.cropro.2023.106478"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-66300-68-2","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb8","uid":"b7PvUaY5TWchofSOMfDP_aQ","uuid":"e4059d4a-c713-487c-aeb1-a2f4e0ff4e87","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb8","parentUuid":"e4059d4a-c713-487c-aeb1-a2f4e0ff4e87","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb8","rootUuid":"e4059d4a-c713-487c-aeb1-a2f4e0ff4e87","name":"Instytut Nauk Prawnych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ae878c28a04739a819"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Beyond the Law.

Rising temperatures and climate change may lead to increased evapotranspiration, specifically soil evaporation, causing water to evaporate and salt to accumulate in the soil, resulting in increased soil salinity. As a result, there is a need to evaluate methods for predicting and monitoring the effects of salinity on crop growth and production through rapid screening. Our study was conducted on 20 wheat genotypes, 10 sensitive and 10 tolerant, exposed to two salinity levels (90 and 120 mM NaCl) with the control under greenhouse conditions. Our results revealed significant differences in the genotypes’ response to salinity. Salt stress decreased chlorophyll index in sensitive genotypes but increased chlorophyll a and carotenoids in tolerant genotypes at 90 mM. Salt stress also increased protein, proline, lipoxygenase, and reactive thiobarbituric acid levels in all wheat genotypes. The study suggests that plant photosynthetic efficiency is a reliable, non-destructive biomarker for determining the salt tolerance of wheat genotypes, while other biochemical traits are destructive and time-consuming and therefore not suitable for rapid screening."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661660","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"1-25","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282606","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682504cefdbe83139258f05a","name":"Ahmed Fathy","lastName":"Yousef","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e6846823-731a-4cab-920a-61d82e56f1bb"},{"objectId":"682504cefdbe83139258f059","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Kociel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"69d463b4-decd-43e8-8219-9c47728eecc2"},{"objectId":"682504cefdbe83139258f058","name":"Sobhi F","lastName":"Lamlom","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"06e31f96-810a-4c95-a1f8-ad7a8388bdb0"},{"objectId":"682504cefdbe83139258f057","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Telesiński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5b155642-9378-4509-b516-281c4c3eea91"},{"objectId":"682504cefdbe83139258f056","name":"S","lastName":"Golkari","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"692865d5-9828-47c0-860d-1ae6e35baf5d"},{"objectId":"682504cefdbe83139258f055","name":"N","lastName":"Mahgdingad","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e40569bb-d950-4fec-8d9f-b7690250e2fc"},{"objectId":"682504cefdbe83139258f054","name":"B","lastName":"Fakheri","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"58aefcf0-61d4-4a72-a01d-e37c8dbcb9f9"},{"objectId":"682504cefdbe83139258f053","name":"M","lastName":"Solouki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"37ef1851-53c2-4177-979f-536fbe8c1ada"},{"objectId":"682504cefdbe83139258f052","name":"Amaneh Ghasemi","lastName":"Masarmi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3076d89a-190b-4dc5-9485-b1b56f48415d"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941bf","name":"Mohamed","lastName":"Kalaji","uuid":"E980832F46BD43DEC3B7BE0AF6953EFF6EFA2450F0F24597D0811CF571F4A5B08DE7D49F0E697901B7A39E422A74CF9108BC2BF9E4A67F966407BBFE73E43426","orcidId":"0000-0002-3833-4917","documentHash":"63337622-ec27-4520-9587-1f4a884fc748"}],"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0282606"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["tool wear classification","1-D CNN","tool condition monitoring (TCM)","long short-term memory (LSTM)","sequential features","milling processes"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709418878c28a0473b615b","5e709259878c28a047394189"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Tool Wear Classification in Chipboard Milling Processes Using 1-D CNN and LSTM Based on Sequential Features","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-3417","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ff202409-59bf-494e-82ae-6802b8fb2444"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-05-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682501dafdbe83139258e74f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709259878c28a047394189","682501dafdbe83139258e750","5e709418878c28a0473b615b"]},"issue":"11","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper presents the comparative analysis of Long short-term memory (LSTM) and one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1-D CNNs) for tool wear classification in chipboard milling processes. The complexity of sequence data in various fields makes selecting the right model for sequence classification very important. This research aims to show the distinct capabilities and performance nuances of LSTM and 1-D CNN models, leveraging their inherent strengths in understanding temporal dependencies and feature extraction, respectively. Through a series of experiments, the study unveils that while both models demonstrate competencies in handling sequence data, the 1-D CNN model, with its superior feature extraction capabilities, achieved the best performance, boasting an accuracy of 94.5% on the test dataset. The insights gained from this comparison not only help to understand LSTM and 1-D CNN models better, but also open the door for future improvements in using neural networks for complex sequence classification challenges."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661661","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/11/4730","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682501dafdbe83139258e750","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Świderska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c81760c2-6032-4174-b0fa-6adf192d8ef9"},{"objectId":"5e709418878c28a0473b615b","name":"Karol","lastName":"Szymanowski","uuid":"A7266288916471936DA59562A0CCE393277330B2A617F65B9C280B5107F914CA1AB983E3247D80068652DDA1CD994D5EC86A941D7A90A633BBA06BBD892DB767","orcidId":"0000-0003-0383-0897","documentHash":"3ced32ae-4205-486b-a67c-130c27d87c25"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a047394189","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Kurek","uuid":"93794B239F38A20F0C9E61192EAD2876CA54EA80C50F40C11675A4D8C2F0EAD12DC96F2D5D543B1ABA18EAEBBD9F114B57D82C3322D2FEC946A9B439C7EFA4A8","orcidId":"0000-0002-2789-4732","documentHash":"4e256ce2-f7ab-4c50-930a-ed3952d31bb7"}],"doi":"10.3390/app14114730"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63d8c6ee40970739948bf9e7","doi":null,"title":"Zbrodnie międzynarodowe w prawie krajowym wybranych państw,","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-67149-24-2","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://wydawnictwo.iws.gov.pl/produkt/zbrodnie-miedzynarodowe-w-prawie-krajowym-wybranych-panstw/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"24f7ecc6-0078-4c10-8224-dc6c5f35e0ff","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb857","mniswId":"37400","name":"Instytut Wymiaru Sprawiedliwości","documentHash":"8612fa11-7572-425a-b771-27595b83b1f4"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet Warszawski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935b878c28a0473a7edf"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df13","uid":"bKtjZT6qPD3d_ou1lCI-Heg","uuid":"64e6c5a1-1be6-4917-9d49-9dec59ed1713","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Nauk Politycznych i Studiów Międzynarodowych","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935b878c28a0473a7edf"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Trudności w penalizacji zbrodni międzynarodowych w prawie krajowym – uwagi wstępne","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63d8c74140970739948bfee0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70935b878c28a0473a7edf"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747261661665","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"7-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://wydawnictwo.iws.gov.pl/produkt/zbrodnie-miedzynarodowe-w-prawie-krajowym-wybranych-panstw/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70935b878c28a0473a7edf","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Grzebyk","uuid":"DF60FC40C89CE13EC0553581CC7381EC8BC9DFB759648E61E3E9ACED08FD3B532C8AAEAD0EACCCB2A2A035F9E73B244B1AA3C8BCA26DD0ED4E22325ED19FFA24","orcidId":"0000-0003-4022-7018","documentHash":"281f8e37-5d79-4217-982a-35a8e5a0be2f"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Antioxidants; Brassica napus L.; Carotenoids; Cold acclimation; Langmuir technique; Low temperature; Tocopherols"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","parentUuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","rootUuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

Warm breaks during/after cold acclimation disturb the natural process of acclimation, thereby decreasing frost tolerance and can even result in a resumption of growth. This phenomenon is called deacclimation. In the last few years, studies that are devoted to deacclimation have become more important (due to climate changes) and necessary to be able to understand the mechanisms that occur during this phenomenon. In the acclimation of plants to low temperatures, the importance of plant membranes is indisputable; that is why the main aim of our studies was to answer the question of whether (and to what extent) deacclimation alters the physicochemical properties of the plant membranes. The studies were focused on chloroplast membranes from non-acclimated, cold-acclimated and deacclimated cultivars of winter oilseed rape. The analysis of the membranes (formed from chloroplast lipid fractions) using the Langmuir technique revealed that cold acclimation increased membrane fluidity (expressed as the Alim values), while deacclimation generally decreased the values that were induced by cold. Moreover, because the chloroplast membranes were penetrated by lipophilic molecules such as carotenoids or tocopherols, the relationships between the structure of the lipids and the content of these antioxidants in the chloroplast membranes during the process of the cold acclimation and deacclimation of oilseed rape are discussed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661667","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66ea6f53fdbe836650abd5e7","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"214","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"6ab01fd5-11db-4073-9d58-04fa63e5e130"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"214","pagesFromTo":"id. 108961","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0981942824006296?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"634f612b752340623bbe65b6","name":"Julia","lastName":"Stachurska","uuid":"D7B67B968A9C73741D7A2881EEC65822F6FF86C9772B743CA7C1F521CEA5771C3BD25FEDC5909E46ABF3DF34D284B4C6F59654ED8A445FC3C945541FA324E05F","orcidId":"0009-0000-1778-9413","documentHash":"c9f4fe43-1e05-471c-a4b6-d239630209f1"},{"objectId":"5e7093f4878c28a0473b3d93","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Ryś","uuid":"40F0BA328F1DAA12171A4AC959407C375DE022AD28103C3F056138CD1F1BBAB5464D090BE708B649CBA0AEF02FCF784EF1DAEDCF45834D3F023C57625BB9CF26","orcidId":"0000-0003-1699-5842","documentHash":"cba2ce56-961f-45d4-924d-16d4c4759f69"},{"objectId":"5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b8b","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Waligórski","uuid":"8B54E8485603C415E496F59451595CCBE35689B6BA19295EBDE56501E8D467FBF73CA96D6F13EF52B549B06DFE0B3E64377C207AB57EC08153A87E420C817340","orcidId":"0000-0001-7511-6196","documentHash":"ee0b2ba8-1791-4c78-bb7d-39ba53b78ce5"},{"objectId":"5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b85","name":"Michał","lastName":"Dziurka","uuid":"C508B84A3E98AF91D4A7CF2B3F96DCF5CDDD04199D55EC6231120160D35F2346ADF8454B963FAF986327F88BE636B80D8617AF7648BCC065B4DC89242B986449","orcidId":"0000-0002-8265-6243","documentHash":"2fccdaa3-374f-450a-82fb-cb867a75d10a"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af1f7","name":"Anna","lastName":"Janeczko","uuid":"A703E1F8883D2BBAAA3650FAEBE0E2C5F8A98125E1069E381115C950E0BFF681058B5A0AB2DD6998E5D342E0C16EA294AF015892B6CD41044D3BE6C59446DBA6","orcidId":"0000-0001-6584-3250","documentHash":"19df622b-6efe-423c-bc99-fe31a63965ac"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a0473982f4","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Rudolphi-Szydło","uuid":"39817C47617937AE7C06C83CCB301EA03DD482B1B5BA9F6B4029CDABC3CE894D78A32A082AC2E9A9A1BEC56A47C268B10CD3D292B33093E1937A5ECDD0E7B5F9","orcidId":"0000-0001-6721-3703","documentHash":"6debe817-9af8-4b4a-9fb5-71550d91be7e"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398248","name":"Maria","lastName":"Filek","uuid":"4EEF5604128E483227CE3D632964F97E108E8DA2D7A0190654A048C3C2BD68DF3C89EAF0CCBADE34AB60D3CCD05C807EF1E8680B783C07A187F5952402E8FEDE","orcidId":"0000-0001-7259-8353","documentHash":"cfffe48a-8fc4-45d2-8496-761104fecdf0"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.plaphy.2024.108961"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["microspore embryogenesis; winter wheat; macro- and micronutrients; stress; antioxidants; hydrogen peroxide"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","uid":"bSdY7AtSClKNL0PqEtrSTTw","uuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","parentUuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0e","rootUuid":"8471ef1c-c23a-48a6-89be-6b4559037063","name":"Instytut Fizjologii Roślin im.

However, the process depends on complex interactions between many genetic, physiological and environmental variables, and in many cases, e.g., winter wheat, does not operate with the efficiency required for commercial use. Stress associated with low-temperature treatment, isolation and transfer to in vitro culture has been shown to disturb redox homeostasis and generate relatively high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), affecting microspore vitality. The aim of this study was to investigate whether controlled plant growth, specific tiller pre-treatment and culture conditions could improve the potential of microspores to cope with stress and effectively induce ME. To understand the mechanism of the stress response, hydrogen peroxide levels, total activity and the content of the most important low-molecular-weight antioxidants (glutathione and ascorbate), as well as the content of selected macro- (Mg, Ca, NA, K) and micronutrients (Mn, Zn, Fe, Cu, Mo) were determined. These analyses, combined with the cytological characteristics of the microspore suspensions, allowed us to demonstrate that an increased microspore vitality and stronger response to ME induction were associated with higher stress resistance based on more efficient ROS scavenging and nutrient management. It was shown that a modified procedure, combining a low temperature with mannitol and sodium selenate tiller pre-treatment, reduced oxidative stress and improved the effectiveness of ME in winter wheat

fibromas (CMF) are uncommon benign bone tumours, known for their moderate risk of local recurrence, that may manifest through various symptoms such as pain, swelling, tenderness, or be asymptomatic. Diagnosing CMF is challenging and requires a comprehensive, multidisciplinary diagnostic approach because the tumour frequently resembles numerous other bone lesions. This report describes a case of a 66-year-old female patient with a tumour in her right fibula. The initial diagnosis of a neuroma of the right tibial nerve was based on a magnetic resonance imaging scan. The lesion was surgically removed. Preliminarily subsequent histopathological evaluation identified the mass as a parosteal osteosarcoma. However, due to the uncharacteristic presentation of the tumour, further investigation was carried out. Using immunohistochemical and genetic analyses focused on the expression of MDM-2 and RB-1, along with an examination for alterations in the GNAS gene, the mass has been finally and conclusively identified as a chondromyxoid fibroma. This case demonstrates the ambiguity of the CMF presentation, the accurate diagnosis of which may frequently rely on additional diagnostic measures, including histopathology and targeted genetic tests. Furthermore, this report illustrates an atypical diagnostic journey, from an initial neuroma through a low-grade osteosarcoma, to a final benign chondromyxoid fibroma."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661671","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"28","pagesFromTo":"267-269","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/Diagnostic-challenge-in-chondromyxoid-fibroma-clinically-mimicking-neuroma,3,54977,0,1.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6824669afdbe831392576b34","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Jagodzińska-Mucha","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0b0a73b6-e730-4733-a434-040197f0cd50"},{"objectId":"6824669afdbe831392576b33","name":"Julia","lastName":"Sołek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"96e8d676-9cdf-4f1a-bed5-124fd8bed94b"},{"objectId":"6824669afdbe831392576b32","name":"Aleksandra Izabela","lastName":"Masłowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1d4407d6-50f1-41a2-9328-bad20884b609"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7d67","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Romańska-Knight","uuid":"2141AAF1142FA39570A986764FB70C1DE93F95CF64EC0BFC2E251271BF013CE3EA3E0AC01FDBE49BD1D4FAE5EA02A407FE88EDD42EB380AAA0B02F8172AFDC4D","orcidId":"0000-0002-2328-710X","documentHash":"dc4f1aa4-3edb-418d-a1a1-f7bb44bd6a4d"},{"objectId":"5e7092db878c28a04739e487","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Braun","uuid":"4362C3BD6F5C4B7880DB9ADA36261C30A52BAA5312920056E3E36AFDC661DD1206AF22B2931B5C40C6A2601EFCD3999713CFACDFED06AB6F75E9E227BB5E9E18","orcidId":"0000-0003-3804-7042","documentHash":"bc691c66-b511-4b97-9db4-84b47e9846b3"}],"doi":"10.5114/wo.2024.144081"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["środowiskowe","standardy ESG","raportowanie zrównoważonego rozwoju","strategia biznesowa","społeczne i zarządcze (ESG)","ramy ESG"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ESG frameworks","environmental","ESG standards","social","and governance (ESG)","business strategy","sustainability reporting"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c3458"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"ESG concepts in business practice.

To provide comprehensive spatiotemporal information about biological processes in developing seeds of cultivated barley (Hordeum vulgare L. subsp. vulgare), we performed a transcriptomic study of the embryo, endosperm, and seed maternal tissues collected from grains 4–32 days after pollination. Weighted gene co-expression network and motif enrichment analyses identified specific groups of genes and transcription factors (TFs) potentially regulating barley seed tissue development. We defined a set of tissue-specific marker genes and families of TFs for functional studies of the pathways controlling barley grain development. Assessing selected groups of chromatin regulators revealed that epigenetic processes are highly dynamic and likely play a major role during barley endosperm development. The repressive H3K27me3 modification is globally reduced in endosperm tissues and at specific genes related to development and storage compounds.

study examines the relationship between the reclamation method (with topsoil and with bare rock), individual species, and land cover (woodland, grassland, and forbsland) on micro-climate and retention properties, that is, volumetric water content (vwc) and water storage capacity (S). The large overburden dump “Sośnica” in Upper Silesia served as a research site, which makes it possible to investigate the planned experimental variants with relatively homogeneous properties of the deposited rock. The study uses statistical analysis and multilinear regressions to investigate the correlation between reclamation method, species, and land cover with parameters such as atmospheric temperature, relative humidity, vwc, soil temperature (st), and S. The experiments were carried out both in the field and in the laboratory. The results of this study indicate that the parameters related to retention properties were higher in the recultivated areas than in the areas left to natural succession. “S” was significantly higher in grassland and forbsland (15.67–16.52%) than in control plots where 10.23% was found, and in areas where an additional soil layer was applied (14.72%). Maximum vwc (22.17%) was on plots with topsoil than on bare rock (14.89%). Vwc were highest in the areas designated as grassland (28.54%), in comparison with woodlands and forblands (the control without vegetation cover had the worst thermal and retention properties). This study sheds light on the effects of reclamation method, species, and land cover on various parameters and helps to understand the importance of appropriate reclamation techniques for soil and water conservation. Further research on the impacts of reclamation techniques and land cover on micro-climatic conditions in diverse post-mining landscapes is crucial for developing globally applicable restoration strategies that promote ecological resilience."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661681","journalIssue":{"objectId":"681b2b85fdbe8356ff0848a2","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"35","number":"14","doi":null,"documentHash":"f7bcecdd-561e-403a-b407-8e2b52938619"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"35","pagesFromTo":"4343-4351","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ldr.5226","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61b961387523402a58cc08cb","name":"Pranav

Being an unexpected, undesired and life-threatening situation, preterm birth (PTB) is a stress-, anxiety- and depression-generating factor for women delivering prematurely. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between self-efficacy, coping strategies and perceived stress in mothers who experienced preterm birth and full-term birth, to determine the needs for personalized emotional support. Methods: The study was conducted among 251 women divided into the preterm birth group (PBG) and the full-term birth group (FBG). Data were collected using the following: (1) The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) Questionnaire, (2) Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) and (3) Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations Questionnaire (CISS), which were distributed online from January 2021 to June 2021. Results: Lower STAI scores were recorded in the preterm birth group (PBG) with high self-efficacy (HSE) when compared to the full-term birth group with HSE. CISS test scores were higher in PBG women with low self-efficacy (LSE) in comparison to women with LSE in FBG (p < 0.001). A positive and strong relationship (0.83; p < 0.05) was found between avoidance-oriented style and strategy of avoidance by engaging in surrogate activities and a positive moderate relationship (0.58; p < 0.05) with the style of looking for social contacts in PBG with LSE. Conclusions: The task-oriented coping style seems to be the most beneficial strategy for mothers, regardless of their preterm or term delivery, as focusing on specific activities increases the sense of self-efficacy and the anxiety level can decrease. Awareness of different styles of coping with stress and a sense of self-efficacy are necessary to plan personalized interventions for premature infants’ mothers."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661690","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/13/16/4945","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68243959fdbe83139256a319","name":"Michał","lastName":"Marczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"23bde41f-e477-469e-83f9-7e3c54648934"},{"objectId":"68243959fdbe83139256a318","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Kamecka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f7e15644-01ee-4d8d-a703-546c5ec97ba0"},{"objectId":"68243959fdbe83139256a317","name":"Anna","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8aa07da0-57ae-4fa2-a1b2-2f5e71bf8867"},{"objectId":"68243959fdbe83139256a316","name":"Agata","lastName":"Białas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8825fb53-7e1e-408c-a6b6-8e8482f33e25"},{"objectId":"5e709382878c28a0473ab870","name":"Remigiusz","lastName":"Kozłowski","uuid":"F832E132282C97AC12259F7DD0E8EF50F89CB12B8DBCF136731EDB2534EB2499AD7DB710E0D712F668FDD9FD2631827C46F680E3B44BF4760F90081EA4FD088F","orcidId":"0000-0003-2781-5341","documentHash":"2c2ceb20-fa37-4eb8-bc43-0e8a63ed33aa"},{"objectId":"5e7092e3878c28a04739ec24","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Rasmus","uuid":"D14626C97B877E98204A19A772B1302A02DBCA6E839DDA5F425FB5CF60C96F43CED4EBA242D30DCAAEBF5A9517FEDBCB291DB4B9CD7DBCD0250881B36D8A05E8","orcidId":"0000-0003-4887-130X","documentHash":"994a2889-09f0-41b0-89c4-8d12d9958b37"},{"objectId":"5e7092e2878c28a04739ea79","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Timler","uuid":"827EA791D9C93A42DC71263656F8F420D7329CB6C2DE31A7DBC823A30BEB2A1AF2E192B3C16CFDB0A0D25D49C64183DEB28EAD235D753ACF692D4E1D4E7D90B7","orcidId":"0000-0002-5415-5660","documentHash":"590f7d85-9486-4e72-a094-a52823d9b3f2"},{"objectId":"5e7092df878c28a04739e8ea","name":"Anna","lastName":"Lipert","uuid":"8FB0CEC4285C84C06085BD66FA907D8E6B02B1CBDEC40B6E618C26818DFD08A76C82A2D2A88888495642086DD9A255F368CE256A50AA396E2DE2F4CB6DBC6451","orcidId":"0000-0002-7727-0901","documentHash":"a1f380ab-8fac-4649-abf9-f9191b724142"}],"doi":"10.3390/jcm13164945"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","uid":"bIJt_NDqzpR2rNcRdakaG3g","uuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","parentUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de25","rootUuid":"521ce6da-8ebb-47a5-90fe-3832685b75f9","name":"Politechnika

purpose of the study was to determine the effect of the fuel used in the spark-ignition engine of the selected vehicle on the characteristics of maximum torque and power at the crankshaft of the engine as a function of crankshaft speed and the content of components in the exhaust gas. The vehicle engine was tested on a stand equipped with V-tech VT-2/B2 chassis dynamometer, MAHA MET 6.3 exhaust gas analyzer and engine parameter monitoring system using OBD standard. The tests used two commercial fuels with different test octane number (RON) values of 95 and 100 octanes. Measurement of the characteristics of the maximum torque, power on the crankshaft and the total power losses in the drive system, the contact of the wheels with the rollers of the dynamometer and the dynamometer as a function of the crankshaft rotational speed was carried out using the acceleration method with a dynamic load comprising the braking torque of the rotating masses and the electro-swirl brake. On the basis of the test results, engine and drive system parameters of the vehicle using the software for generating driving test runs “the calculation of gearshift points for the WLTC cycle”, a set of measuring points determining the values of the engine crankshaft speed and the torque generated by the engine crankshaft was determined. The parameters of the selected engine operating conditions are within the ranges specified by the software for generating the selected test runs. The content of selected exhaust gas components (carbon monoxide CO, carbon dioxide CO2, other hydrocarbons HC, oxygen O2, λ coefficient, nitrogen oxides NO and nitrogen dioxide NO2) was measured for the selected operating parameters of the vehicle for the tested fuels. On the basis of the results of the toxicity measurements, analytical models determining the content of individual components in the exhaust gases as a function of the crankshaft rotational speed and the torque generated on the crankshaft and software simulating the exhaust emissions of the selected vehicle moving under dynamic conditions were developed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661697","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"96-112","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.astrj.com/Analytical-computer-and-laboratory-modelling-of-the-effect-of-the-fuel-used-in-the,194144,0,1.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"68250386fdbe83139258ea3d","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Wąsowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6610ea8c-314d-410f-b5f2-410ddda377c4"},{"objectId":"68250386fdbe83139258ea3c","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Ruchała","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0dd066d4-f809-4b8d-a4f0-87939b66c9f3"},{"objectId":"68250386fdbe83139258ea3b","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Kulesza","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"979934e5-250e-4da8-bc70-b2549f745b1b"},{"objectId":"68250386fdbe83139258ea3a","name":"Remigiusz","lastName":"Mruk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c7114bd1-c2aa-4b9e-a1f9-e2a7172f6da6"},{"objectId":"68250386fdbe83139258ea39","name":"Olga","lastName":"Orynycz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3c70d332-d199-4c40-9110-496305251057"},{"objectId":"5e7093b7878c28a0473afad4","name":"Karol","lastName":"Tucki","uuid":"02D1D1D8B93325A8C1ACE38A4A5534CA76B2DDDF4CDA344C37E8EAD60120E1C6E85A62997333064C918C607B38C79DE24CA8DC7083EF7CE3B24ED9CDD095B7C0","orcidId":"0000-0001-7340-4100","documentHash":"2991d930-5814-4f05-829b-e5a816f37ddd"}],"doi":"10.12913/22998624/194144"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Hybrid drying","Spices","Pretreatments methods","Pro-healthy snacks","Vegetable snacks","Osmotic dehydration"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","uid":"bVev-Y5szMZ-h4bMC7PTglA","uuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","parentUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de36","rootUuid":"40ee9e13-51b8-4fde-b8b0-e9fb7505c3b9","name":"Szkoła Główna Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70923b878c28a0473921ed","682507defdbe83139258f84a","682507defdbe83139258f84b","682507defdbe83139258f84c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Development of drying and roasting processes for the production of plant-based pro-healthy snacks in the light of nutritional trends and sustainable techniques","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454799d5","mniswId":"19787","title":"Trends in Food Science and Technology","doi":null,"issn":"0924-2244","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"40b75573-7907-4980-b159-eee504bed756"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-05-20","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"682507defdbe83139258f849","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["682507defdbe83139258f84a","682507defdbe83139258f84b","682507defdbe83139258f84c","5e70923b878c28a0473921ed"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background: Snacks constitute a huge share of the food market. In recent years there has been a global change involving the implementation of sustainable food production techniques and an increase in consumer awareness of the impact of the food they consume on their well-being and health. There is an increasing interest in snacks with health-promoting properties, especially vegetables. This trend is reflected in the search for new, both thermal and non-thermal, technical solutions in the drying process. Scope and approach: The article describes a comprehensive review of changing methodologies for drying and roasting plant materials with supporting treatments, creating hybrid processes that have a significant impact on the quality of dried food and contribute to process optimization and energy savings. The use of microwaves, infrared, ultrasound, blanching, pulsed electric field, pulsed vacuum, and cold plasma, and also osmotic treatment/ enrichment, edible coatings are included. Key findings and conclusions: Combining hybrid drying methods, particularly those assisted by microwave, infrared, ultrasound, and vacuum, is effective in reducing drying times and maintaining high nutritional quality. Microwave, superheated steam, and infrared-hot air roasting prove efficient in achieving energy savings, retaining functional compounds, and enhancing sensory and nutritional value in roasted products. Selecting from a wide range of methods is crucial to ensuring the production of snacks with the desired properties, especially\nconsidering issues of dietary trends and sustainable techniques toward energy savings."}],"lastRefresh":"1747261661698","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"149","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924224424002292?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"682507defdbe83139258f84c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Ignaczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4ae39347-3121-4094-8595-5b85fc35997b"},{"objectId":"682507defdbe83139258f84b","name":"Mariola","lastName":"Kozłowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ff6c5212-92f4-4c20-b079-c759ea68542b"},{"objectId":"682507defdbe83139258f84a","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Chobot","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"92dc5b77-5ab7-4ff7-8a99-16f9be3d8050"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a0473921ed","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Kowalska","uuid":"921164A5AF64AB61ABB734CF7A43641240D3E37F236BC7ED79E2D1106DCE156F1A42F5CB1E9404CF0C06D32C282C4B6753354F03DB11CCFA459CB0B1A9D2FF52","orcidId":"0000-0002-6732-4590","documentHash":"4936e85e-b3d0-4795-8488-c5e2051b00ee"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.tifs.2024.104553"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzI2MTY2MTY5OA=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
