Multiplication of monoecious hemp varieties requires manual male plants rouging to keep a high share of monoecious plants in the population. It forces relatively small multiplication fields usually oscillating around 5 ha, where the use of big harvesting machines is not economically feasible. The B-800 mower prototype for hemp panicles proved to be a good alternative to harvest seeds of tall fibrous hemp. The test results of the mower analyzed in this study show that although seed loss on a moderate slope (0.37%) was significantly higher than on a flat slope (0.13%), it was still much lower than in the case of harvesting hemp seed with a combined harvester. Moreover, the field efficiency of 93% is very satisfactory as it is reported for much bigger machines. Finally, the harvesting costs proved to be much lower than most of the machines used for harvesting hemp seed"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058024720","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61d431cf2467f0627d077fec","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"f75e7399-5df9-48a8-bced-9ecdfd23d8d2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"185 (s. 1-11)","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/1/185/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62c796a8752340480571c999","name":"Francesco","lastName":"Latterini","uuid":"CACEB340446FB4D6658D01649C4614E61499A61641F167AFFBC6344D44E8291B61B43C50E527B5275449413154134E7EACD6FF854AACC44F14ACA9A37487CF08","orcidId":"0000-0001-7401-8754","documentHash":"7c970a18-8b3d-4160-8189-e32a1aab4e44"},{"objectId":"61e95b012467f0651ffdf738","name":"Luigi","lastName":"Pari","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3851-8625","documentHash":"590cb4f4-16d0-4a22-8654-2a8e0f53f826"},{"objectId":"61e95b012467f0651ffdf735","name":"Walter","lastName":"Stefanoni","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3696-574X","documentHash":"32d7b820-b025-48df-b09d-00b327e2048d"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c2d","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Baraniecki","uuid":"1FD1EE673239EC7DB52881812DCB93094FEF2B265AF24551848A3FDAFCAB9B64C600BFCA64566C282AEED2D2F53266EF1E4563E2B1081B242A1BE7AB9EE97A8A","orcidId":"0000-0002-3160-9017","documentHash":"7ec357a5-859c-45ec-bbcd-95e92f1c9dbf"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af790","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Wielgusz","uuid":"89E0E064299FD6E678B501F379F59DB71FD6ABE9030A6E4CD00D3A017C07C6F768177EE342E9696A145B341B1E6DD0DC8E4D795B96EBEF10A063E88D17678568","orcidId":"0000-0002-0241-3621","documentHash":"78333730-03b6-4a08-8766-5fee9e7176e7"},{"objectId":"5e7092cd878c28a04739d1d2","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Frankowski","uuid":"4BE246876D83EE034F0B2CB4521FA3068A508FF7B17C5A66BCC1037C411C4B3F3EFF2D9864EEA2A8B1E4511586502AAF490B77FCD0E005FBECF5AAF3EEBDE520","orcidId":"0000-0003-1657-9283","documentHash":"178a7602-e97a-4e84-b346-792fa0327fa9"}],"doi":"10.3390/agronomy12010185"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Jonizacja elektronowa (EI)","Nitroalkany","Nitrometan","Spektroskopia UV-VIS","Wzbudzenie dysocjacyjne"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","uid":"bz_6XXECFL3_CFkpms5BsDQ","uuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","parentUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","rootUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","name":"Uniwersytet w Siedlcach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709294878c28a04739845d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Dissociative Excitation of Nitromethane Induced by Electron Impact in the Ultraviolet – Visible Spectrum","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775fa","mniswId":"3528","title":"CHEMPHYSCHEM","doi":null,"issn":"1439-4235","eissn":null,"websiteLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/cphc.201800244","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"e6e62a6e-2272-4dc2-9ab4-088f0a6c295a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61ea5d462467f06f09db9573","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61ea5d462467f06f09db9575","61ea5d462467f06f09db9576","61ea5d462467f06f09db9577","61ea5d462467f06f09db9578","61ea5d462467f06f09db9579","5e709294878c28a04739845d"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The excitation of nitromethane (CH3NO2), which is an important propellant and prototypic molecule for large class of explosives, has been investigated by electron impact and subsequent emission of photons in the UV-VIS spectral region between 300 nm and 670 nm.

Very mild reaction conditions, an absence of the heavy toxic metals, simple procedure as well as high chemoselectivity makes the established protocol desirable for academia and pharmaceutical industry laboratories."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058024953","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e07bcf2467f03439b22bba","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"25","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"55db1738-bfa0-4384-ab46-436a96e49ede"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"25","pagesFromTo":"100576","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S2352554121002035?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebee117752340254fc4366f","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Kęciek","uuid":"5201E39764E519F27E974922D02AD3FCE22BB9408F7FAD7DC733381B52B8B16575A0EE93AB25AE8EF32D17E340641BF316EEFFC8BA2EB2F9CFEFDAE561321BA8","orcidId":"0000-0002-8787-7133","documentHash":"80aac41b-bc41-4f58-997a-0bba90b31096"},{"objectId":"5e7093e8878c28a0473b3140","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Paprocki","uuid":"14620124F1E9C8E43A30884C37D70F5775DEC8E5AC95136A10D8F93250BE6C6ACF8F53B46214FDD0254404D6385E633A07982C2E4521C4FBD2F45837B28E7FB1","orcidId":"0000-0002-2144-7317","documentHash":"4ae21f22-dea1-4985-a97f-b60a67c78785"},{"objectId":"5e70937a878c28a0473aa8ee","name":"Dominik","lastName":"KOSZELEWSKI","uuid":"2947078B50E34A7D1BFDB977E8A851CD9DCE94E44D274F6842DAF74ADDB38432581ADEF4497E02FA95EEF37A2C82AB458A812BD09D71C3C36C40506524938E37","orcidId":"0000-0003-0968-3330","documentHash":"ddcb5e64-fc5e-4faf-83ee-bc6fcdc83a2b"},{"objectId":"5e709378878c28a0473aa8b7","name":"Anna","lastName":"Brodzka","uuid":"A6077477361BF342AE3057D19A5271B322EB406C1E75561F6D72E6B4BB6EEE2E3733F455DAA07BDB9912A352E6CBED411AC61436B6D0AE3999615201008A70BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6659-0758","documentHash":"b777f696-fa02-47a9-884c-aef463281ac1"},{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9ba3","name":"Monika","lastName":"Wilk","uuid":"DD4837EC497A1CD0CBBA1C6299BB5CB760D904F523E779863A7E32325D4981BF37642202D17AC65CD92372BCD0EFB1A68191546C632C0A902A776291D98A2F32","orcidId":"0000-0003-1939-0048","documentHash":"62c2765f-8f47-4300-bf83-6418d86dc3fc"},{"objectId":"5e7092cf878c28a04739d30e","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Ostaszewski","uuid":"6D1241AFAD1EF3C56F8F5075BFC67FDBC4BDF8A66E25673E62E0351D5FA26BDF9276C0FC4A76C12318015E4FDD5CD54B29AE4DBD572B105B1425EE354556E697","orcidId":"0000-0002-3032-196X","documentHash":"3713110c-9a7b-4b90-b1eb-f9c7794a7a3b"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.scp.2021.100576"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["odruch gardłowy, odruch wymiotny, definicja, ocena"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["gagging, gag reflex, definition, assessment"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de54","uid":"bGdC_bzKT-HVRZ9O1mobrEA","uuid":"1c749f42-2a28-46f6-a59f-63d4e8541713","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de54","parentUuid":"1c749f42-2a28-46f6-a59f-63d4e8541713","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de54","rootUuid":"1c749f42-2a28-46f6-a59f-63d4e8541713","name":"Pomorski Uniwersytet Medyczny w Szczecinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61e94d3d2467f0651ffcc93a","61e94d3d2467f0651ffcc93b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Odruch gardłowy – definicja, mechanizm, etiologia i metody oceny","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"64f04bfacf9a7471b0ea4143","mniswId":"201742","title":"Magazyn Stomatologiczny","doi":null,"issn":"1230-0888","eissn":"","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"85a2e854-7465-4dea-876d-41940388d59f"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":true,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61e94d3d2467f0651ffcc938","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61e94d3d2467f0651ffcc93a","61e94d3d2467f0651ffcc93b"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Odruch gardłowy jest często spotykany w praktyce stomatologicznej.

The experiment was designed as the first stage of research leading to the development of a method for decorticated flax fiber elementarization and cottonization; in particular, effectively dividing the fiber bundles to ensure low linear density and reducing impurities in the content, to make the fibers suitable for cotton spinning systems. The degumming process of the decorticated fibers covered hydrodynamic disposal of the gluing substances, mainly pectins from the fibers, with use of a specially designed lab-scale Model Device for Physical Degumming of the Flax Fibers. The degummed fibers were tested for linear density, length, impurity content and chemical composition by thermogravimetric analysis combined with the analysis of evolved gases (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) and analysis of images of fiber cross-sections and longitudinal views from a scanning electron microscope. The study outcomes allowed us to determine the optimal parameters of the degumming process applied for decorticated flax fibers, in which the obtained fibers were of the highest quality. It was found that the optimal parameters of the process were a bath temperature of 30°C and a degumming process duration of 24 hours. These lab-scale process conditions were used in further work on the degumming process of flax fiber carried out on a semi-technical scale, followed by a mechanical cottonization of the fiber, at the final stage of the technological

stuleci zarówno w żeńskich, jak i w męskich klasztorach prowadzono kroniki. Na ich kartach opisywano najważniejsze wydarzenia z życia poszczególnych wspólnot zakonnych, całego Kościoła oraz lokalnych wspólnot. Wobec wydarzeń politycznych nie byli obojętni klasztorni kronikarze. Szerokim echem na kartach kronik odbijają się wydarzenia wojenne – zapewne z powodu tragizmu, ogromu nieszczęść i zła, które niosły wojny, powstania i rebelie. W spokojne życie opactw, klasztorów i zakonnych domów wydarzenia polityczne, które docierały tam niekiedy z opóźnieniem, wnosiły niepokój; wywoływały też komentarze i dyskusje. Ich reminiscencje odnajdujemy na kartach kronik. Po latach czytamy je z zainteresowaniem i traktujemy jako osobliwe świadectwo lat minionych.\nNiniejsza publikacja rozpoczyna serię krytycznych edycji źródłowych, których podstawę wydawniczą stanowią fragmenty kronik klasztornych z terenów byłej Galicji opisujących wydarzenia z lat 1918–1920. Przedsięwzięcie wpisuje się w obchody stulecia odzyskania przez Polskę Niepodległości oraz wojny polsko-bolszewickiej.

It was observed that the chemical composition of waters in post-exploited reservoirs and wetlands is determined by the type of rock that is\nbeing exploited. The hydrological conditions (the degree of hydration of the excavation, the morphometric parameters of water body, etc.) also contribute to the type of vegetation and the direction\nof spontaneous succession in post-exploited areas. The proper choice of reclamation should be performed using a modified succession that is adapted to specific hydrological-hydrochemical conditions. In the case of flow-through-containers, it should provide a good quality of water using special\ntechnical solutions, i.e. an Olszewski tube. The rehabilitation of slurry clarifiers in which sand is\na waste requires a modified succession and the use of stress-tolerating plants that can grow under\nconditions in which there is a lack of water and low fertility of the substratum such as a forecrop.\nThe vicinity near post-exploited water bodies and excavations on limestone ought to undergo reclamation into wetlands or artificial water bodies due to the flooding of the floor of excavation.

The H:L ratio (heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio) is a hematological index that allows for the assessment of the stress induced by environmental changes, including weather conditions. In this paper, we examined the influence of temperatures and the sum of precipitation on the health of nestling pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) by using the H:L ratio reflecting the body’s response to stress. All examined temperature indicators influenced the H:L ratio, yet the average value of daily minimum temperature during the first 12 days of nestling life had the strongest influence, maximum temperature had the weakest effect, while precipitation had no significant influence. Our research indicates that even a small increase in temperature caused a stress reaction in nestling pied flycatchers, which was reflected by an increase in the H:L ratio.

recent years, cinematography and other digital content creators have been eagerly turning to Three-Dimensional (3D) imaging technology. The creators of movies, games, and augmented reality applications are aware of this technology’s advantages, possibilities, and new means of expression. The development of electronic and IT technologies enables the achievement of a better and better quality of the recorded 3D image and many possibilities for its correction and modification in post-production. However, preparing a correct 3D image that does not cause perception problems for the viewer is still a complex and demanding task. Therefore, planning and then ensuring the correct parameters and quality of the recorded 3D video is essential. Despite better post-production techniques, fixing errors in a captured image can be difficult, time consuming, and sometimes impossible. The detection of errors typical for stereo vision related to the depth of the image (e.g., depth budget violation, stereoscopic window violation) during the recording allows for their correction already on the film set, e.g., by different scene layouts and/or different camera configurations. The paper presents a prototype of an independent, non-invasive diagnostic system that supports the film crew in the process of calibrating stereoscopic cameras, as well as analysing the 3D depth while working on a film set. The system acquires full HD video streams from professional cameras using Serial Digital Interface (SDI), synchronises them, and estimates and analyses the disparity map. Objective depth analysis using computer tools while recording scenes allows stereographers to immediately spot errors in the 3D image, primarily related to the violation of the viewing comfort zone. The paper also describes an efficient method of analysing a 3D video using Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). The main steps of the proposed solution are uncalibrated rectification and disparity map estimation. The algorithms selected and implemented for the needs of this system do not require knowledge of intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters. Thus, they can be used in non-cooperative environments, such as a film set, where the camera configuration often changes. Both of them are implemented with the use of a GPU to improve the data processing efficiency. The paper presents the evaluation results of the algorithms’ accuracy, as well as the comparison of the performance of two implementations—with and without the GPU acceleration. The application of the described GPU-based method makes the system efficient and easy to use. The system can process a video stream with full HD resolution at a speed of several frames per second."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058027720","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61dc529f2467f07650dd624d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"22","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"508a05c7-31cf-4dee-ac37-d4b6989c5081"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"471","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/2/471/htm","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64755faa40e3ff6728fdc540","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Mielczarek","uuid":"C49DF5D26C75EF90590BFDB19F79FC21E1FC0732202D8EFDF75AD7543F6C45CD3581DD9CA64820D325CD9358A6AB15DE531CDBFE668FC5AD3E145446F14389DC","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6eafb136-7286-4779-a270-00321b4d8d86"},{"objectId":"5e709466878c28a0473bc2b5","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Perek","uuid":"0F55CA6A0C8B1C70C97C0BB71DE3234EC68F815EEDE21BAC5D738A533A269D8B81DD554AB11DDC2EA558E79E72DF8E093A715158C755BECC8FC8BBCEE5414BEF","orcidId":"0000-0002-7531-2960","documentHash":"c3df80ed-d61c-4a17-9b3d-d1c9a90c1ed3"},{"objectId":"5e709335878c28a0473a4e6b","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Makowski","uuid":"4D92003D4E09765660F807620189C6903C33F94C7CAEDDF5CFC0061401EF4EB1DA9EE14F1526E2ADFF597B9AB60EDEA90D9EF248949FF7AFC6A18C4A95FB27CA","orcidId":"0000-0002-6392-090X","documentHash":"6dfbd242-cfb9-4371-898a-3ca1874b40ea"}],"doi":"10.3390/s22020471"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Planer knives","Regeneration process","Grinding burns","Surface morphology quantification","Surface roughness"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","uid":"bnV99khMVeG3t9dh4evZESg","uuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","parentUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","rootUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","name":"Politechnika Koszalińska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709419878c28a0473b635b","5e7092ae878c28a04739a9b0","5e7092ae878c28a04739a82a","5e7094af878c28a0473c19f5","5e7092ae878c28a04739a9af","5e70942b878c28a0473b77fc"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Influence of regeneration process parameters on geometry and defects of clearance surface of planer knives used in wood planing process","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547718d","mniswId":"1653","title":"Archives of Civil and Mechanical Engineering","doi":null,"issn":"1644-9665","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"f2d4565f-3296-4379-8181-4065c798b805"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-13","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61e120952467f00328be0220","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ae878c28a04739a9af","5e7092ae878c28a04739a9b0","5e70942b878c28a0473b77fc","5e709419878c28a0473b635b","5e7094af878c28a0473c19f5","5e7092ae878c28a04739a82a"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A properly implemented strategy regarding the planer knife regeneration process, may not only restore the original cutting ability of the tool, but even increase its operational quality, including its durability for industrial woodworking processes. This article presents experimental results and discussion in respect of sharpening planer knives with cubic boron nitride grinding wheels. Both the grinding conditions and machining surface quality were analyzed. Application of improper size or loads of abrasive grains may lead to the appearance of grinding burns on a machined surface, or result in a surface with cracks and grooves. The results of the measurements carried out indicate that surfaces with reduced values of roughness and waviness parameters can be obtained, even up to 22% (as in the case of the reduced peak height parameter, Spk) in relation to new knives, prepared at a factory. The value of St and Sds parameters are almost the same as reference knife (deviation up to 3%). Due to machining marks, the total waviness exceeds 33%. Our research also shows that due to the technological quality of the knife surfaces, it is beneficial to use CBN grains with a low depth of cut (ae no more than 0.02 mm), but a moderate or high feed rate (the best choice is about 470 mm/min for vft). Presented results constitute an important know-how for the grinding process with the use of grinders used by operators (like WEINIG Rondamat 980) during the sharpening of planer cutter heads in the wood industry."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058027772","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e120952467f00328be0229","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"22","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"6d7d2371-00fd-4c6d-bb1f-119e2314e1d5"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs43452-021-00332-1","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094af878c28a0473c19f5","name":"Adam","lastName":"Gilewicz","uuid":"C7682ECB8BBF7DDA242D0307A3A85DD1705AEA656610AD501F27720610F08340F836151239F00C37906FF9FAA44FD3AE6317061A4C7C64865C203B156EAF119A","orcidId":"0000-0003-4061-4333","documentHash":"90310eb0-5864-48a5-93d6-b5667f03c6b3"},{"objectId":"5e70942b878c28a0473b77fc","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Sutowska","uuid":"E0AADCC3E6829E93C23107983D5E3920E2628CBAAA8531AA45F5890890F48435C7DAA92209A69F46F1C4D071CE3319EA654C4118C1346CC86A8058A475A5ABC7","orcidId":"0000-0003-0321-0022","documentHash":"3aa930ca-2bb7-4c7f-be80-ef7f95236607"},{"objectId":"5e709419878c28a0473b635b","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Myśliński","uuid":"5AD0975FEF86B4A6E62AB04BF0AAD02F741F95CF14DF80A899056465547351DFDE716E774E471C0D0287D58EB9B41BD2F7AEC7C1FD986AD1478FCD1A562FC470","orcidId":"0000-0001-5032-1652","documentHash":"2768dbec-0961-4383-ae94-d1cf4df464fb"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a9b0","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Nadolny","uuid":"16097EA55E08AB73C9F4F287F5E968183BFCE585664FD297C4C91DE777E7163195A51903DFA1DFEB183DB0237987DAE2810D57C3B966F2A926012AC20303A486","orcidId":"0000-0002-2753-2782","documentHash":"9ccc10dc-ea0a-4555-b98a-5978663b4696"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a9af","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Sutowski","uuid":"D7A9CB19273EB5D6DAE05784BBC069CDFE839272DDB0D25709D50D63440CD0E8ACBBABA5E02A0AEA33E9E0739048BF5150D3D82B9C8E30FAB2DC234569616724","orcidId":"0000-0003-2863-5414","documentHash":"eae256db-ff39-4b37-b6bc-7c01962660ae"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a82a","name":"Bogdan","lastName":"Warcholiński","uuid":"553AC49D84C6EDC1468B96A21A604EF56ADAE36780306C550A063568BAD1C8531E0BB0E6E8CABF999F011A1F41413B8779EDD473CE614449A6B73FB334C7B42E","orcidId":"0000-0001-5331-8539","documentHash":"2822489d-7069-4b80-b9aa-936cb39bd564"}],"doi":"10.1007/s43452-021-00332-1"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["biologia mszaków","ekologiczna rola mszaków","mchy","wątrobowce","siedliska poprzemysłowe"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Bryophyte biology","ecological role of bryophytes","mosses","liverworts","post-industrial habitats"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"61dc21d32467f07650c783d6","doi":"10.1201/9781003271604","title":"Green scenarios : mining industry responses to environmental challenges of the anthropocene epoch : International Mining Forum 2021","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-1-032-22212-7","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/edit/10.1201/9781003271604/green-scenarios-mining-industry-responses-environmental-challenges-anthropocene-epoch-artur-dyczko-andrzej-jagodzi%C5%84ski-gabriela-wo%C5%BAniak?refId=4ba9c67f-7b75-4349-86bf-d486a4a8140d&context=ubx","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"03f13995-15a6-41eb-baa4-36496cd225eb","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb7c9","mniswId":"20200","name":"CRC Press / Balkema","documentHash":"2a6ef8b6-bb62-46c9-82bd-63632e7f90e5"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de35","uid":"bbhWY-GzmS7IoRMQpyKKYhw","uuid":"ea6c2a5f-cea7-406c-84ca-cb69452fa94e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de35","parentUuid":"ea6c2a5f-cea7-406c-84ca-cb69452fa94e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de35","rootUuid":"ea6c2a5f-cea7-406c-84ca-cb69452fa94e","name":"Uniwersytet Bielsko-Bialski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091ff878c28a04738e5f0"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Bryoflora of post-industrial areas in Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61dc22ac2467f07650c82e84","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7091ff878c28a04738e5f0"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A list of bryophyte species occurring in different types of post-industrial areas in Poland is presented.

A total of 410 mothers of children with autism (mean age 39.03, SD 7.42) completed four questionnaires: Parental Burnout Measure (PBM-12), International Personality Item Pool—Big Five Markers (IPIP-BFM-20), Flexibility and Cohesion Evaluation Scales (FACES-IV), and a survey on childcare difficulties. Path analysis using two predetermined models was used to examine the interrelations. Both models fit the empirical data equally with a Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) index of 0.000 and a 90% confidence interval (model 1: 0.000–0.052; model 2: 0.000–0.059). Path analysis revealed similar fit indexes for both models: (a) burnout is a mediator between exogenous variables and family functioning, and (b) family functioning is an indirect mediator between exogenous variables and burnout. These findings suggest that increased maternal emotional instability (neuroticism) and conscientiousness can lead to increased family communication problems, which may further lead to a breakdown of the equilibrium in the family system, resulting in the mother’s dissatisfaction with family life and a consequent increased risk of maternal burnout."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058030078","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61eaa9aa2467f06f09e1bc9d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"19","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"2459da2e-8a6b-461b-a1c9-c173120520ea"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"ID Article 1187","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/3/1187","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61eaa9aa2467f06f09e1bc99","name":"Iris","lastName":"Manor-Binyamini","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3c5b13af-2526-4bc9-8729-6832eb707ec8"},{"objectId":"5e70937f878c28a0473ab33a","name":"Błażej","lastName":"Cieślik","uuid":"4CCD507CAC1A72A204F7D0BCDE6A5E3C44B474605101C4F872930DDE7FA4CB10099AC4E16F4844381722048C0501DA8C32D3DBCBA4C923FDDCC86C64323FA980","orcidId":"0000-0001-7275-7860","documentHash":"a944e3ea-d966-4f4d-833a-4dcc326d7fed"},{"objectId":"5e70926d878c28a047395740","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Boroń-Krupińska","uuid":"9E6F8E3C572F0A6AE633C230ED7AFB040254BFC7DADA7DDB6418D22B313DCD073A7BE8745CA61B19466B7C74D9D339FA9AE673E280453891236A25CAA8BD4760","orcidId":"0000-0002-1710-7547","documentHash":"eb9b24b2-d25c-4efb-8776-931a5231db04"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047394ff7","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Sekułowicz","uuid":"1C0AB475F4B8058D685979A3253399B02C28E379624BCC239479590AB619BB9AC35F56BFE7548681848C6945794563E2D97EC87A596B5795A173DA17A11CBA97","orcidId":"0000-0002-8702-3349","documentHash":"a2fcca6b-5fd9-4591-bdaa-a2e4bc769a5e"},{"objectId":"5e70922f878c28a047391575","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kwiatkowski","uuid":"28E64F7F8CB2F93A7F2AF89AEA4927DB162BA459263873D628E96911DB068D1C17BF154AD5C7D1D0EE00B0AE7CB9CD6780FAD7F43CE5D0ACC4D339E20B20C6E0","orcidId":"0000-0002-4283-0278","documentHash":"65bca1a6-ab35-4aea-8fb8-f19b063f9deb"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19031187"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["healthy food choices","sustainable food consumption","organic products","COVID-19","information sources","buying motives"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091be878c28a04738758c","uid":"bMw2GI7iI3tW4yrhIZnPlyw","uuid":"b34e58bd-9a66-4ca8-9e42-c6cc0fa05453","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Katedra Herbologii i Technik Uprawy Roślin","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70925e878c28a047394899"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6e","uid":"bQeipS4MvQr1wvpe3eSfkxA","uuid":"ce9d174a-cb81-4f87-9171-977021bb017c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Ekonomiczny","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5e32","5e7092f8878c28a0473a03e8","5e7092f8878c28a0473a03f4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Comparison of the purchasing behaviour of polish and United Kingdom Consumers in the organic food market during the COVID-19 pandemic","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","doi":null,"issn":"1661-7827","eissn":"1660-4601","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e236e16e-7430-4ac3-800c-033637860e22"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-20","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61eac6d32467f00287670ead","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70925e878c28a047394899","5e7092f8878c28a0473a03f4","5e7092f8878c28a0473a03e8","5e709342878c28a0473a5e32","61eac6d32467f00287670eb4"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The main objective of the study was to compare young consumer purchasing behaviour towards organic food in Poland (PL) and the United Kingdom (UK), countries with different levels of organic market maturity. The study was conducted by means of an online survey questionnaire during the COVID-19 pandemic between December 2020 and February 2021. The sample consisted of 862 PL and 161 UK consumers. 31% of PL respondents and 58.4% of UK respondents indicated they purchase organic products. Descriptive statistics, the Mann–Whitney U test and the two proportion Z test were used for statistical analyses. The results indicate that young consumers pay particular attention to the freshness and quality of consumed products. Concern for their own health and that of their loved ones, as well as the desire to eat better-quality products were the main motivations for the respondents to purchase organic products. Organic vegetables and fruits, eggs, dairy products, and meat and meat products, were among the most frequently purchased products in the studied cohorts.

Despite progressive fibrosis of the vasculature, compensatory angiogenesis is impaired. The cause of the shift towards anti-angiogenesis observed in SSc is unknown. The IL-17 cytokine family participates in the pathogenesis of SSc and angiogenesis.\r\n\r\nMaterial and methods:\r\nOur study aimed to evaluate levels and find relationships between the levels of proangiogenic cytokines and cytokines from the IL-17 family in 42 SSc subjects and 20 healthy controls. VEGF, PlGF, HGF, TGFβ1, GM-CSF, IL-17A, IL-17B, IL-17E and IL-17F were quantified in the sera of all participants by ELISA sandwich kits.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nSignificantly higher mean concentrations of PlGF compared to controls - mean value (19.3 pg/ml in the SSc group vs. 11.4 pg/ml in the control group; p<0.001) and of HGF (1931 pg/ml in the SSc group vs. 1483 pg/ml in controls; p<0.05). Mean serum TGFβ1 level was also significantly lower in the SSc group (781 pg/ml) than controls (35991 pg/ml; p<0.001). Among the IL-17 family, significantly higher mean concentrations of IL-17B (67.0 pg/ml vs. 2.6 pg/ml in controls; p<0,001), IL-17E (8.0 pg/ml vs 0.64 pg/ml in controls; p<0.001) and IL-17F (0.42 pg/ml vs. 0.0 pg/ml in controls; p< 0.01) were detected. Serum concentrations of HGF and PlGF correlated with the concentrations of IL17A, IL-17B, and IL-17E.\r\n\r\nConclusions:\r\nIn conclusion, our findings indicate that selected cytokines from the IL17 family participate in the pathogenesis of SSc and are responsible for the vascular abnormalities associated with this disorder."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058030362","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.archivesofmedicalscience.com/Interplay-between-IL-17-family-members-and-angiogenic-cytokines-in-subjects-with,128102,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"659403634097076c148c525e","name":"Jarosław ","lastName":"Bogaczewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"327a6aa9-b908-4f75-ba0c-1a559eb48a28"},{"objectId":"659403634097076c148c525d","name":"Bożena ","lastName":"Dziankowska-Bartkowiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fda4271a-64fb-4399-880e-e07b8f0d956a"},{"objectId":"659403634097076c148c525c","name":"Zofia ","lastName":"Gerlicz-Kowalczuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a8bafcb4-081d-4e7e-9442-67a546b85702"},{"objectId":"5e7092e1878c28a04739e9d7","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Robak","uuid":"B298532BF44DB38E5B3F8BC1343842CFF63022E7695677531A59EC3A0F4A669E45807FD0608F03FD259BB84CACBB3979E6D2FED7D0A14F3A0EA95E982E92C24D","orcidId":"0000-0002-4633-9160","documentHash":"486f7eaf-0471-4216-abb6-8cfffa70ef94"},{"objectId":"5e7092df878c28a04739e8c2","name":"Anna","lastName":"Woźniacka","uuid":"D17C1D70A459C3C5E1F42BFA950F9D2F623B1656C8111F6D46BBD82B8EB74B1D489FAD0CA376D16E3BB3F64D4142C3CA96D8C123312C8C712F953C2DF4D8D32A","orcidId":"0000-0003-3698-960X","documentHash":"aa6368e4-e526-48fb-9b65-f79defeb08c8"},{"objectId":"5e7092d8878c28a04739de92","name":"Agata","lastName":"Liszewska","uuid":"0FDAABB66AF07AB2C3686FAE88F49E4E6BD4110F907EB4FDB7D7A8E22C6FEB4184C4C7431B0F92251F56FF63E2D5E177BF6FF1DECC28DA80AA8D842547466371","orcidId":"0000-0002-1760-9416","documentHash":"3ce729c2-ab3c-43ef-ba3c-2467cf8175fa"}],"doi":"10.5114/aoms/128102"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["grzeczność językowa","grzeczność elementarna","grzeczność elitarna","rozmowa medialna","dziennikarstwo sportowe"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["verbal politeness","elementary politeness","formal etiquette","media conversation","sports journalism"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Przejawy grzeczności językowej w medialnych rozmowach ze sportowcami","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547eead","mniswId":"200400","title":"Forum Lingwistyczne","doi":null,"issn":"2449-9587","eissn":"2450-2758","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"8af5d9e4-4783-41b7-8268-b8cbe7100160"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61ee6a982467f068913c9ab7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709425878c28a0473b713b"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Przedmiotem opracowania są językowe zachowania grzecznościowe występujące w trzech odmianach medialnych rozmów ze sportowcami: dialogach w postaci klasycznej (wywiadach radiowych), rozmowach typowych dla dziennikarstwa sportowego (mikrowywiadach pomeczowych) i najnowszych formach komunikacji z zawodnikami (wywiadach internetowych).

One of them is the development of the vertebral column. For many years it was widely believed that the column ossifies anteroposteriorly. However, later studies indicated that such a pattern is not universal in birds and in many groups the ossification starts in the thoracic rather than cervical region. Recent analyses suggest that two loci, located in the cervical and thoracic vertebrae, were ancestrally present in birds. However, the data on skeletal development are very scarce in the Neoaves, a clade that includes approximately 95% of extant species. We review the available information about the vertebral column development in birds and describe the ossification pattern in three neoavians, the domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica), the great crested grebe (Podiceps cristatus) and the red-necked grebe (Podiceps grisegena). In P. cristatus, the vertebral column starts ossifying in the thoracic region. The second locus is present in the cervical vertebrae. In the pigeon, the cervical vertebrae ossify before the thoracics, but both the thoracic and cervical loci are present. Our ancestral state reconstructions confirm that both these loci were ancestrally present in birds, but the thoracic locus was later lost in psittacopasserans and at least some galloanserans."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058030498","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/biology11020180","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61ee75952467f068913d32b6","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kuziak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"61c9a3d3-84f0-4f65-86c8-38791e2ed3a5"},{"objectId":"5ec3463b7523406cb1a7ea70","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Skawiński","uuid":"F2417D462FCD21556529922C3BA46506D4CAB038FA0F3398C765488CD88FB8CE35653313326F16DE963C992D56D73B0A857EFF74DAE9A872AEC233C28F41487D","orcidId":"0000-0002-1163-9366","documentHash":"d05be6fa-4930-40fb-b824-e0f7d25406eb"},{"objectId":"5e7092f7878c28a0473a0225","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Kloskowski","uuid":"77C7669082914543ABA8648BF4D6951D70E29EBB32334ECEE40B851F606AD6A9E0A9A101859BD5561C8A0066D68FDCC266A5FD489CA1F0E1E9B97C562E08D9A4","orcidId":"0000-0002-0525-2421","documentHash":"57f412bd-8208-475c-bb0a-210931d10835"},{"objectId":"5e70922e878c28a047391334","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Borczyk","uuid":"BE9DDDB9291D0799760018B0904025AC7825D5D98B6F6F652F818F5A55AD4C199423B90D5967ED71A84DB96E77C6A8022FF00F853C18FFC0B3ED8E39DFA0C81C","orcidId":"0000-0001-9630-1809","documentHash":"c4113ce1-5799-41f7-bc86-d6b9da4c807e"}],"doi":"10.3390/biology11020180"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1d5","uid":"bJAF3J7gD1iEjREYkfNvHfQ","uuid":"9ab5d088-ab1d-4ba8-8cf3-3b1ed670a267","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wydział Nowych Technologii i Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a5878c28a047399ce9"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"New perspectives of functional metal borohydrides","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478447","mniswId":"10084","title":"Journal of Alloys and Compounds","doi":null,"issn":"0925-8388","eissn":"1873-4669","websiteLink":"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-alloys-and-compounds/?testing=b","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"929bb9d6-bd28-4032-82bf-3d75a201c5c7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61ee62862467f068913c2267","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61ee62862467f068913c2269","61ee62862467f068913c226a","61ee62862467f068913c226b","61ee62862467f068913c226c","61ee62862467f068913c226d","61ee62862467f068913c226e","61ee62862467f068913c226f","5e7092a5878c28a047399ce9"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The chemistry of metal borohydrides and their derivatives has expanded signficantly during the past decade involving new compositions, structures, and the diversity of associated properties. Here we provide an overview of interesting results mainly from the past few years, discussed relative to previously published results. A range of new synthesis strategies has been developed to obtain pure samples, which has allowed very detailed structural, physical, and chemical investigations. A short overview of mono- and dimetallic borohydrides is provided, including a description of the complete series of rare-earth metal borohydrides and the recently discovered ammonium metal borohydrides, where the latter has attracted interest due to an extreme hydrogen content. Metal borohydrides appear to be the most promising class of materials to achieve high cationic conductivity of divalent metals, and particularly derivatives of metal borohydrides with neutral molecules show promise as future electrolytes for new types of solid-state batteries. Furthermore, metal borohydrides display a wide range of other properties, including optical, magnetic, semi conduction and possibly superconducting properties, and are also used as a new approach for carbon capture and conversion. The aim of the present review is to highlight new trends in properties and provide an outlook with possible future applications.

The use of nanometric alumina powder for reinforcement of a synthetized intermetallic matrix was the innovative concept of this work. Moreover, this is the first reported attempt to use the Pulse Plasma Sintering (PPS) method to consolidate composite powder with the contribution of nanometric alumina powder. The composite powders consisting of the intermetallic phase NiAl and Al2O3 were prepared by mechanical alloying from powder mixtures containing Ni-50at.%Al with the contribution of 10 wt.% or 20 wt.% nanometric aluminum oxide. A nanocrystalline NiAl matrix was formed, with uniformly distributed Al2O3 inclusions as reinforcement. The PPS method successfully consolidated NiAl-Al2O3 composite powders with limited grain growth in the NiAl matrix. The appropriate sintering temperature for composite powder was selected based on analysis of the grain growth and hardness of Al2O3 subjected to PPS consolidation at various temperatures. As a result of these tests, sintering of the NiAl-Al2O3 powders was carried out at temperatures of 1200 °C, 1300 °C, and 1400 °C. The microstructure and properties of the initial powders, composite powders, and consolidated bulk composite materials were characterized by SEM, EDS, XRD, density, and hardness measurements. The hardness of the ultrafine-grained NiAl-Al2O3 composites obtained via PPS depends on the Al2O3 content in the composite, as well as the sintering temperature applied. The highest values of the hardness of the composites were obtained after sintering at the lowest temperature (1200 °C), reaching 7.2 ± 0.29 GPa and 8.4 ± 0.07 GPa for 10 wt.% Al2O3 and 20 wt.% Al2O3, respectively, and exceeding the hardness values reported in the literature. From a technological point of view, the possibility to use sintering temperatures as low as 1200 °C is crucial for the production of fully dense, ultrafine-grained composites with high hardness."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058030588","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/2/407","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70946a878c28a0473bc97a","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"WACHOWSKI","uuid":"18E9A988D49F5A43F0E00C2BA5940AAB11E428969FCB24720945050780007E4746B07BA8815F1468D3558D33F7B2A62F2F5F8438350C3ED4407B043BD783CD66","orcidId":"0000-0002-6732-5972","documentHash":"a5652c2f-27ee-4299-990a-ec3d11a43e35"},{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b790e","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Cymerman","uuid":"B7F4B1AA9142DEA819C640FD7CCDF17C9FA89AA4A7B8119E16F4C3176E2A2AD3EB0FE1D7CEEED57F6CACFAFCD0C4B8160A70F5544D98D74580C34F0DD9CA3E70","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3ff6eb83-f4e8-48fa-86c7-8256a7aaa4d1"},{"objectId":"5e709423878c28a0473b6fcc","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Piotrkiewicz","uuid":"596E90DED0CEA10879D1E76B5F6908D12A737956B9BC6521D238E92609312C285277A9455976509BF6F14C291A7EF41925E739EAA2D0B203810821C8494338D9","orcidId":"0000-0001-8846-902X","documentHash":"0f4bc359-b985-4951-b532-a66de7b6abc3"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b58c7","name":"Marek","lastName":"Krasnowski","uuid":"65B4A57BA468B14AB3877BC76889FD06EB7355162051BACF895843ED3D709C7A2C52560A8EC3D3856AE23153A70DB894DA1269BF4E71C6E9F1F22637301A1482","orcidId":"0000-0002-5359-3642","documentHash":"ac05ef11-adb7-4ff4-89a0-e5339ec76e32"},{"objectId":"5e7092e5878c28a04739ee10","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Konopka","uuid":"E645A3935CFDB0DF5AD5FA35D1FA85A2316D50E31C87386E36C32621E75F41FC352A59292EF3888950A9528DFCEA603DD21D7A26BD5E27A327AC8C45C1EFD602","orcidId":"0000-0003-2901-8477","documentHash":"9177e41b-f83f-4202-bb4b-431da1a97c64"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c4c7","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Zygmuntowicz","uuid":"1F255213C85A9AF8D75697E4FBB260E3AF462576672278740CC5DFCE586B67E3587847644228E0929B791BAA7350D908A8B5CA92F2A7D2EF03C82CB485E21078","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9b033981-d6a6-41d6-9aca-5a70d32a4eda"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15020407"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709199878c28a0473803b3","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Virginia Commonwealth University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61ec14f12467f079a093b342","61ec14f12467f079a093b343","61ec14f12467f079a093b340","61ec14f12467f079a093b341","61ec14f12467f079a093b33f"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0c","uid":"bnXIe5Gp0q3Tkxqm6btR47Q","uuid":"3059e2c4-d76b-416b-8360-76fc2ced654d","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0c","parentUuid":"3059e2c4-d76b-416b-8360-76fc2ced654d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0c","rootUuid":"3059e2c4-d76b-416b-8360-76fc2ced654d","name":"Instytut Wysokich Ciśnień Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709390878c28a0473ace98","5e70940f878c28a0473b5989","5e7094f3878c28a0473c7d30","5ffd484f085dcb6be6b60a39","5e709481878c28a0473beaba"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The effect of annealing on photoluminescence from defects in ammonothermal GaN","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478489","mniswId":"10178","title":"Journal of Applied Physics","doi":null,"issn":"0021-8979","eissn":"1089-7550","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f841d16e-475e-49e5-84b3-200e25ad6680"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61ec14f12467f079a093b33c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61ec14f12467f079a093b33f","61ec14f12467f079a093b340","61ec14f12467f079a093b341","61ec14f12467f079a093b342","61ec14f12467f079a093b343","5e709390878c28a0473ace98","5e7094f3878c28a0473c7d30","5ffd484f085dcb6be6b60a39","5e709481878c28a0473beaba","5e70940f878c28a0473b5989","61ec14f12467f079a093b344","61ec14f12467f079a093b345"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Ammonothermal GaN samples with the concentration of free electrons of 1018 and 1019 cm−3 were annealed in a wide range of temperatures (Tann = 300–1400 °C) under atmospheric N2 pressure and under ultra-high N2 pressure conditions to avoid the GaN decomposition.

classification is a crucial prerequisite for the collection of agricultural statistics, efficient crop management, biodiversity control, the design of agricultural policy, and food security. Crops are characterized by significant change during the growing season, and this information can be used to improve classification accuracy. However, capturing variation in vegetation cover requires a reliable source of valid data. Sentinel-1 radar images are a good candidate, as they supply information about Earth’s surface every six days, independent of weather and light conditions. In this paper, we present a method for crop classification based on radar polarimetry. We propose a set of multi-temporal indices derived from time series Sentinel-1 images that aim to characterize crop phenology. A big data, object-oriented classification technique is developed and tested on 16 crop types for the whole of Poland. Our analysis found that overall accuracy varied (regionally) from 86.36 to 89.13% in 2019, and from 85.95 to 89.81% in 2020. F1 scores for individual crops varied from 0.73 to 0.99, and the use of our multi-temporal phenological indices increased F1 scores by about 0.14 compared to calculations using only basic parameters. Results obtained for the whole country demonstrate the efficacy of the method and its resistance to environmental conditions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058033331","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e140272467f00328c0d34d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"107","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"ec624002-5d95-43da-9232-11a166aa7b75"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"107","pagesFromTo":"102683","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0303243422000095?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61e140272467f00328c0d34b","name":"Artur","lastName":"Łączyński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d801e92e-5063-46aa-b78f-69c8e4c594e5"},{"objectId":"61e140272467f00328c0d34a","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Slesiński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e382d02c-8886-4073-ae45-bd57b4c62dd6"},{"objectId":"61e140272467f00328c0d349","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Milewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"16ec1c6a-fd7f-42f6-ba35-f74a0837ee95"},{"objectId":"61e140272467f00328c0d342","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Rybicki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"55fa6489-0d28-4614-a600-bb4e53741fdd"},{"objectId":"5e7094f5878c28a0473c7e31","name":"Cezary","lastName":"Wojtkowski","uuid":"A7D946432A1EB7834AEFCE9CC9A528FB615C2E99B1C025942278FD760CB748DF7BA0503ECB04FA211938FA18114DC28BBFFB07D4A3AD4C5C8368A8CCCE2F1CE3","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bbccd1b5-fa66-479c-a077-322db7b7c11f"},{"objectId":"5e709495878c28a0473bfe93","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Aleksandrowicz","uuid":"39908EE24880CC49C987ECA7F737FC9CD244B4399C9D81407D854C0CE307D4420600642A1B2310B97E1122941732E7CFD6EAF4A7261E0271457B50A6658015EB","orcidId":"0000-0002-8634-436X","documentHash":"90fd89e0-816e-4aea-83e7-bb0a9fc17b7d"},{"objectId":"5e70943c878c28a0473b88d2","name":"Jan","lastName":"Musiał","uuid":"1DF666530A14A23C6EB40C9BE4BEB87770C5678982191D63BA92051761BDDF57AA0CB799AC10D60380E42C3D1EFE2008670E43C35264E5547F92EBF7EC59F17B","orcidId":"0000-0002-0034-7827","documentHash":"9e43596a-3580-45b4-9e09-0ad1f2ddd2f5"},{"objectId":"5e7093fb878c28a0473b45b2","name":"Jędrzej","lastName":"Bojanowski","uuid":"B7F616ADD6AE3D59B870E86EC17FE88CB74446862F8D1FF03EA54B6D62EBD0CBB048DDDCAAFFCCF560DAA439A62B8F630A1997D05BAFEA6D642940F2582F6F69","orcidId":"0000-0001-8460-4183","documentHash":"1e4bb85a-72a3-4848-8b3b-dfab55867ac4"},{"objectId":"5e7093b6878c28a0473af9b5","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Woźniak","uuid":"88668B316014F054719C122890382BFF3A773E0FB81099AA8FF392A93A5E1B197D50CA7C04819B52CF9E0ED80A1FFC9C32134D64CC87913B6F2E42C16102B99B","orcidId":"0000-0002-7717-4848","documentHash":"3a0c4c6a-2a66-41e4-816b-5b14b59e3b85"},{"objectId":"5e709394878c28a0473ad434","name":"Wlodek","lastName":"Kofman","uuid":"68B078422B9A0391DAD0D91A8D5F2CDE552BE5DA550AAEA61DDFF4548D8EAA0768DBFE22EB8F9C9CCCF00887E33CBE899ED5FBDC99A074EB9A763C336EF9C939","orcidId":"0000-0002-6744-8796","documentHash":"d059ae86-360d-4a8b-9623-5a8ef7f3697b"},{"objectId":"5e709355878c28a0473a777a","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Lewiński","uuid":"074F35612C8C9CA08A88543EFEACBB5A0F2817C5936184DC952D6841E0DD415262CA01408F2244FEA738495AAECC3D954BD5B61BDBCD721BA3F82415F431BFD2","orcidId":"0000-0001-5391-3426","documentHash":"a245396c-d56f-47fe-b603-d8b895e1c2a4"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jag.2022.102683"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["polityczne zawłaszczenie państwa","patronaż","przedsiębiorstwa państwowe","państwa postsocjalistyczne","pogoń za rentą"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["political state capture","party patronage","state-owned enterprises","post-socialist countries","rent-seeking","corporate governance"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"How Do Politicians Capture a State?

Evidence of this is delivered from state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and the rotations of members of their management and supervisory boards. In this case, it is deemed that an interest group, which consists of politicians and representatives in the government administration, decides about the appointment and dismissal of board members through the corporate governance of SOEs and ownership policy of the state. We analyzed the scale and intensity of rotations in Poland of about twelve thousand joint-stock companies in the years 2001–2017 according to their ownership structure. We show that changes of managers and supervisory board members in state-owned enterprises are higher than in private companies and are related to political elections.

The lifetime of these organic molecules is crucial to the correct operation of devices as they form the “heart” of the device. Exposition on electromagnetic radiation, in particular from UV–VIS region causes excitation of delocalized electrons and their transfer to higher energy levels. Then, photodegradation processes began to dominate inside organic material. Eventually, the operating parameters of the entire device are deteriorated. Herein we present new reinforced molecules which can be favor in the future applications. In this work we developed the synthetic methodology to a highly birefringent mono-, di-, and tri-fluorinated 4-alkyl-4″-isothiocyanato-[1,1ʹ:4ʹ,1″]terphenyls, where deuterium atoms are located at α and β positions of the terminal alkyl chains. These Deuterated Liquid Crystals have excellent isotopic purity ≥ 95%. The synthetic approach involves mainly deuteration reactions of Ctriple bondC bonds by using effective batch system and transformation of amine group (single bondNH2) into isothiocyanate group (single bondNCS) at the last step. These unique materials show higher photochemical stability vs non-deuterated analogs, while maintaining good optical anisotropy simultaneously. Results indicate a high potential use of Deuterated Liquid Crystals in many types of liquid crystalline devices."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058035946","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"345","pagesFromTo":"117847","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molliq.2021.117847","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61eebd9d2467f06891457c23","name":"Hideto","lastName":"Tsuji","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"43e0d1a8-c677-42d9-bd2f-f5d42486c76e"},{"objectId":"61eebd9d2467f06891457c22","name":"Yuki","lastName":"Arakawa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"56f3823e-177a-44a2-be84-5d842f9e54a7"},{"objectId":"5e709450878c28a0473ba4dd","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Herman","uuid":"5D8E24C31B75C09775586AFEB725A60DB499FEEA3905E2526BEADA2DBE7F92AD3A59BA14E2966948C0AABF90F2AC553945A51E8EF717500BCD05D2BB8C4311D7","orcidId":"0000-0002-5549-7283","documentHash":"ebfcb17b-cb8e-496f-b100-8d991fc74857"},{"objectId":"5e709349878c28a0473a668c","name":"Marta","lastName":"Żak","uuid":"2A1DB62A6959A429202CF08DA899ACC678B55FE5AE33AB393CFB80DABC7E885E525A8D32E4159D58D3D847A84EE486A944EB18AF7123E80760FDCF12C8487AA1","orcidId":"0000-0002-0880-3313","documentHash":"387c3aad-d096-42c1-8f87-54d75b7c933b"},{"objectId":"5e7092a5878c28a047399ce5","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Kula","uuid":"A8332706FF16FEA9A9D54558FD36DD80E87F029DA0089257E8E73ACFDD381D7FF7DCFAE66BBE1A106C349C7C4BB2D425210515B164F64F095A07C3D1D1B26F9F","orcidId":"0000-0002-7862-7968","documentHash":"ef81f658-c0bd-4c41-8bc6-3634424630be"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.molliq.2021.117847"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["spectrum monitoring","data fusion","the decision-making process","cognitive radio network","MANET","dynamic spectrum management","ad hoc networks","machine learning"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b4878c28a047385b35","uid":"btATqUNFhls54hxnijAlZPg","uuid":"5b1fa4f1-edeb-4295-a63b-c14568d4c9f4","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Instytut Systemów Łączności","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709450878c28a0473ba4f6","5e7092a2878c28a047399b1a","5e7092a2878c28a047399b36"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Building the Electromagnetic Situation Awareness in MANET Cognitive Radio Networks for Urban Areas","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796fd","mniswId":"18383","title":"Sensors","doi":null,"issn":"1424-8220","eissn":"1424-3210","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"80ff8bca-a845-44fd-adcb-a436c0342b72"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61efb6f42467f031226bba5b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092a2878c28a047399b1a","5e709450878c28a0473ba4f6","5e7092a2878c28a047399b36"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents a solution for building awareness of the electromagnetic situation in cognitive mobile ad hoc networks (MANET) using the cooperative spectrum sensing method.

Next, a reinforced machine learning algorithm estimates the usefulness of particular channels for the MANET transmission and creates backup channels list that could be used in case of interferences.

Heart rate variability (HRV) provides valuable information in various clinical settings. Limited information exists on changes in cardiac autonomic modulation in extremely obese patients (BMI>40). The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of extreme (morbid) obesity and concomitant diseases on cardiovascular autonomic function. Participants of this study are 40 women and 40 men in mean age 47,9 years old diagnosed with morbid obesity (mean BMI 47,49) and hospitalized to further bariatric treatment. In 42 patients diagnosed with hypertension (treated with beta blockers and ACE inhibitors along with well controlled blood pressure), type 2 diabetes (treatment with the oral drugs) also occurred. Furthermore, 46 patients were diagnosed with depression. None of the participants used antidepressants or sedative agents. Total of 80 healthy (40 women and 40 men) in mean age 42,7 years old and with mean BMI 24,6 were formed in group of controls. All of patients had 24-hour ECG monitoring with Holter method in order to evaluate the autonomic activity with time and frequency domain analysis (heart rate variability - HRV).\n\nResults: Obese group showed a significant reduction of parasympathetic activity and a significant increase in sympathetic activity. No significant differences in cardiac autonomic modulation were noted between the Hypertensive-Diabetic patients and those, only with morbid obesity. However, in studied group, obese patients with depression had lower time and frequency domain parameters (p<0.05) except SDNN, SDANN and LF/HF ratio in contrast to obese non-depressive individuals. Additional load of diabetes and hypertension in depressed patients did not affect the cardiac autonomic modulation differences. Further prospective study can be undertaken within the same subjects to evaluate the effect of weight loss on the cardiac autonomic activity.\n\nConclusions:\n1. Extreme obesity altered cardiac autonomic activity independently of hypertension and diabetes.\n2. Depression associated with morbid obesity intensified HRV reduction."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058036355","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66d58892fdbe8351d923ae72","year":"2020","publishedYear":null,"volume":"26","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"3658b843-ea3c-465f-baba-55accf3e271c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"26","pagesFromTo":"5-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://pjambp.com/view/abstract/id/14874","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093e6878c28a0473b2f9f","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Zawadzka-Bartczak","uuid":"9540ED531B2DE0A6304BD9AB3C47C65BAE61FD3851B5787D1C34DE3C0C87791732F495D81FAAED23E1E7BC5ABCD2E6D19ACC30ED911C7D6EF0B1AAB36EDE0C9D","orcidId":"0000-0003-3113-1612","documentHash":"5ffe7f7c-24c3-4269-a985-08e8626158ec"},{"objectId":"5e70936f878c28a0473a97cc","name":"Dagmara","lastName":"Bartczak-Szermer","uuid":"AF68B0069E1B9AE5FB3FA4B6C1B4717565D91ACE75F5B73C0D38D8D376A1B6961CD94DC24533EF0593A1E35CCC135AD50F9BF00A94B904096B9A9DAF1DF6EDE2","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9106ec4f-82a6-46e8-955d-0640f248a3d2"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["High-intensive interval training","Cardiorespiratory fitness","Musculoskeletal fitness"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","parentUuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","rootUuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

The relationship between CRF and MSF was examined too. Little is known about gaining CRF from HIIT independence of MSF in adolescents. Therefore, this study is aimed at investigating whether MSF mediated the relationship between HIIT and CRF and whether sex moderate this relation. The study sample included 122 individuals (45 boys, 77 girls)  years of secondary school age. Participants were assigned to the HIIT intervention or control groups. The intervention lasted 14 minutes during one physical education lesson per week for ten weeks. Outcome and potential mediator were residual changes calculated from pre- and postintervention results of MSF components: handgrip (HG), sit-ups (ABS), sit-and-reach (FL), vertical jump (VJ), and Harvard step-test representing cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). MSF index (MSFI) was calculated as a construct, agglomerating all MSF, and tested its usefulness. HIIT significantly impacted CRF in boys and girls (, ; , , respectively). The impact of the HIIT program on the ABS and FL was observed only in girls. The moderation effect of sex was confirmed. Significant effect of HIIT on CRF decreased () and was no significant after including FL (, )—complete mediation, but no ABS (, )—partial mediation. CRF was mediated by changes in ABS (, ) and FL (4.18, ). MSFI was not mediating; its usefulness was limited. HIIT is an effective tool in the development of CRF in both sexes. MSF played a limited role in the relationship between HIIT and CRF. It suggested different mechanisms in both sexes: girls who performed better to the HIIT had better values of FL and ABS, but not boys. HIIT intervention involved modifications in ABS or FL, which also influenced the increase of CRF."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058036484","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61efc8312467f03122757e9c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2022","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"2f4e2839-576b-403c-a96e-27579912aa68"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2022","pagesFromTo":"art. 876020, s. 1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2022/8760620.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a7d6","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Koźlenia","uuid":"ACFEDD630F150BD26BEE9B72C1817BF2D7D9C77B56487D83A0E1D8F2AF5690A1293C57DF1B385CFE0B6E13AE7FF53B8A32E6BF69D794003794B16E40DA43B945","orcidId":"0000-0002-5304-7879","documentHash":"69baf409-c652-4ac0-ae79-a87ccf277d85"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047395016","name":"Marek","lastName":"Popowczak","uuid":"DE2FFD2E114AF925ABE9D24F8C06CA2FD73A79025D5767995E3FD2C685E5BA083AFF477FDF71FFE51E1C42D4B5C41182DAF66404B4AA8E1CC11F522C5AF34748","orcidId":"0000-0002-3895-6206","documentHash":"c35d6b0a-e5bb-4350-bb15-1213ac3ee9a6"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047394fec","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Domaradzki","uuid":"CEAC11E0295750434309ABE0B6D490373768A5109983A617965CC2E373E7267D43D78A93E57DA4914835CCB737A7A7471A8BDD2F7A5A313B8C0074A0ECA3C4A5","orcidId":"0000-0001-8057-3033","documentHash":"31b3d6c1-c09c-4f26-8399-6d6ff4fcf145"}],"doi":"10.1155/2022/8760620"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sports mega-events","Olympic Games","FIFA World Cup","legacy","economic growth","generalized synthetic control method","public policy"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Sports Mega-Events and Economic Growth: A Synthetic Control Approach","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478aa2","mniswId":"12706","title":"Journal of Sports Economics","doi":null,"issn":"1527-0025","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"c91cbfb6-c09d-4eaa-a9bd-b017163f846b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61f000d22467f03122827670","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709411878c28a0473b5bad","5e70939e878c28a0473ade1c"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper contributes to the current literature investigating whether hosting sports mega-events brings tangible economic benefits to the host country.

New algorithms are mainly addressed to the occurrence of clutter caused by wind turbines (DP.TURBINE algorithm) and other terrain obstacles (DP.NMET algorithm) as well as various forms of echoes caused by the interaction of a radar beam with RLAN signals (set of SPIKE algorithms). The individual algorithms are based on the employment of polarimetric data as well as on the geometric analysis of echo patterns.

Determining the quality of\nlife of healthy people (health-related quality of life (HRQoL), considering the influence of various\nfactors, is important due to the possibility of making subsequent comparative analyses regarding\nthe quality of life of people diagnosed with diseases. In addition, it allows us to identify the most\ncrucial factors influencing the HRQoL in the process of “good aging”. The purpose of the study\nwas to present the HRQoL level of healthy people over 65 years of age. HRQoL was measured\nin five-year age groups (66–70, 71–75, 76–80, >80 years), considering the analyzed factors. Finally,\n1038 healthy people were included in the study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: no diagnosed\nchronic diseases, no permanent treatment in specialist clinics, and no constant administration of\nmedicaments. A comparative analysis was carried out, assuming a 5% conclusion error. The SF-36\nquestionnaire assessing the main dimensions of the quality of life was the tool used in the study to\nassess the HRQoL: the physical component summary (PCS), mental component summary (MCS)\nand index of life quality (ILQ). The factors significantly differentiating the average level of HRQoL\nwere as follows: gender, place of residence, education, employment status, smoking and physical\nactivity. Relationship status (p > 0.05) was one of the analyzed factors that did not influence the\ndifferences in the average level of the perceived HRQoL. More than a twofold greater chance of a\nhigher HRQoL was reported in the group of men under 75 years of age (66–70: OR = 2.01; 71–75:\nOR = 2.52) compared to the group of women. The same relationship was noted in the case of higher\neducation in respondents up to the age of 80 (66–70: OR = 1.56; 71–75: OR = 2.16; 76–80: OR = 2.74).\nSmoking by people over 80 years of age significantly increased the chances of a higher HRQoL in\neach of the dimensions (PCS: OR = 4.09; MCS: OR = 12.64; ILQ: OR = 5.79). Age as a non-modifiable\nfactor significantly differentiates the level of the HRQoL of healthy people over 65 years of age.

We reared these trap-building predatory larvae under 2 heat stress regimes (mild, 30°C, and harsh, 36°C), and after they progressed from one instar stage to another, we tested their perceptual ability in common unchallenging conditions. We hypothesized that exposure to the harsh heat stress regime would impose costs resulting in handicapped vibration responsiveness. We found that the harsh heat stress regime generated more stressful conditions for the larvae, as evidenced by increased mortality and postponed molting, and the loss of body mass among larger larvae. Furthermore, among the individuals who remained alive, those originating from the harsh heat stress regime were characterized by higher vibration responsiveness. Our results suggest 2 not mutually exclusive scenarios. Costly heat stress conditions can sieve out individuals characterized by poor perceptual ability or surviving individuals can attempt to hunt more efficiently to compensate for the physiological imbalance caused by heat stress. Both of these mechanisms fit into the ongoing debate over how adaptation and plasticity contribute to shaping insect communities exposed to heat stress."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058041669","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61334d7a2467f00b608976e8","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"b33d87d1-8a79-481f-bbab-3f9a6862c211"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"68","pagesFromTo":"345–350","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/cz/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/cz/zoab098/41813595/zoab098.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61dd30202467f047f397afe0","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Czarnoleski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d8f748a8-9030-406a-bfb6-98c43bb993cb"},{"objectId":"5e709328878c28a0473a3d7f","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Miler","uuid":"18E05A8103307AE916169004274D53958BBA6E5053DD908046E1F67532BB282F8A3B64F5DB5FEC686D29153F7E6B45AB696C1041D37742C51C17BDC37D2D3FB9","orcidId":"0000-0001-7684-0629","documentHash":"43f54d10-4211-4e87-a315-c8ee2078e8e4"}],"doi":"10.1093/cz/zoab098"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Biocides","Conservation","Biodeterioration","Aerial green algae","Building materials","Adaptation mechanisms"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709269878c28a0473953d5","60c309509543c72336543ab5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Towards understanding the link between the deterioration of building materials and the nature of aerophytic green algae","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"Science of the Total Environment","doi":null,"issn":"0048-9697","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"59516ca8-3554-4f06-a1d4-f330ee71985e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61dd27f42467f047f3952cc4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6735a72cfdbe83034962d04c","60c309509543c72336543ab5","5e709269878c28a0473953d5"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The gradual degradation of technical materials by bacteria, cyanobacteria and fungi, is of great economic and social significance. In temperate climates, microbial colonization is associated with phototrophic eukaryotes, predominantly aerial green algae. However, these phototrophs are able to colonize most substrates in all terrestrial environments, regardless he geographical area. As little is known of the life processes of green algae, it is widely believed that their impact on materials is purely aesthetic. Most studies on the deterioration of building materials examine both algae and cyanobacteria and propose various methods, mainly conservation practices, to halt the causes and effects of algal colonization. However, to fully comprehend the phenomenon of biodeterioration by green algae, it is essential to understand both the causes and effects of their activities, as their life processes have considerable influence on changes of technical state of building materials. Aerophytic green algae possess various cellular adaptations and life mechanisms to survive and successfully develop in the harsh terrestrial environment. In response to desiccation, UV radiation and high/low temperature fluctuation they form endo- and epilithic biofilms, produce various protective biomolecules and extracellular matrices, and change the volume of cells. Due to their adaptation mechanisms and wide ecological tolerance, green algae undoubtedly have a high potential to accelerate the degradation of building materials. This article reviews the current state of knowledge regarding the mechanisms of biodeterioration, examines the role played by green algae as a result of their adaptation to a terrestrial environment, presents methods that can be used to prevent the development of green algal biofilms and indicate future prospects in the assessment of algal deterioration studies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058041680","journalIssue":{"objectId":"616083712467f04d4f5a0c94","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"802","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"f545fd0d-f4ee-43db-ab2d-5faf6f7422af"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"802","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969721049317","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6735a72cfdbe83034962d04c","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Nowicka-Krawczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2409838e-8303-432e-a5a0-23fc2f8dc816"},{"objectId":"60c309509543c72336543ab5","name":"Michał","lastName":"Komar","uuid":"5801C9DB6CB13F463F060E3D1F831FFCF4DB90079788E4662F1223C8374F2070027D122A490A395BD4A0963856294BFC75C7756C6DFD7DEE54F693A0933D6E41","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"be7a44c5-b86c-47f8-87d6-6c28a1f68948"},{"objectId":"5e709269878c28a0473953d5","name":"Beata","lastName":"Gutarowska","uuid":"E6189DFF0795DA389A7911E1DE3C103C8153F5509C3918CFAB16E6439E8608B5370731AE7735F6BEDD5EEA62FB85D889A1227EC0251DC83D6D09E957044E8179","orcidId":"0000-0002-9523-2001","documentHash":"49782a61-e502-4adf-a05d-2551e2770585"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149856"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Ochrona zdrowia","Edukacja","Medycyna"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-89481-46-7","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","uid":"bqEBivGW4eOgmsFFDSCuw-g","uuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","parentUuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","rootUuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego i Sportu im.

We introduce our innovative loss function, which improves the usefulness of the forecasting ability of the LSTM model in algorithmic investment strategies. Based on the forecasts from the LSTM model we generate buy and sell investment signals, employ them in algorithmic investment strategies and create equity lines for our investment. For this purpose we use various combinations of LSTM models, optimized on in-sample period and tested on out-of-sample period, using rolling window approach. We pay special attention to data preprocessing in the input layer, to avoid overfitting in the estimation and optimization process, and assure correct selection of hyperparameters at the beginning of our tests. The next stage is devoted to the conjunction of signals from various frequencies into one ensemble model, and the selection of best combinations for the out-of-sample period, through optimization of the given criterion in a similar way as in the portfolio analysis.

Ceramics with the nominal composition La2Ni1−ySiyO4+δ (y = 0, 0.02 and 0.05) were prepared by the glycine nitrate combustion technique and sintered at 1450 °C. While minor changes in the lattice parameters of the tetragonal K2NiF4-type lattice may suggest incorporation of a small fraction of Si into the Ni sublattice, combined XRD and SEM/EDS studies indicate that this fraction is very limited (≪2 at.%, if any). Instead, additions of silica result in segregation of apatite-type La10−xSi6O26+δ and La2O3 secondary phases as confirmed experimentally and supported by the static lattice simulations. Both total electrical conductivity and oxygen-ionic transport in La2NiO4+δ ceramics are suppressed by silica additions. The preferential reactivity of silica with lanthanum oxide opens a possibility to improve the compatibility between lanthanum silicate-based solid electrolytes and La2NiO4+δ-based electrodes by appropriate surface modifications. The promising potential of this approach is supported by preliminary tests of electrodes infiltrated with lanthanum oxide."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058042075","journalIssue":{"objectId":"628234b64097077bd4067352","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"10","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"49997206-6083-4272-bf94-c0b603a455e2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"82","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/10/1/82/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61dd2acf2467f047f395b2a1","name":"Aleksey A.","lastName":"Yaremchenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3837-5946","documentHash":"b6d48dce-7b58-4e5a-ae04-040dbe780473"},{"objectId":"61dd2acf2467f047f395b2a0","name":"Miguel A.","lastName":"Vieira","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"158e0a57-063b-48cb-bb25-9e9b03bf93a6"},{"objectId":"61dd2acf2467f047f395b29e","name":"Aleksandr","lastName":"Bamburov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4120-0047","documentHash":"825fe0c0-dfbc-4842-a067-aa9c0868063f"},{"objectId":"61dd2acf2467f047f395b29d","name":"Kiryl","lastName":"Zakharchuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5109-5359","documentHash":"5bf10b1b-a935-45a0-b013-dff280951432"},{"objectId":"5e709444878c28a0473b94f0","name":"Yevgeniy","lastName":"Naumovich","uuid":"E21CFE00C9A076C5F3943AD4CB42EDCB6E3FBCF4CC085BB6C4976A2BCB0247CDB1E06CD22E7D0B16F9E27CC59107C143FC56B4C33570909A5F4FFCF6EBC52EB5","orcidId":"0000-0003-2081-7475","documentHash":"8867c14a-7c1f-4de5-b1f5-cb6107da2f32"}],"doi":"10.3390/pr10010082"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["indoor and outdoor environments","greenhouse","precision agriculture","SLAM","UAV"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A Comprehensive Survey of the Recent Studies with UAV for Precision Agriculture in Open Fields and Greenhouses","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences-Basel","doi":null,"issn":"2076-3417","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"01301afc-a0dc-4e98-8fba-0ab08483b798"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-20","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61f0f8772467f06d26f0fc7c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61f0f8772467f06d26f0fc7e","61f0f8772467f06d26f0fc7f","61f0f8772467f06d26f0fc81","5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","61f0f8772467f06d26f0fc83"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The increasing world population makes it necessary to fight challenges such as climate change and to realize production efficiently and quickly. However, the minimum cost, maximum income, environmental pollution protection and the ability to save water and energy are all factors that should be taken into account in this process. The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in agriculture to meet all of these criteria serves the purpose of precision agriculture. As unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can easily obtain real-time data, they have a great potential to address and optimize solutions to the problems faced by agriculture. Despite some limitations, such as the battery, load, weather conditions, etc., UAVs will be used frequently in agriculture in the future because of the valuable data that they obtain and their efficient applications. According to the known literature, UAVs have been carrying out tasks such as spraying, monitoring, yield estimation, weed detection, etc. In recent years, articles related to agricultural UAVs have been presented in journals with high impact factors. Most precision agriculture applications with UAVs occur in outdoor environments where GPS access is available, which provides more reliable control of the UAV in both manual and autonomous flights. On the other hand, there are almost no UAV-based applications in greenhouses where all-season crop production is available. This paper emphasizes this deficiency and provides a comprehensive review of the use of UAVs for agricultural tasks and highlights the importance of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for a UAV solution in the greenhouse."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058042399","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1047","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/3/1047","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61f0f8772467f06d26f0fc83","name":"Seyfettin Sinan","lastName":"Gültekin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"77ddeb71-119d-4a85-9768-f3f5956297a5"},{"objectId":"61f0f8772467f06d26f0fc81","name":"Kadir","lastName":"SABANCI","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0238-9606","documentHash":"b3e44376-2526-4f3a-b448-2d00bcbe6f82"},{"objectId":"61f0f8772467f06d26f0fc7f","name":"Akif","lastName":"Durdu","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5611-2322","documentHash":"1f257d8e-bc4e-4e35-bb36-834bfe972946"},{"objectId":"61f0f8772467f06d26f0fc7e","name":"Muhammet Fatih","lastName":"ASLAN","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7549-0137","documentHash":"1d093780-4acb-481f-8ead-d43ce9efff36"},{"objectId":"5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ropelewska","uuid":"E3575740307CA373F3BD454AAC58C202E1C2CA28B9FC90C6BC3006DB867893BEE70DFAC85C7D9667CD0ACB7837B8DF63F7D6636679B032F0F1E0E534A3F3CBD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8891-236X","documentHash":"e9d0e369-fc46-40fe-9cb3-5236d6ea38a0"}],"doi":"10.3390/app12031047"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["wastewater","multi-antibiotic resistant pathogens","WHO priority pathogens list","metagenome analy"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709193878c28a04737f022","uid":"b7_F259x3z87jBCBjF7Iavw","uuid":"14c88ce5-55f8-4086-b853-97c0b922b478","parentId":"5e709193878c28a04737f022","parentUuid":"14c88ce5-55f8-4086-b853-97c0b922b478","rootId":"5e709193878c28a04737f022","rootUuid":"14c88ce5-55f8-4086-b853-97c0b922b478","name":"Instytut Ekologii Terenów Uprzemysłowionych","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61dd30ec2467f047f397fdae"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709425878c28a0473b7245","5e70921c878c28a0473900c2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Seasonal and Technological Shifts of the WHO Priority Multi-Resistant Pathogens in Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant and Its Receiving Surface Water: A Case Study","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","doi":null,"issn":"1661-7827","eissn":"1660-4601","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"6ce891bf-9648-4807-8230-a1e1b1d96d01"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61dd30ec2467f047f397fda9","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70937d878c28a0473aaf73","5e709425878c28a0473b7245","5e70921c878c28a0473900c2","61dd30ec2467f047f397fdae"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The present study was focused on the identification of multi-resistant bacteria from the WHO priority pathogens list in the samples taken from different stages of the full-scale municipal wastewater treatment plant and receiving water.

The benefits and disadvantages of using such means are discussed. A dedicated system can be implemented in the satellite design phase and shall be a key subsystem of platforms inserted into orbit. Uncontrolled, semi-controlled and controlled de-orbit can be completed using solid rocket motors. Their impact on the space debris environment is discussed. Specific requirements for dedicated propellants and systems are provided. While the majority of presently developed rocket systems worldwide require high burn rates, several applications, including de-orbiting, benefit from solid propellants with decreased regression rates. This allows limiting spacecraft accelerations and loads during de-orbit manoeuvres. Moreover, the requirement of minimising solid particle generation is presented. Heritage technology from the Mercury and Gemini human spaceflight programmes, where de-orbit motors were used, is shown.

Contact calls are produced by many species of birds and mammals to maintain group cohesion and associations among individuals. Contact calls in bats are typically relatively low-frequency social calls, produced only for communication. However, echolocation calls (higher in frequency and used primarily for orientation and prey detection) can also facilitate interaction among individuals and location of conspecifics in the roost. We studied calling behaviour of brown long-eared bats (Plecotus auritus) during return to maternity roosts in response to playbacks of social and echolocation calls. We hypothesised that calling by conspecifics would elicit responses in colony members. Bat responses (inspection flights and social calls production) were significantly highest during social call and echolocation call playbacks than during noise (control) playbacks. We suggest that social calling in maternity roosts of brown long-eared bat evolved to maintain associations among roostmates, rather than to find roosts or roostmates, because this species is strongly faithful to roosts and the social groups and roosts are stable over time and space. Living in a stable social group requires recognition of group members and affiliation of social bonds with group members, features that may be mediated by vocal signals."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058045170","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"68","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10344-021-01543-w","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61dd69192467f064e64b2e54","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Pakuła","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6d387d88-0fe0-4d97-8b19-e23f7ac4d843"},{"objectId":"5e70922e878c28a0473913f0","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Furmankiewicz","uuid":"CC3A220C8B89615590DDE44985A1ECC5D78BAE924C33855A71DB601959716B350C0DC4974A4C244BC0FD7F65DEAB55EEE9EDFC857929B2551BBBFEE8410B3511","orcidId":"0000-0002-9718-4226","documentHash":"61faee66-7ed8-4b6e-b1e3-8c8f9a2a3bb8"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10344-021-01543-w"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["garden","architecture","archetype","monastery","Athos"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Monastic gardens of Athos: the archetype of the garden in the genesis of Christian architecture","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477bf7","mniswId":"6272","title":"European Journal of Science and Theology","doi":null,"issn":"1841-0464","eissn":"1842-8517","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"f5eb298b-85aa-469e-881f-a12074fc57cd"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":true,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61e1c5f32467f0032820a58d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70920f878c28a04738f504","5e7092b1878c28a04739ac5a"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The gardens of Athos are so unique that they lend credibility to the statement that their forms and purpose are a bridge between the Garden of Eden and the City of God.

In this study, saturated water flow was modeled using two different approaches, depending on the existence of the percolating macropore network. The soil material comprised 26 undisturbed soil cores. Soil samples were scanned using an X-ray micro-CT scanner, and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), bulk density and particle size distribution were measured. The voxel size for X-ray CT scans of soil cores was 23.6 µm, which allowed soil macropore network discrimination. The macropore network was percolating in 11 samples, while the remaining cores were not. A typical approach based on Navier–Stokes (NS) equations was used for saturated water flow modeling in the case of a percolating samples. In the case of cores with a non-percolating macropore network, the NS modeling approach could not be used. An alternative method of modeling (NS/Darcy) was used in this case, blending: regular NS flow in the well-defined macropores with the Darcy–Forchheimer flow in the remaining part – the soil matrix. Soil matrix is treated by the NS/Darcy model as a pore medium without well-defined pore geometry but with some intrinsic permeability incorporated in the model using the Darcy–Forchheimer equation. Unlike the NS approach, the NS/Darcy model allowed for the simulation of water flow for all soil samples, including those where the macropore network was not percolating. Based on simulations, the Ksat was estimated used for model validation. The analysis of results leads to the proposal of a new hybrid modeling approach, mixing the NS and NS/Darcy modeling approaches. A good estimation of the Ksat was obtained using the proposed model (R2 = 0.61). The NS/Darcy modeling approach was used for the analysis of the macropore flow in the soil media. The simulations show that water permeates through the core, but macropores are a favorable flow path if they exist, even if they are not directly connected to each other. The areas of the soil cores taking part in the preferential, macropore flow were quantified, showing that only a small fraction of the macropores take part in water flow both for percolating and non-percolating cores. But generally, for most of the analyzed flow-related indices, apparent differences in results between percolating and non-percolating samples were observed. Effective flow area (EFA), i.e., the sample area used for water flow with a velocity higher than the threshold velocity (Utr) was analyzed. Considering the macropore flow, only ∼2% of sample volume is responsible for: 82% of the total flux in case of percolated and 34% in case of non-percolated samples. Also, for non-percolated samples, the dependence (R2 = 0.44) between relative flux participation and the effective flow area is observed. The simulation results for the non-percolating samples revealed the relationship between the simulated saturated conductivity of the whole soil sample and the saturated conductivity of the soil matrix and macroporosity. This allowed for developing a simple multiple linear regression model (R2 = 0.98) of the soil core’s hydraulic conductivity."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058045314","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61dd66ab2467f047f3aaa1fe","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"406","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"9d5b8110-d94f-4c15-b2bc-12a98a3433fa"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"406","pagesFromTo":"115467","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0016706121005474?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61dd66ab2467f047f3aaa1fb","name":"Liang-Cheng","lastName":"Chang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2571eb3c-4861-4f4f-bf84-106a4bcb8cec"},{"objectId":"61dd66ab2467f047f3aaa1fa","name":"Shao-Yiu","lastName":"Hsu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2cd39560-fcdb-4ae7-9945-136eb89cd41c"},{"objectId":"61dd66ab2467f047f3aaa1f7","name":"Mykola","lastName":"Kochiieru","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"033cdcf1-d138-4971-bc56-0cc00e496114"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6593","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Gackiewicz","uuid":"B5802F9EBD544518FCC2E9657B1E8DF2C685C99251D92F2B37FB69823B36E41C307E77B316302DD34DD9C82C4CF73055D8BBD53B7E14B85E85BD79CD90D16680","orcidId":"0000-0003-1278-0457","documentHash":"8bb28110-df35-4dfe-a568-3fa94624ccf5"},{"objectId":"5e709241878c28a0473929b5","name":"Cezary","lastName":"Sławiński","uuid":"36376FCFEAE93FA5B05BBDD359F5F565A80140B59C63F414356C93A423C244A6D1FFF6F430B4824F5A9B13103E9B047387F20B3BEA9D97812C4484216C451545","orcidId":"0000-0003-1083-1644","documentHash":"7d2b2077-903b-4384-9e6e-9c0d18668553"},{"objectId":"5e709241878c28a047392892","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Lamorski","uuid":"B56206672BC03E7414C627C1480BCE5A2A162AD1B38BE224D291B2C3C3F231D256E95C835D4EB07BFA24EC093C90B5697160B2B60F94CB8477F3AA6A4B391639","orcidId":"0000-0001-9678-541X","documentHash":"d927e234-581e-4b23-89a9-425a9d17b398"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115467"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["S-doped nano-TiO2","Photocatalysis","TBBPA","Persistent organic pollutants"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded2","uid":"bhtjxujYsJBDWqZPLXLXOmg","uuid":"30b10b1f-ec48-467e-961f-2ac6fcbeee11","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded2","parentUuid":"30b10b1f-ec48-467e-961f-2ac6fcbeee11","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded2","rootUuid":"30b10b1f-ec48-467e-961f-2ac6fcbeee11","name":"Instytut Chemii i Techniki Jądrowej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709214878c28a04738fab8"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709229878c28a047390e0d","5e709217878c28a04738fbed"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Photocatalytic Degradation of 4,4′-Isopropylidenebis(2,6-dibromophenol) on Sulfur-Doped Nano TiO2","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1944","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-04","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61dd5f4f2467f047f3a7a804","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709229878c28a047390e0d","61dd5f4f2467f047f3a7a807","61dd5f4f2467f047f3a7a808","5e709214878c28a04738fab8","5e709217878c28a04738fbed"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In present work, we examine the photocatalytic properties of S-doped TiO2 (S1, S2) compared to bare TiO2 (S0) in present work. The photocatalytic tests were performed in alkaline aqueous solutions (pH = 10) of three differently substituted phenols (phenol (I), 4,4′-isopropylidenebisphenol (II), and 4,4′-isopropylidenebis(2,6-dibromophenol) (III)). The activity of the catalysts was evaluated by monitoring I, II, III degradation in the reaction mixture. The physicochemical properties (particle size, ζ-potential, Ebg, Eu, E0cb, E0vb, σo, KL) of the catalysts were established, and we demonstrated their influence on degradation reaction kinetics. Substrate degradation rates are consistent with first-order kinetics. The apparent conversion constants of the tested compounds (kapp) in all cases reveal the sulfur-loaded catalyst S2 to show the best photocatalytic activity (for compound I and II S1 and S2 are similarly effective). The different efficiency of photocatalytic degradation I, II and III can be explained by the interactions between the catalyst and the substrate solution. The presence of bromine substituents in the benzene ring additionally allows reduction reactions. The yield of bromide ion release in the degradation reaction III corresponds to the Langmuir constant. The mixed oxidation-reduction degradation mechanism results in higher degradation efficiency. In general, the presence of sulfur atoms in the catalyst network improves the degradation efficiency, but too much sulfur is not desired for the reduction pathway."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058045332","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61d2de162467f0718b0abf0f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"72d88700-5df7-429f-bf3c-1b2ab783a992"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"ID number 361","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/1/361/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61dd5f4f2467f047f3a7a808","name":"Adriana","lastName":"Barylyak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7a7a1a57-d1b9-4960-8aad-6065f136dc40"},{"objectId":"61dd5f4f2467f047f3a7a807","name":"Gerald","lastName":"Hörner","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3883-2879","documentHash":"ae34fe20-aaac-4c18-8e3e-613dd1e6a93f"},{"objectId":"5e709229878c28a047390e0d","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kisała","uuid":"BD54265B4BCB79E2CF317C21D4DE9538ED836EBC06A17DE15CB1BDA86265ADE425B13B0DCF1DAD2CA76A7056ABCCAABEE049FA4F4A2AD1DBF7A4C154B9FB5F57","orcidId":"0000-0003-0014-0866","documentHash":"47423da9-c7bc-45b0-bb22-eb37f7e09a93"},{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fbed","name":"Yaroslav","lastName":"Bobytskyy","uuid":"5F6EE357AA0B8A95F8ED37F3364B94ECEE32FB5F59DE4A5ECD2428E5A8A5D99EDF324758B3DC81C52DA5B476B335F4F129768485E9D4BB9B7DDEDB562B5F0A98","orcidId":"0000-0002-7957-0502","documentHash":"fec93a97-1802-4f06-abf2-889b8442c455"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fab8","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Pogocki","uuid":"29B991ED212FFE1F4A4085EE966A89E43BC438ECFF420F6C9536E0D917C71734E404903EDFF8CE698B2804CB898C7EC458ADA27114408321C3A80413BE48E169","orcidId":"0000-0002-4953-6960","documentHash":"fe6534d3-8a07-4520-bd44-78a568f5a647"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15010361"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Spring barley","Drought","Air humidity","Leaf temperature","Leaf gas exchange"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","parentUuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","rootUuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

A technical analysis, an elemental analysis and the determination of the highest heat value and lowest heat value were performed to define the quality parameters of waste as fuel. In addition, the emission factors of SO2, NOx, CO, CO2 and dust were estimated to demonstrate the impact of potential biowaste from combustion. Based on the stoichiometric equations, the exhaust gas composition, the theoretical oxygen demand and the total flue gas volume were evaluated. The study showed that the material with the highest energy potential was WREG (LHV-16.19 MJ·kg−1), with an ash content of 3.68%, while the lowest potential was found for WRON (LHV-15.88 MJ·kg−1), with an ash content of 4.21%.

The experiment involved one hundred and twenty Ross 308 broiler chickens randomly allocated to three equinumerous groups (SBM, SEC, EFS). Each group was divided into five subgroups—each consisting of eight birds of both sexes (1:1). From Day 1 to Day 21 of life the birds were fed with loose starter rations, and from Day 22 to Day 42 they were fed grower rations based on a wheat meal, protein products and mineral and vitamin admixtures. The experimental factor was a protein raw material comprising: SBM group—soybean meal from GM (genetically modified) seeds, SEC—soybean expeller cake from n-GM seeds, and EFS—extruded full-fat soybean from n-GM seeds. The experimental diets were isocaloric and isonitrogenous. It was demonstrated that replacing soybean meal with SEC or EFS in feed rations for broiler chickens led to a significant (p < 0.05) weight gain on Day 42 of rearing by 4.57% and 2.88%, respectively. The chickens fed diets with EFS had worse (more than 4.14%) feed conversion rate (FCR) in comparison to the others (p < 0.05). Broiler chickens from the SBM and SEC groups showed a higher share of breast and leg muscles (by 4.74% and 7.54%) and a lower share of abdominal fat (by 31.1%) and skin with subcutaneous fat (by 18.8% and 13.4%) in comparison with birds from the EFS group (p < 0.05). The\nhighest content of intramuscular fat with the best fatty acids profile was determined in the muscles of birds fed with diets containing EFS, while the muscles of chickens receiving SEC scored the highest. The results provide grounds for recommending SEC in broiler chicken nutrition as it allowed for obtaining the best production and slaughter results, whereas—from the point of view of the human diet - EFS should be recommended since it best modified the lipid fraction of muscles."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058047723","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61ee63e02467f068913c3d90","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"128a5d55-c045-4c51-adcf-97e457298ade"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/12/3/294/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61f16cf22467f06d26fa2a33","name":"Mohamed","lastName":"Saleh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"35a8c3ee-1703-4b0a-af0c-39e88e154e29"},{"objectId":"61f16cf22467f06d26fa2a31","name":"Daria","lastName":"Pietrusiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0a52cb91-e2ed-4935-8565-20b1d336f5bd"},{"objectId":"60c325849543c72336543ed8","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Łaski","uuid":"11610C2907A7E1F3A37D203D27B482830C513AA3259CB7F02DCB2E18381C5649DCE197162B7C7D605FBEAA527431C00AD958E8A14A54951B454C5D0F57A2A59F","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"99f1262a-665d-4eaf-99f0-3d17f7fc592d"},{"objectId":"5e709294878c28a047398502","name":"Alina","lastName":"Janocha","uuid":"0493B1407DDC7BBD29840F86B0917176BABC73981B3C713EBC506E80B96018D59EEFEC6487AC3AF6A3A642024DC64051A7409AD97E9CDB6A6D9EC8113A4B7132","orcidId":"0000-0002-5891-0774","documentHash":"29b4b88c-3a97-4209-97ac-57924f175073"},{"objectId":"5e709294878c28a04739848e","name":"Anna","lastName":"Milczarek","uuid":"A8FCC5F1F4C08951B0C431543C4411844F1220E3525BDBA0EA3AA8CFE0F7C6196236E9780925F4AD49E112D347391FD4DBBD9E0E2CC4B850C34DE2DBFDE15A5C","orcidId":"0000-0002-2714-3533","documentHash":"db96f28a-4bae-4893-abf1-338d2c0da2d1"}],"doi":"10.3390/ani12030294"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Antifungal activity","Benzodiazepine","Candida","Cytotoxicity","Tetrazole"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Tetrazole derivatives bearing benzodiazepine moiety—synthesis and action mode against virulence of Candida albicans","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477bcb","mniswId":"6215","title":"European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","doi":null,"issn":"0223-5234","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"9a4bba3f-8fd0-4f24-984f-684fbfb8e0d2"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61f1bf502467f06d26fd4b61","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093f9878c28a0473b44c6","5e709327878c28a0473a3c2d","5e709327878c28a0473a3c41","65ca002940970762634b8edf","65ca002940970762634b8ee0","65ca002940970762634b8ee1","65ca002940970762634b8ee2"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Tetrazole and benzodiazepine derivatives attract widespread attention due to their remarkable pharmaceutical\r\npotential. 5-(2-bromophenyl)-7-fluoro-1-[3-(5-(4-chlorophenyl)-2H-tetrazol-2-yl)propyl]-\r\n1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (6c) and 5-(2-bromophenyl)-7-fluoro-1-[3-(5-(2-\r\nchlorophenyl)-2H-tetrazol-2-yl)propyl]-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (6d) were selected\r\nusing the microdilution approach and because of their preferential fungicidal activity toward C. albicans.\r\n6c or 6d altered the hyphal morphology, chitin deposition and membrane permeation in planktonic and\r\nsessile cells.

Twenty-five youth soccer players were divided into groups: non-supplemented (GN) and supplemented (GS) with a vitamin D dose of 20 000 IU twice a week for 8 weeks. The study was conducted during an 8-week preseason period, from mid-January to mid-March. At baseline (T1) and at the end of this period (T2), the serum concentrations of 25(OH)D, (PTH), osteocalcin (OC) and β-isomerized C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (β-CTx) were measured. At T2, 25(OH)D increased by 70% in GS (p = 0.004) and by 6% in GN (p > 0.05). Significant differences between GS and GN groups were observed throughout the study in the group-by-time interaction and changes of 25(OH)D (p = 0.002; η2p = 0.36) and OC (p = 0.008; η2p = 0.26). Increased OC (ES = 0.74; moderate) and β-CTx (ES = 1.31, large) in GN athletes who had an optimal baseline vitamin D level (GO) were observed. In GN, at T2, β-CTx positively correlated with PTH and OC (p = 0.007 and p = 0.002). In GS, β-CTx positively correlated with OC at both time points (T1, p = 0.027 and T2, p = 0.037). A negative correlation between 25(OH)D and PTH was observed at T2 (p = 0.018). The obtained results suggest that the 20 000 IU vitamin D3 dose applied twice a week for 8 weeks is effective for vitamin D compensation and sufficient to maintain the correct PTH concentration, as revealed by changes in the bone marker concentrations.

Polyploids are often characterised by increased resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Since drought and pathogen attack are the main threats to apple cultivation, obtaining new sources of resistance is an important issue for apple breeding. The newly obtained autotetraploid clones of apple cv. ‘Redchief’ showed superior resistance to fire blight. The aim of the presented research was the in-depth phenotypic characterisation of ‘Redchief’ tetraploids and assessment of their response to drought at the physiological and genetic level. The growth of own-rooted five-year-old trees of ‘Redchief’ tetraploids was poor compared with diploids; all growth parameters—the number and length of current season shoots, the total length of current season shoots per tree and the cross-section area of the trunk—were reduced in tetraploid clones. Grafting on M9 rootstock improved the growth characteristics of ‘Redchief’ tetraploids. Compared with diploid plants, the leaves of tetraploids were thicker, with altered shape, higher chlorophyll content, and larger stomata, but the stomatal density decreased. The leaf anatomical structure of tetraploids was changed, the adaxial and abaxial epidermis and both types of mesophyll were significantly thicker than in diploids. Moreover, the pollen grains of tetraploids were larger, but their viability and germination were reduced. Under conditions of limited water supply, the reduction in growth parameters was smaller and the physiological parameters were higher in the ‘Redchief’ tetraploid clone 4x-25 than in diploid plants. The expression of APX gene was higher in tetraploids than in diploids 15 days after drought stress induction. The results suggest the enhanced drought tolerance of the studied ‘Redchief’ autotetraploid clone compared with its diploid counterpart."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058047936","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61d431cf2467f0627d077fec","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"f75e7399-5df9-48a8-bced-9ecdfd23d8d2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"161","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/1/161/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61f27aeb2467f039a444c878","name":"Przemysław

(HA) mediated fusion of influenza virus envelope with host lipid membrane is a critical step warrantying virus entry to the cell. Despite tremendous advances in structural biology methods, the knowledge concerning the details of HA2 subunit insertion into the target membrane and its subsequent bilayer perturbing effect is still rather limited. Herein, based on a set of molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the structure and interaction with lipid membrane of the N-terminal HA2 region comprising a trimer of fusion peptides (HAfps) tethered by flexible linkers to a fragment of coiled-coil stem structure. We find that, prior to insertion into the membrane, HAfps within the trimers do not sample space individually but rather associate into a compact hydrophobic aggregate. Once within the membrane, they fold into tight helical hairpins, which remain at the lipid-water interface. However, they can also assume stable, membrane-spanning configurations of significantly increased membrane-perturbing potential. In this latter case, HAfps trimers centre around the well-hydrated transmembrane channel-forming distinct, symmetric assemblies, whose wedge-like shape may play a role in promoting membrane curvature. We also demonstrate that, following HAfps insertion, the coiled-coil stem spontaneously tilts to almost membrane-parallel orientation, reflecting experimentally observed configuration adopted in the course of membrane fusion by complete HA2 units at the rim of membrane contact zones."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058047959","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2022.826366","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602e5ce99543c7410626f1af","name":"Michał","lastName":"Michalski","uuid":"EBDF9814726D20863B9399EC6A927AB0E118D4AB3CCD50DDBAF257254889FD9BDE32DE2F2F587C81FA9DB317371EC6941E19C6C40225BD395732BBDE4D394AA2","orcidId":"0000-0001-6969-2074","documentHash":"0eef5040-94d4-412a-9468-cb8237056852"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af721","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Setny","uuid":"281295C132C4E728693CC608217C67CB5C1114C9B19BF8D03347E6E6C37336B33E3F83C453B6F6AC0C2C78DB53BCFF60782A0970925C26DF21A39081CD1547BB","orcidId":"0000-0002-0769-0943","documentHash":"eb11c0a3-9550-469f-a0f5-2fb8bc608e56"}],"doi":"10.3389/fmolb.2022.826366"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Esports","Cognitive performance","Cognition","Video game","Esports athletes","Nutrition habits"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","uid":"bqEBivGW4eOgmsFFDSCuw-g","uuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","parentUuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","rootUuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego i Sportu im.

This review aims to discuss the potential beneficial effects of micronutrients, i.e., vitamins, minerals and biologically active substances on cognitive functions of e-athletes. Minerals (iodine, zinc, iron, magnesium) and vitamins (B vitamins, vitamins E, D, and C) are significant factors that positively influence cognitive functions. Prevention of deficiencies of the listed ingredients and regular examinations can support cognitive processes. The beneficial effects of caffeine, creatine, and probiotics have been documented so far. There are many plant products, herbal extracts, or phytonutrients that have been shown to affect precognitive activity, but more research is needed. Beetroot juice and nootropics can also be essential nutrients for cognitive performance. For the sake of players’ eyesight, it would be useful to use lutein, which, in addition to improving vision and protecting against eye diseases, can also affect cognitive functions. In supporting the physical and mental abilities of e-athletes the base is a well-balanced diet with adequate hydration. There is a lack of sufficient evidence that has investigated the relationship between dietary effects and improved performance in esports. Therefore, there is a need for randomized controlled trials involving esports players."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058048046","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"186","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/10/2/186/htm","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61f3d5452467f061bc106b6e","name":"Monika","lastName":"Szot","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3388-0342","documentHash":"320337a6-1531-4283-bbaf-139668469328"},{"objectId":"602f38b19543c7410626f213","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Karpęcka","uuid":"05F9F9268DDEC0410B714FCF411C4E9E26AA06C5CC6FC2C08FE8E367D774A7E08900DF800DF88E7909A599864F36E6DD115B17ED8F3C2F853EF5E435E0AA9181","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"912d9046-60d6-41dd-9116-41d25529ef58"},{"objectId":"5e709331878c28a0473a4a96","name":"BARBARA","lastName":"FRĄCZEK","uuid":"ED820C009CBC7203002AC74BECD5E944DB8C434DAA606FBF677E2A48A504E78910D34ED705F7C7D0CB3EED6A4E18C6A99EE352A8DB0F63F1245B5AFA3BEB0ECE","orcidId":"0000-0002-5673-6135","documentHash":"e88f4f36-dc7f-4196-83fc-ce368440d040"},{"objectId":"5e70920c878c28a04738f16c","name":"Remigiusz","lastName":"Dróżdż","uuid":"4D6364E30A5A501EE31C5B1A048A40C0F564241A613C6EE12D8EC907B4981029E296A22B4DB1BF846F308940AA09FAE50C646E04BB89866DB28344BBD947A7B2","orcidId":"0000-0003-0282-7442","documentHash":"47f504a0-80b6-4314-bcc5-1a06403f6964"}],"doi":"10.3390/healthcare10020186"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"61f3f49b2467f061bc137db6","doi":null,"title":"Spektrum

The results showed that the EC of the non-wetting fluid remained constant at a high wetting fluid saturation and then decreased nonlinearly. However, the EC of the wetting fluid exhibited more complex trends. In the 2-D micromodel, the number of loops decreased monotonously, reached zero, and remained constant for lower saturations, while the number of distinct components fluctuated because of the appearance and disappearance of disconnected clusters. In the 2-D model, the number of distinct components played a significant role; in the 3-D X-ray CT experiment, the number of loops of pendular rings dominated the EC. The findings suggest that the trends observed in the 2-D micromodel may not apply under 3-D

formation and diffusion of point defects have a detrimental impact on the functionality of devices in which a high quality AlN/GaN heterointerface is required. The present paper demonstrated the heights of the migration energy barriers of native point defects throughout the AlN/GaN heterointerface, as well as the corresponding profiles of energy bands calculated by means of density functional theory. Both neutral and charged nitrogen, gallium, and aluminium vacancies were studied, as well as their complexes with a substitutional III-group element. Three diffusion mechanisms, that is, the vacancy mediated, direct interstitial, and indirect ones, in bulk AlN and GaN crystals, as well at the AlN/GaN heterointerface, were taken into account. We showed that metal vacancies migrated across the AlN/GaN interface, overcoming a lower potential barrier than that of the nitrogen vacancy. Additionally, we demonstrated the effect of the inversion of the electric field in the presence of charged point defects V3−Ga and V3−Al at the AlN/GaN heterointerface, not reported so far. Our findings contributed to the issues of structure design, quality control, and improvement of the interfacial abruptness of the AlN/GaN heterostructures."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058050719","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e1cce32467f00328313fea","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"6feccc50-4f6d-4a2d-a4de-8b8445857aea"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"478","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/2/478/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5fc49bb9085dcb1e6ae0b866","name":"Roman","lastName":"Hrytsak","uuid":"D66F338E20487FFFFA9641D2C21F10778CDE17E93E466511216D76A05EBD2917F004FE6FD9CE54E9085FE17D76EC33D6DC7F6AAAE04A163A4D81198666F75AE4","orcidId":"0000-0002-5467-0953","documentHash":"78a8b650-0373-4ef8-b472-0f8a59ad26e4"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473bea67","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Grzanka","uuid":"4FE27496E14EE1D5DF8E57912FDCE77A8E8757E42C5D4F67091333389DE8843C272FA4CCFB6099419845DD5B684B0760AEBE2B8B8B21392A18E2C225C7B64C2F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5123-1480","documentHash":"07a91e49-8a0d-4e59-b4e4-e4e737ba7bfe"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5917","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Kempisty","uuid":"297D4BB0037ABCF2BD2C107CAF3939A7B26192FEEC3392E1F9C5A7C6B5E4FA233F2E7F2132C9B094CCDCFC8AA82CE07355C68241555366CF0E35751E36170E70","orcidId":"0000-0003-0700-5560","documentHash":"06eda3d9-1b7f-4f6b-86fe-4bdf31f919bc"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b5899","name":"Michał","lastName":"Leszczyński","uuid":"8E2235D4121ED52B1F146F58BB398106DD98365AE7A683AAA801E06B1ABFA40854D53AC29DA0097F758C0D0C4DEC8C6B8A92DF28834102A9BF48AED0D4F2F5BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-9321-9268","documentHash":"463f53d5-eb5b-47e0-b7d8-6e272ee8ea19"},{"objectId":"5e709216878c28a04738fb34","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Sznajder","uuid":"6DC2B29A2ED99F729310C2F571AF44663CE09A422C1D761DC4959572F8F527146285E864F6C6B81EAAE7AF9837A989228C01641BD3389036A35543AB7E0DE77E","orcidId":"0000-0003-4701-9991","documentHash":"8fccf1ff-e227-42c6-99a0-59010f1a21b6"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15020478"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70926a878c28a0473954a4","5e709335878c28a0473a4eac","5e709269878c28a047395448","5e7092ba878c28a04739b924","6040ca449543c711bc6ea883"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A novel, Fourier series based method of control optimization and its application to a discontinuous capsule drive model","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478246","mniswId":"9116","title":"International Journal of Mechanical Sciences","doi":null,"issn":"0020-7403","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"49e20cf4-b4db-4300-be3b-0f88052379f2"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61f989902467f07621d2e2f1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6040ca449543c711bc6ea883","5e7092ba878c28a04739b924","5e70926a878c28a0473954a4","5e709335878c28a0473a4eac","5e709269878c28a047395448","6735f0d6fdbe832d85a48d14"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents a novel, Fourier series based numerical method of open-loop control optimization. Due to its flexible assumptions, it can be applied in a large variety of systems, including discontinuous ones or even “black boxes”, whose equations are not fully known. This aspect is particularly important in mechanical systems, where friction or impact induced discontinuities are common. The paper includes a mathematical background of the new method, a detailed discussion of the algorithm and a practical, numerical example, in which control function of a discontinuous capsule drive is optimized. It is expected that the proposed method can facilitate research in all areas where control of non-smooth, discontinuous or “black box” systems is crucial. In particular, authors hope that the presented algorithm is going to be used for control optimization of other capsule drives."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058053125","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61f989902467f07621d2e2fa","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"219","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"c9ee34e5-8586-4b99-8d57-b0d57ed6fd4d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"219","pagesFromTo":"107104","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002074032200039X?via%3Dihub#!","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6735f0d6fdbe832d85a48d14","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Sagan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fd3a8510-c812-45e3-a99e-dacdc3500b7c"},{"objectId":"6040ca449543c711bc6ea883","name":"Sandra","lastName":"Zarychta","uuid":"B4E2E45235102A020F8764C0C72F189F9198AEE01058C259DF1131321B1545FEFD2369CEAF5BE5BEA0634105E789B70DB70DFC4A25E2386D287FC98953D8DF80","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a7516d7a-4ec6-45eb-8cb4-2b01d5dd907b"},{"objectId":"5e709335878c28a0473a4eac","name":"Artur","lastName":"Dąbrowski","uuid":"6B8EC12822C014F6A6484138CD4E2EEA3F4CDB72CC17FB4DA8A6495121304772A46CC427F8F95923C99B9196A186251785AF002A9D804593ABB367B746C6A5F5","orcidId":"0000-0001-9536-7371","documentHash":"8621a140-a3c7-434d-8e01-7303c39acf74"},{"objectId":"5e7092ba878c28a04739b924","name":"Marek","lastName":"Balcerzak","uuid":"65DE51836F75A67CCB690A92F8C505E0EB8A594D00895ECC221D82C1D5BD965471F4205A76855FCD986BEFFCB300E5C3AB56BD7CECF1631B787E252FE8815F21","orcidId":"0000-0002-2144-6162","documentHash":"5d82f92b-f1b4-498c-91b1-bbf8e0af72ee"},{"objectId":"5e70926a878c28a0473954a4","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kapitaniak","uuid":"9B60F8090803FDE545A9AB67675838BE2103D0B62F134643012D2E4A2914D83C69DDA928DE6FE366F9B756A3385A7FD4C6C87C7BEF17F9B8B9E5F4BE1809654E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9651-752X","documentHash":"0d96a52a-dbb4-44e0-8f5b-3c42335a53fa"},{"objectId":"5e709269878c28a047395448","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Stefański","uuid":"70AB03E232ADD47A018C455E29D7CA1CB91D0DF3DF61CC0CE6D16C881D0175BCFF871C0F188F1EACC748AFBB0B9AC197EE5942D933D4FC62A260026F5DD35CA1","orcidId":"0000-0002-3210-5080","documentHash":"27be6e56-4149-4a29-af46-abf6a88af4bb"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2022.107104"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Motivation

The foetal programming hypothesis states that the mother's condition during pregnancy has a profound impact on the development of her offspring.1 This leads to permanent alterations in the children's organs and systems if their mothers experienced severe stress during pregnancy. The probable explanation is that maternal glucocorticoids pass through the placenta and affect i.a. foetal brain development. This increases the risk of numerous disorders in later life. Studies have shown a higher risk of disturbed foetal growth patterns when mothers experienced prenatal maternal stress due to natural disasters"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058053139","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"111","pagesFromTo":"336-337","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/apa.16122","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61f7f6142467f01b5a1b6be3","name":"Kaushik","lastName":"Bose","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"04ec0c0f-717a-46c8-a4c6-0d62c7207073"},{"objectId":"61f7f6142467f01b5a1b6be2","name":"Raja","lastName":"Chakraborty","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5d1abca0-b4c6-4060-9731-8f59d9c8d0c0"},{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c34ad","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Kozieł","uuid":"B2D0C90AC06CD4DF05D9DFBC48911C17457174C1E1660BB0B986BFD6C97FB13C976F4029AC292C4F2ACCCF086A7036D21FBD2807C175E31FC432464935E80860","orcidId":"0000-0002-0584-4427","documentHash":"63a06e67-ba52-47ed-a6c7-5bc24c92f87d"},{"objectId":"5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c94","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Gomuła","uuid":"39943A79F4646DC4A7933C134FB6DDAAE8182AE2D7B11127892F202A8E7957C29569A85E16191D9DA4AB678919CA0701B2372349CF99CD57C34125F90DA52E95","orcidId":"0000-0003-2206-1659","documentHash":"b410a5ec-142a-4ad7-8e54-790d6f3d6bfc"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473be99a","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Nowak-Szczepańska","uuid":"20557B38C2C4D789FF5E33E022B57EB9B5658DAFBAAA91DBF5A319101EFC2267D963A57C345F7D7EC2EFE62A8FDB26C01CFC89ED17EF42878B0A58274ECFD5D7","orcidId":"0000-0003-2774-992X","documentHash":"b09606f8-29d1-4ddd-ac30-c5cc3c47b741"}],"doi":"10.1111/apa.16122"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","uid":"bhdVW0TkXv39ZSgac65mGnw","uuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","parentUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","rootUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","name":"Uniwersytet Komisji Edukacji Narodowej w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a0473982dd"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092eb878c28a04739f39a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Thickness of Talus Deposits in the Periglacial Area of SW Spitsbergen (Fugleberget Mountainside) in the Light of Slope Development Theories","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547cb5e","mniswId":"13432","title":"Land","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2073-445X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"526e229c-a50e-45eb-9385-cb37ef6ed765"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61f7c3762467f01b5a183a70","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709292878c28a0473982dd","5e7092eb878c28a04739f39a"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Periglacial slopes are susceptible to recent climate change. The rate of morphogenetic processes depends on numerous factors. The most important of these is the warming of the air and ground, increased precipitation (extreme rainfall in particular), and the rate of snow cover decay. The dynamics of these processes may effectively modify contemporary slope development models. The paper shows the structure of selected talus slopes on a Fugleberget mountainside, based on field observations and radar (GPR) soundings. The results are then compared to classical slope models. The radar survey in April and May 2014 used a RAMAC CU II Malå GeoScience system equipped with a 30 MHz RTA antenna (Rough Terrain Antenna). Five GPR profiles of different lengths were obtained along the talus axes, transversally on Fugleberget and partly on the Hansbreen lateral moraine. According to the radar soundings, the maximum thickness of the debris deposits is 25–30 m. The thickness of the weathered material increases towards the talus cone’s terminal part, and debris deposits overlap marine sediments. The talus slopes’ morphometry shows that their current forms differ from standard slope models, which may be due to the significant acceleration of geomorphic processes resulting from climate change, including rapid warming in the last four decades."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058053190","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61f7c3762467f01b5a183a76","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"11","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"bdadf6d1-217b-4968-99c4-42cefc598126"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"id. 209","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/11/2/209/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092eb878c28a04739f39a","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Grabiec","uuid":"AEDA88D8B66E73C593E4A89C430F733971659A62FA0DE31ED7DA770D3E07D1FAA11EB9E1D743E6A206089F1FC38751AF4F3B4C5A731170A506C68D6CA35AE44E","orcidId":"0000-0002-1991-3577","documentHash":"2ab7bead-1da0-41a7-934e-5e8d5e1d87d2"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a0473982dd","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Dolnicki","uuid":"17ACD8B514D2D0AC9CAF9FC3F1CE5D8288CE6555ABF8293361597474F2508E819AD20DF7A3374A90672C1C265BC6395E24158805E17CDDC8E19F2E8CA8699357","orcidId":"0000-0001-5729-6621","documentHash":"6e2c97aa-6899-4829-8a1a-e7d3930c6249"}],"doi":"10.3390/land11020209"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1d5","uid":"bJAF3J7gD1iEjREYkfNvHfQ","uuid":"9ab5d088-ab1d-4ba8-8cf3-3b1ed670a267","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wydział Nowych Technologii i Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f5878c28a0473b3fc7","5e70938e878c28a0473acba9","5e7094cd878c28a0473c40fc"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"InSb Nanowire Direct Growth on Plastic for Monolithic Flexible Device Fabrication","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa81c9aff2974850c976","mniswId":"28924","title":"ACS Applied Electronic Materials","doi":null,"issn":"2637-6113","eissn":null,"websiteLink":"https://pubs.acs.org/page/aaembp/about.html","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"1bac7638-ec49-4a56-a9f7-bef74b1a32e6"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61fa25542467f013ba90b071","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61fa25542467f013ba90b072","61fa25542467f013ba90b073","61fa25542467f013ba90b077","61fa25542467f013ba90b078","61fa25542467f013ba90b079","61fa25542467f013ba90b07a","61fa25542467f013ba90b07b","5e70938e878c28a0473acba9","5e7094cd878c28a0473c40fc","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3fc7"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We report direct growth of InSb nanowires (NWs) and monolithic device fabrication on flexible plastic substrates.

a real solid there are different types of defects. During sudden cooling, near cracks, there can appear high thermal stresses. In this paper, the time-fractional heat conduction equation is studied in an infinite space with an external circular crack with the interior radius R in the case of axial symmetry.

trees are important to maintain biodiversity and, therefore, need public acceptance. Few studies, however, have addressed the topic of social acceptability of old trees. The aim of this research was to examine city residents’ perception of old trees, including hollow-bearing ones, mainly in the aspect of safety and aesthetics. A total of 448 Warsaw municipal forest’ users expressed their opinions by completing an online questionnaire. Several methods were used to analyse the results of the study: the Chi-square test of independence, the Kruskal–Wallis H test, the Mann–Whitney U test and the Quartimax method of factor rotation analysis. The results revealed a correlation between the frequency of forest visits and the level of sensitivity toward old trees, which translates to less radical notion of danger and less radical decisions about cutting such trees down. Age of the respondents (56+) was a factor contributing to higher willingness to protect and care for old trees. The results also indicated that outdoor activity in the urban forest may increase ancient trees acceptance by developing emotional connection with them, and eventually contribute to their protection.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058053517","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61f795e92467f01b5a145410","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"10","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"e49a7406-3036-4d7c-beb0-21fd12ae9576"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"e12700","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://peerj.com/articles/12700/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61fa36d62467f013ba90d6b0","name":"Beata","lastName":"Pachnowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0f450bed-6d0b-47bf-bedd-67e59c8e7824"},{"objectId":"61fa36d62467f013ba90d6af","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Heciak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a4609c32-4656-49eb-9dd2-f05b48f13351"},{"objectId":"61fa36d62467f013ba90d6ae","name":"Agata","lastName":"Jarska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"44ec1bbd-0eae-422b-a009-a6b55132854c"},{"objectId":"61fa36d62467f013ba90d6ad","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Ciemniewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eeb5cb50-8301-42c7-bf24-eb057582892b"},{"objectId":"61fa36d62467f013ba90d6ac","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Gawłowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7c59806a-9d75-4145-b3da-04b0f03ee926"},{"objectId":"61fa36d62467f013ba90d6ab","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Błaszczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fac79e8b-f02b-4702-844a-e03cf350e216"},{"objectId":"61fa36d62467f013ba90d6aa","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Wojnowska-Heciak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8f9cb56a-be8e-4f14-8fa1-e26c0233b096"},{"objectId":"61fa36d62467f013ba90d6a9","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Suchocka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"399112f4-a919-446a-84db-1f9956860f7a"}],"doi":"10.7717/peerj.12700"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"61e556832467f0034f0c8216","doi":null,"title":"Idee, narody, państwa, pogranicza : tom wykładowców na jubileusz 30-lecia Studium Europy Wschodniej UW : monografia zbiorowa","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-67208-09-3","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://katalogi.uj.edu.pl/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma991016804620205067&context=L&vid=48OMNIS_UJA:uja&lang=pl&search_scope=MyInstitution&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=LibraryCatalog&query=any,contains,9788367208093&offset=0","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"a5b965de-1d36-4d6a-8bd9-f8899cb6d398","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb90c","mniswId":"61900","name":"Uniwersytet Warszawski","documentHash":"e562d3bb-53a6-4c01-be6b-23d7e3b6bd3e"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dc86","uid":"b53mJQrrydfOeTNm01VB6ZQ","uuid":"7da28615-12f7-408a-8cc0-b1bc42b85990","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Orientalistyczny","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094b2878c28a0473c1d7d"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Nauka czy polityka historyczna?

previously described involvement of the MYC/miR-150/MYB/ZDHHC11 network in the growth of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells. Here we studied the relevance of this network in the two other B-cell lymphomas: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Expression levels of the network components were assessed at the RNA and protein level. The effect of modulating levels of the network components on cell growth was determined through GFP competition assay. AGO2-RNA immunoprecipitation was performed to validate targeting by miR-150. Expression levels of MYC, MYB and ZDHHC11 were increased, while miR-150 levels were decreased similar to the pattern observed in BL. The knockdown of MYC, MYB and ZDHHC11 decreased the growth of HL and DLBCL cells. In contrast, overexpression of miR-150 did not induce clear phenotypes in HL, and limited the effects in DLBCL. This could not be explained by the differences in overexpression levels. Furthermore, we showed that in HL, ZDHHC11 and MYB are efficiently targeted by miR-150. To conclude, MYC, MYB and ZDHHC11 are critical for the growth of HL and DLBCL cells consistent with the role observed in BL cells, while low endogenous miR-150 levels appeared to be less critical for the growth of HL and DLBCL cells despite the effective targeting of ZDHHC11 and MYB."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058053600","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61fa4c1c2467f013ba91341e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"0e9a9b8f-26fd-4d42-bc08-1aa261df3825"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"227","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4425/13/2/227/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61fa4c1c2467f013ba91341c","name":"Joost","lastName":"Kluiver","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7650-2937","documentHash":"6f3a2dc0-f0d9-417e-a487-4ccf3e1d907f"},{"objectId":"61fa4c1c2467f013ba91341b","name":"Anke","lastName":"van den Berg","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8894-2638","documentHash":"35bf558f-1fe8-453c-ad2d-aebcb996f453"},{"objectId":"61fa4c1c2467f013ba913419","name":"Fazlyn R.

For these purposes, gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, DPPH radical-scavenging assay, agar and disc diffusion, and vapor phase methods were used. The results from the volatile profile determination showed that δ-cadinene (36.3%), (Z)-β-farnesene (13.8%), viridiflorol (7.3%), and himachala-2,4-diene (5.4%) were the major components of the EO chemical constitution. Based on the obtained results, a strong antioxidant effect (81.1%) of the CEO was found. CEO is characterized by diversified antimicrobial activity, and the zones of inhibition ranged from 7.33 to 21.36 mm in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and from 5.44 to 13.67 mm in yeasts and fungi. The lowest values of minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) were noted against gram-positive Micrococcus luteus (7.46 µL/mL) and against yeast Candida krusei (9.46 µL/mL). It seems that the vapor phase of CEO can inhibit the growth of the microscopic filamentous fungi of the genus Penicillium according to in situ antifungal analysis on bread, carrots, and celery. This finding confirms the impact of CEO on the change in the protein structure of older biofilms of Pseudomonas fluorescens and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica. Insecticidal activity of a vapor phase has also been demonstrated against Pyrrhocoris apterus. CEO showed various advantages on antimicrobial activity, and it is an ideal substitute for food safety."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058053629","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e7d6632467f05e2961f3fe","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"11","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"d3f788bd-8bc4-46da-a86f-64fc6aa76c38"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"358","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/11/3/358/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61f6dbcf2467f020ebd2c279","name":"Nenad L.","lastName":"Vukovic","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f5d484c6-850b-4be0-83f0-6e365f17cb70"},{"objectId":"61f6dbcf2467f020ebd2c278","name":"Milena","lastName":"Vukic","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"56949067-dd1f-41a9-a032-83e7664d1d5f"},{"objectId":"61f6dbcf2467f020ebd2c277","name":"Natália","lastName":"Čmiková","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"818491c9-37cc-45a8-bffc-dc83c50fef09"},{"objectId":"61f6dbcf2467f020ebd2c276","name":"Jana","lastName":"Štefániková","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3799-4390","documentHash":"990926a5-b9da-4d5f-bf0d-513a0c3f0ab2"},{"objectId":"61f6dbcf2467f020ebd2c275","name":"Hana","lastName":"Ďuranová","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7274-6210","documentHash":"f8584529-df89-4b72-8a5f-856ebaec2d46"},{"objectId":"61f6dbcf2467f020ebd2c274","name":"Veronika","lastName":"Valková","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7048-6323","documentHash":"a5d43f59-8d99-48b2-ae93-65962e7339f7"},{"objectId":"61f6dbcf2467f020ebd2c273","name":"Lucia","lastName":"Galovičová","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1203-4115","documentHash":"cddd29a1-793b-4c90-a523-10015d69d8a1"},{"objectId":"5e7094d9878c28a0473c533c","name":"Miroslava","lastName":"Kacaniova","uuid":"A4FEB7DDD74B9C91CF82C8FA0C8F4F1BB525A36849B53E66BB4E6411D5E4F11265062F7307A3FD2484590169A6B3921DDA802A9AD06950FA42CF15FBCB7078D3","orcidId":"0000-0002-4460-0222","documentHash":"9830f862-8289-487d-b8b0-5198c0abfe0a"},{"objectId":"5e709472878c28a0473bd37b","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Kowalczewski","uuid":"DE6CB135EA3EC9DEFAD4D1903F445B04F935CDE49DF028924FE4C2B542B69B3DCE4DD80636C1F2B5FCF8D125090539F66C6AE3409827CB09FE577B21D81042E9","orcidId":"0000-0002-0153-4624","documentHash":"243c1264-fd70-4d77-b348-a3a1df8cbf0d"}],"doi":"10.3390/plants11030358"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","uid":"b1CAWFlsJj7f886P9BWoCUQ","uuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","parentUuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","rootUuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","name":"Uniwersytet Radomski im.

For this reason, nowadays plants are widely used to produce natural cosmetics and foods. In these studies, the properties of the water extracts of Papaver rhoeas L., Punica granatum L., Clitoria ternatea L., Carthamus tinctorius L., and Gomphrena globosa L., as bioactive, natural dyes, were investigated. Plant flower extracts were tested for their antioxidant (ABTS and DPPH radical methods) and anti-inflammatory effects by determining the ability to inhibit the activity of lipoxygenase and proteinase. The extracts were tested for their cytotoxic effect on skin cells, using Alamar Blue and Neutral Red tests. The ability to inhibit the activity of enzymes responsible for the destruction of elastin and collagen was also studied. Research has shown that extracts have no toxic effect on skin cells, are a rich source of antioxidants and show the ability to inhibit the activity of elastase and collagenase enzymes. P. rhoeas extract showed the strongest antioxidant properties with IC50 value of 24.8 ± 0.42 µg/mL and 47.5 ± 1.01 µg/mL in ABTS and DPPH tests, respectively. The tested plants are also characterized by an anti-inflammatory property, for which the ability to inhibit lipoxygenase at a level above 80% and proteinase at the level of about 55% was noted. Extracts from P. rhoeas, C. ternatea, and C. tinctorius show the strongest coloring ability and can permanently dye cosmetic products, without significant color changes during the storage of the product."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058053670","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63c124d24097076d26875e6d","name":"Zofia","lastName":"Hordyjewicz-Baran","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7c2c8c6c-3c10-4f62-b10b-31d33c1b5ecc"},{"objectId":"63c124d24097076d26875e6c","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Lal","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"be707005-9351-4c21-b7e2-0054ab8a5f73"},{"objectId":"63c124d24097076d26875e6b","name":"Zofia","lastName":"Nizioł-Łukaszewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7859f2c6-71e4-4bcc-b4a3-f3dc9e3db5ae"},{"objectId":"63c124d24097076d26875e6a","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Ziemlewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e9824753-e19b-4e48-903a-102a316a885c"},{"objectId":"63c124d24097076d26875e69","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Zagórska-Dziok","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"616e4480-ddce-49f0-893d-4a27e0eaa99f"},{"objectId":"63c124d24097076d26875e68","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Bujak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a03d93a9-531d-4375-9b63-70ee8379a9a0"},{"objectId":"5e709262878c28a047394cc1","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Wasilewski","uuid":"227D4E7D3EC4AF982A206DE70C399770182A9F544DE89CD4A18E6892004978A5F8522483CCBE7CB3E71F340D5E14D7823230BFA43E06FC74A59AB9BB45BB64A5","orcidId":"0000-0002-0498-6415","documentHash":"8d6fb98f-0688-44ef-afce-85111765f8e0"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules27030922"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["standardization","judicial discourse","arrêt de la Cour de cassation","judgment"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"64ccb1164097077ac1d7faa6","doi":null,"title":"Law, language and the Courtroom : legal linguistics and the discourse of judges","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-0-3677-2185-5","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/287525","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":null,"translationFromPolish":null,"bookProjectNCN":null,"bookProjectFNP":null,"bookProjectNPHR":null,"bookProjectUE":null},"documentHash":"59a5c434-4652-45f7-b67e-90055f785691","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb75f","mniswId":"2100","name":"Routledge","documentHash":"64cc346c-fb88-4618-a71a-f3105e672a66"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Standardization in judicial discourse: the case of the evolution of the French arrêts de la Cour de cassation and the use of forms in European procedural law","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61f831632467f01b5a1f6b14","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709415878c28a0473b5f9a"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Standardisation in judicial discourse can be analysed on two levels, linguistic and legal, with regard to concepts pertaining both to positive law and to procedural law.

The approach on such a twofold level reflects the two dimensions of standardisation: the speciality, which is systematically linked to a discipline of reference, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the linguistic and discursive dimension which can be assessed by analysing texts. Standardisation is a pervasive phenomenon both linguistically and legally. Linguistically, the major difficulty regarding the standard lies in the variety of formulations being used.

This volume examines the literary representations of the Armenian genocide, the Holocaust, and the massacre in Srebrenica in a rich, detailed, and comprehensive way, expanding the existing research and, in some cases, challenging the former sometimes ossified ideas. Polish literature not only reflects the obvious extermination of Jews and Poles, but also records what had been largely overlooked: the extermination of disabled and mentally ill people, the Roma and Sinti, and the Soviet prisoners of war by the Nazis. This volume includes analysis of the literary works of Władysław Szlengel, the most prominent Polish-language poet in the Warsaw ghetto; the peculiar reception of Julian Tuwim’s famous poem for children \"Locomotive;\" the memoir of Leon Weliczker, a prisoner of the Janowska concentration camp in Lvov and a member of the ‘death brigade’ (Sonderkommando); the origins of Medallions by Zofia Nałkowska, who ‘processed’ historical documents into literature and contributed to the making of professor Rudolf Spanner’s ‘dark legend,’ and the textual origins of Tadeusz Różewicz’s ‘poetry after Auschwitz.’ Furthermore, this volume addresses issues related to the genesis and function of ‘genocide literature’ – aesthetic, cognitive, ideological, and social.

Propozycję wprowadzenia takiego dokumentu, nazwanego unijnym zaświadczeniem cyfrowym, Komisja Europejska przedstawiła w marcu 2021 r. Z punktu widzenia prawa rynku wewnętrznego UE istotny jest materialnoprawny wymóg zaszczepienia się przeciw COVID-19 do celów transgranicznego korzystania z różnego rodzaju usług, którego spełnienie potwierdza unijne zaświadczenie cyfrowe. Celem artykułu jest zbadanie, czy wymóg zaszczepienia się przeciw COVID-19 przez obywatela państwa członkowskiego UE zamierzającego skorzystać z usług oferowanych w innym państwie członkowskim UE należy uznać za, co do zasady zakazane, ograniczenie swobody świadczenia usług w UE. Wniosek, że tak jest w istocie, umożliwia wskazanie warunków, jakie muszą być spełnione, by przedmiotowy wymóg był zgodny z prawem UE."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058053800","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61fa3bc52467f013ba90e2ba","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"e967882e-9c54-43a9-b5cc-b3133d1f0fa0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"10-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.pwe.com.pl/czasopisma/przeglad-ustawodawstwa-gospodarczego/wymog-zaszczepienia-sie-przeciw-covid-19-przez-uslugobiorce-jako-ograniczenie-swobody-swiadczenia-uslug-w-ue,a1567907472","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709232878c28a047391816","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Wróbel","uuid":"2812995840F7BCDBF5A0993E2F707FF9220F99F9550D4E603B7AD1B868BD051CD68DBFF896B6BA9C2BFBA8CFA0212DEEA61324E4A551575AE14D3D17DC436AE2","orcidId":"0000-0001-7907-646X","documentHash":"c16b34f8-411a-4fb4-b9d2-94f054d003fd"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19 restrictions","physical activity after the pandemic","long-COVID syndrome"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.
