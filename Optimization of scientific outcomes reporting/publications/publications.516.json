SLR validation results still contain many systematic errors that require special handling of various biases. For this purpose, we derive methods of reducing systematic effects affecting the SLR residuals to LEO Swarm satellites. We test solutions incorporating the estimation of range biases, station coordinate corrections, tropospheric biases, and horizontal gradients of the troposphere delays. When estimating range biases once per day, the standard deviation (STD) of Swarm-B SLR residuals is reduced from 10 to 8 mm for the group of high-performing SLR stations. The tropospheric biases estimated once per day, instead of range biases, further reduce the STD of residuals to the level of 6 mm. The systematic errors that manifest as dependencies of SLR residuals under different measurement conditions, e.g., elevation angle, are remarkably diminished. Furthermore, introducing troposphere biases allows for the comparison of the orbit quality between kinematic and reduced-dynamic orbits as the GPS-based orbit errors become more pronounced when SLR observations are freed from elevation-dependent errors. Applying tropospheric biases in SLR allows obtaining the consistency between the POD solution and SLR observations that are two times better than when neglecting to model of systematic effects and by 29% better when compared with solutions considering present methods of range bias handling."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677448","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10291-022-01289-1","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eae54740970762632ba40f","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Jäggi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fae86e9b-c437-4073-a848-ab6a2658cf95"},{"objectId":"65eae54740970762632ba40e","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Arnold","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a7edfbf2-38fe-49db-be8d-aaa7001f5635"},{"objectId":"602f925a9543c7410626f61e","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Zajdel","uuid":"5E7BB79C3A34BEF743303834A2DBB23BF5EFF85CEB7F1AFDE8C949BF43ECB7477C36C3D2ECD294A54E31DAE35D3937A3551D6FDD070CF1252A87DB6EB38D4ACF","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"de7129cf-4f7b-4a9c-8998-38645d850a36"},{"objectId":"602f502d9543c7410626f327","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Strugarek","uuid":"4DB11E16279FA436512269EA82BD850FD82E8E5DA213D26E08A13A4A8F28292CCBBBA33FD1016B997D07A1CE4B21A9954156A239C8CA2B00FDB5254BAF9AE15E","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3e59abf1-b904-4d93-af2f-528c98d6c757"},{"objectId":"5f0e6d807523405869ccc283","name":"GRZEGORZ","lastName":"BURY","uuid":"F0D07A78A7870BF886CEC14863E2610B2CEE2198FCCD232ED3F7C5B9E24998E66AB5A4E22B9A3280CEAB8A387A5974EE9F58475239EE664E33C5B6E3EF6DD3A8","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"acc86b11-d230-41d0-87d6-6fe47544a29a"},{"objectId":"5e709437878c28a0473b83c7","name":"KRZYSZTOF","lastName":"SOŚNICA","uuid":"22D515E8674D468ED4D4CF62223E7EECD8B8352CEB0CD1836B9DDC1CE8294387C0820DC8358CDFCBC932A875FC2E9DCD5A7090797CD99D2610AC43E60CE18002","orcidId":"0000-0001-6181-1307","documentHash":"083640a6-2e12-412c-8dfb-f1627940b3cb"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10291-022-01289-1"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["FATE","HCM","zakrzep","kot","aorta"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["FATE","HCM","thrombus

past two decades have seen a growing proliferation and generic (intermedial) diversifi cation of Holocaust-related fi ction and non-fi ction in the Dutch language. At the hands of Dutch and Flemishauthors of the third generation as well as writers who do not have a personal connection with the Holocaust, genres as diverse as the historical novel, picture books, the graphic novel, comic books and informational books have become the platform for creative engagement with the Shoah. In view of the growing temporal distance separating contemporary readers from the actual events of the Holocaust children’s literature, we saw its informative function being reinforced and revaluated. In this paper, I review Dutch and Flemish children’s literature about the Holocaust created in the 21st century. Special attention is paid to the literary methods and interventions used by authors in order to authenticate the narrative and frame it as non-fi ction. These strategies demonstrate the further change in child images: the child is increasingly becoming a full-fl edged participant in society and is as such entitled to historical truth, even if this truth is horrifying."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677453","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"33","pagesFromTo":"27-38","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.19195/0860-0716.33.3","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70922e878c28a0473914c2","name":"Irena Barbara","lastName":"Kalla","uuid":"0310982098335526CBBA15B235E881737127D8616DE013C379670F55D95B8A0D7B4FBFDBFE0CA378FF7AA60F7D9EBC713D7C196254241FB15E6225D8F64B600E","orcidId":"0000-0002-6032-9321","documentHash":"8f205198-24c4-4568-8afd-761561bf9877"}],"doi":"10.19195/0860-0716.33.3"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["skalna twierdza","Tustań","graficzna rekonstrukcja 3D","dziedzictwo architektoniczne"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["rock fortress","Tustan","3D graphical reconstruction","architectural heritage sites"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","uid":"bQp8ITDzg_V-1GFpvOVvvtg","uuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","parentUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","rootUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","name":"Politechnika Opolska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["600bc7389543c71c2ca2a59c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Graphical 3D Reconstruction of the Tustan Rock Fortress, Ukraine, in the Study and the Promotion of Architectural Heritage Sites","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d53878c28514547a64f","mniswId":"28564","title":"Wiadomości Konserwatorskie","doi":null,"issn":"0860-2395","eissn":"2544-8870","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"c29cb065-1a1b-4bbc-8531-e1a27abaf79e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_SA","releaseDate":"2022-02-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6489a3274097077564b7ac52","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6489a3274097077564b7ac53","600bc7389543c71c2ca2a59c","6489a3274097077564b7ac54","6489a3274097077564b7ac55"]},"issue":"69","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Narodowy rezerwat historyczno-kulturalny „Tustań” \r\nutworzony został w roku 1994 w celu zachowania \r\ni racjonalnego wykorzystania unikatowego skalnego \r\nmiasta-twierdzy Tustań znajdującego się w pobliżu wsi \r\nUrycz w obwodzie lwowskim (Ukraina).

It was proved that contemporary 3D \r\nreconstructions are not only a new method of investigating and studying heritage sites, but also a new means \r\nof promoting them at regional and international levels."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677454","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"26-35","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.zeriba.pl/wkjohc/wk/wk69.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6489a3274097077564b7ac55","name":"Maksym","lastName":"Yasinskyi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"93f11d3d-a580-4e1e-98a6-bcaf27812733"},{"objectId":"6489a3274097077564b7ac54","name":"Vasyl","lastName":"Rozhko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1d1a2b7a-c5d0-435c-89c0-73df5b3aec6f"},{"objectId":"6489a3274097077564b7ac53","name":"Bogdan","lastName":" Cherkes","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aa48afb7-e616-4538-827c-b54c478d5f17"},{"objectId":"600bc7389543c71c2ca2a59c","name":"SVITLANA","lastName":"LINDA","uuid":"D57E8A45ACD11558A435B0931CD95CF4FE6E5E3ECD04A8A09F8E3DD9995241ADE278C1DACCB446938F9CED80CEEE57F45DD365C47448FC3AFA1CC72F0A22829E","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4504ae97-e81e-42f6-9103-66942003aa06"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Dezinformacja","Przeciążenie informacyjne"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"646dc6844097076e9c3a4350","doi":null,"title":"Leksykon bezpieczeństwa informacyjnego","year":2023,"volume":null,"isbn":"9788367162784","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"http://katalog.nukat.edu.pl/lib/item?id=chamo:5564063&fromLocationLink=false&theme=nukat","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"3ae6dea0-4807-462e-8a9e-f1d1fc2a9be1","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb900","mniswId":"60700","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczo-Humanistyczny w Siedlcach","documentHash":"389012b5-cf02-495f-a6c0-cb587c7e6934"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","uid":"bz_6XXECFL3_CFkpms5BsDQ","uuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","parentUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","rootUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","name":"Uniwersytet w Siedlcach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709373878c28a0473a9eb3"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Chaos informacyjny","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"648ab612409707349d2fba4d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709373878c28a0473a9eb3"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058677456","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"57-59","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://katalog.nukat.edu.pl/lib/item?id=chamo:5564063&fromLocationLink=false&theme=nukat","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473a9eb3","name":"Daria","lastName":"Krzewniak","uuid":"731367E95C2E26949DA354BB5D3E74134CD032AF800495C89814DDDE870EABFAE26A891B9DB1303C89C0591BD09EE97B98D524227183A825A1E781FD0413F502","orcidId":"0000-0003-1085-8361","documentHash":"c0abc8bb-f2bd-4cae-99ae-34e265816dac"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["aktywność fizyczna","chód człowieka","monitoring aktywności"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Physical activity","Human walking","Activity Monitoring"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63c8f02c4097074220c2bb8e","doi":null,"title":"Post-COVID.

Optymalny poziom aktywności fizycznej stanowi podstawę funkcjonalności, a tym samym dobrostanu osób w każdym wieku. Cywilizacyjny problem ograniczania aktywności jest przedmiotem wielu badań. Jest on szczególnie ważny w odniesieniu do osób ze specjalnymi potrzebami — o ograniczonej sprawności z powodu\r\nchoroby lub niepełnosprawności. Możliwość monitoringu aktywności w warunkach nielaboratoryjnych może w istotny sposób poprawić efektywność usprawniania i rehabilitacji tych osób.\r\nCel: Celem pracy było przedstawienie Systemu Monitorowania i Racjonalizacji Treningu SMART. Przedstawiono koncepcję systemu, założenia jego funkcjonowania, przebieg prac nad opracowaniem tego systemu oraz efekty tych prac. Wnioski: System umożliwia monitorowanie podstawowej formy aktywności — chodu człowieka, zarówno w aspekcie ilościowym, jak i jakościowym. Stwarza potencjalnie duże możliwości badania, programowania i kontroli aktywności, zarówno pacjentów w procesie usprawniania — szczególnie neurologicznych, kardiologicznych i ortopedycznych, jak i do indywidualnego użytku. Przewiduje się zbudowanie systemu eksperckiego, mającego na celu zarówno bieżący monitoring użytkowników, jak i tworzenie baz danych umożliwiających modyfikację stosowanych programów rehabilitacyjnych."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Physical activity is defined as any work of skeletal muscles with above‑resting potential. Optimal level of physical activity is the basis of functionality and thus well‑being of people of all ages. The civilization problem of limiting activity is the subject of many studies. It is especially important for people with special needs — those with reduced capacity due to illness or disability. The possibility of monitoring activity in non‑laboratory conditions can significantly improve the effectiveness of rehabilitation and rehabilitation of these people. Core of work: The aim of the work was to present the Training Monitoring and Rationalization\r\nSystem — SMART. The concept of the system, assumptions of its functioning, the course of work on the development of this system and the effects of these works were presented.\r\nConclusion: The system allows you to monitor the basic form of activity — human gait, both in quantitative and qualitative terms. It creates potentially great opportunities for research,\r\nprogramming and activity control, both for patients in the rehabilitation process — especially neurological, cardiological and orthopedic ones, as well as for individual use.

Their origin can be either odontogenic or non-odontogenic. One of the most common odontogenic cysts is the odontogenic keratocyst (OKC). Its nomenclature and classification have changed many times over years, from a tumor to, finally, a cyst. Nowadays, its treatment has not greatly changed, however, it is related to a potential recurrence rate more than any other cyst of odontogenic origins. OKC size, localization, and possible cortical expansion towards adjacent soft tissues might influence the scope of treatment and possible reoccurrence in time. Each case is quite individual, and after removal of the pathology in some cases there can be a necessity for either bone grafting or any other reconstruction method to restore proper bone continuity. The size and the placement of OKC might influence pathological fracture occurrence or inappropriate healing if the bone cavity after cyst removal is not properly treated. A good healing potential can be achieved with xenograft bone substitutes or allograft fresh–frozen bones. On rare occasions, a titanium plate is used to ensure mandibular stability. In the following case report, an atypical case of a large OKC treated with fresh–frozen bone grafts, supported with collagen barrier material in the anterior mandible with buccal cortical expansion, will be presented."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677466","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"art.1234 [12

Affected chondrocytes, osteoblasts and synoviocytes, that are all critical actors in the bone and cartilage defects exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction that develops immediately following cartilage and bone injury, and leads to tissue residing specific cell death, cartilage degeneration, bone erosion, and ultimately post-traumatic musculoskeletal degeneration. Herein, we would like to introduce a novel concept for bone and cartilage related defects treatment based on artificial transfer of exogeneous functional mitochondria (AMT). Particularly, we believe that because mitochondrial failure critically contributes to degenerative disorders onset and progression, replacing malfunctioning mitochondria with their healthy and functional counterparts can represent a novel, and effective therapeutic solution for the management of bone and cartilage related degenerative diseases."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677470","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"2195-2201","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12015-022-10357-5.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a2782409707626339cf01","name":" Larry","lastName":"Galuppo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"52f5de18-9bf5-427c-abf3-77db1d0ed7fc"},{"objectId":"61e785b87523406748fb8694","name":"LYNDA","lastName":"BOUREBABA","uuid":"E9E482563FE63E31FD25D3D5B3F1FE97F8C784FB74495DAFBEE514285948D7708ABC57D70A7A7210E8AB66B1FA91DAC4CF304A8A8A5BB6233A578F342B73A0C1","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"963e7a14-47c1-4f88-ba64-cc93c7c9718d"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6cc8","name":"KATARZYNA","lastName":"KORNICKA-GARBOWSKA","uuid":"FB251AF6CDC68A7B2BD091B986BD0B657263E06AC054EF862478A7BE819360443931EC06C7D139FF7724DC0E8FD2661566B5070F37A9F45AE65C450D0C74284A","orcidId":"0000-0002-2311-5789","documentHash":"71f86337-2b0a-4908-9ad6-f352ecd3d55a"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e29a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Marycz","uuid":"232BD10216D5623A2C97AEE2B23109CFB6C3A3BD5B79AA43203A222A1A37A575D9EBD9FFFDABB7F4C32C3CDC7BA67C6A7DE4A8F0D86DC6A5DF0F1CF93573FCD0","orcidId":"0000-0003-3676-796X","documentHash":"927d7659-0c17-40c1-bed6-9f2cf8d61940"}],"doi":"10.1007/s12015-022-10357-5"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["ronienie","ciąża w trzonie macicy","mumifikacja","nadmierna liczba płodów","przepuklina ciężarnej macicy","skręt macicy","ciąża pozamaciczna","pęknięcie macicy","wypadnięcie pochwy","patologia ciąży","pies"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["abortion","pregnancy in the uterine body","mummification","excess number of fetuses","hernia of the pregnant uterus","uterine torsion","ectopic pregnancy","uterine rupture","vaginal prolapse","pathology of pregnancy","dog"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["662a3eec40970762633a6551","662a3eec40970762633a6550","5e709236878c28a047391bac","662a3eec40970762633a654f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Wybrane niezakaźne patologie ciąży u suk","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"64f04bfacf9a7471b0ea4124","mniswId":"201648","title":"Weterynaria w Praktyce","doi":null,"issn":"1732-1999","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"MINISTRY","editor":null,"documentHash":"d38a8c76-30f8-4a38-bfdd-e1c75a5bac95"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6407033240970770355cf0aa","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709236878c28a047391bac","662a3eec40970762633a654f","662a3eec40970762633a6550","662a3eec40970762633a6551"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Celem niniejszego opracowania jest przybliżenie mających istotny wpływ na efektywność hodowli psów wybranych niezakaźnych patologii ciąży u suk, takich jak: ronienie, ciąża w trzonie macicy, mumifikacja, nadmierna liczba płodów, przepuklina ciężarnej macicy, skręt macicy, ciąża pozamaciczna, pęknięcie macicy i wypadnięcie pochwy.

However, in most publications, one remarkably significant aspect seems to be ignored – the ageing of people with disabilities, especially the intellectually disabled. The issue is gaining importance in the society, as the people with disabilities more and more frequently actively function in social life, showing the evidence of inclusion. The aim of the paper is to draw attention of a broad range of social groups. Particularly, those liable for making decisions regarding care centres. The goal would be achieved by indicating the possibilities, limitations, and threats concerning these groups of people in the context of the passing time. The analysis was made on the basis of the available literature on the subject, both from the special needs education and geragogy. The conclusions have allowed to assess how safe and stress-free the process of entering old age of people with disabilities is. It is important to indicate how people with intellectual disabilities who enter old age can be prepared for the new life situation. However, the most significant seems to be to determine the improvement of professional help service, living conditions adopted to the nature and level of disability and limitations resulting from the old age."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677478","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"83-98","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://cnsonline.pl/resources/html/article/details?id=233648","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70944b878c28a0473b9daa","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Żabińska","uuid":"46A0889C1496916FE4B3CDF61207FFE50FB64C8897B115337B180074DB0B91CAE0EEB0A2FADCA238E67FC5979476651EA29D0F2EDAF04E18B978F24EC22B75C8","orcidId":"0000-0002-2035-491X","documentHash":"8576481e-c5d0-4d22-8298-df073335e99c"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Green leaf volatiles","Hydroxyl radicals","Aqueous phase","Reaction products","Secondary organic aerosol","DFT calculations"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4a7b6085dcb1e6ae0b889","5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89","5fc4bba0085dcb1e6ae0b8d5","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff3d","5e70940f878c28a0473b5974"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Aqueous-phase photo-oxidation of selected green leaf volatiles initiated by  OH radicals: Products and atmospheric implications","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796aa","mniswId":"18243","title":"Science of the Total Environment","doi":null,"issn":"0048-9697","eissn":"1879-1026","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"8db62889-7562-4bb8-9442-090130c06edf"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"APRIL","releaseDateYear":2023,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"648868144097072fd7709efb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5fc4bba0085dcb1e6ae0b8d5","648868144097072fd7709efc","5fc4a7b6085dcb1e6ae0b889","648868144097072fd7709efd","648868144097072fd7709efe","648868144097072fd7709eff","5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89","648868144097072fd7709f00","5e7093bd878c28a0473aff3d","5e70940f878c28a0473b5974"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"C5- and C6- unsaturated oxygenated organic compounds emitted by plants under stress like cutting, freezing or drying, known as Green Leaf Volatiles (GLVs), may clear some of the existing uncertainties in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) budget. The transformations of GLVs are a potential source of SOA components through photo-oxidation processes oc-curring in the atmospheric aqueous phase. Here, we investigated the aqueous photo-oxidation products from three abundant GLVs (1-penten-3-ol, (Z)-2-hexen-1-ol, and (E)-2-hexen-1-al) induced by center dot OH radicals, carried out in a photo-reactor under simulated solar conditions. The aqueous reaction samples were analyzed using advanced hyphen-ated mass spectrometry techniques: capillary gas chromatography mass spectrometry (c-GC-MS); and reversed-phase liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Using carbonyl-targeted c-GC-MS analysis, we confirmed the presence of propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, 1-penten-3-one, and 2-hexen-1-al in the reaction samples. The LC-HRMS analysis confirmed the presence of a new carbonyl product with the molecular formula C6H10O2, which probably bears the hydroxyhexenal or hydroxyhexenone structure. Density functional theory (DFT)-based quantum calculations were used to evaluate the experimental data and obtain insight into the formation mechanism and struc-tures of the identified oxidation products via the addition and hydrogen-abstraction pathways. DFT calculations high-lighted the importance of the hydrogen abstraction pathway leading to the new product C6H10O2. Atmospheric relevance of the identified products was evaluated using a set of physical property data like Henry's law constant (HLC) and vapor pressure (VP). The unknown product of molecular formula C6H10O2 has higher HLC and lower VP than the parent GLV and thus has potential to remain in the aqueous phase leading to possible aqueous SOA formation. Other observed carbonyl products are likely first stage oxidation products and precursors of aged SOA."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677481","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6438f2c54097077a0cc64ad7","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"879","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"0cf436df-c4d3-48b5-b42c-fe4c7df43b2f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"879","pagesFromTo":"162622","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S004896972301238X?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"648868144097072fd7709f00","name":"Hartmut","lastName":"Herrmann","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3b750f81-e707-4559-8b48-dd7086c05cc0"},{"objectId":"648868144097072fd7709eff","name":"Irena","lastName":"Grgić","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a2696978-097c-4527-a680-55a2c441d5b0"},{"objectId":"648868144097072fd7709efe","name":"Martin","lastName":"Brüggemann","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"23c4cedb-6e84-4d80-b5ab-d9c3ea2d6ada"},{"objectId":"648868144097072fd7709efd","name":"Thomas","lastName":"Schaefer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"27c5e684-948c-4148-bd65-7bc2db8f8134"},{"objectId":"648868144097072fd7709efc","name":"Tobias","lastName":"Otto","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7ddb4872-57ea-4891-94ae-d0a5b611039e"},{"objectId":"5fc4bba0085dcb1e6ae0b8d5","name":"Kumar","lastName":"Kumar

During parturition, animals exhibit variation in hormone levels, homeostasis disturbance and dysfunction of the immune system as a result of stress. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) is responsible for the occurrence of oxidative stress in the cells. Cortisol is known as the stress hormone, but it is also involved in the metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates and metabolism processes led by adipose tissue. The aim of the this study was to determine how the levels of GST and cortisol change depending on the parity. Additionally, the influence of lambing on the microbiological composition of the digestive system and placenta in Olkuska sheep was investigated.\r\n\r\nMethods: Eighteen ewes were selected for the experiment - primiparas (n = 9) and multiparas (n = 9), they were kept in the same environmental conditions, had the same diet and did not show any disease symptoms. Fecal samples were collected individually from each ewe (n = 18) and then bacterial DNA isolation was made, then qPCR analysis for Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria phyla and Lactobacillaceae family bacteria levels was performed. These samples were also used to analyze cortisol levels by ELISA test. In addition, placenta fragments were collected during delivery, and then the GST level from the tissue was tested.\r\n\r\nResults: The analysis of the results showed a higher level of cortisol in primiparous sheep than in multiparous ones, as in the case of glutathione transferase. There were differences between both studied groups in the microbiological composition of the digestive system. In primiparous sheep, the levels of the tested microorganisms were significantly lower than in multiparous ones. A similar relationship occurred in the study of the placental microbiome.\r\n\r\nConclusion: The results show that sheep microbiome, cortisol and GST levels are different in primiparas and multiparas. The study conducted may constitute an introduction to further analyzes that would help positively affect the welfare and homeostasis of the female organism."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677483","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://bmcvetres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12917-022-03201-y.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a2718409707626339cb7a","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Pogoda-Sewerniak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e5e564ff-12da-4488-86ae-6c64bef45710"},{"objectId":"662a2718409707626339cb79","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Wojnarowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8df88550-6f6a-4d25-91c7-31e86baff81d"},{"objectId":"662a2718409707626339cb78","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Smoliński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8c47b1d1-93c0-48bf-9642-eb54d39ca618"},{"objectId":"662a2718409707626339cb77","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Cholewińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"68b34bc8-f827-4571-9400-b65d36335e3e"},{"objectId":"662a2718409707626339cb76","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Szeligowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"29e86282-5079-4050-af1b-4e574ce489eb"},{"objectId":"5e7093b6878c28a0473af9fe","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Czyż","uuid":"73B25319D9EC320F109F2E9472F66EAD4FFF050E311E6E5D9A0F6C3C572BD0678FA7FB4D8E4A15A667A71E27EE8FAA0688D46106A5EEAF7299F11D489BCCBC82","orcidId":"0000-0001-7548-8918","documentHash":"9d586f4b-d1a2-4d35-b2ca-9d46e51dd968"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e277","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Pokorny","uuid":"18C1346FBE34A0F219C2C34FBA0B08C860284C36F35C8A0E6C4053BE9EE955632DABC500379735508E163776EDA918D4C4A6D310BBD490CEF9D5F71134743ACB","orcidId":"0000-0002-3816-7848","documentHash":"4639b085-cadc-4149-b369-cd3ebd611cf3"}],"doi":"10.1186/s12917-022-03201-y"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bacterial biocenosis","activated sludge","landfill leachate","treatment","fluorescent staining"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091ff878c28a04738e498","5e709422878c28a0473b6c96","5e709203878c28a04738e9c4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Analysis of the Bacterial Biocenosis of Activated Sludge Treated with Leachate from Municipal Landfills","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","doi":null,"issn":"1661-7827","eissn":"1660-4601","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e236e16e-7430-4ac3-800c-033637860e22"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-05","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6406f53540970770355cbb2e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709422878c28a0473b6c96","5e709203878c28a04738e9c4","5e7091ff878c28a04738e498"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The influx of toxic pollutants into wastewater treatment plants can negatively affect the quality of the activated sludge (AS). One source is landfill leachate. The identification of microorganisms present in AS is very important, e.g., while improving wastewater treatment technology. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the effect of raw leachate and after purification of Phragmites australis and Ceratophyllum demersum on the composition of the AS bacterial biocenosis. In addition, AS status was assessed by LIVE/DEAD BacLight ™ fluorescent staining. The obtained results showed that the leachate did not significantly affect the cell membranes of AS bacteria, and even a slight improvement was noted. The research carried out using the next-generation sequencing method shows that the origin of the samples (active and closed storage) and the method of processing do not significantly affect the composition of the AS bacterial biocenosis at higher taxonomic levels. However, at the species level, the appearance of bacteria not previously present in AS was observed, namely: Flavobacterium luticocti, Candidimonas nitroreducens and Nitrobacter hamburgensis. The obtained results suggest that the leachate may be a source of microorganisms positively influencing the condition of AS bacteria."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677487","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"1-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/3/1801/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c96","name":"ALEKSANDRA","lastName":"WDOWCZYK","uuid":"7141CE62A64D7EA188F0A8D3B075CCE58ED9F3548F345916C2AE8AC10A88AC50B1CFBC2EAE4B60D8D8C2225CF6DCB1A16DF7F489B3D891A96498BB4C6CF37C34","orcidId":"0000-0002-6389-7682","documentHash":"8cd2447c-0b45-4716-bfb0-9452617acbe8"},{"objectId":"5e709203878c28a04738e9c4","name":"Agata","lastName":"Szymańska-Pulikowska","uuid":"FA589861490B0AD981C41CCFD3C087FBA3CDA414D51C7DB9E464C862DB0973F5AC9283079026FE3F473042FD1C754309E492E8FDBFE114ACE02A86B0E3FE8B16","orcidId":"0000-0001-5431-6228","documentHash":"995f9d68-f6f8-418a-b68f-0333285c82c4"},{"objectId":"5e7091ff878c28a04738e498","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Domańska","uuid":"68BA8D18585D79B193B00B682AECAB12207D2E557D84195BD6D366F757F4A39B8557087CF8D6E0A419440D12D704DB5012F6317688267121B53D891E7E30BB9B","orcidId":"0000-0003-3323-7648","documentHash":"1af5ec0b-b781-4a24-9d7e-2d63c9c79018"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19031801"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63d1a30740970711f804c27a","doi":null,"title":"Unity

Cannabidiol or CBD is a non-psychoactive phytocannabinoid that can activate the endocannabinoid system and its receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system in bodies of different species.

It was published in Lviv, in October 1939, in two language versions: Polish and Ukrainian. Based on aselection of language units, the author proves how anthroponyms, toponyms and chrematonims were designed to unite the community, to convince the people to believe government propaganda and to persuade them to behave in adesirable way. Furthermore, the author classifies the names into: historical, unhistorical — real, and unhistorical — unreal.

On the works of Ernst Josef Krzywon</strong> / This article presents key motifs in the lyrical works of Ernst Josef Krzywon, a German poet, literary historian. and translator of Polish literature. Krzywon was an intellectual of Upper Silesian origin, who struggled with the conditions of a double biography, enhanced by the socalled great history of belonging to two cultural circles. Both in his poetry and in his scientific works and essays, the author born in Rokitnica (a historical part of Zabrze), tries to face the challenge of presenting the cultural heritage of Upper Silesians as the product of meetings between representatives of several nations – as a common work of the German and Slavic<br />peoples. Our article analyzes the main topic of his poems: the multiracial character of the region and its consequences for the individual – especially the necessity to look for national identity in the area between two cultures and two (or even three) languages."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677505","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"185-198","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.14746/fp.2022.28-29.36755","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094c5878c28a0473c3747","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Radłowska","uuid":"F0465199C663A46706C7B40E44323398E3DB1ACF939FFD27BB6A15C0DFD32A1FFFA6F6DA708C62D66FDC343BA942732BCFA78BA58CC46462F3B740A98B1F7966","orcidId":"0000-0002-5376-8107","documentHash":"98ef81ce-90eb-4b6f-9c03-b4e29394ba8c"},{"objectId":"5e7091ff878c28a04738e588","name":"Edward","lastName":"Białek","uuid":"9E505ED1F139A62B58E5873CAEF72F139D408CE2552C78F1E60853EC7645CE7A9B2283ED86CB74151A8A37165DCDAA17E2A6B1A1C9D264D6EDD52F92BC29B448","orcidId":"0000-0001-6334-8539","documentHash":"f50c3e4b-4429-4b9e-909c-93605c562d23"}],"doi":"10.24917/20811853.22.11"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ec878c28a04739f3ef","5e70943b878c28a0473b87a2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A deeper insight into the phytoremediation of soil polluted with petroleum hydrocarbons supported by the Enterobacter ludwigii ZCR5 strain","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477151","mniswId":"1520","title":"Applied Soil Ecology","doi":null,"issn":"0929-1393","eissn":"1873-0272","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"c1965a4a-323f-475a-9309-64b3b80cd1f0"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"SEPTEMBER","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"648ab6fd409707349d2fc0fe","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70943b878c28a0473b87a2","648ab6fd409707349d2fc100","648ab6fd409707349d2fc101","648ab6fd409707349d2fc102","5e7092ec878c28a04739f3ef"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Enterobacter ludwigii ZCR5 strain, isolated from the leaves of Zea mays growing in soil cocontaminated with hydrocarbons and heavy metals, was investigated under laboratory conditions for its plant growth-promoting traits, petroleum hydrocarbon (PH) degradation and biosurfactant production abilities and then used in bacterial-assisted phytoremediation. The whole genome of the ZCR5 was sequenced, and the presence of several genes encoding enzymes important for the enhancement of phytoremediation of soil polluted with PHs was detected. Next, the ZCR5 strain was introduced into polluted soil planted with Lolium perenne cv. Pinia. After inoculation, the ZCR5 strain was able to survive in polluted soil and colonized plant tissues. The highest efficacy of PHs removal (30.6 %) was observed for soil bioaugmented with living cells of the ZCR5, whereas in soil treated with bacterial necromass, it reached a value of 17.6 %. During the experimental period, the mechanisms enhancing the phytoremediation of PH-polluted soils were also tested in situ through the quantification of the expression of selected genes. The expression of genes encoding proteins involved in the biosurfactant production and promotion of plant growth by the ZCR5 strain was not detected either in the rhizosphere or in the endosphere of ryegrass. Among the genes involved in the degradation of PH, only CYP153 (in the rhizo- and endo-spheres) and nahAC (in the rhizosphere) were expressed. Despite the fact that we observed a higher efficiency of phytoremediation in the ZCR5-bioaugmented soil than in the controls, we were not able to indicate the bacterial mechanisms responsible for the observed effect of phytoremediation enhancement by the ZCR5 strain. The results obtained in our experiments indicate the necessity to study bacterial-plant interactions during assisted phytoremediation at the more detailed level. Thus the metatranscriptomic analysis of bacterial activity will be performed in the next step."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677507","journalIssue":{"objectId":"648ab6fd409707349d2fc0ff","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"181","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"ed98d014-6a7c-4c76-9e78-7a964bf46828"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"181","pagesFromTo":"104651","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929139322002670","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"648ab6fd409707349d2fc102","name":"Marta","lastName":"Prach","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b43fa404-6b13-4fee-a8b9-12847739ae6c"},{"objectId":"648ab6fd409707349d2fc101","name":"Daria","lastName":"Chlebek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c63d2605-d3bc-44a0-bd2b-24ad800b1c83"},{"objectId":"648ab6fd409707349d2fc100","name":"Adam","lastName":"Byrski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"12b07cb0-7a31-4b79-b884-c764e214e511"},{"objectId":"5e70943b878c28a0473b87a2","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Pacwa-Płociniczak","uuid":"021D9E8685F090D2A1AFD82059DBC996E5098BF29A17BAE81B528A4B37A1F1FCE734D82D7BD7393FB31EEA1CD2F7AE39FEC5E79220B16817F52748E90994AB32","orcidId":"0000-0003-0383-3537","documentHash":"12ad74f4-2926-482a-ab32-87de0d0f775a"},{"objectId":"5e7092ec878c28a04739f3ef","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Płociniczak","uuid":"AC56AFC6110D7F219986D6739183073562C18EA060042E3BB621AAF2237E00749D11AF477210A6FB661DA4DF64B45A3DDA05679EE337241CE6940194E2E52E22","orcidId":"0000-0001-9594-4378","documentHash":"ab7d7b24-ec68-44e7-82bb-d7148b37b214"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.apsoil.2022.104651"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"9781665487009","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"2022 24th European Conference on Power Electronics and Applications","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6459ed124097076a7a4b99a7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058677508","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb7fc","mniswId":"26900","name":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","documentHash":"b80f2dd5-e346-440a-b828-4712b50be331"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/9907022/proceeding","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["antiprotozoal","antiparasitic activity","essential oils","LD50","phytochemistry","bioactivity","terpenes","phytoncides"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602f4b0b9543c7410626f2e4","5e7091fc878c28a04738e2a7","662a3a9a40970762633a3ef2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Novel Formula of Antiprotozoal Mixtures","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b9bb","mniswId":"1353","title":"Antibiotics","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2079-6382","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"491ddc91-9d9f-4982-aa71-dd451a3b74fc"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-07","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"640700f640970770355ce710","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602f4b0b9543c7410626f2e4","5e7091fc878c28a04738e2a7","662a3a9a40970762633a3ef2","662a3a9a40970762633a3ef3"]},"issue":"7","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is becoming more common in both bacteria and pathogenic protozoa. Therefore, new solutions are being sought as alternatives to currently used agents. There are many new ideas and solutions, especially compounds of natural origin, including essential oils. In the present study, the antiprotozoal activity of a mixture of essential oils (eucalyptus, lavender, cedar and tea tree), organic acids (acetic acid, propionic acid and lactic acid) and metal ions (Cu, Zn, Mn) were tested. As a model, protozoans were selected: Euglena gracilis, Gregarina blattarum, Amoeba proteus, Paramecium caudatum, Pentatrichomonas hominis. The tested concentrations of mixtures were in the range of 0.001–1.5%. The analyses show unexpected, very strong protozoicidal activity of combinations, presenting the synergy of compounds via determination of LD50 and LD100 values. Obtained mixtures showed significantly higher activity against protozoans, compared to chloramphenicol and metronidazole. Most of the analyzed samples show high antiprotozoal activity at very low concentration, in the range of 0.001–0.009%. The most effective combinations for all analyzed protozoans were the cedar essential oil and tea tree essential oil with a mixture of acids and manganese or zinc ions. Innovative combinations of essential oils, organic acids and metal ions are characterized by very high antiprotozoal activity at low doses, which, after further investigation, can be applicable for control of protozoan pathogens."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677512","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6382/11/7/913/pdf?version=1657185614","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a3a9a40970762633a3ef3","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Różański","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a162061e-a878-424a-a62a-b1b4d61074d6"},{"objectId":"662a3a9a40970762633a3ef2","name":"Hubert","lastName":"Iwiński ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2b54af89-a718-4cc8-bbd4-a68df8c106c9"},{"objectId":"602f4b0b9543c7410626f2e4","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Łyczko","uuid":"39EEC3C52B018F373384C41F0E1FB450414CB122502093E113786A5DE3DDF5A5CD0041A930234BA08648905F3BC951856D8B6D665FF34E07B1D7E49AE6A8C74F","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4d9c5d5a-7c5a-46ff-b2a1-3fabc184ed96"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e2a7","name":"Antoni","lastName":"Szumny","uuid":"AE28B651B632C894879C2606F003399974DB4F842D3C49CA1D5C8EB76BBAD0B5F2BCC1B7BA62F3E92848A2BD932035D823CDA1FF929B80C04EA5CC526CE6F2D5","orcidId":"0000-0001-9058-1598","documentHash":"8b015d67-9d2a-4720-a998-2fe34600ba49"}],"doi":"10.3390/antibiotics11070913"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Lie groupoids","Lie functor","Nonassociative algebras","Discrete mechanics"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb3","uid":"bdcud9f5wTDoe2In0PutAaw","uuid":"96a58ef3-d4b3-4384-b9e4-4792d490536f","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb3","parentUuid":"96a58ef3-d4b3-4384-b9e4-4792d490536f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb3","rootUuid":"96a58ef3-d4b3-4384-b9e4-4792d490536f","name":"Instytut Matematyczny Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f9878c28a0473c81a7","5e70928e878c28a047397db1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Nonassociative analogs of Lie groupoids","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547795b","mniswId":"5070","title":"DIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY AND ITS APPLICATIONS","doi":null,"issn":"0926-2245","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"79049c0c-82d5-45ff-98ec-cc02fd2e527a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64885dd74097072fd76fb96d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928e878c28a047397db1","5e7094f9878c28a0473c81a7"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We introduce nonassociative geometric objects generalizing naturally Lie groupoids and called (smooth) quasiloopoids and loopoids.

The first extensive attempts to determine the exact place that Anthropological Linguistics occupies in this taxonomy were presented over a decade ago (Chruszczewski 2010, 2011), and they were later developed and modified (Chruszczewski 2018). The present classification of Anthropological Linguistics is based upon the current state of knowledge and above all on research undertaken in numerous scientific centers around the world where it is obvious that language is an integral part of human culture and it is recognized that both of the phenomena influence each other and that the most reliable results can be obtained by studying language and culture simultaneously. It goes without saying that scholars are thinking, hard-working and creative beings. Therefore, the increase and updating of knowledge, including research fields and disciplines, is very large and takes place very quickly. Many working research ideas from not so far ago are already recognized and autonomous scientific disciplines. Hence, I share the opinion of those researchers who believe that from time to time it is necessary to modernize, re-describe and explain anew the classification of the disciplines in which we work, so that the readers of our works can see how we ourselves understand the discipline of our core research. On the one hand the following classification of Anthropological Linguistics can be seen as exactly this kind of explanation of how the author of the paper understands this research field, and on the other hand it can be seen also as an open invitation for

has long been known that coronaviruses cause various infectious diseases in animals. Although SARS-CoV-2 is genetically related to viruses isolated from Rhinolophus bats, the exact origin, mode of transmission, and how the human species has become the epidemiological reservoir of the virus have not yet been established with certainty. Although the main route of transmission is human-to-human, there are considerable numbers of reported cases of infection in animal species, predominantly among pet animals. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity in dogs and cats during the COVID-19 pandemic in Šumadija District, Serbia. We used serology to identify household contacts of pet animals with infected pet owners and the degree of association. The study presented in this paper is also the first study of this type in Serbia. The results of a retrospective serosurvey, which was conducted in dogs and cats with different exposure risk factors, were analyzed to find the possible modes of transmission between humans and animals. The relative frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection in dogs was 1.45% bounded with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.0007–7.73%, while in cats, it was 5.56% (95% CI: 0.77–4.13%). The relative frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pet owners was 11% (95% CI: 6.25–18.63%). In pets that were in close contact with COVID-19 positive owners, the seropositivity was found to be 9%. Out of a total of five stray dogs and cats tested, seropositivity was observed in two animals. Detected SARS-CoV-2 infection in pets shows that these animals are susceptible to infection and that the most common means of virus transmission to pets is through contact with diseased owners. However, the presence of infection in stray dogs and cats is not clear and needs further research."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677525","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"208","pagesFromTo":"1-5","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016758772200188X?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a3a3540970762633a3b4b","name":"Nevenka","lastName":"Ilić","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"70293604-7c16-43b0-8248-b071eb281830"},{"objectId":"662a3a3540970762633a3b4a","name":"Kristina","lastName":"Prokic","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"52440127-be1d-492c-bf54-f55d84bca34e"},{"objectId":"662a3a3540970762633a3b49","name":"Dragan V.","lastName":"Vasiljevic","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ac665fef-d946-4ac5-8c7a-1be19495bef3"},{"objectId":"662a3a3540970762633a3b48","name":"Damjan","lastName":"Srejić","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"041c7349-e8e2-4402-aabd-5d7ca48c8a7f"},{"objectId":"662a3a3540970762633a3b47","name":"Sonja","lastName":"Radojičić","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ecf758ce-b02b-419d-9ef3-17e17d692b16"},{"objectId":"662a3a3540970762633a3b46","name":"Slavoljub","lastName":"Stanojevic","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4814e23a-037b-4793-8445-c8b187896cbd"},{"objectId":"61e785b87523406748fb8688","name":"DUŠAN","lastName":"MIŠIĆ","uuid":"AF53E141E26108A24AFA2366B9548C88CBCE53C3D7EEB9994263731BFAFF84C327BD9B3A7F3E30AE566BBB3D9623E787519AB39EC6E49C59ED8D43760F2E2AD2","orcidId":"0000-0001-5393-8922","documentHash":"b13397ae-b1bf-4ebd-9e13-2dfc252b323d"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.prevetmed.2022.105755"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["wastewater","melatonin","heavy metals","soil","wheat","bioavailability","nutrition","chitosan","lime"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709273878c28a047395e25","662a37e040970762633a2cf3"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Effects of Soil Application of Chitosan and Foliar Melatonin on Growth, Photosynthesis, and Heavy Metals Accumulation in Wheat Growing on Wastewater Polluted Soil","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","doi":null,"issn":"2071-1050","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"76492123-acbe-4743-a4ae-6a63f3108e24"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-06","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6406fd3440970770355cda50","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709273878c28a047395e25","662a37e040970762633a2cf1","662a37e040970762633a2cf2","662a37e040970762633a2cf3","662a37e040970762633a2cf4","662a37e040970762633a2cf5","662a37e040970762633a2cf6"]},"issue":"14","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Due to freshwater scarcity in developing countries, irrigating the arable land with wastewater poses potential ecological risks to the environment and food quality. Using cheap soil amendments and foliar application of a newly discovered molecule “melatonin” (ML) can alleviate these effects. The objectives of this pot study were to evaluate the effectiveness of the sole addition of chitosan (CH) and sugar beet factory lime (SBL) in wastewater impacted soil, foliar application of ML, and combining each soil amendment with ML on the heavy metals (HMs) accumulation, growth, nutritional quality and photosynthesis in wheat. Results showed that CH was more effective than SBL for reducing HMs bioavailability in soil, HMs distribution in plants, improving photosynthesis, nutritional quality, and growth. ML application also influenced plant parameters but less than CH and SBL. The CH+ML treatment was the most effective for influencing plant parameters and reducing HMs bioavailability in the soil. Compared to control, CH+ML significantly reduced the concentrations of Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Co in roots, shoots, and grain up to 89%. We conclude that adding CH+ML in wastewater impacted soils can remediate the soil; reduce HMs concentrations in plants; and improve their photosynthesis, plant growth, grain yield, and nutrition."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677527","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/14/8293/pdf?version=1657112890","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a37e040970762633a2cf6","name":"Hafiz Syed","lastName":"Tanzeem-Ul-Haq","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3b25de0f-e19c-4bbf-afe6-4c563adf2f67"},{"objectId":"662a37e040970762633a2cf5","name":"Muhammad Arbaz Khalid","lastName":"Rana","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"acb2d320-6a8e-4b48-bbe9-14e2567413f7"},{"objectId":"662a37e040970762633a2cf4","name":"Gull","lastName":"E-Faran","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e63d1b70-597e-4799-9e9f-feb02694e8a1"},{"objectId":"662a37e040970762633a2cf3","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Jędroszka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9ecd4f7b-5e2f-49d2-8701-938fbdf9d6fe"},{"objectId":"662a37e040970762633a2cf2","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Lewińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5726b2ec-5d1c-41ad-b8ca-23697d9c39cc"},{"objectId":"662a37e040970762633a2cf1","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Iqbal","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"86ad25f5-56e5-4d42-8877-468b556792c3"},{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395e25","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Dradrach","uuid":"BBBABBC15411648084304F0BCDDFDEB8625625107FC7AF85902C9EA6C192B7AD67C87FDB86F8DDAE797E07072B15493298DA438A4B3DC2C9E3DF389F6427BA02","orcidId":"0000-0001-5406-9685","documentHash":"d90221e3-c01b-4e40-a37e-49f88970a81a"}],"doi":"10.3390/su14148293"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Migracje","Demografia","Rynek pracy","Polska"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Demography","Migration","Poland"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"646751ec409707515b4eb8b2","doi":null,"title":"Polska Racja Stanu w Perspektywie 2035","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-67786-04-1","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://sin.akademia.mil.pl/publications/details/i7964","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"40476202-78f5-4067-bd25-9d8405077050","publisher":{"objectId":"5d6d0363878c284eaa45c902","mniswId":"71500","name":"Wydawnictwo naukowe FNCE","documentHash":"26eb0606-8c14-43a2-807c-7ad7f4c6df9e"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","uid":"bABmAiyO82JgMB2LqzOepAg","uuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","parentUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","rootUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","name":"Akademia Sztuki Wojennej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70935e878c28a0473a8291"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Diagnoza uzależnienia polskiego rynku pracy od migracji – uwarunkowania demograficzne bezpieczeństwa obszaru społeczno‑ekonomicznego","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64884c084097077564b3881d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70935e878c28a0473a8291"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058677529","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"129 -

The randomized complete block design was applied in field condi-tions in 2015–2017. It comprised one factor, the timing and the intensity of post-emergence weed harrowing with the spring-tine harrow. The plots were harrowed once, twice, or three times on one day at six consecutive growth stages of triticale: BBCH 10, 11, 12, 13, 21, 22. Harrowing did not increase the grain yield of the triticale-lupin mix-ture, and when repeated three times at BBCH 21, it decreased the grain yield. The cereal was more resistant than lupin to timing and intensity of harrowing. The weeds were best controlled by a single cultivation conducted at the first leaf of triticale.

study aimed to assess the impact of a hydropower plant (HP) on the Bystrzyca River (left tributary of the Odra River, Poland) on selected parameters of the bottom sediment within this hydrotechnical structure. The following parameters were examined as part of the analyses: particle size distribution, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and concentrations of Cd, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn. Field studies were carried out upstream and downstream of the HP and at reference points. In addition, the risk of heavy metals in aquatic organisms was assessed using an ecotoxicological method. Based on the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, it was found that the HP influenced all of the parameters tested, except pH. Comparing the points closest to and downstream of the HP, an increase in the average grain diameter of D50 (on average by 750%), and a decrease in the concentrations of most heavy metals: Ni (271%), Zn (216%), Cu (163%), Cr (83.0%), and Cd (74.2%), was observed. The ecotoxicological classification of heavy metal concentrations in sediments indicates, in most cases, little or no impact on aquatic organisms; the values of Ni and Zn in some samples upstream of the HP are exceptions, where remediation using synthetic zeolites, metal accumulation plants, or by electrokinetic methods, is necessary. Fine-grained fractions dominate the clays and sandy clays upstream of the hydropower plants, while sands, sandy clay loams, or sandy clays are dominated downstream. Frequent occurrence of skeletal fractions (>2.0 mm) was observed downstream, i.e., an average of 23.30% in each sample compared to 1.82% upstream of the HP, which is mainly due to greater anthropogenic pressure, especially tourism. The dominance of fine-grained fractions upstream of the HPs favors the accumulation of metals due to the high sorption capacity of these fractions. When comparing the analyzed groups of points, the average pH values are arranged in the following sequence: upstream HP (U) > downstream HP (D) > reference points (R), while EC has opposite values (i.e., U < D < R). This study may support sustainable sediment management and may allow for the development of recommendations related to the rational management of HPs."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677537","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2022.795922/full","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602f3fc69543c7410626f25f","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Tomczyk","uuid":"9B8B8F06B6C724E94B43BA1C2514F4DFF1A84347D388FCA28D8FF62A934929B74567A82CDA31D92CA2CDC4748A990E5306DD34096076874D95BDA9F4385D7B44","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"899ae4b9-922b-437f-b807-3f13a79f188d"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6cf3","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Gruss","uuid":"F49E7556C93664F3BB275D707D699E5AD5880D0BF090B5414085A44583BCB7758059A18C40E60E4761ADAB3011B892455A1F98757A6B5209D686CE3DD0DEB5DF","orcidId":"0000-0002-7548-9758","documentHash":"fde19c45-20c7-423b-a7ad-a48e82d69ec3"},{"objectId":"5e70924e878c28a0473935e0","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Wiatkowski","uuid":"3B2A563C5BB75017380E4AA991B146240D67646BD85053BFD519D5B3D6A139C55D82BF100C94F8D693BD6E609BE03902AE4EF60974C2D1DEA6271757B493EF67","orcidId":"0000-0002-5155-0593","documentHash":"68aae787-7828-4e50-b34e-fb0126814555"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e228","name":"Bernard","lastName":"Gałka","uuid":"5E2A5F4AA394E950F11AD135B1675D9B1216ABCFA372C2AEE9857611C54DA3A30C8C0AD88AE46B3390A6A3CB66320C15F7D433CB9E31956947BA1442CC47210A","orcidId":"0000-0002-4555-9460","documentHash":"945419ac-d0b9-40bb-b799-13f69f32eabc"}],"doi":"10.3389/fenvs.2022.795922"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"6411993340970706bbc60a0d","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"The National Academy of Arts of Ukraine","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["64895aa6409707322845b578"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Religious and Legal Aspects in World Cinema","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e7191dc46e0fb0001d28985","mniswId":null,"title":"Bulletin of Kyiv National University of Culture and Arts.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between blood serum AMH concentration and semen quality in dogs. Moreover, this study sought to find the optimal cut-off point value of serum AMH with the greatest sensitivity and specificity to predict semen quality. Forty-five clinically healthy dogs were included in the study and their age as well as the following semen parameters were determined and correlated to serum AMH concentration: total sperm output, normal morphology, plasma membrane integrity, total motility, progressive motility, and velocity parameters. Statistical analysis for correlations were performed using Spearman’s correlation coefficients. Moderate negative associations were found between serum AMH and semen total motility (r = −0.38, p = 0.01), progressive motility (r = −0.36, p = 0.01), and normal morphology (r = −0.36, p= 0.02). Based on these associations, an AMH concentration of 5.54 µg/L was found to be the optimal cut-off point value to obtain the greatest summation of sensitivity (86%) and specificity (63%) to predict semen quality. The serum AMH assay may therefore be a potential hormonal marker to predict which dogs would require further semen analysis.

In this context, the authors focus on the perceptions of those involved in SEA. Three non-routine SEA case studies from Central Europe are explored, including a Polish-German development programme SEA, a 6-country (Austria, Slovenia, Italy, France, Switzerland and Germany) Alpine program SEA and a German marine spatial plan SEA. Information was obtained through interviews and questionnaires conducted with academics as well as private and public SEA actors. Participant observations were used to support the interpretation of results. In the three cases, academics fullfilled different roles, including being providers of expert knowledge and being members of advisory committees. Results suggest an overall positive perception of collaboration between academia and practice, with important contributions being the introduction of novel ideas and innovative assessment methods in SEA, the contribution of knowledge from the academic literature, and the generation of scientific backing for new approaches. Potential challenges for collaboration were found to be associated with negative previous experiences of actors with science-practice interactions along with some contextual factors. Academics benefit from implementing research knowledge in practice. Furthermore, teaching becomes informed by practice and can thus better embrace real life situations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677542","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"99","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195925522002529","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6406f40b40970770355cb5b4","name":"Thomas B.","lastName":"Fischer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5a596e4d-aa79-4f97-8999-baa9d994a082"},{"objectId":"6406f40b40970770355cb5b3","name":"A.","lastName":"Jiricka-Pürrer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"13edb201-dbd5-471b-b327-762f5b0d9f46"},{"objectId":"6406f40b40970770355cb5b2","name":"G.","lastName":"Geißler","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7e808c85-57e3-4934-8546-6309d5fcbb24"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e1e5","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Tokarczyk-Dorociak","uuid":"DE17D44185113BE24D3F5EB1C66F83D9554789E1465EC7ACBDB50604ECE4B66EEBB5E652FCB84EC3CE5851A4E36F5DC89D57C2DDAB7EC204F7E31D83D63F51D2","orcidId":"0000-0001-7581-3047","documentHash":"f08b941d-5b72-44e2-9df4-32c69c097b8c"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.eiar.2022.106986"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Municipal landfills","Leachate treatment","Vertical flow constructed wetlands","Phragmites australis"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091fc878c28a04738e228","5e709203878c28a04738e9c4","5e709422878c28a0473b6c96"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Removal of selected pollutants from landfill leachate in constructed wetlands with different filling","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477388","mniswId":"2527","title":"Bioresource Technology","doi":null,"issn":"0960-8524","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"edca5c97-a39a-474b-8c9c-22ef0a19afef"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-04-09","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6406f53e40970770355cbb4c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709422878c28a0473b6c96","5e709203878c28a04738e9c4","5e7091fc878c28a04738e228"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Constructed wetlands (CW) with vertical flow were used to treat leachate from municipal landfills (active and closed, at different concentrations) using a combination of substrates, i.e., gravel, sand and an exchangeable layer, depending on a variant: organic substrate (pine bark) or mineral substrate (zeolite, expanded clay).

In this study, Bacillus subtilis #309 was applied to produce surfactin using rapeseed and sunflower cakes, the most common oil processing side products in Europe. Studies of the chemical composition of the substrates were performed, to determine the feasibility of oil cakes for surfactin production. Initially, screening of proteolytic and lipolytic activity was performed to establish the capability of B. subtilis #309 for substrate utilization and hence effective surfactin production. B. subtilis #309 showed both proteolytic and lipolytic activity. The process of surfactin production was carefully analyzed by measurement of the surfactin concentration, pH, surface tension (ST) and emulsification index (E24). The maximal surfactin concentration in the sunflower and rapeseed cake medium reached 1.19 ± 0.03 and 1.45 ± 0.09 g/L, respectively. At the same time, a progressive decrease in the surface tension and increase in emulsification activity were observed. The results confirmed the occurrence of various surfactin homologues, while the surfactin C15 was the dominant one. Finally, the analysis of surfactin biological function exhibited antioxidant activity and significant angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value for ACE inhibition was found to be 0.62 mg/mL for surfactin. Molecular docking of the surfactin molecule to the ACE domains confirmed its inhibitory activity against ACE. Several interactions, such as hydrophobic terms, hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions, were involved in the complex stabilization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the effect of a lipopeptide biosurfactant, surfactin, produced by B. subtilis for multifunctional properties in vitro, namely the ACE-inhibitory activity and the antioxidant properties, using different assays, such as 2,2-azinobis (3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). Thus, the ACE-inhibitory lipopeptide biosurfactant shows promise to be used as a natural antihypertensive agent.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677546","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"art.10824 [19 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/18/10824/htm","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630bd074097076263e72477","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Janek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3090b764-a942-4225-a648-c85080a5b284"},{"objectId":"6630bd074097076263e72476","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Łaba","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e61c9be2-66bc-472c-bcd9-4ab1e0d0a173"},{"objectId":"6630bd074097076263e72475","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kancelista","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f687bf18-5403-4edd-b2f2-ed813d097746"},{"objectId":"6630bd074097076263e72474","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Ciurko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ff08be9c-4350-450f-9122-1d23d4b7ef61"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1377","name":"Żaneta","lastName":"Czyżnikowska","uuid":"C6BA62CFE9C67087E6578F197093192569844703F1C71AD8F9D4D0F94E435B40D0DD2384926A3425BDA568700EBF22C11F6CF1A8954C13414F53FE1C4A217B13","orcidId":"0000-0002-5758-9667","documentHash":"5223762d-768e-41d2-b88e-5b280cad5806"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms231810824"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63d1527a4097071d34b9b777","doi":"10.4324/9781003266495","title":"Trust, Digital Business and Technology.

Marketers increasingly operate in virtual space, therefore there is a need for cyclical research on consumer trust in advertising content. The research findings presented in this chapter add to a growing body of literature exploring this field. The aim of this study was to examine internet users’ trust in online advertising. The research involved a literature review, analysis of source materials, and a diagnostic survey. The survey was carried out online using the Computer Assisted Web Interviewing method. The sample consisted of 613 individuals aged 18–25. The study showed that respondents’ trust in online advertising was moderate, but varied depending on ad location, content, type, and the components used. Gender and average daily use of the internet had moderate impacts on the declared trust. The findings may not be representative of the larger population, but may serve as a basis for future studies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677547","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"231-241","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003266495-21/trust-advertising-digital-marketing-agnieszka-werenowska-agata-bali%C5%84ska-ewa-jaska?context=ubx&refId=150704c9-e332-45c5-a37c-cb8b8a076374","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a0473921be","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Jaska","uuid":"D8A88816F3EA328BF3528588F9FEB6984E6626DBDC69908B8A05EDC0F5B5D3411CA31852D33B106F44727D230A84CEEE6F1A5DC323C580FF57CF0B8782FE1BC8","orcidId":"0000-0002-3874-1985","documentHash":"a977fe9a-f18a-433a-b688-1e1e4ec2cf94"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a04739219b","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Werenowska","uuid":"487F6F9999F2E11D86947CABC860967F09C3C26E1F640F15EA08CF83DC42C30170D1A42913595F316CC425A333F6D588631478F6C0E10D1A7320B2A296EA25C9","orcidId":"0000-0002-2545-4442","documentHash":"f84b1580-ec97-4277-99a9-1baf6419e1dc"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a04739218f","name":"Agata","lastName":"Balińska","uuid":"B833C23B94F507ADB1A86F075C9FFF9D4D9CAECF3B03A42BF4028DF0CC834AC259FEC8B4CD2181BAA344D1ED87A0A6EFB32D74D9729037E84319E9BEA2FF0AFD","orcidId":"0000-0002-8777-9955","documentHash":"39f1b23a-436f-4b0f-a76e-85ebaf87a7a2"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"61dc21d32467f07650c783d6","doi":"10.1201/9781003271604","title":"Green Scenarios: Mining Industry Responses to Environmental Challenges of the Anthropocene Epoch.

The environment is transformed due to agriculture, different types of industry, and exploitation of natural mineral resources. The abiotic and biotic elements and their relationships with the environment have been altered in many places. Knowledge and understanding of the inseparable links between human health and environmental health are increasing. However, environmental protection activities conducted up to now are insufficient on a global scale (global change). There is a need to analyze the reasons for inefficiency and list possible erroneous actions in various human activity on mining areas. As a result, a change of the current paradigm is necessary. The modern approach must include the current state of knowledge regarding mechanisms of ecosystem functioning, particularly the Novel Ecosystems and the natural environment, and their roles in providing ecosystem services for the urbanindustrial landscape and societies. In post-mining areas, the innate potential of poor oligotrophic habitats determines their functioning and environmental value for the urban-industrial landscape mosaic. The species composition of spontaneously established vegetation and developing ecosystems are optimally adapted to the specific abiotic conditions of post-mining mineral habitats. A new type of internal relationships is developing with regard to the flows of matter and energy in novel ecosystems. The essential functions of ecosystems, including ecosystems created in mining areas, include the demand for regulation potential of natural processes (e.g., regulation of the water balance, retention and increases of biodiversity, carbon sequestration). Strengthening of the opportunities to adapt to newly established ecosystem functioning in a comprehensive environmental approach should be one of the aims of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the face of global changes. The potential of the natural environment is defined as natural capital, on which ecosystem functioning (ecosystem services) and all aspects of the economy are dependent. We aimed to present the current interdisciplinary environmental knowledge which should be included in CSR with respect to all aspects of economic activity, to limit and counteract global change."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677551","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"317-326","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://opus.us.edu.pl/info/article/USL6dca53ca54194b92892872d0add70705/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62d7","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Jagodziński","uuid":"03F14E2076FEABB44CC7B743F6FD9B59C0B3CE3F788CFE10E84226C037F019164ED6EE4E61A04DD072E5640611915200DC9689ED62B57A29F869C4D59C6D63FF","orcidId":"0000-0001-6899-0985","documentHash":"002defbf-325a-404d-a301-7cc974eec233"},{"objectId":"5e7092e7878c28a04739f022","name":"Gabriela","lastName":"Woźniak","uuid":"2D9FBD547ED5A35CF5E1E8D2C5DD7679C3C0131E7732BE3AC783A27D55AC85FF0DA6826E6609ED403B95EF9697D29BDBD2B4621647DA0B5DEB0701E6C4E2184A","orcidId":"0000-0003-1936-2880","documentHash":"9db4886c-beb8-4af7-a752-7933a8390aa4"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Boswellia carterii","frankincense","essential oil","antioxidant","antimicrobial","antibiofilm","insecticidal activity"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709214878c28a04738fa57","5e7094d9878c28a0473c533c","5e709229878c28a047390e18"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709472878c28a0473bd37b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Antioxidant, Antimicrobial, and Anti-Insect Properties of Boswellia carterii Essential Oil for Food Preservation Improvement","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547ed47","mniswId":"27373","title":"Horticulturae","doi":null,"issn":"2311-7524","eissn":"2311-7524","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d9822e24-c608-4514-bb91-1457594f0cb4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-03-03","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6406fd76409707353499ed6c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6406fd76409707353499ed6d","6406fd76409707353499ed6e","6406fd76409707353499ed6f","6406fd76409707353499ed70","6406fd76409707353499ed71","6406fd76409707353499ed72","5e709472878c28a0473bd37b","5e709229878c28a047390e18","5e709214878c28a04738fa57","6406fd76409707353499ed73","6406fd76409707353499ed74","5e7094d9878c28a0473c533c"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Boswellia carterii, known as frankincense, is a fragrant medicinal plant. The essential oil from this plant is often used in traditional medicine or aromatherapy.

prevention of biofilm formation is crucial for the limitation of bacterial infections typically associated with postoperative infections, complications in bedridden patients, and a short-term prognosis in affected cancer patients or mechanically ventilated patients. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) emerges as a promising alternative for the prevention of infections due to the inability of bacteria to become resistant to aPDT inactivation processes. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the use of a functionalized combination of Chlorin e6 and Pheophorbide as a new approach to more effective aPDT by increasing the accumulation of photosensitizers (PSs) within Escherichia coli cells. The accumulation of PSs and changes in the dry mass density of single-cell bacteria before and after aPDT treatment were investigated by digital holotomography (DHT) using the refractive index as an imaging contrast for 3D label-free live bacteria cell imaging. The results confirmed that DHT can be used in complex examination of the cell–photosensitizer interaction and characterization of the efficiency of aPDT.

The study was conducted among 145 Russian and 102 Polish teachers. The developed questionnaire consisted of 20 questions on the research topic. The anonymous study was conducted in July 2020 after the second academic semester. The analysis of the results showed 100% adaptation of the teachers of University of Economy in Bydgoszcz in the transition to the distance learning format and 75% adaptation of the teachers of Transbaikal State University in the transition to the distance learning format. The older teachers of the TSU, who were used to working offline, were not in the mood to fully use information technologies in the future after the end of the pandemic, and some respondents were sceptical about distance learning format. The WSG used a synchronous form of delivery of materials, in contrast to the TSU, which used a more asynchronous format. WSG employees plan to make the distance learning format one of the components of the training system in the future. The results indicate the need for universities to continue improving digital transformation, which is currently one of the most effective means for involving students in the educational process."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677566","journalIssue":{"objectId":"648abc01409707349d30317d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"907f8bf4-cf56-4e56-a74d-5b39f6a33c3c"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"648ab967409707349d30092c","mniswId":null,"startDate":"2021-11-02","endDate":"2021-11-03","fullName":"IV INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC AND PRACTICAL CONFERENCE “NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES IN THE ARCHITECTURE AND CONSTRUCTION” (NITAC 2021)","shortName":"IV INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC AND PRACTICAL CONFERENCE “NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES IN THE ARCHITECTURE AND CONSTRUCTION” (NITAC 2021)","city":"Yekateringburk","country":"RU","website":"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/acp/article-abstract/2657/1/010001/2831637/Preface-IV-International-Scientific-and-Practical?redirectedFrom=fulltext","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"5b059545-5764-4087-9826-2953d0949645"},"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2657","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/5.0106835","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"648abc01409707349d303180","name":"A.","lastName":"Skaliy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3f37a6cc-b1df-41e3-9795-8c8de337f53c"},{"objectId":"648abc01409707349d30317f","name":"S.

The performance of the normalized RBF network regression estimates is also tested in simulations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677568","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"63da1f10409707687b01153a","mniswId":null,"startDate":"2022-06-19","endDate":"2022-06-23","fullName":"21st International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing","shortName":"ICAISC 2022","city":"Zakopane","country":"PL","website":"https://icaisc.eu/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"5728e1ba-1333-41bc-bff3-e23d586425d0"},"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"363-376","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-23492-7_31","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a0473976df","name":"Adam","lastName":"Krzyżak","uuid":"B5179A17D06B0F363F3867C958A3BFD83D55F97D3B2D68BF41D83C4A15637C2F33BD7D991CD10D086263A395F61A4E8EF0E8BCAE620D3F98DB3258678D088D0E","orcidId":"0000-0003-0766-2659","documentHash":"a7346ade-e339-4357-9c91-414b7a5cb45f"},{"objectId":"5e709235878c28a047391add","name":"MARIAN","lastName":"PARTYKA","uuid":"897E6DD33B7E9B285299A047A483018DDB3FC10CC4E30C0A28555B45AD62D5F011F4D5FC5F044676652CB537A9C46193467FFB0017395B4F04C1D3BD0FFC1E9C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9083a1fd-f1fd-4f10-8a62-63bdaaef3d56"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e732","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Gałkowski","uuid":"711706D5F7948C6DA549C621C9681865DEE74EF0AE528CDD764DC7D3B059B07A51178AEFB50D831A8D58972CE3B37DF3535BD3E781F18579579DCFA02C66F595","orcidId":"0000-0001-9989-7708","documentHash":"de8b37db-be68-4b80-bb03-bd088741a3f7"}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-23492-7_31"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["inflammatory bowel disease","dog","cat"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709422878c28a0473b6d2d","662a3e6640970762633a5f4f","5e709224878c28a047390855","5e7091fc878c28a04738e27a","5e709224878c28a047390873"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Nieswoiste zapalenie jelit u psów i kotów – obserwacje własne","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478e2c","mniswId":"14214","title":"Medycyna Weterynaryjna","doi":null,"issn":"0025-8628","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"7e1ddf8d-ae73-466a-a954-ccae7c1919cf"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2022-12-12","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6407048740970770355cf86d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7091fc878c28a04738e27a","5e709224878c28a047390855","5e709224878c28a047390873","5e709422878c28a0473b6d2d","662a3e6640970762633a5f4f"]},"issue":"12","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the study is to present our observations related to the diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in dogs and cats based on clinical cases. Inflammatory bowel disease is a group of diseases characterized by chronic and/or recurring gastrointestinal signs of unknown cause. The etiology of inflammatory bowel disease in dogs and cats is not fully understood. The disease can be caused by genetic factors, abnormal reactions of the immune system, damage to the protective barrier of the mucosa, and environmental factors. Symptoms of IBD are not very characteristic, and the \"gold standard\" in its diagnosis is endoscopy combined with the collection of mucosa specimens for histopathological examination. The treatment of IBD may involve the use of glucocorticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressants, probiotics, and vitamins. Appropriate diet therapy is also important."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677570","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"78","pagesFromTo":"646-650","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.medycynawet.edu.pl/archives/940-summary-2022/summary-122022/6724-summary-med-weter-77-12-6724-2022","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a3e6640970762633a5f4f","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Jankowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"48459222-6aff-4657-82f5-fb011eb647d2"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6d2d","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Kubiak-Nowak","uuid":"1ED5760FA8344C7215DABACF15DF0A8B7DDDE4E0D133B5FB10D95E3C72B3CBCE1D601C6344C27A956E30F6BF9ABD9CE368D6D689BBC15E8F0C68FC169C4B3F08","orcidId":"0000-0001-9842-9240","documentHash":"e318c749-fc0d-4256-993a-b270fe31eb25"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390873","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Glińska-Suchocka","uuid":"9EEFB8B5444F452AABEBDF2BEAB7783EA64A4DB59E0F0F23219DADD271D98A792BA6EE27BCE740EBC87F1005359E577ECF637716F01DB3EA0B33D8EB4164C24A","orcidId":"0000-0002-9480-1508","documentHash":"90430180-f0fd-4e73-9360-5f10ca090836"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390855","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Spużak","uuid":"9ED46EAC4FFB756170ADF977E35418F4536EB2B6FA9C42AFBB6691548387039470C40CC8F904DB92C5168765A57B7A791A46C896408909881A1C8B381F0F2133","orcidId":"0000-0002-0048-1225","documentHash":"b2f716c9-4a62-4fc2-a274-4a4bf1ba39b0"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e27a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kubiak","uuid":"73C51E687565681733FDD51400110034BD9AFF7F9ADB92EBC4FF38266796A47509AD2800D37549B2622F75382A43F8C6AFE04568C3B34259269E14A788ABDF3C","orcidId":"0000-0001-9640-2597","documentHash":"1e73cdf9-bbe3-46a1-b28a-2f9c0fa1955c"}],"doi":"10.21521/mw.6724"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["kardiomiopatia rozstrzeniowa","pies","kot","histopatologia","patologia"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dilated cardiomyopathy","dog","cat","histopathology","pathology"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709440878c28a0473b8ebd"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Kardiomiopatia rozstrzeniowa (DCM) – czy to tylko psi problem?","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"64f04bfacf9a7471b0ea4124","mniswId":"201648","title":"Weterynaria w Praktyce","doi":null,"issn":"1732-1999","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"MINISTRY","editor":null,"documentHash":"d38a8c76-30f8-4a38-bfdd-e1c75a5bac95"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6407042840970770355cf62e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709440878c28a0473b8ebd"]},"issue":"9","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Kardiomiopatia rozstrzeniowa (DCM) jest chorobą upośledzającą budowę i funkcję mięśnia sercowego (głównie lewej komory).

The measurements (the greatest height, width, thickness, width of the lateral and medial joint surface and the height of these joint surfaces) and ratios were calculated (height to width, height to thickness as well as width to height of lateral and medial joint surfaces) and tested according to sexual dimorphism. The best parameter in terms of discriminatory assessment was the patella’s highest height, which made it possible to classify the sex in 46.5% of cases. However, an index of the sum of the height, width and thickness measurements seems to be even better for differentiating between the sexes, making it possible to correctly classify the sex in 49.3% of cases. Due to some limitations of this study and the need of population-specific standard, it is recommend to employ the patella in sex determination only in cases of fragmented human remains and when no other method can be applied.

on performance measurement in waste management service, usually considers assessment tools and methods that focus only on a specific dimension of performance and lacks methods and models that simultaneously consider more dimensions. In this study, adopting the fuzzy logic expert system, we propose a performance measurement model that simultaneously considers three performance dimensions: profitability, financial characteristics and efficiency. To show its empirical implementation, a quantitative analysis was developed regarding the service provided in the 106 Italian provincial capitals that have different owner structures (private, public and mixed). As output, the fuzzy logic system approach adopted generated a rating for the assessment of the performance of the entities, and then a ranking of the cities based on the same. The main results show that: 1) the public owned companies that provide the waste management service have an overall better performance than those with private or mixed ownerships; 2) cities that entrust the waste management service to the same company do not occupy an adjacent position in the ranking.\n\nAs practical implications, the proposed model can help public administrators: a) to control the outcomes of their entities (as the TARI); b) to make a decision whether to provide solid waste management services directly or through a private entity chosen to provide the service in return for a negotiated fee; c) to compare waste management services provided in different cities in an objective way and to monitor their performance over time, with the aim of achieving continuous improvement. The model's outcomes are useful to assist public managers and politicians in assessing the compliance level of performance goals related to the solid waste service; while the overall performance index is a useful tool to assist the decision-making process leading to change either fully or partially, their nature from public to mixed or private. The proposed method is able to formalize and automate the decision-making process concerning the evaluation of the performance of waste management, reducing the distortions of the political and environmental context."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677591","journalIssue":{"objectId":"64886bcd4097072fd770ee14","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"79","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"ce84a27b-fd4b-4c67-8328-de4035276619"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"79","pagesFromTo":"nr art. 101092","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0038012121000847?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64886bcd4097072fd770ee17","name":"Giovanni","lastName":"Mastroleo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"717c32ca-f116-4d74-81aa-1e42a3165d73"},{"objectId":"64886bcd4097072fd770ee16","name":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Dammacco","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"015bf6ed-5a00-4ab3-9fd8-a94d1aacd94b"},{"objectId":"64886bcd4097072fd770ee15","name":"Alessandra","lastName":"Tafuro","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a5ff5217-a3ab-46c5-bb62-b1ec326f1ee9"},{"objectId":"617e0db87523400564d62e4d","name":"Paolo","lastName":"Esposito","uuid":"1145DBC7AE4A2257F0045A48DC7A9F925FE636DDAC745DFB19A85DB50A6137B60609B9DB9A0DDEB5033B6592C7940BF4FDA4FE6415D68ABE10A58AAC95200056","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"77c46136-6bea-4c5b-b554-76e3124022db"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.seps.2021.101092"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709218878c28a04738fe37"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Instytucjonalizacja związku osób tej samej płci jako realizacja zobowiązania pozytywnego państwa z art. 8 EKPC -

To extend our knowledge of this biotechnological workhorse, we investigated the genomic and phenotypic diversity of 56 natural isolates. Y. lipolytica is classified into five clades with no correlation between clade membership and geographic or ecological origin. A low genetic diversity (π = 0.0017) and a pan-genome (6528 genes) barely different from the core genome (6315 genes) suggest Y. lipolytica is a recently evolving species. Large segmental duplications were detected, totaling 892 genes. With three new LTR-retrotransposons of the Gypsy family (Tyl4, Tyl9, and Tyl10), the transposable element content of genomes appeared diversified but still low (from 0.36% to 3.62%). We quantified 34 traits with substantial phenotypic diversity, but genome-wide association studies failed to evidence any associations. Instead, we investigated known genes and found four mutational events leading to XPR2 protease inactivation. Regarding lipid metabolism, most high-impact mutations were found in family-belonging genes, such as ALK or LIP, and therefore had a low phenotypic impact, suggesting that the huge diversity of lipid synthesis and accumulation is multifactorial or due to complex regulations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677594","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"9","pagesFromTo":"1-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2309-608X/9/1/76","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6406fa5440970770355cc9f3","name":"Cécile","lastName":"Neuvéglise","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ba781338-ddf0-4615-b588-6c612d502007"},{"objectId":"6406fa5440970770355cc9f2","name":"Hugo","lastName":"Devillers","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"995f4621-ed85-4d30-a367-e14d1691a7d3"},{"objectId":"6406fa5440970770355cc9f1","name":"Anne-Marie ","lastName":"Crutz-Le Coq","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f184e04f-511d-4b43-819d-29617fe657cb"},{"objectId":"6406fa5440970770355cc9f0","name":"Stéphane","lastName":"Thomas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dcfe8c2a-0c84-40bc-9526-40e7649ec45e"},{"objectId":"6406fa5440970770355cc9ef","name":"Emilie","lastName":"Pasteur","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c4b81e19-2515-4037-802a-2faffddc82c0"},{"objectId":"6406fa5440970770355cc9ee","name":"Frédéric","lastName":"Bigey","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e8d9aec8-d74d-4809-8fbf-2b62b8512524"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e25b","name":"Xymena","lastName":"Połomska","uuid":"A9BDDDB6039FCD03B34E7981C5B0B5A3FAA938577D85771452A8B4823F5A847FDAEE2A37F950F356D7A39FD71DB5116F7A1792C174BEECB9A7C4594081E70BA2","orcidId":"0000-0003-0345-8482","documentHash":"6876e056-3d36-4593-84fe-a8bbe447da86"}],"doi":"10.3390/jof9010076"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biosynthesis","AgNPs","environmental stresses","reactive oxygen species","ROS"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Biogenic Silver Nanoparticles as a Stress Alleviator in Plants: A Mechanistic Overview","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":null,"issn":"1420-3049","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"85ea3d3d-2670-4384-98ee-1b5b44edab21"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-24","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6406f71340970770355cbcc0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709231878c28a0473916a6","65e82dbd409707626313ba7a","65e82dbd409707626313ba7b","65e82dbd409707626313ba7c","65e82dbd409707626313ba7d","65e82dbd409707626313ba7e","65e82dbd409707626313ba7f","65e82dbd409707626313ba80"]},"issue":"11","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Currently, the growth and yield of crops are restrained due to an increase in the occurrence of ecological stresses globally. Biogenic generation of nanomaterials is an important step in the development of environmentally friendly procedures in the nanotechnology field. Silver-based nanomaterials are significant because of their physical, chemical, and biological features along with their plentiful applications. In addition to useful microbes, the green synthesized Ag nanomaterials are considered to be an ecologically friendly and environmentally biocompatible method for the enhancement of crop yield by easing stresses. In the recent decade, due to regular droughts, infrequent precipitation, salinity, and increased temperature, the climate alternation has changed certain ecological systems. As a result of these environmental changes, crop yield has decreased worldwide. The role of biogenic Ag nanomaterials in enhancing methylglyoxal detoxification, antioxidant defense mechanisms, and generating tolerance to stresses-induced ROS injury has been methodically explained in plants over the past ten years. However, certain studies regarding stress tolerance and metal-based nanomaterials have been directed, but the particulars of silver nanomaterials arbitrated stresses tolerance have not been well-reviewed. Henceforth, there is a need to have a good understanding of plant responses during stressful conditions and to practice the combined literature to enhance tolerance for crops by utilization of Ag nanoparticles. This review article illustrates the mechanistic approach that biogenic Ag nanomaterials in plants adopt to alleviate stresses. Moreover, we have appraised the most significant activities by exogenous use of Ag nanomaterials for improving plant tolerance to salt, low and high temperature, and drought stresses."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677596","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"1-24","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/11/3378/pdf?version=1653460855","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e82dbd409707626313ba80","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Haroon","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6b6cfbf4-aad9-41cb-ad97-526ccfbdfc48"},{"objectId":"65e82dbd409707626313ba7f","name":"Nilofar","lastName":"Mustafa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5cc70a77-d221-4326-b049-cf707b01c798"},{"objectId":"65e82dbd409707626313ba7e","name":"Maria","lastName":"Ehsan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7476c390-1e09-452c-8b7f-53a7912ad598"},{"objectId":"65e82dbd409707626313ba7d","name":"Muhammad Shoaib","lastName":"Amjad","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ab3c358c-d413-4e3a-a611-33c570b810f5"},{"objectId":"65e82dbd409707626313ba7c","name":"Zia ur Rehman","lastName":"Mashwani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a70e91ed-0ad6-4607-9f65-72c415a17d94"},{"objectId":"65e82dbd409707626313ba7b","name":"Naveed Iqbal","lastName":"Raja","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"adb645c2-c2c0-4932-905d-ef7c548a1e06"},{"objectId":"65e82dbd409707626313ba7a","name":"Fozia","lastName":"Abasi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b0c8daa8-5831-48e3-997b-06f5fa84cc65"},{"objectId":"5e709231878c28a0473916a6","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Proćków","uuid":"70701C5C678163514436375EF8CAD6D3DB2B353579CDC817CDB9CDC66060DA03F8247EF622FD5202713335D60FD7F634D7DE07E31CA1363A9333A985C3EC803F","orcidId":"0000-0003-4100-3438","documentHash":"3f63635c-e25d-4333-ba43-89dbe7f84a86"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules27113378"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["mikroinstalacje fotowoltaiczne","przekroczenie dopuszczalnego napięcia","wyłączanie falowników"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["exceeding the permitted voltage","photovoltaic micro-installations","switching off inverters"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Problemy wyłączeń mikroinstalacji fotowoltaicznych","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a366","mniswId":"16681","title":"Przegląd Elektrotechniczny","doi":null,"issn":"0033-2097","eissn":"0033-2097","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"7fb5ed22-953f-45a3-8677-4d7dec111abb"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-12-21","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64070b0d40970735349ad88d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709200878c28a04738e6b9","6024c3429543c7744e88f360"]},"issue":"nr 1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Publikacja skupia się na problemie przestojów instalacji PV spowodowanych przekroczeniem dopuszczalnego napięcia sieci - 253 V.

The aim of the study was to provide a better understanding of the patterns and directions of Crepis chromosome evolution, using comparative analyses of rDNA loci number and localisation. The chromosome base number and chromosomal organisation of 5S and 35S rDNA loci were analysed in the phylogenetic background for 39 species of Crepis, which represent the evolutionary lineages of Crepis sensu stricto and Lagoseris, including Lapsana communis. The phylogenetic relationships among all the species were inferred from nrITS and newly obtained 5S rDNA NTS sequences. Despite high variations in rDNA loci chromosomal organisation, most species had a chromosome with both rDNA loci within the same (usually short) chromosomal arm. The comparative analyses revealed several independent rDNA loci number gains and loci repositioning that accompanied diversification and speciation in Crepis. Some of the changes in rDNA loci patterns were reconstructed for the same evolutionary lineages as descending

deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is commonly a neurodevelopmental behavioural disorder in children and adolescents. Mainly characterized by symptoms like lack of attention, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness, it can impact the overall mental development of the one affected. Several factors, both genetic and non-genetic, can be responsible for this disorder. Although several traditional treatment methods involve medication and other counselling techniques, they also come with different side effects. Hence, the choice is now shifting to alternative treatment techniques. Herbal treatments are considered one of the most popular complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) administered. However, issues related to the safety and efficacy of herbal remedies for the treatment of ADHD need to be investigated further. This study aims to find out the recent advancement in evidence-based use of herbal remedies for ADHD by a comprehensive and systematic review that depicts the results of the published works on herbal therapy for the disorder. The electronic databases and the references retrieved from the included studies present related randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and open-label studies. Seven RCTs involving children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD met the inclusion criteria. There is a fair indication of the efficacy and safety of Melissa officinalis L., Bacopa monnieri (L.) Wettst., Matricaria chamomilla L., and Valeriana officinalis L. from the studies evaluated in this systematic review for the treatment of various symptoms of ADHD. Limited evidence was found for Ginkgo biloba L. and pine bark extract. However, various other preparations from other plants did not show significant efficacy. There is inadequate proof to strongly support and recommend the administration of herbal medicines for ADHD, but more research is needed in the relevant field to popularize the alternative treatment approach."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677605","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.827411/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e82dd0409707626313bbe9","name":"Abhijit","lastName":"Dey","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eefae340-1aa0-4b0f-96c6-aa6c218f08cb"},{"objectId":"65e82dd0409707626313bbe8","name":"Devendra K.","lastName":"Pandey","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4edbef17-38f3-4926-a8c6-1c2a24a286ec"},{"objectId":"65e82dd0409707626313bbe7","name":"Mahipal S.","lastName":"Shekhawat","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ba149637-c1dc-47ca-841d-6fc34f3c227a"},{"objectId":"65e82dd0409707626313bbe6","name":"Nusratbanu K.","lastName":"Shaikh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e3218df7-b945-4bf7-803c-191821a0c566"},{"objectId":"65e82dd0409707626313bbe5","name":"Niraj K.","lastName":"Jha","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"be8c8e2f-18f7-49ab-b2a9-07c0eed5343c"},{"objectId":"65e82dd0409707626313bbe4","name":"Mimosa","lastName":"Ghorai","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"14941d1d-6d02-49eb-9fd7-9005db08b943"},{"objectId":"65e82dd0409707626313bbe3","name":"Shreya S.","lastName":"Mitra","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7cba652f-5db6-4292-8509-77b2524c2b93"},{"objectId":"65e82dd0409707626313bbe2","name":"Uttpal","lastName":"Anand","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6d936f85-7614-4688-b92d-cfe7e09754df"},{"objectId":"65e82dd0409707626313bbe1","name":"Tusheema","lastName":"Dutta","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3b8dd9e4-236b-43fc-9bc1-98207bf053e1"},{"objectId":"5e709231878c28a0473916a6","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Proćków","uuid":"70701C5C678163514436375EF8CAD6D3DB2B353579CDC817CDB9CDC66060DA03F8247EF622FD5202713335D60FD7F634D7DE07E31CA1363A9333A985C3EC803F","orcidId":"0000-0003-4100-3438","documentHash":"3f63635c-e25d-4333-ba43-89dbe7f84a86"}],"doi":"10.3389/fphar.2022.827411"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"61dc21d32467f07650c783d6","doi":"10.1201/9781003271604","title":"Green Scenarios: Mining Industry Responses to Environmental Challenges of the Anthropocene Epoch.

Despite unfavourable abiotic conditions (fine-grained, often compacted, erosion-prone substrate, salinity, impaired air-water relations), the vascular flora of these objects is quite diverse. A distinct participation of native species, mainly non-forest species was recorded. Ruderal, meadow, thicket and forest species predominate among them. The species represent different ecological groups reflecting the spectrum of habitats occurring on the sedimentation pools as well as environmental gradients connected with light, moisture, soil reaction and soil fertility. Competitors dominate in the vascular flora of sedimentation pools as well as species with a mixed type of strategy (CR, CS, CSR). Most species reproduce via seeds or vegetatively which enables them to survive in a given place and occupy new areas. Five species are present that can grow in habitats with higher than typical contents of salt in the substrate, including Bulboschoenus maritimus, Spergularia salina, Juncus ranarius, Scirpus lacustris and Puccinellia distans."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677607","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"129-144","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://opus.us.edu.pl/info/article/USL1f4716a69ead45be85a2ce52957850a0/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602b873c9543c7410626de1a","name":"Robert","lastName":"Hanczaruk","uuid":"2DDBE6BAB9C6E4D18244118C27EA113F0FBE9008624281899F5E44488AD6B814F1B06562A534D4465982DEF45D256DABBCF1E607340AFDAF92133CA2E55BD591","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4f7ae12f-fda5-4727-8097-0813dcf793c0"},{"objectId":"5e709316878c28a0473a29b0","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Bąba","uuid":"CCB17581569A76A138DEB9A9DF0708F0527B171743C6F3347952409F341E2BE29FD10B1ED75F53CB58349B2D3852D670231360AF0C2691F2E06E148879B19C61","orcidId":"0000-0001-7428-0429","documentHash":"abf998f8-0325-4dfb-b503-9d093593f90c"},{"objectId":"5e7092ec878c28a04739f444","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kompała-Bąba","uuid":"315003E5E564B83AD1EF114135A2B0B672D89A7B44D690DB85C7159F000090D22E2C2C6ECCE6ABF55B8EC6B235D92D39813C5599A5F90E5D140F1E4A4FE1443A","orcidId":"0000-0002-4736-4704","documentHash":"f7edb539-c684-4915-be07-b106f3a1d2e7"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Metoda scenariuszowa","Globalizacja","Banki","Zadłużenie zagraniczne","Konsumpcja (ekonomia)","Prognozowanie","Bezpieczeństwo ekonomiczne państwa","Bezpieczeństwo narodowe","Inwestycje zagraniczne","Suwerenność państwa"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Globalization","Banks","Foreign investment","Forecasting","National security","Economic security of the state"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"646751ec409707515b4eb8b2","doi":null,"title":"Polska Racja Stanu w Perspektywie 2035","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-67786-04-1","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://sin.akademia.mil.pl/publications/details/i7964","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"40476202-78f5-4067-bd25-9d8405077050","publisher":{"objectId":"5d6d0363878c284eaa45c902","mniswId":"71500","name":"Wydawnictwo naukowe FNCE","documentHash":"26eb0606-8c14-43a2-807c-7ad7f4c6df9e"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","uid":"bABmAiyO82JgMB2LqzOepAg","uuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","parentUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","rootUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","name":"Akademia Sztuki Wojennej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709352878c28a0473a723f"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Scenariusze, rekomendacje i zalecenia dla Polski w perspektywie 2035 roku w obszarze bezpieczeństwa ekonomicznego w kontekście uzależnienia ekonomicznego Polski","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64884c6a4097077564b3888c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709352878c28a0473a723f"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058677608","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"296 -

This study focused on lingual morphology due to its relation to the type of food consumed. Light and scanning electron microscopy on the tongues of 3 adult male hedgehogs was performed. Five types of papillae were distinguished on the dorsal lingual surface: filiform (fork-like), conical, fungiform, vallate and foliate. Small conical papillae covered the dorsal surface of the apex, filiform (fork-like) papillae were found on the corpus, fungiform papillae were scattered among conical as well as fork-like papillae.

Here we investigate the tribological performance of AlN/CrN coatings and a CrN/AlN coating for piston rings. Tribological tests were conducted using a ball-on-disc tribometer. The tribo-tests were performed under a normal load of 5 N, sliding speed of 3.0 m/s, and sliding distance of 1000 m. The topography and morphology of the coatings were analyzed by SEM, EDS and XRD. Moreover, this article also presents the correlations between the angle of action, distribution, surface voltage, and surface energy of coatings, wetted by lube oils and water. The tribological results illustrated that AlN/CrN multilayer coatings (2.3 μm thickness) reduced the friction coefficient by 6%, as compared with CrN/AlN coatings. While the wear rate of AlN/CrN multilayer coatings was increased by 3% compared to reference coating. The tests were carried out under dry friction conditions, surrounded by new oil and surrounded by oil with a 4% content of soot. The novelty of the work is the comparison of the functional properties of anti-wear coatings with strongly hydrophilic or hydrophobic properties during the friction and wear process in laboratory conditions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677615","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6406fc48409707353499e0f2","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"271","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"9175082c-c67a-412d-8e2a-fd14d2afdd44"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"271","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544223003687?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70934f878c28a0473a6ee9","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Wróblewski","uuid":"F5552C9F8E62B230CA7FB36137F66077A3ABE322871DD5B1C44482ECC5EA3DA57178357A772DDC3EDC8D0D6A220FD638E81FEE5F4E713391A2B4C9387C7F0A9A","orcidId":"0000-0001-5811-8333","documentHash":"6a453a36-3eef-40c3-9979-058c6f253ee7"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.energy.2023.126974"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["high-intensity laser therapy","carpal joint","physiotherapy","thermography","clipped coat","skin temperature"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094b4878c28a0473c1f30","662a3cbf40970762633a4eef","5e709415878c28a0473b5f65"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Effects of High-Intensity Laser Therapy (HILT) on Skin Surface Temperature and Vein Diameter in Healthy Racehorses with Clipped and Non-Clipped Coat","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-2615","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"cf012089-3ed8-4dde-a05c-d5b280240cb4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-06","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"640702fb40970770355cef80","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094b4878c28a0473c1f30","5e709415878c28a0473b5f65","662a3cbf40970762633a4eef","662a3cbf40970762633a4ef0","662a3cbf40970762633a4ef1"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this study was to investigate the differences in the effects of high-intensity laser therapy (HILT) on skin surface temperature and vein diameter in the carpal joint region in racehorses with clipped and non-clipped treatment areas. The study included 20 Thoroughbreds split into two equal groups: clipped coat and non-clipped coat. Horses underwent thermographic examination to detect changes in skin surface temperature at the medial surface of the carpal joint, followed by ultrasonographic examination to assess changes in the diameter of the medial palmar vein before and after HILT. The increase in skin surface temperature after HILT was significantly lower in the group with clipped coat than in the non-clipped group. The group with clipped coat showed a greater increase in vessel diameter. There was a significantly weak negative correlation between the changes in average skin surface temperature and vein diameter in both groups. In conclusion, an efficient photothermal effect can be achieved in skin with a non-clipped coat and clipping the treatment area increases photobiostimulation of the tissue, while reducing the photothermal effect. Further research is needed to specify the parameters for the treatment of skin with clipped and non-clipped coat in order to perform effective laser therapy."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677617","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/2/216","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a3cbf40970762633a4ef1","name":"Nina","lastName":"Čebulj-Kadunc","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c9adf3ec-9ab0-43b4-9de7-e82a0af28218"},{"objectId":"662a3cbf40970762633a4ef0","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Dudek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"12e0c6f5-2fda-453b-8762-099ef0024a33"},{"objectId":"662a3cbf40970762633a4eef","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Śniegucka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5bb64fef-ec64-44e0-9083-8b9346faa4ca"},{"objectId":"5e7094b4878c28a0473c1f30","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Zielińska","uuid":"17383BF9B6C46511E99F071DDF30D04E671F4170F8DF55B46055E64137134413C29CF171B3ED7DA6F679239D2ED8701ED5EE5B40AE934945E2EEA4AD9A672D2D","orcidId":"0000-0001-6767-8367","documentHash":"379c1b9f-7a2f-4db4-9d87-c67469c7a5cf"},{"objectId":"5e709415878c28a0473b5f65","name":"Maria","lastName":"Soroko-Dubrovina","uuid":"213319BB579762FF9676A753B02B488CC90C59AEA19A21D18DEFBAB8C4D763D4D72592B475BB5A1B1868C4D7B2A80DA7AB6DF4AE29305411686D9A4FA64BC210","orcidId":"0000-0002-8585-8000","documentHash":"426c9128-3fae-4bad-a16a-519863f20544"}],"doi":"10.3390/ani13020216"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Microbiome","Microbiota","16S rRNA","NGS","Bacteria","Uterine fibroid","Leiomyoma","Pathophysiology"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","uid":"bfUR7pyerT3GiQw3TRkatRw","uuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","parentUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","rootUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","name":"Centrum Medyczne Kształcenia Podyplomowego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c5878c28a0473c3610","5e709386878c28a0473abeca","6164f32875234017e052497a","5ebeca4f752340226956f76f","5ef170567523404d1000ea65"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The role of microbiota in the pathophysiology of uterine fibroids – a systematic review","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d58","mniswId":"6831","title":"Frontiers in Cellular and Infection Microbiology","doi":null,"issn":"2235-2988","eissn":"2235-2988","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f404ba5b-ab30-482c-9d14-8bb0bf9903c7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-26","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6488386c4097072fd76b8cd4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6488386c4097072fd76b8cda","6488386c4097072fd76b8cdb","5e7094c5878c28a0473c3610","5e709386878c28a0473abeca","6164f32875234017e052497a","5ebeca4f752340226956f76f","5ef170567523404d1000ea65","5e7093fa878c28a0473b4509"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"For a long time, the uterus had been considered a sterile organ, meaning that under physiological conditions the uterus would not be colonized by bacteria. Based on available data, it may be concluded that the gut and uterine microbiome are related, and that the role of this microbiome is greater than expected. Despite being the most common pelvic neoplasms in women of reproductive age, uterine fibroids (UFs) are still poorly understood tumors whose etiology has not been fully determined. This systematic review presents the relationship between intestinal and uterine dysbiosis and uterine fibroids. A systematic review of three medical databases was carried out: the MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane. In this study, 195 titles and abstracts were reviewed, including only original articles and clinical trials of uterine microbiome criteria. Finally, 16 studies were included to the analysis. In recent years, researchers dealing with reproduction in a broad sense have focused on the microbiome in various locations to study its role in the pathogenesis and, consequently, the prevention and treatment of diseases of the genital organ. Conventional microbial detection methods are not suitable for identifying bacteria, which are difficult to culture. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides an easier and faster and more informative analysis of bacterial populations. It seems that gut microbiota dysbiosis has the potential to be a risk factor for uterine fibroids or affect the disease process. Some changes were shown in many types of bacteria, such as Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia detected in fecal samples in patients with uterine fibroids. In view of the few results on the link between the microbiome and uterine fibroids, further intensive studies in humans and animal models are necessary, including the possible use of different microbiome modulations in the prevention or treatment of uterine fibroids."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677619","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6488386c4097072fd76b8cd5","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"e35e0c5e-b00e-4a45-9a4d-0d2c9fdba10d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"[1-6]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2023.1177366/full","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6488386c4097072fd76b8cdb","name":"Cezary","lastName":"Wojtyla","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cb1e4eb8-aa67-42e3-9739-115976b177ff"},{"objectId":"6488386c4097072fd76b8cda","name":"Kornelia","lastName":"Zareba","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"199607f8-880d-4273-afc6-55cff08a328e"},{"objectId":"6164f32875234017e052497a","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Korczyńska","uuid":"CEB3A320DA6B1B8A580864ADF384C9BB753ADC37BC44DB20F381CB8825464CB1AA26EFC94B22D62F3E1DC9D95A4566827359FBAFEFBB35DCFD888301E4F7E65F","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f1130ee5-be58-41f1-b7d2-3da27fc54b65"},{"objectId":"5ef170567523404d1000ea65","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Zarychta","uuid":"DFC2B7D59B61040AD0B222C59E650968B12065A1A710AF213872312E9B8B3F1A815964DCE9E1DEA641A00897870138AEE11B9AFE8E83F342FF08C8F8366376B9","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d86029d6-71a9-4b27-b437-25404cc2d440"},{"objectId":"5ebeca4f752340226956f76f","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Zgliczyńska","uuid":"2162A25D4C31B0BAD50BDFEB71BACBE1E163BA2E540939D6DD76353C3C31078FF47D83D65DA11B1A3B7416AAC4EE62E7137BB65B6BA3DDF3B3FC0B9C9DF134E9","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f0eb3a17-ee59-40f1-b959-aa0d5729120b"},{"objectId":"5e7094c5878c28a0473c3610","name":"Michał","lastName":"Ciebiera","uuid":"A4A02D1E2D83B05ADE4D4130BE7631E6CC5B3FB6E4CB6FE5FFF98EFE18A678426B75C6629512C895D103666CA3EB1C22A29C3A5B4597D4644871F4951E5B6468","orcidId":"0000-0001-5780-5983","documentHash":"977326e1-77d5-4844-bdf9-344897610949"},{"objectId":"5e7093fa878c28a0473b4509","name":"Michalina","lastName":"Dąbrowska","uuid":"117665C69C49981522C9C4A6CA1A17A47D3C86BAF64EF0F86CBBAAEE2AB9A5A45A004F5C0E67AECFF86D67AAB8C0A96598C8AB199D08F9173BEDFDE50F17B2B8","orcidId":"0000-0002-7585-4946","documentHash":"a6701627-0840-414a-a212-7eedf18ebc06"},{"objectId":"5e709386878c28a0473abeca","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Żeber-Lubecka","uuid":"E175A2CACCAFC8819A5C38B6C817D1AF277DF0C59E016C75976173D3322414D399F0C3CADF558811B31C591F076EF4915B53BB07C67CE6B1D91B3020F76C606A","orcidId":"0000-0003-4036-3191","documentHash":"919cdeb0-369b-4135-9d1f-9383328ec240"}],"doi":"10.3389/fcimb.2023.1177366"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet

Essential oils have been considered as potential pest management agents, because they demonstrate to have a broad range of bioactivity, possess contact, and fumigant toxicity. In addition, the major advantages of many plant-based acaricides lie in their low toxicity to agroecosystems. Botanical acaricides composed of essential oils may prove to be a good choice for the more persistent synthetic acaricides. In this study, the acaricidal effect of four plant-derived essential oils against adults of the two important crop pests, Tetranychus urticae (Koch) 1836 and Eutetranychus orientalis (Klein) 1936 are studied. The fumigant toxicity revealed that all the essential oils tested Mentha pulegium L., Lavandula stoechas L., Rosmarinus officinalis L., and Origanum compactum Benth (Lamiaceae family) displayed an acaricidal effect. At the highest dose (625 µl/ml), mortalities recorded were found between 91 and 98% and 92 and 99% at 24 and 48 h, respectively, for T. urticae, and between 90 and 98% and 94 and 99% at 24 and 48 h, respectively, for E. orientalis. The M. pulegium L. essential oil represents the highest activity against E. orientalis and T. urticae. For the binary combination between the EOs (essential oils) and the acaricide based on the active ingredient acequinocyl, the results showed that the mixture of O. compactum EO (essential oil) + acequinocyl exhibited an important acaricidal effect on T. urticae and E. orientalis with 99% at 24 h and 100% at 48 h of mortality, followed by M. pulegium EO + acequinocyl with 92% at 24 h and 95% at 48 h for T. urticae as well as 99% at 24 h and 100% at 48 h for E. orientalis of mortality. Whereas, the mixture of L. stoechas EO + acequinocyl presented the lowest activity against T. urticae and E. orientalis with 82–87% at 24 h and 86–90% at 48 h, respectively. The mixtures (M. pulegium EO + acequinocyl, R. officinalis EO + acequinocyl, and O. compactum EO + acequinocyl) exerted a high acaricidal effect against E. orientalis. These promising results could help to develop botanical pesticides that could be used in integrated pest management."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677621","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2022","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2022/2004623/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a487840970762633a767e","name":"Abdellah","lastName":"Farah","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bed4bbbe-8064-4795-bc05-6f13e5c7f904"},{"objectId":"662a487840970762633a767d","name":"Abderrahim","lastName":"Lazraq","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0a903972-aa8b-4496-a50c-8a475d23218c"},{"objectId":"662a487840970762633a767c","name":"Bushra Abdulkarim","lastName":"Moharram","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ce0a86c2-4191-4d31-9b99-8e98cf3d3591"},{"objectId":"662a487840970762633a767b","name":"Essam A.","lastName":"Ali","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4f1dec8a-b7bb-4258-b510-5a20a8951411"},{"objectId":"662a487840970762633a767a","name":"Saoussan","lastName":"Annemer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e9786acf-24ad-4ca1-be1c-e983c0ead576"},{"objectId":"662a487840970762633a7679","name":"Amal","lastName":"Ramzi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2ca5ebf7-af7e-4b5b-b2ff-97cffa182971"},{"objectId":"662a487840970762633a7678","name":"Mohammed","lastName":"Kara","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3373c54e-ef5b-48bc-9e4f-d01b939d4eca"},{"objectId":"662a487840970762633a7677","name":"Amine","lastName":"Assouguem","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"220dbf1e-04e8-4ab3-ac51-0b2739b2ccd6"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6cb0","name":"ALICJA","lastName":"KOWALCZYK","uuid":"C705216E59FBAAFF2A7C88BB52B61ED0953F96BE8F409A91F245C381B4D326994B9DCAD17731D944FF8827468890DDB642B964255EF2DAF115CB1F0912FEDB35","orcidId":"0000-0003-1908-2942","documentHash":"bcfe947d-bb6d-4d1f-9007-b5865024847a"}],"doi":"10.1155/2022/2004623"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biofilm","Klebsiella pneumoniae","CAUTI","antiseptics","surfactants","catheters"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

quantitative and qualitative changes of soil organic matter result from degradation processes, such as water erosion connected with intense arable land use. In order to take adequate preventive action, the proper indicators of soil quality or degradation are urgently needed. In particular, tests considering the soil organic matter quality seem to be beneficial for soil monitoring. In this paper, we performed organic matter fractionation using the Tyurin and IHSS procedures on eight profiles of chernozemic soils (non-degraded, eroded, forest and accumulative soils). The study conducted confirmed the applicability of using humic and fulvic fractions in order to determine the pedogenesis processes and degradation rates of chernozemic soils. For example, the HA/FA ratio was higher in non-eroded and accumulative soils, compared with eroded or forest profiles. These findings were supported by statistical discrimination performed on the mid-infrared spectra of humic acids extracted from the selected profiles. Groups of samples were divided into classes depending on land usage or degradation rate. Considering the results, fractions of humic substances can be recommended as useful tools for the assessment of soil transformation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677626","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/3/733/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a37cf40970762633a2c6e","name":"Michał","lastName":"Dudek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e34cf4b2-a3cf-4abc-9a6c-9c1b48cc8b8c"},{"objectId":"602f416a9543c7410626f26f","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Bednik","uuid":"92DF00E1F2269614A0C8F80C4AC2D21E3896D987609F7D59EF43053262433B33F80C4B7C2C02205028C9D5A62A051027E8B5A8A88318C2356DD21D19B71B6836","orcidId":"0000-0003-3209-9044","documentHash":"e024b1f9-9aee-4b21-8d5c-55e22c1c692f"},{"objectId":"5e70920d878c28a04738f2d8","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Medyńska-Juraszek","uuid":"A97CAD4C33290C92643BF27D1123970777A0D8E5397A8E4A6B73B39C75293098728F6313E70FFFDDC36A00239FF1AC0E735274DD97063B766B39B3313691A4DC","orcidId":"0000-0002-9891-2600","documentHash":"ce4f4572-f246-4666-b3e0-c6d43ca7d7fd"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e230","name":"Beata","lastName":"Łabaz","uuid":"8406E6A1ED619554B565A604766930DBE8269EC2E70691DC4AB92928DDA2C86050D1A7E96D2CAAEDB748253E6F5AF122F49418DD379F38741F9A6B619D506E9E","orcidId":"0000-0003-0957-015X","documentHash":"21627ec9-e044-4590-bb43-01fd644e3212"}],"doi":"10.3390/agronomy12030733"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6407106740970770355d1290","doi":null,"title":"Wirusologia","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-012-2238-3","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://researchportal.amu.edu.pl/info/book/UAMc422ae6ff389459197d28cbceca00afa/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"d947c795-2635-47b7-91ea-996e0e786469","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb941","mniswId":"72100","name":"Wydawnictwo

existence of more than one liquid state in a single-component system remains the most intriguing physical phenomenon. Herein, we explore the effect of cation self-assembly on ion dynamics in the vicinity of liquid-liquid and liquid-glass transition of tetraalkyl phosphonium ([Pmmm,n]+, m = 4, 6; n = 2-14) ionic liquids. We found that nonpolar local domains formed by 14-carbon alkyl chains are crucial in obtaining two supercooled states of different dynamics within a single ionic liquid. Although the nano-ordering, confirmed by Raman spectroscopy, still occurs for shorter alkyl chains (m = 6, n < 14), it does not bring calorimetric evidence of LLT. Instead, it results in peculiar behavior of ion dynamics near the liquid-glass transition and 20-times smaller size of the dynamic heterogeneity compared to imidazolium ionic liquids. These results represent a crucial step toward understanding the nature of the LLT phenomenon and offer insight into the design of efficient electrolytes based on ionic liquids revealing self-assembly

aim of this study was to assess the effect of the standard crosslinking (CXL) procedure on corneal properties and subsequent changes in collagen bonds formation using optical coherence tomography (OCT) corneal speckle statistics and vibrational spectroscopy. Porcine eyes with intact corneal epithelium were randomly selected to one of the four study groups: (1) untreated eyes moistened with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); (2) eyes after the epithelial debridement and riboflavin application; (3) eyes after CXL procedure according to the Dresden protocol; and (4) eyes after corneal epithelial debridement, regularly moistened with PBS. Before and after this selection, each eyeball was subjected to the constant intraocular pressure of 20 mmHg. Then, ocular biometry was performed and the central cornea was imaged using spectral-domain OCT. Following this, a nonparametric approach to speckle modeling (the Contrast Ratio (CR)) was utilized within the region of interest for each B-scan covering the central corneal stroma. To verify whether the CXL performed ex-vivo results in formation of new bonds in the cornea, Fourier Transform Infrared Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR-FTIR) spectra of dried corneas, dissected from examined eyeballs, were collected and analyzed. Corneal epithelium removal alone or with the riboflavin application leads to a statistically significant decrease in the CR median value (the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p < 0.05). However, the most pronounced change in CR median value, which decreases with the increased number of scatterers, was shown after the complete CXL procedure including riboflavin soaking and UVA irradiation (the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = 0.004). Analysis of ATR-FTIR spectra revealed influence of UVA irradiation on collagen matrix. The study has shown the increased dehydration accompanied by almost no alteration of collagen native triple-helical structure. Significant changes have been observed for bands related to collagen crosslinks. Specifically, the predominant changes occurred in the sugar region from 1150 to 975 cm−1, as well as in the absorbance of carbonyl groups. Furthermore, the ratio of two Amide I components at approximately 1660 cm−1 and 1675 cm−1 decreased after UVA irradiation. Together, these results provided the evidence for the creation of new corneal crosslinks. In conclusion, this study clearly indicates that the UVA exposure causes the substantial difference in optical scattering occurring in corneal stroma as a result of the induced biochemical changes at the molecular level in this tissue assessed with ATR-FTIR. The proposed speckle-based methodology brings a new insight into the development of OCT technology useful in an indirect assessment of some collagen changes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677636","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"219","pagesFromTo":"1-7","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014483522001312?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a3e1040970762633a5c46","name":"Robert","lastName":"Iskander","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"972be7d2-512d-4e1b-a4b1-47152692a451"},{"objectId":"662a3e1040970762633a5c44","name":"Marcela","lastName":"Niemczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2475ef18-fc21-4919-89f4-a9a5606b4cda"},{"objectId":"662a3e1040970762633a5c43","name":"Marlena","lastName":"Gąsior-Głogowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7e6a8662-0656-45f2-845e-84e0d8c38148"},{"objectId":"662a3e1040970762633a5c41","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kostyszak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6f30a308-00d9-480c-90bb-e3dfed09e82b"},{"objectId":"662a3e1040970762633a5c40","name":"Monika","lastName":"Danielewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d0270493-ccc4-49b2-b912-aa0592ab7efe"},{"objectId":"5e70941c878c28a0473b65db","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Sareło","uuid":"19E23CAEC83B7798F174FD6B7ED1DE5330EE8684739E7A7F86FD1692DF9FC6CA23D6018CFE0C3B7CF6CC19A0751C75FD0DD6B3660DF50CFB59C30F8B56FD2E20","orcidId":"0000-0002-9125-7594","documentHash":"518427da-429f-46c9-a5ca-db965176da22"},{"objectId":"5e7093ea878c28a0473b333b","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Antończyk","uuid":"DD9D0B75195D23A2DCFBB0CD3F07E7196F982E9E403DBDB396A7C0445111C17B5887416C52709864509015B7BF76461E810F4703A33D307BA21F09C63D1410F1","orcidId":"0000-0003-2065-4223","documentHash":"931eccbb-fe76-4c8f-9ebb-a87551577ce4"},{"objectId":"5e709237878c28a047391e35","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Prządka","uuid":"A9E4B1F0863AEDDC42EF8B29FF4B1C4A30E4BB310F2DEE73C97E935D63600D503EB4CCEC7BD5FFC059F54211D928E1C07386BD6103057E5BB49E6A7DFF9EF257","orcidId":"0000-0003-3596-2990","documentHash":"bc3e91d6-2104-4b7a-8974-4461a64577cf"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e278","name":"ZDZISŁAW","lastName":"KIEŁBOWICZ","uuid":"CA3A3030B21BD397A7F4C274FC32E5293877D00089118295C23138F6B24C041431278D20F123EB1D9A27650B040BDA57C8BFDD412B1234967AEEE10D5AA1A9B7","orcidId":"0000-0003-4946-0449","documentHash":"516738fc-5255-4c55-b500-9297c632ed1b"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.exer.2022.109051"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c2fc239543c7233654339a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Recent advances in the detection of glioblastoma, from imaging-based methods to proteomics and biosensors: A narrative review","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477525","mniswId":"3203","title":"Cancer Cell International","doi":null,"issn":"1475-2867","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"7a619f27-a386-4fc4-b67d-4818bef74a45"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-20","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64885a6c4097072fd76f515a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64885a6c4097072fd76f515b","64885a6c4097072fd76f515c","64885a6c4097072fd76f515d","60c2fc239543c7233654339a","64885a6c4097072fd76f515e","64885a6c4097072fd76f515f","64885a6c4097072fd76f5160","64885a6c4097072fd76f5161","64885a6c4097072fd76f5162","64885a6c4097072fd76f5163","64885a6c4097072fd76f5164"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive type of cancer that originates in the cells called astrocytes, which support the functioning of nerve cells.

These changes are fine-tuned by many genetic and epigenetic factors, including posttranslational histone modifications such as histone acetylation. Antagonistically acting enzymes, histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylases (HDACs), which control histone acetylation in many developmental processes, are believed to control SE. However, the function of specific HAT/HDACs and the genes that are subjected to histone acetylation-mediated regulation during SE have yet to be revealed. Here, we present the global and gene-specific changes in histone acetylation in Arabidopsis explants that are undergoing SE. In the TSA (trichostatin A)-induced SE, we demonstrate that H3 and H4 acetylation might control the expression of the critical transcription factor (TF) genes of a vital role in SE, including LEC1, LEC2 (LEAFY COTYLEDON 1; 2), FUS3 (FUSCA 3) and MYB118 (MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 118). Within the HATs and HDACs, which mainly positively regulate SE, we identified HDA19 as negatively affecting SE by regulating LEC1, LEC2 and BBM. Finally, we provide some evidence on the role of HDA19 in the histone acetylation-mediated regulation of LEC2 during SE. Our results reveal an essential function of histone acetylation in the epigenetic mechanisms that control the TF genes that play critical roles in the embryogenic reprogramming of plant somatic cells. The results implicate the complexity of Hac-related gene regulation in embryogenic induction and point to differences in the regulatory mechanisms that are involved in auxin- and TSA-induced SE."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677640","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"863","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709419878c28a0473b634b","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Wójcikowska","uuid":"D8DE9EEBDCCDB5F819E4335ABB3202450B652A179E98AA3AD5404BBF9101992B27D6DBF11FCBD4053A97135FD2196C7848D135411AAF7667C1AD3CA6F097B343","orcidId":"0000-0003-0287-9859","documentHash":"104e31d8-13ca-46e0-b34b-e579d2685398"},{"objectId":"5e70937d878c28a0473aaf82","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Morończyk","uuid":"6111F18DBB255E3A8997804DD12CAF58DB6383AF23F3A59D7A710E56A28F44E9787F605FF190D06E6CBB5F63FD0DC5FDD04DDD466AFED7B7138F8E63AB4F539A","orcidId":"0000-0003-2317-1219","documentHash":"b48e13bc-feaa-43fb-b4e8-f8704106ba1d"},{"objectId":"5e709301878c28a0473a0e2a","name":"Anna","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"A163430001E887C2566CC7A31E6FACD80CAB418BCA6321988AB317735DCDD7F6C759C125A7550A65595E22B4B9DDAD10F50DE6FAB6E385CCDB4459C7B5DB0650","orcidId":"0000-0001-5511-2569","documentHash":"f942a59c-0045-4929-beff-47feea1c413f"},{"objectId":"5e7092ec878c28a04739f46c","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Chwiałkowska","uuid":"EE41AF86A22404862ACE83A13B0A5FEBB96C7156582ABAF86CAE76DB794490FF902F9EA9C9EA5A0582CF5EE3E243A833E66AD91F6B97717758105B432DAB1DB5","orcidId":"0000-0001-8053-8959","documentHash":"629e956a-1063-41fd-986d-62a9dfbc3791"},{"objectId":"5e7092ec878c28a04739f449","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Kwaśniewski","uuid":"45F3888879134B05F33C81998B02628E79B484A10BDDEC2E9E2E147AF54B50D149DADB61FCD0CE368165776865AD8039F44C75767F8C218FBBD0BAC430D0FA6A","orcidId":"0000-0003-2598-108X","documentHash":"877d74cc-7d4f-4c3b-a6c2-f26171c4e0ce"},{"objectId":"5e7092ec878c28a04739f430","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"A38A2E979C3DA54CFACA0B638115B78E21ECFCD09F659036321021457456A99031A85BCF70FB8C63417B93A9DF02717430029CF7B2890BED227BCDC64144E2BC","orcidId":"0000-0003-3657-6119","documentHash":"c6d0831e-e66b-4727-8a13-265d6a17b430"},{"objectId":"5e7092ec878c28a04739f3fe","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Brąszewska","uuid":"6DF732D9CCDB635899E275E2BCA0800D9749062FA32D9FC5F4530BD936805565163FF0825AF132CD84636E60BB1E8A6D493DD3612C4B10EBE1AD04AE0F0C8BDB","orcidId":"0000-0003-0997-8753","documentHash":"257d2df2-3725-41c4-8539-72eef6fff6ad"},{"objectId":"5e7092e7878c28a04739effb","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Gaj","uuid":"EBF665596788F05DD46EFD6E36376EAC222E93BEE8C285B295F0FF499CD0040E76921B4B731794CEB8D78CB9E424488D233A780C3AAEBFC50DEFBB1101F775D7","orcidId":"0000-0003-2995-4134","documentHash":"54ccc0aa-2285-486e-8f29-1e1cb0b8c74f"}],"doi":"10.3390/cells11050863"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Electrical impedance tomography, Long short-term memory  networks, Machine learning, Moisture imaging"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd3a","uid":"bfskHPklsldyd3xD172-Eng","uuid":"f4dd5e8d-c071-4ec2-a048-faf9c2aae76d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd3a","parentUuid":"f4dd5e8d-c071-4ec2-a048-faf9c2aae76d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd3a","rootUuid":"f4dd5e8d-c071-4ec2-a048-faf9c2aae76d","name":"Lubelska Akademia WSEI","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709428878c28a0473b7561","5e709434878c28a0473b8278"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Use of the Two-Stage Neural System in Electrical Impedance Tomography for Imaging Moisture inside Walls","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2023-01-24","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"648ae67d409707349d32bf71","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621b878c2877157415a9","mniswId":"15","startDate":null,"endDate":null,"fullName":"ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems","shortName":"SENSYS","city":null,"country":null,"website":null,"isEdition":false,"documentHash":"89e39961-b320-435d-ad9f-a52679d3b3a6"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["648ae67d409707349d32bf72","5e709434878c28a0473b8278","5e709428878c28a0473b7561"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Damp walls of buildings are a serious problem due to the social and economic consequences. Moisture causes accelerated wear of facades, paint coatings, weakening of the wall structure, and high maintenance and renovation costs. The growth of fungi and bacteria worsens the indoor microclimate [1]. Effective identification of moisture inside the walls enables effective preventive actions. The paper presents an algorithmic concept that increases the quality of tomographic images showing the distribution of moisture inside the walls. The method solves the problem of monitoring the dampness of historical buildings and walls susceptible to moisture. The research focuses on solving the inverse problem of converting electrical measurements into spatial images. The study used a proprietary electrical impedance tomography system with specially designed electrodes. The measurement vector is converted to images in two stages. In the first stage, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network was used, which generates raw reconstructions. The task of the second LSTM network is to convert the raw images obtained in the first stage into enhanced images. The application of the presented method is not limited to one type of narrow-sphere tomography. The two-stage approach can be easily adapted to, e.g., medical and industrial or process tomography.

Since amoebae belonging to the genus Acanthamoeba are not only\r\nof environmental but also of clinical significance, it is of great importance to fully understand their\r\nphysiology. Thus, determination of MLB lipid composition could partly address these questions.\r\nBecause MLBs are secreted by amoebae as a result of bacteria digestion, the co-culture technique\r\nwith the use of “edible” Klebsiella aerogenes was used for their production. Lipids obtained from The\r\nMLB fraction, previously purified from bacterial debris, were analyzed by high-performance thinlayer\r\nchromatography, gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, and high-resolution\r\nmass spectrometry. Lipidomic analysis revealed that in MLBs, a very abundant lipid class was a\r\nnon-phosphorous, polar glycerolipids, diacylglyceryl-O-(N,N,N)-trimethylhomoserine (DGTS). Since\r\nDGTSs are regarded as a source of nitrogen and fatty acids, MLBs can be considered as lipid storage\r\norganelles produced in stress conditions.

Czytaniu Szymborskiej, podporządkowanemu poetyce wyrafinowanej zabawy, wydaje się patrono-wać zarówno idea dawnych gabinetów osobliwości, której odpowiednikiem w przypadku rzeczywistości książkowej staje się swoista, odzwierciedlająca kierunek lektury Bibliotheca Curiosa, jak i Tuwimowska zasada cicer cum caule, określająca podstawę stworzonej przez poetę kolekcji „niepotrzebnych wiadomości”."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<strong>“Homo Ludens with a Book”. On Lektury nadobowiązkowe [Non-compulsory readings] by Wisława Szymborska. </strong>This article is an analysis of Wisława Szymborska’s style of reading used by the poet in her quasi-reviews collected in Lektury nadobowiązkowe [Non-compulsory readings]. The ludic poetics of the book is closely related to the author’s inclination towards curiosity and nonsense humour which expresses her typical “sense of oddness”. The aim of the reading is thus to reveal in radically diverse texts (a floristic compendium or a popular guidebook How to live more comfortably side by side with Montaigne’s Essays or Nietzsche’s Aphorisms) some uncommon details, humorous paradoxes and unexpected facts and incidents. Szymborska’s way of reading, animated by the spirit of a sophisticated play, has also its source in the historic concept of cabinets of curiosities, reflected here in the Bibliotheca Curiosa as well as in Julian Tuwim’s device cicer cum caule structuring his famous collection of “useless knowledge”."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677650","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"92-104","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.24917/23534583.10.7","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709232878c28a0473917a0","name":"Maria","lastName":"Tarnogórska","uuid":"154030E098F365D2FCDD0172B1D5A1725DDF7A3119D2D658A49E6DDC53B7704C7FA9AF2D86D0EA5D59FAB5DF4EE1A9551D76466B977A23129D548FD83284AECB","orcidId":"0000-0001-5257-1620","documentHash":"8ae913cf-cb94-43db-9675-67b432efc9ea"}],"doi":"10.24917/23534583.10.7"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["crop type mapping","spectral indices","principal component analysis","random forest","agriculture"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Evaluation of Spectral Vegetation Indexes and Redundancy Reduction on the Accuracy of Crop Type Detection","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-3417","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ff202409-59bf-494e-82ae-6802b8fb2444"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-17","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6406f36940970770355cb4d8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709422878c28a0473b6cc3","65eae48840970762632b9a35"]},"issue":"10","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Knowledge about crop type distribution is valuable information for effective management of agricultural productivity, food security estimation, and natural resources protection. Algorithms for automatic crop type detection have great potential to positively influence these aspects as well as speed up the process of crop type mapping in larger areas. In the presented study, we used 14 Sentinel-2 images to calculate 12 widely used spectral vegetation indices. Further, to evaluate the effect of reduced dimensionality on the accuracy of crop type mapping, we utilized principal component analysis (PCA). For this purpose, random forest (RF)-supervised classifications were tested for each index separately, as well as for the combinations of various indices and the four initial PCA components. Additionally, for each RF classification feature importance was assessed, which enabled identification of the most relevant period of the year for the differentiation of crop types. We used 34.6% of the ground truth field data to train the classifier and calculate various accuracy measures such as the overall accuracy (OA) or Kappa index. The study showed a high effectiveness of the Modified Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index (MCARI) (OA = 86%, Kappa = 0.81), Normalized Difference Index 45 (NDI45) (OA = 85%, Kappa = 0.81), and Weighted Difference Vegetation Index (WDVI) (OA = 85%, Kappa = 0.80) in crop type mapping. However, utilization of all of them together did not increase the classification accuracy (OA = 78%, Kappa = 0.72). Additionally, the application of the initial three components of PCA allowed us to achieve an OA of 78% and Kappa of 0.72, which was unfortunately lower than the single-index classification (e.g., based on only NDVI45). This shows that dimensionality reductions did not increase the classification accuracy. Moreover, feature importance from RF indicated that images captured from June and July are the most relevant for differentiating crop types. This shows that this period of the year is crucial to effectively differentiate crop types and should be undeniably used in crop type mapping."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058677652","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/10/5067/pdf?version=1653009021","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eae48840970762632b9a35","name":"Marta","lastName":"Pasternak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d0a1ed1c-9789-42c6-9c57-75dad521e04b"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6cc3","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Pawłuszek-Filipiak","uuid":"EB2CEB5F2BA2743F2490B16DB767063ED6AA6E8AB19E69E2422264290DB59BE404533A33A66271C92A1893204F039985A6F23ADD1DB24226388784E32BF9C6C0","orcidId":"0000-0003-2162-371X","documentHash":"a5b2da57-8267-4a03-8a2f-aeb97764ff62"}],"doi":"10.3390/app12105067"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6407106740970770355d1290","doi":null,"title":"Wirusologia","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-012-2238-3","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://researchportal.amu.edu.pl/info/book/UAMc422ae6ff389459197d28cbceca00afa/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"d947c795-2635-47b7-91ea-996e0e786469","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb941","mniswId":"72100","name":"Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN","documentHash":"ca25cf52-932a-4fa1-876c-5b030f39b8f0"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Papillomawirusy","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"640710b240970770355d14ed","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093d3878c28a0473b1647"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058677655","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"59-67","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://researchportal.amu.edu.pl/info/article/UAM7843eeba1fa648a48fe07e342e08d536/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093d3878c28a0473b1647","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Warowicka","uuid":"88FD31B6D05467025A1D79412137B857F823E716486B27D9B95A3AFB7F5B943CE1B570EF2A7279AE9E8FA552353FEDF6941EA38BA6E947F15807141EB29DEE2D","orcidId":"0000-0003-4301-9855","documentHash":"bf7dd723-d44d-47b1-b3e0-44a5b31581c9"}],"doi":null}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA1ODY3NzY1NQ=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
