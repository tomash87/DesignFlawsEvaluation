It is meant to be a full-fledge, comprehensive presentation of many aspects related to the broadly perceived fractional-order dynamical systems which constitute an extension of the traditional integer-order-type descriptions. This implies far-reaching consequences, both analytic and algorithmic, because—in general—properties of the traditional integer-order systems cannot be directly extended by a straightforward generalization to fractional-order systems, modeled by fractional-order differential equations involving derivatives of an non-integer order. This can be useful for describing and analyzing, for instance, anomalies in the behavior of various systems, chaotic behavior, etc. The book contains both analytic contributions with state-of-the-art and theoretical foundations, algorithmic implementation of tools and techniques, and—finally—some examples of relevant and successful practical applications."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057403318","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"402","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":"2198-4182","series":"Studies in Systems, Decision and Control","translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-89972-1","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-89972-1"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Postpartum depression","Pregnancy","Psychology","Prevention","Risk factors"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","uid":"bfUR7pyerT3GiQw3TRkatRw","uuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","parentUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deca","rootUuid":"69cad015-151b-4fe2-a54c-81c2fd2168e5","name":"Centrum Medyczne Kształcenia Podyplomowego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c5878c28a0473c3610","5e70941d878c28a0473b67fd"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Prevalence and associated psychological risk factors of postpartum depression: a cross-sectional study.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478924","mniswId":"12077","title":"Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology","doi":null,"issn":"0144-3615","eissn":"1364-6893","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"3aa5ed6f-f621-4e15-bbd3-f71ddbbf0c59"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2021-04-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61bef04f2467f07b6bd1f67f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61bef0502467f07b6bd1f7cc","61bef0502467f07b6bd1f7cd","61bef0502467f07b6bd1f7ce","61bef0502467f07b6bd1f7cf","61bef0502467f07b6bd1f7d0","61bef0502467f07b6bd1f7d1","61bef0502467f07b6bd1f7d2","61bef0502467f07b6bd1f7d3","61bef0502467f07b6bd1f7d4","61bef0502467f07b6bd1f7d5","5e7094c5878c28a0473c3610","5e70941d878c28a0473b67fd"]},"issue":"(5)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of postpartum depression and the associated risk factors in a sample of Italian women at three months after delivery.

Based on this, buyers could rapidly assess the material before purchase and malt-houses could optimize the technological process. This study examined the feasibility of Bishop’s formula (originally designed to identify calculated extract of malting barley) being applied to measure the calculated extract of wheat. For this purpose, ten winter cultivars of common hexaploid wheats, grown in 2019, were selected for the study. The variables applied included the cultivar and the plumpness of the wheat grains. The grains were sorted into size 2.5-2.8 mm and size > 2.8 mm for the study of nitrogen content and 1,000 grain weight (TGW). The wheat was malted and five-day laboratory malts were obtained. The Congress mashing protocol was carried out and the actual extract of the wheat malts was determined based on the extract produced in that specific process. The actual extract values were compared to the calculated extract according to Bishop (statistical analysis).

paper presents an analysis of the long-term (1982–2015) variability of aerosol optical properties, as well as aerosol and greenhouse gases (GHG) direct radiative forcing (RF) in central Europe on the basis of MERRA-2 reanalysis and ground-based observation. Calculations of longwave (LW) and shortwave (SW) RF were made with the use of the off-line Fu-Liou radiative transfer model and were preceded by the sensitivity study of the code's input parameters. Then, the long-term mean as well as the annual variability for selected regions of aerosol optical properties and radiative forcing were analysed. The mean AOD trend was −0.056 ± 9% per decade and AOD was reduced by 48% between 1982 and 2015. While for 1982–1990 the trend per decade was −0.12 ± 20%, for 1991–2000 it was −0.17 ± 17% and only −0.02 ± 31% in the last 15 years (2001–2015). The trend of the aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) was 1.52 ± 0.12 W·m−2/10 year and 1.21 ± 0.19 W·m−2/10 year at top of the atmosphere (TOA) and at Earth's surface, respectively. The trend for GHG was significantly smaller and it equalled 0.27 ± 0.01 W·m−2/10 year at TOA and 0.17 ± 0.01 W·m−2/10 year at the surface. Changes in GHG and aerosol direct effect produced additional 3.2 ± 0.2 W·m−2 at TOA, which could be associated with the observed regional climate warming. The change of the direct aerosol effect was about 4 times the GHG RF. The influence of aerosol loading reduction on the radiation budget was significantly higher in the 1990s of the 20th century in comparison to the first decades of the 21st. The effect of aerosol reduction has significant impact on air temperature changes during warm season and negligible during winter."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057416371","journalIssue":{"objectId":"605317b52467f04a40ff2a5f","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"c7948a07-e77e-4a5d-a4af-d672b55b4625"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"42","pagesFromTo":"4129-4146","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/joc.7488","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094b0878c28a0473c1bc7","name":"Olga","lastName":"Zawadzka-Mańko","uuid":"E2848FC70B8C0DA0158BDFABDB2480F194629C8E521B6330D41FF2972C4DA331D4BE9D5A2565DA12B2E91653463E1204155827F65424716F55E596C1626AC03F","orcidId":"0000-0001-8751-3914","documentHash":"08d0be16-03ee-4945-9b06-77676ca152dc"},{"objectId":"5e709405878c28a0473b5090","name":"Michał","lastName":"Posyniak","uuid":"D700397288A9F23BF1CEB0F7DFA26EE5C37EB65EC190D37F00D13DB27179C8527E626071243108936E04E838BB0FB1CEE31E14BD31C457B346682F52E9D3A484","orcidId":"0000-0003-2156-9434","documentHash":"811c4d9c-de94-4c4b-88d1-0dfc9ef468b2"},{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7bd0","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Markowicz","uuid":"AC239775D4B6CBB827F09663593D1256CFD20E3B246683DAC7990FF24302F8C989C5ECECCBF82C2CCEE9C312F5CAF3744230786ADB5C847184B2351833E1D528","orcidId":"0000-0003-4190-0243","documentHash":"0c6ea7a5-fec7-43f4-aca0-c49449c195c8"}],"doi":"10.1002/joc.7488"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"61b998ec2467f0239144714c","doi":null,"title":"Swoboda działalności gospodarczej.

In many cases, it has also led to more sustainable lifestyles and a more efficient use of natural resources. But despite the relevance of innovation as a tool to support sustainable development, there is a need for research that analyses current trends in order to guide future efforts. The present paper addresses this research need. It examines existing methods and tools for fostering social innovation in matters related to sustainable development, within the framework of the SDGs. By means of an online survey undertaken among sustainability and innovation experts in a sample of industrialised and developing nations, this study has identified some of the means via which social innovation is being pursued, along with its applications and limitations. A number of case studies showing examples of sustainable innovation have been mapped to demonstrate its usefulness. A causal loop diagram, which links the factors associated with social innovation within the context of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, is also presented, offering a greater understanding of their interconnections.

2014–2018, a study was conducted on the interspecific cross-compatibility between various fruit-tree genotypes of three species of the genus Prunus: the Japanese plum (P. salicina Lindl) – 6 genotypes, the myrobalan plum (P. cerasifera Ehrh.) – 1 genotype, and the apricot (P. armeniaca L.) – 8 genotypes, and 1 hybrid between the Japanese plum and the myrobalan plum. It was found that incompatibility between the crossed genotypes manifests itself at various stages of hybridization – from flower pollination and fruit setting to the growth of the hybrid seedlings obtained. In the interspecific hybridization Japanese plum × apricot, fruit setting is more dependent on the Japanese plum genotype as the maternal form than on the apricot genotype as the pollen donor. Post-zygotic crossability barriers have the effect that a large number of obtained fruit contain an underdeveloped seed. Seed germination capacity and viability of the obtained hybrid seedlings depend on the interaction of the crossed parental forms. The Japanese plums ‘Trumlar’ and D 17–73 are useful maternal forms for obtaining hybrid seedlings of Japanese plum × apricot as well as Japanese plum × myrobalan plum. The use of the myrobalan plum ‘Amelia’ as the maternal parent allows obtaining hybrid seedlings of myrobalan plum × apricot. The results showed that by using these genotypes in traditional distant hybridization it is possible to obtain more hybrids of Japanese plum × apricot, Japanese plum × myrobalan plum, and also myrobalan plum × apricot than by using the other genotypes tested in the study."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057444170","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61c040f52467f064509b8604","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"146","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"36120b77-8efa-44dd-b3f8-ca7822ee1762"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"146","pagesFromTo":"624-633","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61c040f52467f064509b85f4","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Studnicki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"83726fe0-069d-4d31-ac45-030c60e80d9a"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c1e","name":"Marek","lastName":"Szymajda","uuid":"9FDF7765FBA01A0940EFE3D842149684D9F84C7430CE9AD5FF8E82D2E71C8A02F41C6DC2E24B7F9B8DAFDBE52AF2F373BD4E7865783AA9D4757AB5522E062743","orcidId":"0000-0001-9734-7016","documentHash":"f46dc0b5-1c16-453c-94dd-7b8d1f4da775"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a04739871c","name":"Edward","lastName":"Żurawicz","uuid":"DAAB62032D2A6BED7871CD5B6C0A06CBE9A1520405A503F1705A3FB6D652E6FEC4D3AF1EDAF08D7B308D69FCDEB8B079BD79D881EBB5F7556B86959DD70CEAB6","orcidId":"0000-0001-6657-892X","documentHash":"18a0e1dc-b4af-442e-b859-7dcab8647f46"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397e96","name":"Anita","lastName":"Kuras","uuid":"80DA45629098C8E91C25095841315C03495C9DCF893055A8291C9132BD0B647BB2A256A4611B921DE32C7262DE06E84BE4DA69B90547F014E3832537C1FF039A","orcidId":"0000-0003-4724-788X","documentHash":"2ad3784f-b10c-4be2-8f13-62fd3d58636d"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.sajb.2021.11.036"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","uid":"bWyeXRlH0huS_TwqiYk7m5Q","uuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","parentUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","rootUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092c8878c28a04739c9af"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Kynurenic acid in neurodegenerative disorders -

However, environmental correlates of spatial patterns in collision risk are poorly understood, thus making mitigation measures difficult to implement. We took advantage of Covid-19 lockdown in the spring of 2020, when people were obligated to stay mainly at home, and performed a memory-recall questionnaire survey concerning bird-window collisions in Poland. We received information on bird-window collisions with 1800 buildings across the whole country accompanied by characteristics of each building, its vicinity and resident's behavior (time spent home, window cleaning). We supplemented these data with landscape description and performed statistical models to estimate importance of 13 explanatory variables as predictors of number of bird-window collisions. Reported number of collisions increased with the share of forests and arable land within 2 km of the building, and with proximity to rivers. Number of collisions also increased when single trees were close to buildings. More collisions were reported for houses than for flats and for new buildings than for old ones. Reported number of collisions increased with window cleaning which might suggest that cleaning reduces glass visibility for birds. As bird-window collision risk is highly variable among buildings but can be reduced with several measures improving glass visibility for birds, we recommend to use predictive models to identify collision hotspots for applying these measures. New houses located near rivers, in forests or agricultural landscapes have highest collision risk, and trees near buildings, often planted to benefit birds, can additionally elevate collision rate, thus potentially creating ecological traps. In such collision hotspots, reduction of window cleaning frequency can be considered as a mitigation measure unless the visual markers improving glass visibility for birds are installed on the panels."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057449235","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61125a5e2467f00b3651a72e","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"a8b25af7-3e46-4e5d-9808-b2265efa0187"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"811","pagesFromTo":"152358","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152358","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61c17fde2467f03fff2a7376","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Zyśk-Gorczyńska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d38eca91-6740-4d18-bfad-0e71d84a212f"},{"objectId":"5e7094dd878c28a0473c595f","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Kotowska","uuid":"1F487AC43F85D796EAE365D7315E83C8104587E491E959BB4AA5EEC3D0C670DF2C14A91157249558E884757EB7A14EAC53600F4AB9B1829186C5993B0640A0BC","orcidId":"0000-0002-0358-3665","documentHash":"1701588c-f647-44d9-9487-6191686912dd"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b590f","name":"Michał","lastName":"Żmihorski ","uuid":"B0A9039BD3417C5E06BAB2E9BBA69B0511421073A612E514373667101BE10CB67AB15AB8DBEEEA4A8DB8511FFFF44AFC723292759194A650949ECE574985369B","orcidId":"0000-0001-5137-1635","documentHash":"54e9f336-c9d1-4b30-a8e0-83c485644a69"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.152358"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Internet","nonusers","COVID-19","policy implementation","Poland","e-government","allowance"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","uid":"b_ZPtKgtv4v90uInHkYp6dg","uuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","parentUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","rootUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Kochanowskiego w Kielcach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709297878c28a047398a16"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The right to stay offline?

is a sediment occurring on glacier surfaces worldwide which reduces ice albedo and concentrates glacier surface meltwater into small reservoirs called cryoconite holes. It consists of mineral and biogenic matter, including active microorganisms. This study presents an experimental insight into the influence of sediment oxygenation on the cryoconite ability to produce and decomposition of organic matter. Samples were collected from five glaciers in the Arctic and the European mainland. Cryoconite from three glaciers was incubated in stagnant and mechanically mixed conditions to imitate inter-hole water–sediment mixing by meltwater occurring on glaciers in Northern Hemisphere, and its effect on oxygen profiles and organic matter content. Moreover, we investigated short-term changes of oxygen conditions in cryoconite from four glaciers in illuminated and dark conditions. An anaerobic zone was present or approaching zero oxygen in all illuminated cryoconite samples, varying in depth depending on the origin of cryoconite: from 1500 µm from Steindalsbreen (Scandinavian Peninsula) and Forni Glacier (The Alps) to 3100 µm from Russell Glacier and Longyearbreen (Arctic) after incubation. Organic matter content varied between glaciers from 6.11% on Longyearbreen to 16.36% on Russell Glacier. The mixed sediment from the Forni Glacier had less organic matter than stagnant, the sediment from Longyearbreen followed this trend, but the difference was not statistically significant, while the sediment from Ebenferner did not differ between groups. Our results have implications for the understanding of biogeochemical processes on glacier surfaces, the adaptation of organisms to changing physical conditions due to abrupt sediment mixing, but also on the estimation of productivity of supraglacial systems."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057462474","journalIssue":{"objectId":"663a062b4097077c1aa859b4","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"25","doi":"","documentHash":"ba42b5b1-4a66-49be-99ca-bcbaae55ec71"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"25","pagesFromTo":"1510-1521","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10021-021-00729-2.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"662a26c0409707626339c829","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Zawierucha","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"49f5e230-afe7-4876-b64b-665283af6dd4"},{"objectId":"662a26c0409707626339c827","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Klimaszyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fd6739d5-45e3-4ecb-8336-b1a31930cf93"},{"objectId":"662a26c0409707626339c826","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Franzetti","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bc235d09-0185-49c1-8744-b137af7e7250"},{"objectId":"662a26c0409707626339c825","name":"Elizabeth

isothiocyanate (AITC), a constituent of Brassica family plants, has been reported to possess a high bioactivity in animal and human cells, showing ambiguous properties from adverse to beneficial ones. It was reported its genotoxic, carcinogenic, goitrogenic effects. On the other side, AITC has shown anti-cancer, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, and lately anti-obesity abilities. So far, its anti-diabetic effects are poorly explored. We tried to assess AITC action on carbohydrate, lipid and hormonal disorders in high fat diet-fed/streptozotocin diabetic rats. In this report, diabetic rats were treated intragastrically at doses 2.5, 5 and 25 mg/kg b.w./day of AITC for 2 weeks. Irrespectively of doses, AITC considerably lowered thyroid hormones (fT4, fT3), increased liver TG content, and also caused robust LDL-cholesterol and direct bilirubin concentration enhancement. Moreover, AITC at the highest dose caused pancreatic amylase and lipase drops and thyroid gland hypertrophy. AITC at 2.5 and 5 mg significantly reduced blood glucose levels along with robust beta-hydroxybutyric acid drop. Additionally, AITC at 5 mg improved insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR index) in spite of reduced blood insulin. To conclude, despite amelioration of diabetic hyperglycemia by AITC, the adverse lipids and hormonal effects may exclude its use as a health-promoting compound in terms of anti-diabetic properties."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057476267","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"3","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6651/14/1/3/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709494878c28a0473bfd6d","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Hertig","uuid":"71CBD8BFDACA31C92FC7DF2CF0CC50EC02EEFCAD9A8584526C5B3B52734EB6EC91625A71644F38B2A111DF08B546D17BE765963E6E9AB5F55718B452DBC83418","orcidId":"0000-0002-3455-615X","documentHash":"1a7389c3-987d-4559-af8d-4e22c3333035"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a649a","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Szkudelski","uuid":"5C4D0D6618D4A7FE1851BBFBEC52959606B93CE85666A67ACA13EA97D77D66234499EC3EE981E31A4A34F837C2D277D764366DFFC77ADD453B473E1896B56F94","orcidId":"0000-0002-9067-6682","documentHash":"7be18921-49a0-4753-9f2c-4efe73b52d08"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a63e7","name":"Monika","lastName":"Okulicz","uuid":"11546368AB571B51E69EB689D5B8C724926CCA3D24A7DFB0C62E9F31940A45CAC69D5F1C3C53A5AA06E49DA19BB511D6FE7F0BF4E23CA9AE3E4FC0CD009BA787","orcidId":"0000-0002-5155-0358","documentHash":"138d9432-82d6-4f88-8305-e544d2a99545"}],"doi":"10.3390/toxins14010003"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Chiral solvating agents","selenoacid","selenophosphinic acids","X-ray analysis","conformation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","uid":"bRRT1dnyPJtioT7xTLQBnOQ","uuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","parentUuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de93","rootUuid":"3c52c513-9f5d-4587-8e9f-57092b021e3b","name":"Centrum Badań Molekularnych i Makromolekularnych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709474878c28a0473bd5bc","5e7094a1878c28a0473c0b2c","5e70923e878c28a047392542","5e70934c878c28a0473a6aa2","5e70934a878c28a0473a68ee"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","uid":"bHvub0W7DW61k4FKLYJQ3Zw","uuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","parentUuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","rootUuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Długosza w Częstochowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70923e878c28a047392542"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The progress in crystal structure determination of organometallic complexes and their organic synthons containing selenium and stereogenic phosphorus as heteroatoms","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547923f","mniswId":"16038","title":"Phosphorus, Sulfur and Silicon and the Related Elements","doi":null,"issn":"1042-6507","eissn":"1563-5325","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"22a32815-9cf4-481b-a459-1e88b9d53936"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61c2eefa2467f05753224b7d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61c2eefa2467f05753224b83","5e7094a1878c28a0473c0b2c","5e70934a878c28a0473a68ee","5e70934c878c28a0473a6aa2","5e709474878c28a0473bd5bc","5e70923e878c28a047392542"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The characterization of phosphines has attracted much attention in recent years because they are extensively used in asymmetric and stereoselective synthesis. In contrast to this, the P-stereogenic phosphinic acid derivatives which contain selenium, have been much less studied although they can be considered as useful stoichiometric and catalytic auxiliaries. For example, the enantiomeric tert-butylphenylphosphinoselenoic acids could be used as chiral solvating agents for the NMR determination of the enantiomeric excesses of a few optically active organic compounds with stereogenic carbon or heteroatoms. The progress on the X-ray structure determination of our synthesized selenophosphinic acids 1 is hereby presented. This should provide the three-dimensional architecture and verify proposed models of intramolecular interactions in supramolecular complexes with heteroorganic ligands. The acquired knowledge about supramolecular complex architecture and mechanism of action, will also be advantageous to synthetic chemists, to broaden the applicability of supramolecular compounds in stereocontrolled synthesis, for purpose to eliminate an expensive, time-consuming and non-stereoselective multi-step reaction protocols from use."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057476493","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c944e24097074220cca175","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"197","number":"5-6","doi":null,"documentHash":"ac86f60f-1164-4c85-a027-1959f4a3b7b5"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"542-544","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10426507.2021.2008924","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61c2eefa2467f05753224b83","name":"Lesław","lastName":"Sieroń","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4e0e4857-c8d7-47ec-a4d9-288d5f1f454f"},{"objectId":"5e7094a1878c28a0473c0b2c","name":"Bogdan","lastName":"Bujnicki","uuid":"83DF7B1CF2E9272C94AC34A7ECB343C4235A5F690F621220532846B53CF5171DD4AAF6DB21983ACDB9205B525C9FD7182C0BC04B3406E20233B4826F373406EE","orcidId":"0000-0002-9561-5459","documentHash":"04f8a1ba-bfbb-464e-b3c5-7a424259eccd"},{"objectId":"5e709474878c28a0473bd5bc","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Pokora-Sobczak","uuid":"D58F3276C08B0A68E30902EE938EEE3FA58E221983864B3C82B4A65181CB667CF658A9F020FFF457062E2805D1A5DF1B5F21849773CC13AE1CD1D204F7B4D1FA","orcidId":"0000-0002-8118-8492","documentHash":"27c05969-5f65-4d16-a46b-f900431c353a"},{"objectId":"5e70934c878c28a0473a6aa2","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Błaszczyk","uuid":"EE6738595A2CA271F6DA6590768227A4A0211F2FE9173D1BC0DDBF730288E46454C818C7D617F704E1CC4478D6F9267CD419F1D88219DB685C3812D07C421A94","orcidId":"0000-0003-2985-6569","documentHash":"52fcbec7-2727-4d8f-a4eb-0bfad6dcf2ea"},{"objectId":"5e70934a878c28a0473a68ee","name":"Grażyna","lastName":"Mielniczak","uuid":"26AD1EEE3BE3636532596C6247153876075E23805DC90EF3264CB2BBCDE9446688460A1328ED354AB7C19458DEF4E70CEA609AA1592C544AE68A9230CF94DF79","orcidId":"0000-0002-0408-9722","documentHash":"38f7465e-09af-480d-8de7-8112803fa7e5"},{"objectId":"5e70923e878c28a047392542","name":"Józef","lastName":"Drabowicz","uuid":"3B191E3156A924D8707B2408E2D2805B853CECA8D4A783D6206E37E81D11474766A992B5790F663190A7E483F441EBDE40AEBEA2F9B4093D5908A0E49CD8F367","orcidId":"0000-0002-4899-5970","documentHash":"a2d2ac10-9ca0-48dd-bd3f-2afbae80ec01"}],"doi":"10.1080/10426507.2021.2008924"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["stratygrafia

IoT communication node spacing selection process show may potential areas for improvements such as high delay ratio,\r\nhigh total energy consumption ratio, confusion of the optimal communication information band, intelligent spacing node design\r\nunder the constraints of the energy-saving selection of IoT communication. Based on energy-saving constraints, the link status\r\nbetween nodes is evaluated through link stability and link quality. In order to prevent the generation of serious noisy nodes and\r\nfrequency hopping data, the interference nodes under the intrusion of the Internet of Things are identified by determining\r\ntransition amplitude of the noise nodes in the transmission data sequence. Finally, according to the calculation results of the\r\noptimal communication node selection, the design of the intelligent spacing selection model for the communication nodes of the\r\nInternet of Things is realized. The simulation results show that the established model not only reduces energy consumption of\r\nnodes, shortens the average transmission delay of nodes, but also improves anti-interference effect of node spacing selection."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057481449","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"628-636","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11036-021-01828-z.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65b3c66540970719779b56a5","name":"T.","lastName":"Zhu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"18d4d16d-e86c-4ce7-8dc4-c3ea9d3b9748"},{"objectId":"65b3c66540970719779b56a4","name":"J.-S.","lastName":"Sun","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"206d0202-21d2-45a8-95d7-c3d7ddb5ca34"},{"objectId":"5e7093ab878c28a0473aec68","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Woźniak","uuid":"25494025D5B87B2F701C30F204B344F174BAA3949C55FA0127081CE68E603533B4A478A7EFAC36B639AB81C7A6B56E4D509232FE39EA575DEFDD9205A0310CAE","orcidId":"0000-0002-9073-5347","documentHash":"d9da6b8f-6eab-498e-8646-321f648eae04"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11036-021-01828-z"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"9783631869970","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet Warszawski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70925f878c28a04739492d"]}],"type":"BOOK","title":"Theory of provocation.

Three independent types of molecular descriptors, based on geometry (the HOMA index), electrical properties (trace of the polarizability tensor), and energetic (the HOMO-LUMO energy gap) were shown to be mutually correlated and provided concordant indication that communication through the cumulene chain was considerably better than through the polyyne one.

Despite the fact that they were also abundant in the geological past, their fossil record is uneven. For example, little is known about sponge communities that inhabited the Tethyan areas during the Cenozoic. Here, we record an abundant and taxonomically diverse assemblage of middle–late Eocene sponges from east-central Ukraine. The material consists of preserved whole-body specimens as well as disassociated spicules. The taxonomic composition of this new assemblage, supplemented with previously published data obtained from sponge materials originating from the middle and upper Eocene of the East European Platform, documents a surprisingly rich sponge community that inhabited shallow waters (depths of 100 m) and comprised at least 30 demosponge species, including two new taxa, Paratetilla milanek Łukowiak and Theonella alexandriae Łukowiak, three hexactinellids and a single homoscleromorph. Additionally, we report the first fossil occurrence of Vetulina, a demosponge genus that currently is found near the Philippines and Australia and in the Caribbean Sea. Some of the sponge taxa recognized were previously noted from the upper Eocene of Australia and New Zealand. This is indicative of their wide distribution during the early Cenozoic and also shows that a non-interrupted connection existed between the western Tethyan and peri-Australian areas, explaining the patchy distribution of some sponge taxa in modern seas."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057489324","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-29","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/spp2.1416","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61c164862467f03fff27a43d","name":"Vadym","lastName":"Stefanskyi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a262d70b-06d6-47af-9993-6909371c81e9"},{"objectId":"61c164862467f03fff27a43c","name":"Tetiana","lastName":"Stefanska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"56ca2318-b477-470e-bc6d-a589326121f6"},{"objectId":"5e709409878c28a0473b5362","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Łukowiak","uuid":"BC60FE80A9EFD924D3CE00D7E33C56A5AC82CCD8339E634BC7B9142670FB09454FCE24EE039FF4BAA38C9048DE82EEF521101A11529BEACA0D6CCD951F0307F6","orcidId":"0000-0002-5282-5341","documentHash":"44600a2e-b8a9-422e-82df-b6c692e76343"},{"objectId":"5e7093e6878c28a0473b2fa4","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pisera","uuid":"3A8D977A31B6F72A8A426B60F01B0A179DDE0D1BC0FE5846F167423CDC2DB01A246366ED5EBF74809B9E2F03D1E63AB495CD02A584D92A85E052C923EA7E67C0","orcidId":"0000-0001-7112-6063","documentHash":"d5e39fd3-d269-4aaa-9924-bcc43aa8a2f5"}],"doi":"10.1002/spp2.1416"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Ciliates","Predatory copepods","Feeding guilds","Cyanobacterial blooms","Shallow freshwaters"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","uid":"bqvFVl6-FYxc-KjUUrbTwDw","uuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","parentUuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","rootUuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","name":"Instytut Ochrony Przyrody Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709297878c28a0473989dc","5e70932d878c28a0473a471f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Insight into the role of cyanobacterial bloom in the trophic link between ciliates and predatory copepods","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477f7e","mniswId":"7812","title":"HYDROBIOLOGIA","doi":null,"issn":"0018-8158","eissn":"1573-5117","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"457d513e-e879-48f1-aa13-e04accb1b242"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"OTHER","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-15","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61c187932467f03fff2c4b81","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709297878c28a0473989dc","5e70932d878c28a0473a471f"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"An important group of protozooplankton, the ciliates, are a crucial component of aquatic food webs. They are the main grazers on bacteria and algae transferring carbon to higher levels of the food web (metazooplankton and fish fry). Changes in the quality and quantity of protozooplankton can modify the quality and quantity of metazooplankton, especially predatory copepods, causing changes in energy transfer and the matter cycle. Observable climate change is one of the most significant factors promoting the increase of cyanobacterial blooms. Therefore, the aim of this study was to find out how cyanobacterial blooms modify relationships between ciliates (prey) and copepods (predator), and to discover possible pathways of changes in freshwater food webs. We analysed the relationship between the biomass of predatory copepods and feeding guilds of ciliates (algivorous, bacterivorous, bacteri-algivorous). The relationship of predators biomass with algivorous and bacteri-algivorous ciliate biomasses, with a simultaneous lack of relationship with bacterivorous ciliate biomass, demonstrates that bacterial fixed carbon may be only partially contributing to the total energy passed through this link. Results demonstrated that the bloom enhanced the relationship between prey and predator. Larger and free-swimming ciliate species appear to play a greater role in energy transfer than smaller sedentary species."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057492174","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"849","pagesFromTo":"1195–1206","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10750-021-04780-x.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70932d878c28a0473a471f","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Krztoń","uuid":"AF171B3924DEEEC08F66B6B9506B6FC24CA70E0FF3F81CFBB6D3C60CF44DF110FA5F921E2CE64C11740D2ED0CC2672375A3FDDB876C9961777F67A28258BF887","orcidId":"0000-0003-2224-2599","documentHash":"10cfea6b-f781-490a-87c9-506a7edb9bdc"},{"objectId":"5e709297878c28a0473989dc","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kosiba","uuid":"0C770770E6FE3C78225408670FC8353102567A26BDC7B0DC454C5D56D5FFE52E85020807962DE32A9B24A659D6C7BE8F9F81F9FF7BB0375BB5E79D7416AE7AE8","orcidId":"0000-0002-9238-1159","documentHash":"dc6571b2-e500-49ca-ab4f-1904c8dff28b"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10750-021-04780-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["asthma","matrix

aim of this paper was to analyze the thermal properties of gamma-cyclodextrins with different degrees of nitration and to determine the kinetic parameters of their decomposition reactions. The differential scanning calorimetry was used to investigate six nitro derivatives of gamma-cyclodextrins obtained and characterized by various degrees of nitration. The tested samples differed in the number of esterified OH groups in gamma-cyclodextrins from 6.4 to 24.0 and nitrogen content from 6.3 to 14.1 %. It was concluded that the value of the heat of combustion increases with the nitrogen content and achieves the highest value (4.0 kJ/g) for nitrogen content 14.1 %. The thermal effect of decomposition was found to increase significantly and proportionally to the increased heating rate of the sample. The largest temperature shift of the decomposition process with changed heat flow rate was observed for the samples with the highest nitrogen content (13.7 % and 14.1 %). No influence of nitrogen content on the value of apparent activation energy for the obtained gamma-nitrocyclodextrins was observed, which may indicate that the initial stage of decomposition is independent from the nitrogen content. The determined kinetic parameters of the decomposition reaction make it possible to estimate the safe conditions for the synthesis, use and storage of gamma-nitrocyclodextrins and to determine parameters such as Self-Accelerating Decomposition Temperature (SADT), Adiabatic Decomposition Temperature (ADT24)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057497470","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"47","pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/prep.202100241","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65c9f48c40970762634a4229","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Janson","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8ea00500-1585-4416-ac39-0bdfd2a38886"},{"objectId":"5e709327878c28a0473a3c3f","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Gołofit","uuid":"631FAAE8E79E501C13FCA2BBF8E9B14BFC6C257006F1C71A158A2A64D18B802012E9FE2476285B6E1E3509FE1F243B79FC40F41FD4818AACC572096DFCE6DA2B","orcidId":"0000-0001-7594-1145","documentHash":"56991286-e21f-408f-a975-cff32c221e98"},{"objectId":"5e709327878c28a0473a3c1f","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Maksimowski","uuid":"049E9E7E82464C4A7EF704BBAEE5D3F768DF75D14DE63EB39274729DBF653550CE42B6DBF67C16E3B31B0AF085C047BF2F5E4358E54FB734867DC16353AAABC5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0945-7149","documentHash":"77499b6c-1d96-4120-be3e-2d07c84b9fbc"}],"doi":"10.1002/prep.202100241"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Edible mushrooms","Extraction","Neuroprotective effect","Functional food"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"619eeea57523402fabdec1a7","uid":"bcD6ws1rBvMgqVrdBUveYFQ","uuid":"db928bb7-b202-4ae0-bb7c-d44c14aa8031","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Katedra Biotechnologii, Mikrobiologii i Żywienia Człowieka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709225878c28a047390a14"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6452","5e709346878c28a0473a62fc","602f765c9543c7410626f4ec","5e709347878c28a0473a6417","60c2fe8b9543c72336543860"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Dual functional cholinesterase inhibitors and complexing of aluminum ions of five species of fungi family depended of drying conditions and extraction process - In vitro study","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d21","mniswId":"13782","title":"LWT - Food Science and Technology","doi":null,"issn":"0023-6438","eissn":"1096-1127","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"2b15abc5-a709-45ca-b3d4-a75f134aed8e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2021-10-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61bdac3e2467f07b6ba28504","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709225878c28a047390a14","60c2fe8b9543c72336543860","5e709346878c28a0473a62fc","602f765c9543c7410626f4ec","5e709347878c28a0473a6452","5e709347878c28a0473a6417"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The nutritional value of mushrooms is not great but, from the dietary point of view, fungi can bring in many beneficial nutrients such as selenium and some vitamins.

It was shown that the tested samples exhibited inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. The extracts also had the ability to complex aluminum ions, with the porcini and oyster mushroom extracts characterized by the highest ability among the samples tested.

Despite the extensive debate on the impact of bank competition on risk-taking and procyclicality, there is no evidence of its role in the effects of macroprudential policy on loan growth and on the sensitivity of lending to the business cycle. Using over 80,000 bank-level observations in 95 countries from 2004 to 2015, we find that increased competition strengthens the countercyclical effects of macroprudential policy instruments (MPIs) in terms of reduced loan growth. Bank lending is procyclical in a perfectly competitive industry. However, any decrease in the intensity of competition in countries not applying MPIs is related to the increased procyclicality of lending. The sensitivity of lending to the business cycle in countries implementing macroprudential policy depends on the type of MPI and the length of use of the instruments. We demonstrate that an extended duration of use of cyclical instruments is associated with increased procyclicality in lending. In a perfectly competitive environment, we find increased procyclicality of credit in countries using cyclical instruments for longer periods, and decreased procyclicality of credit in countries applying balance-sheet-oriented instruments. Under the imperfectly competitive banking sector, we find the opposite effects of macroprudential instruments on the procyclicality of

The hypothesis that air-classified faba bean protein fraction (FBP) can replace soybean meal (SBM) in pelleted or extruded broiler diets without adverse effect on performance or nutrient digestibility was tested.\n2. At 17 d of age, male broilers were randomly distributed among four dietary treatments consisting of either SBM or FBP (main dietary protein source) and pelleting or extrusion as processing methods. Treatments had 10 replicate pens containing five birds each.\n3. Compared to SBM, birds fed FBP had significantly lower feed intake, less weight gain and had poorer feed conversion.\n4. Pellet durability was high (above 92%) for all diets. In pelleted diets, FBP was harder than SBM whereas extruded diets had similar hardness. Pelleting increased water stability compared to extrusion. FBP diets were more water stable than the SBM diets.\n5. Gizzard content weight was 2.2-fold higher (P = 0.002) for birds given FBP compared to those fed SBM. The weight of the jejunum and ileum with contents was 1.4-fold lower for the FBP diets, and this effect was larger (P < 0.05) for the extruded FBP diet.\n6. Birds fed FBP diets had significantly higher nitrogen digestibility in the lower jejunum and ileum compared to those given SBM diets, while the starch digestibility coefficient was above 0.980 in all treatments.\n7. The high nutrient digestibility of FBP diets indicates that the poor performance of the FBP group was due to lower feed intake which was not explained by the differences in pellet durability or hardness. The reduced palatability of the FBP and the longer retention of the FBP diets in the upper gut are more likely to have depressed feed intake."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057509434","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63aefe28409707743b337a6e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"63","doi":"","documentHash":"23b88280-a79f-4535-9adf-6951192758c8"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00071668.2021.1960949","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61c46c562467f05d3804373e","name":"M.","lastName":"Øverland","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d2c4a1b6-4af0-4228-93fd-001e9358ae45"},{"objectId":"61c46c562467f05d3804373d","name":"B.","lastName":"Svihus","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"beb63868-7eac-4bd5-b699-1772ba78c0d2"},{"objectId":"61c46c562467f05d3804373c","name":"L.

Its efficacy and safety were assessed in clinical trials; however, the real-world evidence is still scarce.\n\nObjective\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of 1-year treatment with pasireotide-LAR on disease control and glucose metabolism in acromegaly patients resistant to first-generation SRLs.\n\nDesign\nA single-center prospective study.\n\nMethods\nTwenty-eight patients with active acromegaly or acrogigantism on first-generation SRLs following ineffective pituitary surgery were switched to treatment with pasireotide-LAR 40 or 60 mg i.m. every 28 days. To assess the efficacy of the treatment GH and IGF-1 levels were measured every 3 months. Safety of treatment was carefully evaluated, especially its impact on glucose metabolism.\n\nResults\nComplete biochemical control (GH ≤ 1 ng/mL and IGF-1 ≤ 1 × ULN) was achieved in 26.9% of patients and partial + complete response (GH ≤ 2.5 ng/mL and IGF-1 ≤ 1.3 × ULN) in 50.0% of patients. Mean GH level decrease was the largest within first 6 months (P = 0.0001) and mean IGF-1 level decreased rapidly within the first 3 months (P < 0.0001) and they remained reduced during the study. Blood glucose and HbA1c levels increased significantly within 3 months (P = 0.0001) and stayed on stable level thereafter. Otherwise, the treatment was well tolerated and clinical improvement was noticed in majority of patients.\n\nConclusions\nThis real-life study confirmed good effectiveness of pasireotide-LAR in patients resistant to first-generation SRLs. Pasireotide-LAR was overall safe and well tolerated, however significant glucose metabolism worsening was noted."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057527065","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63f61563409707158a8a943d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"25","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"99988e4d-9565-4e90-bce9-a790fc234cb3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"25","pagesFromTo":"180-190","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11102-021-01185-w.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61c5495f2467f0370fbf9801","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Tomasik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e47376ab-f73b-463f-aedc-2d351d7af7c1"},{"objectId":"5e709408878c28a0473b5262","name":"Maria","lastName":"Stelmachowska-Banaś","uuid":"6B96055E2CD8B3AFC8341EA33A92D69BBE38E7F0EDECF83BCF766E0E09F36BB90186EFAFE1241A9AA2F6E44F4ACC7239D0F773DB90302A0CC26998E82621E7CE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2961-3316","documentHash":"7e6fc1a6-2bb6-4f83-8417-0b51223a8dc2"},{"objectId":"5e7093d5878c28a0473b194b","name":"Izabella","lastName":"Czajka-Oraniec","uuid":"0D0827DFB5C6D264E592889F23F77AF8DBF411BB14625E42028D3C7703A3F3B76D08A128BAF67CAF2B48CA15A3AA0A0B5B1BC8BB6397C06881D05EB2E1A353ED","orcidId":"0000-0003-0099-1361","documentHash":"f0028316-8ed6-4d36-953f-6027ad2c0209"},{"objectId":"5e7093d5878c28a0473b1943","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Zgliczyński","uuid":"323787E7D1E426F90114E9789B59BA97DA2B0A3FE39F74FA1D463CCA7DAF68CBD8D4033D9A9F2A852A2A0DF9E3F111306E78E5766AF2C1BB89B5094308D7FC23","orcidId":"0000-0002-7283-4755","documentHash":"5ae08826-38cc-4504-955f-4b9a7af1314c"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11102-021-01185-w"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4b","uid":"bbnwounKOU-G0A35qUoTjRg","uuid":"f3b17ba6-8d96-4eee-a245-737a6775d82d","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4b","parentUuid":"f3b17ba6-8d96-4eee-a245-737a6775d82d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4b","rootUuid":"f3b17ba6-8d96-4eee-a245-737a6775d82d","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Supplementation led to a mean estimated increase in blood bicarbonate of + 5.2 mmol L−1 (95% credible interval (CrI) 4.7–5.7). The meta-analysis models identified a positive overall effect of supplementation on exercise capacity and performance compared to placebo [ES0.5 = 0.17 (95% CrI 0.12–0.21)] with potential moderating effects of exercise type and duration, training status and when the exercise test was performed following prior exercise. The greatest ergogenic effects were shown for exercise durations of 0.5–10 min [ES0.5 = 0.18 (0.13–0.24)] and > 10 min [ES0.5 = 0.22 (0.10–0.33)]. Evidence of greater effects on exercise were obtained when blood bicarbonate increases were medium (4–6 mmol L−1) and large (> 6 mmol L−1) compared with small (≤ 4 mmol L−1) [βSmall:Medium = 0.16 (95% CrI 0.02–0.32), βSmall:Large = 0.13 (95% CrI − 0.03 to 0.29)]. SB (192 outcomes) was more effective for performance compared to SC (39 outcomes) [βSC:SB = 0.10 (95% CrI − 0.02 to 0.22)].\nConclusions\nExtracellular buffering supplements generate large increases in blood bicarbonate concentration leading to positive overall effects on exercise, with sodium bicarbonate being most effective. Evidence for several group-level moderating factors were identified. These data can guide an athlete’s decision as to whether supplementation with buffering agents might be beneficial for their specific aims."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057527498","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"52","pagesFromTo":"505–526","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61c30c2e2467f0370f67cc72","name":"Bryan","lastName":"Saunders","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"073d0078-3a51-4424-8554-9820cb170d6b"},{"objectId":"61c30c2e2467f0370f67cc71","name":"Lars R.","lastName":"McNaughton","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"42ca20e0-3049-42c2-ae3b-96122bdb2867"},{"objectId":"61c30c2e2467f0370f67cc70","name":"Guilherme G.","lastName":"Artioli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4e37d1cb-6168-417f-b42c-aa20f821bfaf"},{"objectId":"61c30c2e2467f0370f67cc6f","name":"Paul A.","lastName":"Swinton","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3b2afc85-7ea2-42a5-859d-052f3a32a36b"},{"objectId":"61c30c2e2467f0370f67cc6e","name":"Eimear","lastName":"Dolan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1a0245ef-2893-4de9-b410-1eec08503c2f"},{"objectId":"61c30c2e2467f0370f67cc6d","name":"Luana","lastName":"Farias de Oliveira","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2533979b-d1bf-4cc7-a422-48f1a5b02bc0"},{"objectId":"5e7093d0878c28a0473b12b2","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Durkalec-Michalski","uuid":"56B258E7AF2AC7CE37728CBE99CAEFC0F402B8359A1341625D2F2C707CA0D519C9867195A279983E2C2377131D0E49642C97BB62F59A91BF188D4C5EBF020985","orcidId":"0000-0002-5041-2981","documentHash":"5924c969-6a88-4807-864e-d58915022a76"}],"doi":"10.1007/s40279-021-01575-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["crystal structure","hydrazone-aromatic interaction","N-acylhydrazone","solid-state","vibrational circular dichroism"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","parentUuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","rootUuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

In the crystal structure, dimers of anion-cation pairs stabilized by H-bonding and ionic interactions. Some less common interaction types, like C=N···C-NH3+ (σ-hole) interactions, hydrazone–aromatic interactions and dispersive contacts of the CF3 groups are also present in the crystal. Satisfactory reproduction of the solid state IR and VCD spectra required that quantum-chemical calculations be done on a tetramer (four cation-anion pairs) cut out from the crystal structure, exhibiting key intermolecular interactions. Ten DFT functionals were assessed as to the agreement between the calculated and experimental spectra. Various approaches to scaling of the calculated frequencies were applied. The best results were yielded with individual (optimized) frequency scaling factors (FSFs) and band half-widths at half maximum-(HWHM) for four separate spectral subregions. The best matching between the experimental and theoretical spectra (according to SimIR, SimVCD and SimVDF indices) was found for the B3PW91 functional, however, a few other functionals follow closely in the ranking. Based on the quantum chemical calculations, spectral assignments have been made."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057529587","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61dbc8c02467f07650a3016c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"269","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"65066838-8023-4685-b436-4e3cc0f32432"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"269","pagesFromTo":"120761","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S138614252101338X","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61c310e62467f057532f577f","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kosińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a38b3a20-99b3-429a-ac12-3487f4e20162"},{"objectId":"5e70948e878c28a0473bf850","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Dyniewicz","uuid":"A8A30EEE9F9F99BD05350EF470D9E90A335FF9501FE71EFA4B4E25BD5F636C38225D94202DBD62C77AD260DD197CC039B28BCD859C935884CAD2D70087818797","orcidId":"0000-0002-1932-4019","documentHash":"5210ef19-91a1-4a60-80bd-8b064ada8a0b"},{"objectId":"5e70948d878c28a0473bf725","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Matalińska","uuid":"717482983C323DEA1B4D420E26E24DAB8D7DA178D5477076F88A05D46E9C28F186DD3A4AE5F708727DFEE62B9359A755196C6EB1DF07DECC72D3A6451666D347","orcidId":"0000-0003-0837-7171","documentHash":"26b04b24-507b-4320-ba69-b58e5bfacfd3"},{"objectId":"5e709450878c28a0473ba4a1","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Łyczko","uuid":"03F3079A1043D951BBDDFE4BB64C9452AF361DDE7FD24BDB567F09591E0E27933712F0AD2C001B0D390647BEF87C6971262E80648443C7C669560973B4DCA655","orcidId":"0000-0003-4859-674X","documentHash":"bd2fa01e-ba6c-41e9-a7f2-32eb58b6f8d0"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473a9ef0","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Lipiński","uuid":"0A26A266AEABE99E92125BAA150EBFAFF3F0896A216497E92AE72AA0451BF78638F6BCB1D0182E2B43B019D1506A66744765BD7DAF0D8F6604A6ABD482529D35","orcidId":"0000-0002-8364-7955","documentHash":"33ec05f8-1c58-4bc5-a512-524ad609a751"},{"objectId":"5e70927d878c28a0473968fb","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Misicka-Kęsik","uuid":"8B9BE6568A6744020B06584A1C96947F2302A482C949F1A539EE99311B1FF2C3145E1002A6A1912B7C0EA344994CFE69DDFA4524C7311FB5335C0E0A0EF3A1F5","orcidId":"0000-0001-7446-2396","documentHash":"a39cc187-ef56-4d47-a996-f8503cff711a"},{"objectId":"5e709245878c28a047392d15","name":"Jan","lastName":"Dobrowolski","uuid":"AF91473F3AAB1D76EFC801EC00AC0F6CDFB6797F6F7E279FEBFCA760BA3E8DE8C557BD168CBE0F685EEFD826B21FE2136C3D21483924C7523A4E52642CEC1F7B","orcidId":"0000-0002-7301-1590","documentHash":"55c40db1-fbb2-444d-8dff-5c3d024267b5"},{"objectId":"5e709244878c28a047392bf4","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Rode","uuid":"7FC9C0018578F26B599F80DF34F96BAE67649A7E3B88AF48C2C387D27C3A8C3C16F3E863FECCE2812A85BF8716D43B2D443A129D6778267A4B5FE5ED3F3B26A6","orcidId":"0000-0003-0592-4053","documentHash":"68aff481-67f8-47aa-bca6-e92f11a7025d"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.saa.2021.120761"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet

Herein, we evaluated the 41-gene classifier trastuzumab advantage risk model (TRAR) as a predictive marker for patients enrolled in the NeoSphere trial. TRAR scores were computed from RNA of 350 pre- and 166 post-treatment tumor specimens. Overall, TRAR score was significantly associated with pathological complete response (pCR) rate independently of other predictive clinico-pathological variables. Separate analyses according to estrogen receptor (ER) status showed a significant association between TRAR score and pCR in ER-positive specimens but not in ER-negative counterparts. Among ER-positive BC patients not achieving a pCR, those with TRAR-low scores in surgical specimens showed a trend for lower distant event-free survival. In conclusion, in HER2-positive/ER-positive BC, TRAR is an independent predictor of pCR and represents a promising tool to select patients responsive to anti-HER2-based neoadjuvant therapy and to assist treatment escalation and de-escalation strategies in this setting."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057532344","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ff23da4097075fba705fc1","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"16","number":"12","doi":"","documentHash":"86d9c146-7bec-41e1-be12-2275fbd970cf"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"2355-2366","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1878-0261.13141","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61bf13de2467f07b6bdc8053","name":"Luca","lastName":"Gianni","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c5c2cf0e-fb75-403d-9500-b45a8fc3c210"},{"objectId":"61bf13de2467f07b6bdc8052","name":"Giulia","lastName":"Viale","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4c61fa7e-4447-41e8-a851-a99fd9d4177c"},{"objectId":"61bf13de2467f07b6bdc8051","name":"Begona","lastName":"Bermejo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"89b0aa15-9c8f-4de5-ae2c-1d5af2c916fb"},{"objectId":"61bf13de2467f07b6bdc8050","name":"Juan","lastName":"de

annulare (GA) is a benign inflammatory skin disease that presents with erythematous papules and annular plaques. The pathogenesis of GA remains unknown and may potentially involve type 1 T helper cell (Th1)-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. GA is associated with many conditions such as malignancy, trauma, thyroid disease, diabetes mellitus, and viral infection. The role of biological treatment is under investigation. In this article, we present a case of GA development following systemic treatment of psoriatic arthritis in a 59-year-old patient; golimumab therapy resulted in the successful treatment of both psoriatic arthritis and GA. This is the first case report describing GA therapy using golimumab."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057532423","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65f1908340970767dc8f7b25","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"35","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"2f6e50c0-226a-4e49-b6de-e46efb947705"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"35","pagesFromTo":"1-4","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34730269/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61bf13d12467f07b6bdc7d8c","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Szymańska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"24610ea3-8b1d-49c5-8cce-31a91bb14908"},{"objectId":"61bf13d12467f07b6bdc7d8b","name":"Michał","lastName":"Szczerba","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e85fba17-1ade-4364-91e5-32479c6f40eb"},{"objectId":"61bf13d12467f07b6bdc7d8a","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Gabzdyl","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"802a9e31-5f53-4921-b6b0-bfd2720675a2"},{"objectId":"61bf13d12467f07b6bdc7d89","name":"Klaudia E.","lastName":"Dopytalska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a2075024-432f-4899-b183-cc4b9dc802d4"},{"objectId":"5e7094ab878c28a0473c1553","name":"Irena","lastName":"Walecka - Herniczek","uuid":"A84A5C8FE6355BDCBCD3F9D94A97125F6FB7351E2570AA58DE6F2D691BA9A10DED17562E708CAE2FFFC468BD22F597FEB921C555AFB02411BD94F2552F119CE5","orcidId":"0000-0002-3502-3339","documentHash":"5d73e80a-452d-47a8-8c75-43ab2551053a"}],"doi":"10.1111/dth.15188"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["FGM","FLEXOMAGNETICITY","NANOSTRUCTURES","NONLOCAL ELASTICITY"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"629f2c1240970718a3865460","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-81705-3","title":"Advanced Materials Modelling for Mechanical, Medical and Biological Applications","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"9783030817046","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":null,"translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"9b13f18c-6bb8-4811-8576-e3cae75fac0b","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094df878c28a0473c5abb","5e709423878c28a0473b6fe6","61ca84b87523404d4a949b1e"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Flexomagneticity in Functionally Graded Nanostructures","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61c332e42467f057533827e8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61ca84b87523404d4a949b1e","5e709423878c28a0473b6fe6","5e7094df878c28a0473c5abb"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Functionally graded structures have shown the perspective of materials in a higher efficient and consistent manner.

European countries have not been among the world’s leading countries in this statistic. In addition, there have been different paces in the implementation of electromobility in individual countries. The main purpose of this paper is to determine the directions of change and the degrees of concentration in electromobility in European Union (EU) countries, especially after the economic closure as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The specific objectives are to indicate the degree of concentration of electromobility in the EU and changes in this area, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic; to determine the dynamics of changes in the number of electric cars in individual EU countries, showing the variability in this aspect, while also taking into account the crisis caused by COVID-19; to establish the association between the number of electric cars and the parameters of the economy. All EU countries were selected for study by the use of the purposeful selection procedure, as of December 31, 2020. The analyzed period covered the years 2011–2020. It was found that in the longer term, the development of electromobility in the EU, measured by the number of electric cars, is closely related to the economic situation in this area. The crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the economic situation in all EU countries, but has not slowed down the pace of introducing electromobility, and may have even accelerated it. In all EU countries, in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, the dynamics of introducing electric cars into use increased. The growth rate in the entire EU in 2020 was 86%, while in 2019 it was 48%. The reason was a change in social behavior related to mobility under conditions of risk of infection. COVID-19 has become a positive catalyst for change.

In this study genome-wide experiments were conducted using expression microarray-system. Only one common mRNA transcript coding for CCDC65 gene was equally expressed by HT-29 cells after incubation challenge with three different E. coli strains used. This gene and its bacterial analogue are important in the ciliary or flagellar motility, respectively. Altogether, 78 and 81 HT-29 mRNA transcripts for E. coli UM146 and E. coli UM147 had identical RNA quantity in comparison to the response obtained for non-pathogenic E. coli Nissle 1917 interactions with HT-29 monolayers. Specific analysis using REACTOME and agriGO terms enrichment data-mining tools as well as word-cloud analysis allowed for identification the most important processes characteristic during HT-29 cell line infections for each pathogenic E. coli strain used. The importance of results may contribute to recognition of those processes during bacterial infections that are identical with processes arising from human interaction with non-pathogenic strains that belong to the same bacterial species."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057544752","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"1 - 7","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092a4878c28a047399bda","name":"Roman","lastName":"Kotlowski","uuid":"292AADE7FACE5F700AE3600041A1BC89A98C3471E006628D373D72AE37AE6BE0DA731FEA78D53BB82E53AE30F5244EACD07F31D9A8CE5D31373ACA598F36D78C","orcidId":"0000-0001-7793-9786","documentHash":"db2f86ce-faea-41d2-a9a2-c76056abebf3"}],"doi":"10.7150/jgen.67277"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["classification model","separation control","fuzzy logic","machine learning","artificial intelligence"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Comprehensive Knowledge-Driven AI System for Air Classification Process","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":"10.3390/ma","issn":"1996-1944","eissn":"1996-1944","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"8475d9fb-a844-4cfe-87c7-25090cd02fd3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-22","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61c97bfe2467f00f2d4935e4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709200878c28a04738e74a","5e709414878c28a0473b5e0e","5e709200878c28a04738e71d","5e709202878c28a04738e839","5e709240878c28a04739265a"]},"issue":"Iss.1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Air classifier devices have a distinct advantage over other systems used to separate materials.

Since improvement in their performance is challenging, the development of an efficient modeling system is of great practical significance. The paper introduces a novel, knowledge-based classification (FLClass) system of bulk materials. A wide range of operating parameters are considered in the study: the mean mass and the Sauter mean diameter of the fed material, classifier rotor speed, working air pressure, and test conducting time. The output variables are the Sauter mean diameter and the cut size of the classification product, as well as the performance of the process. The model was successfully validated against experimental data. The maximum relative error between the measured and predicted data is lower than 9%. The presented fuzzy-logic-based approach allows an optimization study of the process to be conducted. For the considered range of input parameters, the highest performance of the classification process is equal to almost 362 g/min.

Adult Plant Resistance (APR) is a post-seedling resistance mechanism and its expression is influenced by many factors, including host susceptibility and weather conditions, as well as the timing and severity of disease outbreaks. There are two mechanisms associated with APR: non-hypersensitive and minor gene APR. In this study, 431 European barley accessions were evaluated phenotypically over 2 years (2018–2019) under field conditions, scoring APR to powdery mildew (PM), barley brown rust (BBR), and stem rust (SR), and genotypically using DArTseq. Accessions were grouped into sub-collections by cultivation period (group A—cultivated prior 1985, B—cultivated after 1985, and C—Polish landraces) and by European country of origin or European region. GWAS was conducted for PM, BBR, and SR, and scored at the heading (HA) and milky-waxy (MW) seed stages in 2019 and maximum scores across all replicates were obtained 2018–2019. Disease severity was sufficient to differentiate the collection according to cultivation time and country of origin and to determine SNPs. Overall, the GWAS analysis identified 73 marker–trait associations (MTAs) with these traits. For PM resistance, we identified five MTAs at both the HA stage and when considering the maximal disease score across both growth stages and both years. One marker (3432490-28-T/C) was shared between these two traits; it is located on chromosome 4H. For BBR resistance, six MTAs at HA and one MTA at the MW stage in 2019 and seven MTAs, when considering the maximal disease score across both growth stages and both years, were identified. Of the 48 markers identified as being associated with SR resistance, 12 were on chromosome 7H, 1 was in the telomeric region of the short arm, and 7 were in the telomeric region of the long arm. Rpg1 has previously been mapped to 7HS. The results of this study will be used to create a Polish Gene Bank platform for precise breeding programs. The resistant genotypes and MTA markers will serve as a valuable resource for breeding for PM, BBR, and SR resistance in barley."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057549923","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61c421832467f0264d189e80","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"f1afdd90-928f-4bf9-95eb-20b7eaeb9f2a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"7","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/1/7/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61c421832467f0264d189e7e","name":"Nathan S.","lastName":"Watson-Haigh","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7935-6151","documentHash":"6499a088-a81c-4d8b-b13c-15fe4a21a360"},{"objectId":"61c421832467f0264d189e7d","name":"Radoslaw","lastName":"Suchecki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"438bf63d-41e9-4de8-b93c-a49b391aec69"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4ae4","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Kochańska-Czembor","uuid":"EBFB92567CC085B0C008AC9D080EA5004AA1F5D86D83C82290CDA37F061637217445BDB07E9315E3DE26E47100542FE3F68CD0EE3076E65BF10CF1C52F5A486F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3021-3053","documentHash":"ba5932be-ecf7-43fe-876c-38631970cc77"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4a53","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Czembor","uuid":"E00D8BE03C2BA2ACE4CB4650A64FB8015B7A7A6C6822520E91E3F5AF593BC25F4F7E3A87D8778F47DAFC3D4501B8B6A7F6742AD1F5934FF118B61E081A692143","orcidId":"0000-0002-3997-3868","documentHash":"fdd2a85c-7b14-4663-89a3-fc2ef4fd333e"}],"doi":"10.3390/agronomy12010007"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Embryo arrest","Marginal populations","Pollen limitation","Seed quality"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","uid":"b_ZPtKgtv4v90uInHkYp6dg","uuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","parentUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","rootUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Kochanowskiego w Kielcach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709355878c28a0473a7675"]},{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f82c","uid":"bW6UmF5uUXnumJ4PLD8QbxQ","uuid":"da53ef4a-4e78-45bf-8b53-36a8ba11acd3","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","parentUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","rootUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","name":"Wydział Biologii (od 1.10.2019 r.)","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922b878c28a047390f18","5e709337878c28a0473a520f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Flowering and quality of seeds and pollen in endangered populations of Betula humilis","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454799cc","mniswId":"19772","title":"Trees-Structure and Function","doi":null,"issn":"0931-1890","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"ebfdab3f-a685-468c-b970-8e576301f4dd"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-09-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61c430f72467f0264d1aecf3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709337878c28a0473a520f","5e709355878c28a0473a7675","5e70922b878c28a047390f18","61c430f72467f0264d1aecfe"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Key message\nLowered pollen and seed quality of B. humilis compared to its widespread tree relatives may threaten its populations at the southwestern edge of the species range.\n\nAbstract\nInability to produce vital propagules is the main threat to the persistence of rare plants at the edges of species distribution. In the present investigation, factors responsible for the low germinability of shrub birch (Betula humilis) seeds in the peripheral populations were analysed. As shrub birch populations are found in phosphorus (P)-limited peatlands with high groundwater levels, the impact of groundwater PO43− ion contents and groundwater table for B. humilis flowering was also studied. Qualities of the B. humilis seeds and pollen were compared to those of tree congeners silver birch (B. pendula) and downy birch (B. pubescens), which usually represent a high reproductive performance. We revealed that the poor germination ability of B. humilis seeds was caused by the high proportions of empty seeds (44.8%) and seeds with partially developed embryos (47.3%). The insufficient numbers of viable seeds may be a consequence of low-quality shrub birch pollen, as only 1.6% of pollen grains sprouted. The germinability of shrub birch pollen was significantly lower than that of Betula tree pollen; thus, there is a risk of pollination of B. humilis female flowers by pollen grains of tree birches. Positive relationships between the P concentrations in seeds and seed germinability were revealed in tree birches, but not in B. humilis. The availability of PO43− ions in the groundwater did not affect B. humilis flowering, but male inflorescences were more numerous in stands with higher groundwater levels. Consequently, the maintenance of peatlands is crucial for the efficient sexual reproduction of shrub birches."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057550204","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"36","pagesFromTo":"313–324","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00468-021-02207-7.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61c430f72467f0264d1aecfe","name":"Galya","lastName":"Petrova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0635-9394","documentHash":"aa2d0d56-89b6-4c7e-b278-37ffddd337a0"},{"objectId":"5e709355878c28a0473a7675","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Kłosowski","uuid":"974D3777E0BBD5F8C5846C49437D13B17A3D8E96F3E899BF8C1ADC23F065CD9B6C06F46D092E25C9E6355CA9EB36F230C0E4ACAF5E91C2C9A05421B66B548389","orcidId":"0000-0003-3240-6438","documentHash":"568e8fe7-d979-4eb2-bed5-7e336e20e6b8"},{"objectId":"5e709337878c28a0473a520f","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Bona","uuid":"4329C23EDDF42C090C17AD826590356CB816FFFE476570199B14E8C804DB3567F7398FA8954EF843EF9DF62731C72AC729C4B9E78B1583196B03044556816DD4","orcidId":"0000-0002-2359-517X","documentHash":"0065e83f-9b74-4fec-b86d-3c6978990f66"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047390f18","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Jadwiszczak","uuid":"72B847F102E0D5ABC99FB7ED73BA9DDA5688CDEF7ABBA959A9024956F6084A6A0BE351A4A83AD6B83901FDFEB25B9B3EE67346AE0146FA714C29C97E64CD02B4","orcidId":"0000-0002-9345-8891","documentHash":"445fafd3-0e6c-45ae-be71-94abcfb009f1"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00468-021-02207-7"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["black soldier fly","alternative dietary energy fat","microbiota","microbial activity","immune status"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709346878c28a0473a62a6","5e7092cd878c28a04739d0e9","5f7d8b87085dcb410a25eb5b","603094699543c7410626f7fa","5e7093e2878c28a0473b29a0"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Hermetia illucens fat affects the gastrointestinal tract selected microbial populations, their activity, and the immune status of broiler chickens","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547705d","mniswId":"1208","title":"Annals of Animal Science","doi":null,"issn":"1642-3402","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"918f4592-7ca2-4efd-8f18-3c3ce7805298"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-12","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61c46fb12467f05d3804bb6b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092cd878c28a04739d0e9","603094699543c7410626f7fa","5e709346878c28a0473a62a6","5e7093e2878c28a0473b29a0","5f7d8b87085dcb410a25eb5b"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The present study investigated the effect of Hermetia illucens larvae (BSFL) fat, derived using supercritical CO2 extraction and added to broiler chickens’ diets as a partial (50%) or total replacement for commonly used soybean oil, on the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbial population, its activity, and selected physiological and immune traits. A total of 576 one-day-old female Ross 308 chicks were randomly assigned to 3 dietary treatments with 16 replicates each. The following treatments were applied: SO – 100% soybean oil, BSFL50 – a mixture of BSFL and soybean oils in a 50:50 ratio, and BSFL100 – 100% BSFL fat. Digesta samples from the crop, jejunum and ceca were collected for further analyses, i.e., pH measurements, fluorescent in situ hybridization, and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentrations. Additionally, the selected plasma biochemical parameters and immunological traits were assessed. In general, the implementation of BSFL fat in broilers’ diets resulted in increased proliferation of potentially pathogenic bacterial populations in the crop, such as Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides – Prevotella cluster, and Clostridium perfringens. Furthermore, BSFL100 enhanced microbial activity via total SCFA production and lowered the pH in this segment. However, no detrimental effects were observed in terms of other GIT segments, i.e., the jejunal and cecal microecosystems. The strongest impact on reduction of select components of the microbial population in the cecum was observed with the BSFL50 treatment for potentially pathogenic bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides – Prevotella cluster, while commensal populations were also limited, i.e., Bacillus spp., C. leptum subgroup, and C. coccoides – Eubacterium rectale cluster. Additionally, BSFL100 reduced the cholesterol concentration in the blood, while both experimental treatments decreased the ALT level. In conclusion, due to the insufficient release of lauric acid from the BSFL fat in the crop, an adverse shift in the microbiota can be noted. However, a positive suppressive effect on the select components of the cecal microbiota, as well as improvement of liver health suggests implying the BSFL fat in broiler nutrition."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057556186","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"663-675","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/aoas-2021-0071","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"603094699543c7410626f7fa","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Mikołajczak","uuid":"3F4D818538C65714230EAF943DE46BD0B405BCF656F770E6E60FEFDDC8E481E11087FEB875A252F2A55B95A90C10C7EDD5734A5D726A37A361C4522EFBBBBD41","orcidId":"0000-0003-4869-8260","documentHash":"85d7c7fc-b25a-4501-b285-0ff485375fb8"},{"objectId":"5f7d8b87085dcb410a25eb5b","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Leciejewska","uuid":"D1A85D2E3823D4E63420D16E166257CA53FB224707A867C857F19837864A47BE5F3479BE1F110773E725358DE9F49101F2EF33B17006E878357F0A24D5D833AD","orcidId":"0000-0002-0081-7585","documentHash":"efd4ee22-0730-4cb9-98d6-7fbaec846b67"},{"objectId":"5e7093e2878c28a0473b29a0","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Rawski","uuid":"E140AA6BEDE599E0D8783F10772C719DFEA86DAC8DCD7E2AEA9DF5BAF82749496E4874C938CE13C464CE4E8B29C0A40F428BB32843F2BCF49916006F0A192689","orcidId":"0000-0001-8734-724X","documentHash":"0fb78ea7-e4e0-4dcd-ade7-2a17d117db2c"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62a6","name":"Damian","lastName":"Józefiak","uuid":"313C63DAC3BAE2CFF3B5F4796B6368D8CF6ABFFF18FEDA622C43DCF4FA3F8C744F7DA41625E9CC39900990D3902DD29BB19F5C2197A0242E10D3E9009E888FF7","orcidId":"0000-0002-6606-7975","documentHash":"a003c9e4-3193-47d4-be74-ce7bf8b7488d"},{"objectId":"5e7092cd878c28a04739d0e9","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Kierończyk","uuid":"5F7BDDA33BF27C2628C2F217CEBAE8C090AB2EB6DEBB30D643C9545B7B778E0ADE543C2004F766343DAC868FA002019347BDC892C8A7E47B1B2C74D613238AD0","orcidId":"0000-0001-6006-117X","documentHash":"29052b59-0d1c-4684-b39b-344e17fe77fc"}],"doi":"10.2478/aoas-2021-0071"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Sieci neuronowe","Produkty ubezpieczeniowe z funduszem inwestycyjnym","Równania BSDE ze skokami"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Neural network","Equity-linked insurance products","BSDEs with jumps"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3d","uid":"b2eiZUbb85g0FOaTA2KZtOw","uuid":"c7c10a2a-f381-4dc2-8511-53400ceb4a90","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3d","parentUuid":"c7c10a2a-f381-4dc2-8511-53400ceb4a90","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3d","rootUuid":"c7c10a2a-f381-4dc2-8511-53400ceb4a90","name":"Szkoła Główna Handlowa w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709267878c28a04739513c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Pricing equity-linked life insurance contracts with multiple risk factors by neural networks","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454785ad","mniswId":"10606","title":"Journal of Computational and Applied Mathematics","doi":null,"issn":"0377-0427","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"1d31f9a6-5d8b-406f-9995-baf0c43ecd4a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61c049172467f07b6b060bb7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709267878c28a04739513c","672e0f70fdbe830349945069"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper considers the pricing of equity-linked life insurance contracts with death and survival benefits in a general model with multiple stochastic risk factors: interest rate, equity, volatility, unsystematic and systematic mortality.

The impact of atmospheric conditions on the daily concentrations of birch pollen grains, the Annual pollen integral (APIn), and the length of pollen seasons were studied. The dependency between each meteorological condition and various features of the birch pollen season was determined using Spearman’s rho correlation, the Kruskal–Wallis test, and cluster analysis with the k-means method. It has been shown that the duration of sunshine and average air temperature occurring within 14 days preceding the season has the most significant influence on the beginning of a birch pollen season. The value of daily birch pollen concentrations in Sosnowiec showed a statistically significant positive correlation with the duration of sunlight and the average and maximum wind speed. The daily concentration also depended on the synoptic situation: the mass airflow direction, the type of air mass inflow, and the type of weather front. The near-ground temperature influenced the APIn of birch pollen grains during the period of 14 days before the beginning of the season and the meteorological conditions occurring in the summer of the preceding year such as the maximum temperature, duration of sunlight, the maximum and average wind speed, and the relative air humidity. It was concluded that the length of birch pollen seasons decreased year by year."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057571822","journalIssue":{"objectId":"60903b702467f0719b07adc8","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"53d93836-0df5-44a4-92c9-f1f5436b08e0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"38","pagesFromTo":"51-70","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10453-021-09734-3.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b8220","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Dąbrowska-Zapart","uuid":"B4D24BE847F26BA7D3C9FCFB9270D2764A0A58AE97B823F2E7CFB0AF817999D1F8C4D850E1B4E718B140F57065E4865E2AF9D1A976611D87DCD8DE4170C52341","orcidId":"0000-0002-8976-7739","documentHash":"b3023841-6686-44b3-a2c4-3f5df0949a60"},{"objectId":"5e7092e7878c28a04739f0b1","name":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Niedźwiedź","uuid":"0F49DB6B5E9EFFA6E5B081D9D7F07739699BC1769379CE9A79F28D22DF840982B389C132FA73B363DA49F852223E35B6DFFDC943E018A0C904F52E638A8A6EA3","orcidId":"0000-0003-0004-9501","documentHash":"6c8c9962-a9d5-4aae-83bd-18e042e3474d"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10453-021-09734-3"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["solenoids","packing measure","Lyapunov exponents","stable/ unstable foliation","Hausdorff measure"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb3","uid":"bdcud9f5wTDoe2In0PutAaw","uuid":"96a58ef3-d4b3-4384-b9e4-4792d490536f","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb3","parentUuid":"96a58ef3-d4b3-4384-b9e4-4792d490536f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb3","rootUuid":"96a58ef3-d4b3-4384-b9e4-4792d490536f","name":"Instytut Matematyczny Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c33b549543c7233654418a","5e70928f878c28a047397f21","5e70928f878c28a047397f30"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Hausdorff and packing dimensions and measures for nonlinear transversally non-conformal thin solenoids","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b3b","mniswId":"5914","title":"Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems","doi":null,"issn":"0143-3857","eissn":"1469-4417","websiteLink":"http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayJournal?jid=ETS","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"15b941bd-5008-4ee9-9f80-ca793a375b52"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61c9a1e42467f00f2d535dc3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c33b549543c7233654418a","5e70928f878c28a047397f30","5e70928f878c28a047397f21"]},"issue":"11","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We extend the results of Hasselblatt and Schmeling [Dimension product structure of hyperbolic sets.

Under the assumptions of transversality and on the Lyapunov exponents for an appropriate Gibbs measure imposing thinness, as well as the assumption that there is an invariant C1+ε strong stable foliation, we prove that Hausdorff dimension HD(\u0003 ∩ Ws ) is the same quantity t0 for all Ws and else HD(\u0003) = t0 + 1. We prove also that for the packing measure, 0 < \u0004t0(\u0003 ∩ Ws) < ∞, but for Hausdorff measure, HMt0(\u0003 ∩ Ws ) = 0 for all Ws. Also 0 < \u00041+t0(\u0003) < ∞ and HM1+t0(\u0003) = 0. A technical part says that the holonomy along unstable foliation is locally Lipschitz, except for a set of unstable leaves whose intersection with every Ws has measure HMt0 equal to 0 and even Hausdorff dimension less than t0. The latter holds due to a large deviations phenomenon."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057574680","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61c9a1e42467f00f2d535dc9","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"5e7fd80d-fe6d-4254-87ef-5b55520050e7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"42","pagesFromTo":"3458 - 3489","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S0143385721000948","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"60c33b549543c7233654418a","name":"Reza","lastName":"Mohammadpour Bejargafsheh","uuid":"3F2FAD225A994FE0AEBFA4712A45FE426385CAB13DE7DE9B5FFD5FBAB901D53AED7B9618F9BB857BA73A780DAC0E94B21CAB6ACA4CFBC2D3CA574C49B52B68DA","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f73e30fb-a2d6-4c90-b4d8-8c97afb31677"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397f30","name":"Michał","lastName":"Rams","uuid":"BDD83125CC96584F62A387FC9A7B45CC2031238F9CC4093209F091B046866659550378CCBF515DE930FEC8CB2F29D094F1E94FF94B3346541FFD631C1FD88C87","orcidId":"0000-0002-9447-9504","documentHash":"9393bc5b-5d24-4cef-9385-a7030c101e8d"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397f21","name":"Feliks","lastName":"Przytycki","uuid":"F1CEB85C2F645E5B6A5C33C04DFD8293FFAA19F1D34E2B1DF3DA430BA7488A3AB9B79BF1D8930F29E24E3537560B3DC16EDDA3C96B989E87E803CEBD141C77F9","orcidId":"0000-0002-5713-948X","documentHash":"1247b51d-bff4-4ee4-9a71-e3f46c622f26"}],"doi":"10.1017/etds.2021.94"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cancer","glycosylation","immune system","infection","vaccination"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Recent advances on smart glycoconjugate vaccines in infections and cancer","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477ca7","mniswId":"6530","title":"FEBS Journal","doi":null,"issn":"1742-464X","eissn":"1432-1033","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"23469f39-95b7-40f0-8ba1-0c5ab79bb12e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-07-19","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61c0579f2467f06450a391bb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63ae83ed409707109b9f8073","63ae83ed409707109b9f8074","5e70923b878c28a0473921d0","63ae83ed409707109b9f8075","63ae83ed409707109b9f8076","63ae83ed409707109b9f8077","63ae83ed409707109b9f8078","63ae83ed409707109b9f8079","63ae83ed409707109b9f807a","63ae83ed409707109b9f807b","63ae83ed409707109b9f807c","63ae83ed409707109b9f807d","63ae83ed409707109b9f807e","63ae83ed409707109b9f807f","63ae83ed409707109b9f8080","63ae83ed409707109b9f8081","63ae83ed409707109b9f8082","63ae83ed409707109b9f8083","63ae83ed409707109b9f8084","63ae83ed409707109b9f8085","63ae83ed409707109b9f8086","63ae83ed409707109b9f8087","63ae83ed409707109b9f8088","63ae83ed409707109b9f8089","63ae83ed409707109b9f808a"]},"issue":"14","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Vaccination is one of the greatest achievements in biomedical research preventing death and morbidity in many infectious diseases through the induction of pathogen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Currently, no effective vaccines are available for pathogens with a highly variable antigenic load, such as the human immunodeficiency virus or to induce cellular T-cell immunity in the fight against cancer. The recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has reinforced the relevance of designing smart therapeutic vaccine modalities to ensure public health. Indeed, academic and private companies have ongoing joint efforts to develop novel vaccine prototypes for this virus. Many pathogens are covered by a dense glycan-coat, which form an attractive target for vaccine development. Moreover, many tumor types are characterized by altered glycosylation profiles that are known as “tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens”. Unfortunately, glycans do not provoke a vigorous immune response and generally serve as T-cell-independent antigens, not eliciting protective immunoglobulin G responses nor inducing immunological memory. A close and continuous crosstalk between glycochemists and glycoimmunologists is essential for the successful development of efficient immune modulators. It is clear that this is a key point for the discovery of novel approaches, which could significantly improve our understanding of the immune system. In this review, we discuss the latest advancements in development of vaccines against glycan epitopes to gain selective immune responses and to provide an overview on the role of different immunogenic constructs in improving glycovaccine

These heights are required for geodetic and geodynamic scientific research as well as for extensive engineering applications. The main objective of this study is to estimate the geoid-to-quasi geoid separation (GQS) in Ethiopia (ETH-GQS). Such separation would be required for a conversion between geoid and quasigeoid models, which is mandatory for the determination of accurate geodetic heights in mountain regions. The airborne free-air gravity anomalies and the topographic information retrieved from the SRTM3 (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission of a spatial resolution 3 arc-second) digital elevation model were used to compute the ETH-GQS model according to the Sjöberg's strict formula for the geoid-to-quasigeoid separation. The ETH-GQS was then validated using GNSS-levelling data as well as geoid heights determined from different Global Geopotential Models (GGMs), namely the EGM2008, EIGEN-6C4 and GECO. The results reveal that the standard deviation of differences between the geoid heights obtained from the EIGEN-6C4 model and the geometric geoid heights obtained from GNSS-levelling data were improved by ∼75% (i.e. from ∼24 to ∼6 cm) when considering GQS values obtained from the ETH-GQS."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057580536","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61c195b42467f03fff30019e","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"9f00fb24-728c-46c6-8355-76d66c46d3a7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"31-37","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674984721000859?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61c195b42467f03fff30019b","name":"Robert","lastName":"Tenzer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"18827357-9a6f-4ae1-96ab-ab2cc1c6256d"},{"objectId":"61c195b42467f03fff300194","name":"Ephrem Y.","lastName":"Belay","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b98313b7-6d7e-47e8-a88e-4501ad9c3a44"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d3a","name":"Walyeldeen","lastName":"Godah","uuid":"D0A5AC7D45EAF07F284BAF7C82F99B7DD153FCD6B89DFD4A7DBBE572A8151EF4899CD62581185D7D09C6A4B81BEDDAA0EE0BBC2AEF9748456827566288E13C57","orcidId":"0000-0002-5616-0770","documentHash":"200e25d4-74b5-42c4-a4af-217fd4cc8358"},{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395dea","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Szelachowska","uuid":"9CC7B542BF162916069D7E8CB1D87ABA1E73EA688B583ED085908C6845E9C5F08C547A7677FF054FA0C1A6E9132DA7B86241114D4771021B12127157E478D742","orcidId":"0000-0002-6421-7589","documentHash":"2b64eb24-a465-44dd-90a8-d87171dd5aaf"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.geog.2021.09.006"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["czynniki ryzyka","zarządzanie projektami","zarządzanie ryzykiem projektowym","projekty kogeneracyjne"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["risk factors","project management","management project risk","cogeneration projects"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f8f5","uid":"bQmdkdjc2fEVOfEB4Ahn06Q","uuid":"224d312f-19b7-4f25-83ea-6ac59c6c2892","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","parentUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","rootUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","name":"Instytut Zarządzania","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a2878c28a0473999a5"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473972bf"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Risk identification in cogeneration (combined heat and power) projects : a Polish case study","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1073","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-22","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61c9e7242467f00f2d6565e2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092a2878c28a0473999a5","6661a0c54097074fa1bcbff2","5e709285878c28a0473972bf"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The purpose of the article is to define the risk factors in cogeneration projects and to demonstrate that a lack of sufficient identification of risks in different phases affects project implementation. A theoretical study is conducted, which aims to identify risk factors in cogeneration projects, based on case studies of such projects in Poland. The study offers a view at CHP (combined heat and power) projects as extremely dependent on the external environment of the organisation. These projects are subject to many external regulations due to their environmental impact and dynamically changing technical aspects. The biggest technical errors occur at the planning and construction stages. The biggest economic and financial risks occur at the execution stage after 2% and 3% of additional design costs occur, respectively. The authors estimated the risks at different stages of the project and concluded that the total cost of failure in correct identification of the risks at the planning stage exceeded PLN 1.5 billion, which amounted to almost 60% of the total additional costs of materialised project risk. Consequently, the biggest challenges in the area of CHP project management at the planning stage are a thorough identification of risks, and the pricing and planning reactions to risk."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057582803","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61c2dfca2467f057531dd187","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"35d7af3b-28f3-4dc0-94a1-73c4071fb0ad"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/1/42/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6661a0c54097074fa1bcbff2","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Borkowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"409e3cb4-af29-409f-9a65-4382f7b0a102"},{"objectId":"5e7092a2878c28a0473999a5","name":"JOANNA","lastName":"RZEMPAŁA","uuid":"FD800300F66942C32D08A6D379A9CA4D7CF1AE561FE4DBAA286381B172F15D1B455DB7E1095475597AD863D9298955B2B107D5DCA598DCA8379CDC9A9EDB1BE5","orcidId":"0000-0002-0542-9370","documentHash":"5f1a70e7-15c6-46f1-a12d-f6afb8ec040f"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473972bf","name":"ARTUR","lastName":"RZEMPAŁA","uuid":"5A888139996F42B00436BC1F13EB71797F5B99B31E9315FD4DBF08DA704C75EE58B397CB41C62D94C33A7D0502EA72D04745E1382831163BF49B4E0EA6CEBCCF","orcidId":"0000-0002-6576-8091","documentHash":"1268fbca-6a33-4191-9d3a-2a770accb197"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15010042"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9a","uid":"b8KxaPPV_aM8-YLJlYjQq8Q","uuid":"cd9df9ee-5c47-4b8c-bda2-b903eac95559","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9a","parentUuid":"cd9df9ee-5c47-4b8c-bda2-b903eac95559","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9a","rootUuid":"cd9df9ee-5c47-4b8c-bda2-b903eac95559","name":"Instytut Biologii Doświadczalnej im.

In particular, system-specific kin relationships among hosts can create contact\r\nheterogeneities and differential disease transmission rates. Here, we investigate\r\nhow distance-dependent infection risk is influenced by genetic relatedness in a novel\r\nhost-pathogen system:wild boar (Sus scrofa) and African swine fever (ASF).We hypothesized\r\nthat infection risk would correlate positively with proximity and relatedness\r\nto ASF-infected individuals but expected those relationships to weaken with the\r\ndistance between individuals due to decay in contact rates and genetic similarity.We\r\ngenotyped 323 wild boar samples (243 ASF-negative and 80 ASF-positive) collected in\r\nnorth-eastern Poland in 2014–2016 and modelled the effects of geographic distance,\r\ngenetic relatedness and ASF virus transmission mode (direct or carcass-based) on the\r\nprobability of ASF infection. Infection risk was positively associated with spatial proximity\r\nand genetic relatedness to infected individuals with generally stronger effect of\r\ndistance. In the high-contact zone (0–2 km), infection risk was shaped by the presence\r\nof infected individuals rather than by relatedness to them. In the medium-contact\r\nzone (2–5 km), infection risk decreased but was still associated with relatedness and\r\npaired infections were more frequent among relatives. At farther distances, infection\r\nrisk further declined with relatedness and proximity to positive individuals, and was\r\n60% lower among un-related individuals in the no-contact zone (33% in10–20 km)\r\ncompared among relatives in the high-contact zone (93% in 0–2 km). Transmission\r\nmode influenced the relationship between proximity or relatedness and infection risk.\r\nOur results indicate that the presence of nearby infected individuals is most important\r\nfor shaping ASF infection rates through carcass-based transmission, while relatedness\r\nplays an important role in shaping transmission rates between live animals."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057585684","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"69","pagesFromTo":"2656-2666","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tbed.14418","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"660fe9814097076263f8b342","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Borowik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"244c5cce-6912-434b-8e08-2fe5f819de0e"},{"objectId":"660fe9814097076263f8b341","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Łyjak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2cdad066-7f22-49d7-aa4f-d43658719c33"},{"objectId":"660fe9814097076263f8b340","name":"Angelika","lastName":"Podbielska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5b784fe8-0f82-4798-bec8-1c687b242866"},{"objectId":"660fe9814097076263f8b33f","name":"Anna","lastName":"Radko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"297ebe9c-835d-40be-ba6e-9823dcc283d6"},{"objectId":"660fe9814097076263f8b33e","name":"Kim M.","lastName":"Pepin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f5f40daa-ccc8-4f9f-9a10-dd646cb75a16"},{"objectId":"660fe9814097076263f8b33d","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Podgórski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"25dabccf-e24d-479f-b032-5b54d341d1f1"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d6b","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Woźniakowski","uuid":"6D282CFCD3A7758B6F62BC672552908C0AA3BFA7E8AEA251B82246AFAA5A380A7601C034C662EDB06D1DAC96FEDDFDEE170F3BCD44E519D0E60AD2F0542F38F5","orcidId":"0000-0002-1333-4275","documentHash":"207a7d5b-ae39-4599-8ff4-03f9d039e209"}],"doi":"10.1111/tbed.14418"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Crystal Structure and Energetics of Arsenic(III)-Oxide Intercalates with Rubidium Chloride and Their Comparison with Isostructural Intercalates of Potassium Halides","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547784f","mniswId":"4571","title":"Crystal Growth & Design","doi":null,"issn":"1528-7483","eissn":"1528-7505","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"a74fd0a5-1a2c-4144-b4de-f61e8704ecc7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-05","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61cb24612467f0191a5ea7f9","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093a5878c28a0473ae6a9","65c9ffd240970762634b81a5","65c9ffd240970762634b81a6"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Two intercalation compounds of arsenic(III) oxide and rubidium chloride have been crystallized and characterized.

The structures of intercalates PRbCl and Y′RbCl have been studied by 87Rb solid-state magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy which has indicated the presence of one and two rubidium cations with distinct chemical environments, respectively. The comparison of these spectra allowed for the assignment of peaks to rubidium cations occupying particular sites. Infrared (IR) spectra and 1H ssNMR spectra of intercalate Y′RbCl have revealed dynamic disorder of water molecules occurring on the time scale of the IR experiment.

It  has been shown that some of these products contain a  mixture of menaquinone-7 geometric isomers. Since the geometric shape may influence biological activity, there was a  need for a  semi-preparative method to isolate single compounds for further studies. Here, we present an argentation chro-matographic method for the separation of menaquinone-7 isomers and an nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methodology for the configuration assignment of isoprenoid side chain. The DFT calculations were performed to determine more energetically favorable complexes between the cis or trans menaquinone-7 isomers and the silver cation. Seventeen components were resolved, and fractions were collected and subjected to NMR study. Struc-tures and chemical shifts for thirteen new compounds were assigned, and the identity of three known compounds was confirmed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057587766","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61cb4c412467f0191a66aba4","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"368","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"1455418b-e2e8-445b-a8d8-4c1648ae7a2b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"368","pagesFromTo":"130890","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0308814621018963?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70942a878c28a0473b7776","name":"Adam","lastName":"Zmysłowski","uuid":"CDC9CB1DBEC7896954BCE608F005691A499DBA349E889E1E77E2F2946D15CBB5E63781B3FED4F6F1A01C2F5CF8BB9CF5AFE769DA34CC3BAF921C697271A86CB9","orcidId":"0000-0002-5256-6298","documentHash":"ceb236cb-3382-487d-b97b-58851622b7cf"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b22","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Sitkowski","uuid":"CD1C570381521009E825476C21D040AD5349E38DFDBC5F6C3F318149F8C7583B7450ED0B91DFB68AA358A77C0C8FD1F771B03C995B14246253F12D189DD78BD3","orcidId":"0000-0002-9962-6024","documentHash":"e2fe8fc9-70e3-4132-b3ba-9badaf87f703"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b1b","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Bocian","uuid":"430FE3D8307E2DCA02F1146016E05F2FCE76611CEBABFFF46779D43AEBFB83355B2162A71C283EB1B926F49B8C2428440FE9918B8AB30EFF5C54F19FFE6DA208","orcidId":"0000-0003-3862-8656","documentHash":"3a40dbca-45d5-4502-9e0e-4bfb8d7d65cf"},{"objectId":"5e70934a878c28a0473a6929","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Bus","uuid":"FADD43E76049E586F8362D5A8D1DB7CAC9E828E4322D457A67915B4019A1B8B1250DD2991E7715DE45636DB3154E318717FC13EA794F519EFD89D67F1F1DCC02","orcidId":"0000-0001-6544-5412","documentHash":"d2ec09cd-94fd-4dea-a239-c1f7ed4d6b73"},{"objectId":"5e70930c878c28a0473a1d23","name":"Karol","lastName":"Ofiara","uuid":"6EA3CBB1C6BD5303600B47E34FA52E62DFDE7A64F225EC7EEE363E36B5790D58D3A47A4E280FC11469FB7E6F1199DE1A21F0310339E6558FAA53F257A66223C1","orcidId":"0000-0003-2211-4546","documentHash":"59d3165f-9327-45d1-a5e1-47563b4a7718"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a047392285","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Szterk","uuid":"A0D4E851D597280AC6670C7C3B7D559AE378458664A9AB7584C80F46B6D662791CE148112C8C76DAD1F1766027C6FB0451AAD351F0FDE5CCFDA22123BCEEB4F1","orcidId":"0000-0002-1399-5073","documentHash":"a89fe99b-7fa2-41de-a284-d2e1281f35b8"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.foodchem.2021.130890"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Higher education; internship; job adverts; labour market; work experience; text mining"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e7878c28a04739f073"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","uid":"bhdVW0TkXv39ZSgac65mGnw","uuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","parentUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","rootUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","name":"Uniwersytet Komisji Edukacji Narodowej w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709291878c28a0473981da"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Do employers really require experience?

The literature review demonstrates that one effective method to facilitate this transition is to ensure students acquire professional experience. The aim was to establish the scale and characteristics of employers’ demand for work experience expressed in job adverts. The data sample consisted of 17 397 adverts posted over a period of 18 months and addressed to geography, earth and environmental sciences specialists across six European countries. Quantitative analyses demonstrated that over one third of job postings required work experience. Text mining methods of content analysis revealed differences in the structure of high-importance words in adverts addressed to graduates with no, some or short work experience and those addressed to candidates with more extensive professional experience. A hierarchical cluster analysis helped us identify strong relationships between the word ‘experience’ and other words in specific subsets of adverts. The analysis led us to determine the characteristics of employers’ demand for work experience. The results help outline the directions of education policy for HE institutions regarding marketoriented measures aimed at ensuring work integrated learning which can clearly improve graduates’ chances on the labour market."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057587858","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63b5c2834097076e479e0bb4","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"47","number":"11","doi":"","documentHash":"63b96ae0-fe52-4ba5-9f5f-824075dde02f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"47","pagesFromTo":"2138-2160","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03075079.2021.2020747","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092e7878c28a04739f073","name":"Adam","lastName":"Hibszer","uuid":"8C5CD30B767AD686DFAB02FD223B575EA4C31A4E7BBBB0F4A8B53D75F0AB9F44CA4B26A1FE396737A7A6457C5F6033FD88E87D54456AEA919CF53BCABDCE5C5C","orcidId":"0000-0002-1416-7464","documentHash":"ed52c7a3-d408-41de-82ff-7a683bc34d7e"},{"objectId":"5e709291878c28a0473981da","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Piróg","uuid":"A7C3177F7E68C7CD3B5889AE23E50F4E9ABE840F5650927D5B6B78074453B80502F3E7FC759AD4EB879CB5E0C7E91F6FB5E44A2A8B34956C2DA210761EC4954B","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c8311113-0edd-4ef0-9d4d-1df7c79b0a39"}],"doi":"10.1080/03075079.2021.2020747"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","uid":"bWyeXRlH0huS_TwqiYk7m5Q","uuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","parentUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","rootUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709463878c28a0473bc13a","5e7092c8878c28a04739c7ff"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Botulinum toxin in cancer therapy - current perspectives and limitations.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477137","mniswId":"1489","title":"Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology","doi":null,"issn":"0175-7598","eissn":"1432-0614","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d9be8735-4b6d-48f1-9ff7-1f679c063624"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-24","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61cb0fba2467f0548882431f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c8878c28a04739c7ff","5e709463878c28a0473bc13a","6576ec1a4097071b8e0bec1e","6576ec1a4097071b8e0bec20"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747057587896","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"106","pagesFromTo":"485–495","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00253-021-11741-w","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6576ec1a4097071b8e0bec20","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kwiatek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"212c104a-68f8-4eda-9dd3-20015e979595"},{"objectId":"6576ec1a4097071b8e0bec1e","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Grenda","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b1f2131e-242e-40ff-970f-fb29290b4757"},{"objectId":"5e709463878c28a0473bc13a","name":"Anna","lastName":"Grenda","uuid":"4A1ACC570D480A538798FE6F11089BF57F54B15712382487E2C4E895D9F6F247452D05810C36428A0F2E39076496DDBBD8A16CD3DBC2A7C1779DFA7CB8C029B4","orcidId":"0000-0002-2112-8092","documentHash":"8dd6a6ba-ffaf-4046-a3b2-b45d50751089"},{"objectId":"5e7092c8878c28a04739c7ff","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Krawczyk","uuid":"524967AC3497E94F13409FDD5BB4853F5C7B7A2B1EB1EFDAF6E7C6F50FEC610FB9538D7051392707C35EB785FF9B58979E4FEE2FF6F544FBC8E7792E6BC4127C","orcidId":"0000-0001-8400-4452","documentHash":"8fa1d11f-bbea-4e8f-ac88-97d586b4107b"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00253-021-11741-w"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Alzheimer’sdisease","amyloid","cerebrospinal fluid","positron emission tomography","subjectivecog-nitive decline"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","parentUuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","rootUuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

In this context, manganese (Mn2+)-based nanoparticles have been greatly investigated, due to their valuable use as a contrast agent, improving signal intensity and specificity in MRI (manganese-enhanced MRI, MEMRI). Additionally, Mn2+ can act as scavengers of reactive oxygen species (ROS), commonly present in the inflammatory processes of neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of the present study was to develop nanoreactors, which can be used as contrast-agent in MEMRI. Several blends of methacrylated gellan gum (GG-MA) and hyaluronic acid (HA) were embedded with different types of manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoparticles and further physico-chemically characterized. Dynamic light scattering, scanning electron microscopy, water uptake and degradation studies were performed. In vitro cytotoxicity of the different formulations was also evaluated using an immortalized rat fibroblast cell line L929, up to 72 h of culturing. Synthesized nanoparticles were obtained with an average size of 70 nm and round-shaped morphology. The stability of the different formulations of hydrogels was not affected by nanoparticles' concentration or HA ratio. The presence of synthesized MnO2 (MnO2_S) nanoparticles reduced hydrogels' cytocompatibility, whereas the commercially available type 1 (MnO2_C1) nanoparticles were less toxic to cells. Additionally, cell proliferation and viability were enhanced when a lower content of HA was present. Higher concentrations (75 and 100 ng/mL) of MnO2_S and MnO2_C1 nanoparticles did not negatively affected cell viability, whereas the opposite effect was observed for the commercial type 2 (MnO2_C2) nanoparticles. Further studies are required to evaluate the potential application of the most promising nanoreactors' formulations for combined application in MEMRI and as ROS scavengers."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057588018","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"134","pagesFromTo":"112575","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0928493121007153?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61c1d5a62467f03fff478452","name":"Joaquim M.","lastName":"Oliveira","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c00707d5-0e49-4ea8-9820-512fe94a352d"},{"objectId":"61c1d5a62467f03fff478451","name":"Joana","lastName":"Silva-Correia","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"27d52dcc-f8c2-4ff3-81c9-5d6abd311c07"},{"objectId":"61c1d5a62467f03fff478450","name":"Rui L.","lastName":"Reis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bce3249a-ae2f-4798-8d58-e54ad9212ad7"},{"objectId":"61c1d5a62467f03fff47844c","name":"Soraia V.","lastName":"Lopes","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8d2a1dd8-26ef-4437-8b65-293e6f152a3d"},{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae461","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Walczak","uuid":"696DC098F9EFF12A4E6A18640E7BA8C1837561C21B5DBA0A5DAA3034B49CA9DBF2FFA3B81BEA11947EFD667B8390D29098F7B96981D5F86B94C3C101E663DAE7","orcidId":"0000-0002-3733-3322","documentHash":"3f359ad1-69d6-4fcb-912b-b83903eb84b7"},{"objectId":"5e70927a878c28a04739677d","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Janowski","uuid":"494C933050F8B50DA1DB856CFAB3604D21D9C78D1B3D3C4E9711C5960CE88B0534930AEAE5F4AB6DEECCC878A9E601896D99B50294D861ECFDEAB7015A1C36D6","orcidId":"0000-0001-5261-7975","documentHash":"0a11f99a-7ca2-4704-989f-b55c1938f2eb"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.msec.2021.112575"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["combined characterization techniques","secondary ion mass spectrometry","density functional theory","terpyridine","chemical stability"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Insight into structure-property relationship of organometallic terpyridine wires: Combined theoretical and experimental study","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479321","mniswId":"16353","title":"Polyhedron","doi":null,"issn":"0277-5387","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"802faa9f-2e5b-43df-b5b0-c5f0f17adc52"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61cb0ef82467f0191a54e20a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6160fea975234017e050de9b","65c9f45e40970762634a3c8c","65c9f45e40970762634a3c8d","65c9f45e40970762634a3c8e","65c9f45e40970762634a3c8f","65c9f45e40970762634a3c90"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Recent development in combined theoretical and experimental analysis methods offer an attractive opportunity to investigate organometallic materials. The selection of optimally combined characterization techniques allows for an effective description and even prediction of structure-property relationship occurring in terpyridine (TPY) molecules. In this work, secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), quantitative and qualitative characterization, hand-in-hand, with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, can aid analysis of the chemical stability and reactivity of organic compounds. A case study was based on the characterization of [M-(TPY)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> complexes (M: Co/Fe) with specific organic and organometallic architectures. The SIMS mass spectra showed the step-by-step molecules fragmentation and the quantitative SIMS analysis allowed to predict its direction. Analysis of electron density, electrostatic potential visualization, and calculated bonds length and HOMO-LUMO energetic gap were employed to confirm the differences between the bond-breaking mechanism depending on the metal atom bound to the terpyridine. The combined DFT/SIMS approach was successfully used to assess the chemical stability of various isomers of the TPY compounds, and to determine the possible fragmentation pathways depending largely on the metal centre present within the TPY structure."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057588096","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"213","pagesFromTo":"1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277538721006100?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65c9f45e40970762634a3c90","name":"Paweł Piotr","lastName":"Michałowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"88819be1-fe28-4732-837a-151b78d7e5ad"},{"objectId":"65c9f45e40970762634a3c8f","name":"Karol","lastName":"Hęclik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6e626f2b-5d97-4c60-bdb2-e4d818492244"},{"objectId":"65c9f45e40970762634a3c8e","name":"J.","lastName":"Kargul","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"84509f7d-5360-41e8-a9b7-cdf020729e0d"},{"objectId":"65c9f45e40970762634a3c8d","name":"Margot","lastName":"Jacquet","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7a986e90-a7a1-48d0-81b3-2dfe245f1c50"},{"objectId":"65c9f45e40970762634a3c8c","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Kozdra","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4f21aee2-6c98-4a6d-b583-f5979cd92c88"},{"objectId":"6160fea975234017e050de9b","name":"Adrianna","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"A6072E88E027E73DC689B85E71BF00E3C48554C7C9815781DFFD48F1A1D93335717879A2A4EAA48A3F5C05CA015215732CDCF35C8B67626FB1A7BDB592F7118B","orcidId":"0000-0002-1882-4134","documentHash":"e14ccc8e-dcf6-4b25-92d0-26d07c8857c4"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.poly.2021.115628"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","uid":"bWyeXRlH0huS_TwqiYk7m5Q","uuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","parentUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","rootUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092c7878c28a04739c72d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Assessment of drug-drug interactions between moxonidine and antiepileptic drugs in the maximal electroshock seizure test in mice.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454772cd","mniswId":"2263","title":"Basic and Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology","doi":null,"issn":"1742-7835","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"47c8a18d-54ed-43c9-bd27-7e46d91bfd38"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61cac06a2467f0348edb7309","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["657428fc4097071b8ed79c45","5e7092c7878c28a04739c72d"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747057588332","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"130","pagesFromTo":"28-34","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bcpt.13669","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"657428fc4097071b8ed79c45","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Łukawski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bd612f4d-8b35-4f05-b2ae-e73e54b04cb2"},{"objectId":"5e7092c7878c28a04739c72d","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Czuczwar","uuid":"ACE9878BC3592D4D81F8874DDC941D50C525F3E737C37B8AD42371A5F6774AE8831921160DFCC0450AE1404F9623C9B8644DE334B8A784D7A64193C8888AC336","orcidId":"0000-0003-2879-9945","documentHash":"1528fc2b-f2c7-4b31-bf2e-398123f56cc5"}],"doi":"10.1111/bcpt.13669"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["GLUCOSE SENSING","GOLD NANOPARTICLES","MEMBRANES","PBS","POLY(ZWITTERIONS)"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fded993085dcb71a319c180","5e70925d878c28a04739465a","5e70925e878c28a047394738"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb2","uid":"b3JwWgz_uDIpMZyMFk3QpAw","uuid":"674b7e57-dd24-4e8d-8949-327fa2f8bc82","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb2","parentUuid":"674b7e57-dd24-4e8d-8949-327fa2f8bc82","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb2","rootUuid":"674b7e57-dd24-4e8d-8949-327fa2f8bc82","name":"Instytut Maszyn Przepływowych im.

Those materials possess good catalytic activity toward glucose oxidation in 0.1 × phosphate buffered saline as well as resistance to some interferants, such as ascorbic acid, urea, and glycine. The electrodes are further coated with three different polymers, that is, Nafion, photo-crosslinked poly(zwitterions) based on sulfobetaine methacrylate, and a hybrid membrane consisting of both polymers. Both the optimal integrity of the material and its catalytic activity toward glucose oxidation were maintained by the hybrid membranes with a large excess of poly(zwitterions) (mass ratio 20:1). The chemical structures of the as-formed membranes are confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Due to the zwitterionic nature of the coating, the electrodes are resistant to biofouling and maintain electrochemical activity toward glucose for 4 days. Moreover, due to the synergistic effect of both Nafion and poly(zwitterions), the interference from the two compounds, namely, from acetylsalicylic acid and acetaminophen, was diminished. Besides the presence of polymer membranes, the electrode possesses a sensitivity of 36.8 μA cm−2 mM−1 in the linear range of 0.4–12 mM, while the limit of detection was estimated to be 23 μM. Finally, the electrodes are stable, and their response is not altered even by 1,000 bending cycles."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057593373","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6310844c409707291a609136","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"110","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"06def3ee-1775-44c0-b3f6-3efd8821d247"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"110","pagesFromTo":"679-690","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/jbm.b.34946","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5fded993085dcb71a319c180","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Olejnik","uuid":"E8F1BF8A81A42C7306161A3E3F4060EB2D90526D68215B60DB1EE75852DEA6987441B3E68661B7A7DB71303311E5D791DB0D4D9270D140A524B40D4B185143CB","orcidId":"0000-0002-1807-8995","documentHash":"6d201b1e-4ac1-425f-9e2c-63a758f238dd"},{"objectId":"5e7093ac878c28a0473aed62","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Siuzdak","uuid":"B15B72F086223F00EC659BC07346EB14A697D44FEE9542CBDA0FED1F249BB2739E359DF335C6B1CC1B5B4D41D370B443944290E14948CB8B02BFED6FF9580E9C","orcidId":"0000-0001-7434-6408","documentHash":"ca61740e-c4df-4c1b-a3b6-7542d77ddd6b"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b513","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Grochowska","uuid":"B6AAF451A14D04F838021BA8517E90686EEC59C10B8AEEEC51557B7703E72C5F8DAD8C8EDCA44CAC99375579438D3556748D3A0CFB9AC94982A8B897F9249F43","orcidId":"0000-0001-7577-3399","documentHash":"14413012-7901-428d-afdd-9d1bbfb65935"},{"objectId":"5e70925e878c28a047394738","name":"Anna","lastName":"Dołęga","uuid":"BBD5687FCC3D9D8A2B9B12CFDF8C20C7C763B012D243C8E0EEF2D22AD03B7E9D10DC8411A1B876EFBC14135F11E8C57B25D13CE0B178D06AF6058C7D2EE0CA9D","orcidId":"0000-0003-0509-2285","documentHash":"04d3b794-fa7c-4406-83e8-01e29ee3f938"},{"objectId":"5e70925d878c28a04739465a","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Karczewski","uuid":"23A4EB65C4378C77E40A609F60C35A89B3EC792C0B01214514A4B7DA807B2F9F4052E69821174B554C88504EA1BA483F8285440627476C8D98B71A53A6333FF6","orcidId":"0000-0001-9322-7842","documentHash":"95dbab74-c7d1-4966-aff9-2ae217562c95"},{"objectId":"5e709239878c28a047391eb1","name":"Adam","lastName":"Cenian","uuid":"5516090A5BB91A474CCA33816764D04C3F2CF5E33EFD6CF69BF60AF32496D1D71DD127A03886B46CF8F57AD70999BE70502D5D233EFBD6D761B16638C5B5ED26","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"000b94b6-e14b-4d2e-9981-5adc75c3b111"}],"doi":"10.1002/jbm.b.34946"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Assessment of the effectiveness of liquid hot water and steam explosion pretreatments of fast-growing poplar (Populus trichocarpa) wood","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479ade","mniswId":"20340","title":"Wood Science and Technology","doi":null,"issn":"0043-7719","eissn":"1432-5225","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"4b06f617-076c-49db-9bcd-276bf67b87ad"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61c209512467f0370f1b8e7c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923d878c28a0473923e5","5e709463878c28a0473bc070","5e709463878c28a0473bc06f","5e70923d878c28a0473923d6"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, the influence of physicochemical pretreatment methods on the chemical composition, enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency and porosity of fast-growing Populus trichocarpa wood was compared. Among the pretreatment methods, the liquid hot water (LHW) and steam explosion (SE) were used, which were performed at three different temperatures (160 °C, 175 °C and 190 °C) and two residence times (15 min and 1 h). The chemical composition, enzymatic hydrolysis and porosity analysis were done for native wood and solid fraction obtained after LHW and SE pretreatments. The porosity analysis was performed by inverse size exclusion chromatography method. Additionally, inhibitors of hydrolysis and fermentation processes in the liquid and solid fractions obtained after pretreatments were examined. Based on the results, it was found that the tested pretreatments caused the greatest changes in the chemical content of hemicelluloses. It was found that after LHW and SE pretreatments up to 99.1% or 94.0%, respectively, of hemicelluloses were removed from the obtained solid fraction. Moreover, the LHW and SE processes greatly enhanced the enzymatic digestibility of fast-growing poplar wood. The highest glucose yield was achieved after 15 min of SE pretreatment at 190 °C and was 676.4 mg/g pretreated biomass, while in the case of xylose the highest value (119.3 mg/g pretreated biomass) was obtained after 15 min of LHW pretreatment at 160 °C. Generally, after SE pretreatment process, more inhibitors were formed, and a greater effect of porous structure development was noticed than after LHW pretreatment. Despite this difference, the average glucose contents and yields after enzymatic hydrolysis of pretreated biomass were generally similar regardless of the pretreatment used."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057593516","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"56","pagesFromTo":"87-109","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00226-021-01350-1.pdf.","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709463878c28a0473bc070","name":"Jan","lastName":"Szadkowski","uuid":"E1E098CA680A2FAAEDC3483328F756E95FA0B992329DED82F2E1EA4059AF2E480BC9584874697E0F64D08118403D20EF925A5870D9854A1C6C130BF20E2C74C1","orcidId":"0000-0002-3884-7392","documentHash":"aea12fef-4314-44c9-b304-79b6f23df4ce"},{"objectId":"5e709463878c28a0473bc06f","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Szadkowska","uuid":"CF1D61E2E2670335C4EDBE93CD00BAC9EF6EE3F86A4F08D77124D6E76570944E8540D1213BE141AE643C5B59436D26555B728D64C6066183CD28954D828153AE","orcidId":"0000-0002-7993-4038","documentHash":"b0d0dc2d-7e5a-4b4f-9d7a-abd55f75c044"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923e5","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Antczak","uuid":"22247C0EE9C75354227A44640A454DC1BE1630DA3EEA3057A332A29B577ACFF07363199C570288572C6A40A9741A8C2147309B7BD360AE292DDF838F286BEF14","orcidId":"0000-0003-1876-3519","documentHash":"06bd17d7-6809-4bd5-a253-dd8e01f5ce9b"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923d6","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Zawadzki","uuid":"52AE2BF4EEE60B448B23B74500D8DE25D0763CCDBE8A0A48E7977812A75DA12BC5A6E0677D285B9805F3EAA80B1CEBB2D9CCD5981CD0ED576608C6B9FAC10F8D","orcidId":"0000-0003-1431-4388","documentHash":"174903d3-4dc8-41d0-a4bb-52228a14bb35"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00226-021-01350-1"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-8286-003-0","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet

The obtained results prove that the proximity of an obstacle affects the sound’s fundamental frequency, as the airflow speed coming out of the flue pipe’s mouth changes. The relationship between the airflow speed, the value of the Reynolds number, and the Strouhal number was also established. The thesis of the influence of the proximity of an obstacle on the fundamental frequency of the sound of a flue pipe was generalized, and formulas for calculating the untuning of the sound of the pipe were presented for various types of mouth.

The overall aim of our study was to determine the clinical and functional significance of two B-cell regulators, BACH2 and BCL6, in CLL. The results showed that CLL patients expressing low levels of BACH2 and BCL6 RNA had a shorter overall survival (OS). Their low RNA expression was associated with a shorter overall survival of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region-mutated (IGHV-M) CLL patients, as well as those with 11q and 13q deletions. Further, co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry studies from MEC-1 CLL cells showed no direct interaction between BACH2 and BCL6, but shared protein networks that are involved in ubiquitination mediated B-cell receptor functions, nucleic acid metabolism, protein degradation, and homeostasis in CLL biology. Taken together, this study reports BACH2 as a potential prognosticator and indicates the protein networks influenced by BCL6 and BACH2 in CLL. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a heterogeneous disease with a highly variable clinical outcome. There are well-established CLL prognostic biomarkers that have transformed treatment and improved the understanding of CLL biology. Here, we have studied the clinical significance of two crucial B cell regulators, BACH2 (BTB and CNC homology 1, basic leucine zipper transcription factor 2) and BCL6 (B-cell CLL/lymphoma 6), in a cohort of 102 CLL patients and determined the protein interaction networks that they participate in using MEC-1 CLL cells. We observed that CLL patients expressing low levels of BCL6 and BACH2 RNA had significantly shorter overall survival (OS) than high BCL6- and BACH2-expressing cases. Notably, their low expression specifically decreased the OS of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region-mutated (IGHV-M) CLL patients, as well as those with 11q and 13q deletions. Similar to the RNA data, a low BACH2 protein expression was associated with a significantly shorter OS than a high expression. There was no direct interaction observed between BACH2 and BCL6 in MEC-1 CLL cells, but they shared protein networks that included fifty different proteins. Interestingly, a prognostic index (PI) model that we generated, using integrative risk score values of BACH2 RNA expression, age, and 17p deletion status, predicted patient outcomes in our cohort. Taken together, these data have shown for the first time a possible prognostic role for BACH2 in CLL and have revealed protein interaction networks shared by BCL6 and BACH2, indicating a significant role for BACH2 and BCL6 in key cellular processes, including ubiquitination mediated B-cell receptor functions, nucleic acid metabolism, protein degradation, and homeostasis in CLL biology."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057607059","journalIssue":{"objectId":"621cabd62467f05c960e7498","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"9302f93f-ffcd-46d9-a870-05a87a4d71ae"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"23","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/14/1/23","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61c2ecd42467f0575321c65f","name":"Jeyanthy","lastName":"Eswaran","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0dc6c38f-e3c0-40b4-9ee1-ece33409d5a0"},{"objectId":"61c2ecd42467f0575321c65e","name":"Meera","lastName":"Soundararajan","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4687-0151","documentHash":"2909e196-848c-41be-b0bb-86e5c02ea9f6"},{"objectId":"61c2ecd42467f0575321c65d","name":"Christine

This problem is of a crucial importance because as a numerous studies show, it is difficult to give an unambiguous answer to the question of whether there is a relationship between GDP and energy production and what direction it takes if it exists, i.e., whether energy production drives GDP growth or GDP growth drives energy production. The research conducted by the authors used data on hourly power production in MWh/h averaged over a whole day, which were converted into total quarterly production. The data were divided in terms of the type of energy into conventional, renewable, other and total. Next, the correlation coefficient was calculated for proper data sets in order to determine whether there was a correlation between the variables. The main conclusion from the study is the fact that a correlation measured with the Pearson correlation coefficient is not reflected in the data. Changes in power production independent of the source of power do not influence the GDP directly. Naturally, in some countries, the connection between power production and GDP was stronger; however, comparing this to the rest of the researched countries, where correlation was low or even extremely low, it can be seen that the relationship is random. This study should be seen as an introductory one with a perspective of broadening research in terms of causality between variables, which, nowadays, has great application in terms of climate change and sustainable development."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057617387","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61c2dfca2467f057531dd187","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"35d7af3b-28f3-4dc0-94a1-73c4071fb0ad"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"50","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/1/50/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b8262","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Szewczyk","uuid":"22FD2932B3BDFCA69A22F7EFF9C5B5800C4758EB481D445F669507548BB15281E4E87FC27B4BBCEEF61B840087C9CBFF94E3559E1B919C89132B848411DD16B8","orcidId":"0000-0001-9313-0717","documentHash":"62432722-ed2c-46e2-b7a3-566c82775ba6"},{"objectId":"5e7092da878c28a04739e243","name":"Witold","lastName":"Gradoń","uuid":"59B50629E7F2200DF8C715A783646676CFBDA730549ECBBB56625C30648AA15714A063BAD9E9A951181E5A6EC4B861FBA79F36DA01A2BFF874419A7EC1A18B9C","orcidId":"0000-0001-8339-5447","documentHash":"33a77faa-e627-46c9-bce7-fe85cf352bfc"},{"objectId":"5e7092da878c28a04739e1ed","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Dąbrowski","uuid":"FC841A1F53C11A085E5E2FA62CA85FA23B87A5596A9F9CAB056B84E0D42CEB2C4FC01CE16EE35C11B2D3CE50CFCF270840A884C376DE837DFB846954D34A4D0D","orcidId":"0000-0002-9151-6138","documentHash":"558d51bc-f27f-4dc2-ac47-ac376e9c40a9"},{"objectId":"5e70927a878c28a047396754","name":"Grażyna","lastName":"Szustak","uuid":"1909A5715E7F49244AAA052857A0B2DD6DDB110914FA9CC58032C1F8023AD3BDFA71B3DE7BA0D9E124B134431AA87B3F7E27A9FC3EC5417485EAC4105E27F886","orcidId":"0000-0002-3225-7412","documentHash":"eb719ff9-08a6-4847-9d8e-df4641631685"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15010050"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Analiza widmowa Ramana","Emulsje","Podawanie leków domiejscowe","Podawanie leków wziewne"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Spray chilling","spray cooling","melt emulsification","core-shell","microemulsion","interfacial tension","PEG","long chain glycerides","Raman mapping","oral drug delivery"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Solvent-Free Fabrication of Biphasic Lipid-Based Microparticles with Tunable Structure","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceee","mniswId":"15948","title":"Pharmaceutics","doi":null,"issn":"1999-4923","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"995dc94f-1b71-4349-b0f1-31916b29d036"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-27","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61cc3c0c2467f06e5d431050","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c3878c28a04739c3b4","66017bd640970762631c996a","66017bd640970762631c996b","66017bd640970762631c996c","66017bd640970762631c996d"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>Lipid-based biphasic microparticles are generally produced by long and complex techniques based on double emulsions. In this study, spray congealing was used as a solvent-free fabrication method with improved processability to transform water-in-oil non-aqueous emulsions into spherical solid lipid-based particles with a biphasic structure (b-MPs). Emulsions were prepared by melt emulsification using different compositions of lipids (Dynasan®118 and Compritol®888 ATO), surfactants (Cetylstearyl alcohol and Span®60) and hydrophilic carriers (PEGs, Gelucire®48/16 and Poloxamer 188). First, pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed to identify the area corresponding to each emulsion type (coarse emulsion or microemulsion). The hydrophobicity of the lipid mostly affected the interfacial tension, and thus the microstructure of the emulsion. Emulsions were then processed by spray congealing and the obtained b-MPs were characterized in terms of thermal and chemical properties (by DSC and FT-IR), external and internal morphology (by SEM, CLSM and Raman mapping). Solid free-flowing spherical particles (main size range 200–355 µm) with different architectures were successfully produced: microemulsions led to the formation of particles with a homogeneous internal structure, while coarse emulsions generated “multicores-shell” particles consisting of variable size hydrophilic cores evenly distributed within the crystalline lipid phase.

art is typically studied in terms of its aesthetic or historical value.

The analysis reveals, for the first time, the sequence of the artists’ work, from the initial preparation of the wall surface to the master sculptor's final touches. This enables a reconstruction of the ergonomic organisation of the work, distinguishing the contributions of individual hands and revealing often intangible phenomena, such as master-apprentice interactions.

Two rigorous pot experiments were conducted with two spring wheat cultivars growing on soil artificially contaminated with Zn. The experimental design included three levels of soil contamination with Zn: 0, 300 and 700 mg kg−1, and three levels of SA concentration: 0, 0.5 and 1 mM. Foliar spray of SA was applied twice at an interval of two weeks. Wheat biomass was harvested two months after plant emergence. Both cultivars showed similar biomass reduction due to Zn phytotoxicity, but differed in the accumulation and distribution of this metal in the plant. The positive effect of SA foliar application was obtained only for one of the two tested cultivars, where a reduction in the Zn translocation from the roots to the aboveground part was observed. As a consequence, the decrease in biomass caused by the toxicity of Zn was limited. A greater positive effect of SA application on wheat biomass was observed at 700 than at 300 mg kg−1 Zn in soil. The different responses of the cultivars to the SA was probably related to their different defense mechanisms against Zn stress."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057622513","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61c421832467f0264d189e80","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"f1afdd90-928f-4bf9-95eb-20b7eaeb9f2a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"60","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/1/60/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a0473990c4","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Korzeniowska","uuid":"A7F8FE7AAC3CA876134E468012C48939E653BB3A2E8BA2A1F79DD462A9877005A384A0F5A25C27374D4504C8E0BD45018740CC03C7644848891432DEE3AA5EA1","orcidId":"0000-0003-3701-9576","documentHash":"299ea3a0-09bf-47b1-b922-7f537fc91b15"},{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a0473990b2","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Stanisławska-Glubiak","uuid":"95C322C3FB3A366A018CCB8A304C119D350BA6CC27F30EE16B289BCB9F9ADE90E867624B9451E7775BFB17E3A91497C50D9D1542939C2CAE037BF4E0A050E54E","orcidId":"0000-0003-1852-6732","documentHash":"4f8a0c3b-9bbd-44d9-ae11-58b5396a764b"}],"doi":"10.3390/agronomy12010060"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df08","uid":"bkIJHJpQNKsrvtM8Wh9DD9w","uuid":"62b1bfdd-fc86-44b6-8f44-098cdc87f941","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df08","parentUuid":"62b1bfdd-fc86-44b6-8f44-098cdc87f941","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df08","rootUuid":"62b1bfdd-fc86-44b6-8f44-098cdc87f941","name":"Akademia Pożarnicza","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70941a878c28a0473b63ff","5e709368878c28a0473a8f2d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Publicly Available Data-Based Flood Risk Assessment Methodology: A Case Study for a Floodplain in Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a9a","mniswId":"20224","title":"Water (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":"2073-4441","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f45dfe6a-c51f-4cba-a665-a984d2f35671"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61cc2b9d2467f06e5d38bbd3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70941a878c28a0473b63ff","5e709368878c28a0473a8f2d"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Flood risk assessment is used to estimate the expected consequences and probability of a flood. It leads to the strengthening of resilience through appropriate preparation for an event of a specific scale. The methodology described in this paper was developed by the authors for the purposes of flood risk assessment in Poland, introduced to and applied on an actual example. It is based on simple calculations and a comparison of the results with a template. All of the data required for calculation came from freely available sources. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of the flood risk assessment methodology in improving construction safety and identifying the factors that influence its implementation. The approach presented in this article is based on implementation of the parameters of floods, describing the characteristics of the exposed area and human vulnerability, among other factors, to the national risk assessment methodology, and then using it to determine the directions of activities aimed at reducing the risk of flooding. Simultaneously, assessment of these parameters might not be related directly to flood threats, but rather to the broader approach to risk assessment, including other threats. As a result of the application of the described methodology, it was estimated that the flood risk in the studied area is catastrophic, which requires immediate decisions of people responsible for safety."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057622687","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/14/1/61","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70941a878c28a0473b63ff","name":"Adrian","lastName":"BRALEWSKI","uuid":"BF6430A7E582ECD6EDD38B7705E3751F935F127B94DDED3588FE106A57DDEF345CA8A2BEA5F9026D7082142DB11C7B4A9F5CD1AC324AE092BDE9F8B9ED682D52","orcidId":"0000-0001-9411-8736","documentHash":"d9b7f8b8-87a1-4412-b544-a5ea84ac278d"},{"objectId":"5e709368878c28a0473a8f2d","name":"Karolina","lastName":"BRALEWSKA","uuid":"E2A03B56563B6BAAA1C53DF627640F5AD8626FA9D026D4685B91D26B0579A1C1EC41516E43F22FC44B875C1AD030CCA658824BD6181392EEB320F6541DB425D7","orcidId":"0000-0003-4329-7759","documentHash":"450ffb7b-f587-4dfe-a32a-1ba9055191dc"}],"doi":"10.3390/w14010061"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","uid":"bdg5X4wp8W-4e-xI_icapqQ","uuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","parentUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","rootUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","name":"Instytut Chemii Organicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70936f878c28a0473a97ad","5e709428878c28a0473b7543","5e709315878c28a0473a2963"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Propargylation of CoQ0 through the Redox Chain Reaction","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478945","mniswId":"12131","title":"JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY","doi":null,"issn":"0022-3263","eissn":"1520-6904","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"fe61daea-68b5-4693-a183-d4b8ec3527e6"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-21","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61c369cd2467f02e36327fd4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70936f878c28a0473a97ad","5e709428878c28a0473b7543","5e709315878c28a0473a2963"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"An efficient catalytic propargylation of CoQ0 is described by employing the cooperative effect of Sc(OTf)3 and Hantzsch ester.

The mechanism of the given transformation is also discussed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057624840","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.joc.1c02685","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709428878c28a0473b7543","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Stodulski","uuid":"31C3F5EF9FE2F3B39AAC75B254AA1E3613DA3F2ED0243810934DFE55AF593B7A67C500CC076C5D708F5A4004C700BD4A226C36528C8F565E49FE6ABFE4A1B2D4","orcidId":"0000-0003-1613-8592","documentHash":"37571ab8-67bf-4963-9007-2c7f52bdee89"},{"objectId":"5e70936f878c28a0473a97ad","name":"Robert","lastName":"Pawłowski","uuid":"28D5AB360D939994639196E1BA1943DB2E0A38B8C5B657B08E65455B38AE480BA0A68150FF475D119EFE27CBCE69C346AD52D8EA780B1B5DF0162A0DDC825871","orcidId":"0000-0002-0848-0809","documentHash":"59f40f12-8172-47c7-8325-25626d38383f"},{"objectId":"5e709315878c28a0473a2963","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Młynarski","uuid":"D56357EDD51F54AAB8E0DC13E611B77404717C7EAAE2F1AB938308A2AEBE14031B79A39139906628CE1552DC1299BDD91DA3CE8B78E8F2A672345F101CE3CBC2","orcidId":"0000-0002-1794-306X","documentHash":"c0c07ddf-a687-408c-b84e-768c491c422d"}],"doi":"10.1021/acs.joc.1c02685"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Choquard equation","Fractional operators","Hartree–Fock theory","Sign-changing nonlinearities"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb3","uid":"bdcud9f5wTDoe2In0PutAaw","uuid":"96a58ef3-d4b3-4384-b9e4-4792d490536f","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb3","parentUuid":"96a58ef3-d4b3-4384-b9e4-4792d490536f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb3","rootUuid":"96a58ef3-d4b3-4384-b9e4-4792d490536f","name":"Instytut Matematyczny Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709349878c28a0473a67c4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Semirelativistic Choquard equations with singular potentials and general nonlinearities arising from Hartree–Fock theory","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c28514547904d","mniswId":"15121","title":"Nonlinear Analysis : theory, methods and applications","doi":null,"issn":"0362-546X","eissn":"1873-5215","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"5fc5b23c-0b88-4285-a7fe-3e95f6f8bfe1"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61c98ec12467f00f2d4d9a78","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61c98ec12467f00f2d4d9a7a","5e709349878c28a0473a67c4","61c98ec12467f00f2d4d9a7c"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We are interested in a general Choquard equation√−∆+m2u−mu+V(x)u−μ|x|u=(∫RNF(y,u(y))|x−y|N−αdy)f(x,u)−K(x)|u|q−2uunder suitable assumptions on the bounded potentialVand on the nonlinearityf.Our analysis extends recent results by the second and third author on the problemwithμ= 0and pure-power nonlinearityf(x,u) =|u|p−2u.

The research method was carried out on a sample of 157 industrial enterprises in the food industry. The research process was conducted with the consideration of making these decisions dependent on the strength of companies’ commitment to several strategic issues: sustainable development, innovation orientation, and the maturity of their partnership with the customer. The results of the data analysis collected during the quantitative research show a strong correlation between the level of openness of the organization of the IR 4.0 era to RES and (a) orientation towards sustainable development, (b) orientation towards intelligence, and (c) maturity of strategic partnering with customers."}],"lastRefresh":"1747057633185","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61c2dfca2467f057531dd187","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"35d7af3b-28f3-4dc0-94a1-73c4071fb0ad"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"180","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/1/180","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"673709cafdbe832d85ae9668","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Wiśniewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f94a4d61-117f-492f-b474-22729db793db"},{"objectId":"673709cafdbe832d85ae9667","name":"Paula","lastName":"Pypłacz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6d95b21a-6600-4546-b97e-a59ef7586ea8"},{"objectId":"673709cafdbe832d85ae9666","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Liczmańska-Kopcewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"115a89e6-39ec-4238-bc99-94c125e59252"},{"objectId":"5e709333878c28a0473a4cf0","name":"Anna","lastName":"Adamik","uuid":"34E3D9FB79944B164E6667D4C435C64D65AE8D450D91CF9080D5C09CEF6C08D8183C9B7B04A9C7F604284EA6FB3FCEA874017E29EF57E14D6F66949B0C51A4CC","orcidId":"0000-0002-6007-5675","documentHash":"0fa15c43-64b0-4f38-9be6-3b2921173402"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15010180"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-200-6579-4","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"ChemSex : ujęcie wielodyscyplinarne.","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":232,"publicationPlace":"Warszawa","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61c40ad32467f0370f8e8561","editors":[{"objectId":"657c785a4097076c14ab4ce4","name":"Agata","lastName":"Stola","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"729e1447-5fcb-4609-8301-00d3909c6238"},{"objectId":"657c785a4097076c14ab4ce3","name":"Robert","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1671a653-34ee-470e-9a50-ffe647694a5a"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["657c785a4097076c14ab4ce3","657c785a4097076c14ab4ce4"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747057633352","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb934","mniswId":"69000","name":"Wydawnictwo Lekarskie PZWL","documentHash":"c1cef3b3-3c79-43fc-af3e-55bfa41c131a"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://katalogi.bn.org.pl/discovery/search?query=isbn,exact,9788320065794&tab=LibraryCatalog&search_scope=NLOP_IZ_NZ&vid=48OMNIS_NLOP:48OMNIS_NLOP&lang=pl&offset=0","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":"10.53270/2021.032"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["principal strain","abdominal wall","photogrammetry","intraabdominal pressure","in vivo measurement","deformation","peritoneal dialysis","strain field","hernia"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A novel in vivo approach to assess strains of the human abdominal wall under known intraabdominal pressure","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478b56","mniswId":"12965","title":"Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1751-6161","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"ec22ff47-3de2-4794-95e2-5dbdde43174c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-07-07","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61c3bff22467f0370f8a2b68","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66c7b3fafdbe8327373feef5","66c7b3fafdbe8327373feef6","66c7b3fafdbe8327373feef7","66c7b3fafdbe8327373feef8","5e70937a878c28a0473aaac3","5e70937b878c28a0473aabfe","66c7b3fafdbe8327373feef9"]},"issue":"art.
