The results show that the highest yield of biocrude could be achieved at 5 wt% BC, 15 wt% KOH/BC, and 5 wt% H2SO4/BC catalysts under used conditions, which could reach 17.84 wt%, 16.99 wt%, and 18.00 wt%, respectively. They were all higher than that of the non-catalytic condition (16.86 wt%). H2SO4/BC gave the greatest boost to the biocrude yield (18.00 wt%) and the highest energy recovery (ER up to 51.15% at 5 wt% loading), 8.85% higher than the energy recovery without catalyst (42.30%).

We discuss enhanced tropospheric delay models for SLR based on numerical weather models with empirical corrections, which improve the consistency between space geodetic parameters derived using different techniques, such as SLR, GNSS, and Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI).

Although most of the countries that were part of the former Soviet bloc are now members of the NATO or of the European Union, and the democratic system in these areas seems to be a solid one, the last ten years have indicated a declining trust of the citizens in political institutions and a degradation of political systems which keeps generating vocal manifestations of populism and Euroscepticism. The end of the 1990s marked the final shift towards democracy, with the accession of the first states to NATO and the beginning of accession negotiations with the European Union. The process of consolidating democracies seemed to be an irreversible one, and steps towards respect for human rights, freedom of expression, and the development of economies that functioned according to the rules of the free market gave hope for a very fast path to reduce the gaps in relation to Western democracies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488288","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5e70f75d46e0fb0001b33010","mniswId":null,"name":"Lexington Books","documentHash":"c04be743-7085-44bb-925c-a151245ebd73"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781666953794/Post-communism-Democracy-and-Illiberalism-in-Central-and-Eastern-Europe-after-the-fall-of-the-Soviet-Union","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["artificial intelligence","computational mechanics","computer simulations","finite element method","heat conduction","inverse problems","swarm algorithms"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Analyzing the Impact of Population Size in AI-Based Reconstruction of the Thermal Parameter in Heat Conduction Modeling","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479bc1","mniswId":"540","title":"Advances in Science and Technology-Research Journal","doi":null,"issn":"2080-4075","eissn":"2299-8624","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d231421f-b42b-42c2-879b-aa7186856cf8"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"FEBRUARY","releaseDateYear":2024,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eee02140970749973d81a2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5fc8de14085dcb7999c2eb99","5e709200878c28a04738e737","5e709200878c28a04738e70c","65eee02140970749973d81a3"]},"issue":"Iss.2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The research shows how to use swarming algorithms to rebuild the heat transfer coefficient, especially in regard to the continuous border condition. The authors utilized their application software to do numerical computations, employing classical variants of swarm algorithms. The numerical calculations employed a functional determining error to assess the accuracy of the estimated result. The functional minimization was conducted with the swarm algorithms (especially ABC and ACO). The geometry analyzed in this study consisted of a square shape referred to as the cast, enclosed within another square shape known as the casting mold. These two squares were separated by a layer facilitating heat conduction, characterized by the coefficient κ. The coefficient of the thermally conductive layer was recalibrated utilizing swarm methods within the range of 900 - 1500 [W/m^2K] and subsequently compared to a predetermined reference value. A finite element mesh consisting of 576 nodes was used for the calculations. The study involved simulations with populations of 5, 10, 15, and 20 individuals. Furthermore, each scenario also took into account noise of 0%, 2%, and 5% of the reference values. Results make evident the reconstructed value of the κ coefficient, cooling curves, and temperatures for the ABC and ACO algorithms are physically correct. The consequences indicate a notable level of satisfaction and strong concurrence with the anticipated of the κ parameter values. The results from the numerical simulations demonstrate considerable promise for applying artificial intelligence algorithms in optimizing production processes, analyzing data, and facilitating data-driven decision-making."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488291","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.18","pagesFromTo":"brak","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.astrj.com/Analyzing-the-impact-of-population-size-in-AI-based-reconstruction-of-the-thermal,185298,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eee02140970749973d81a3","name":"Michał","lastName":"KOWALKOWSKI","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fa870be6-2b30-4767-af0b-1614b09183d6"},{"objectId":"5fc8de14085dcb7999c2eb99","name":"Maria","lastName":"Zych","uuid":"227DA8521D04853CD008A232FEC9D4800C3DC8D2699084DB202E244CFE20C59B24D70D0D09F9F2EA10BB0D7A4D73C09C898E0369F49870605C697D920C22CA1A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c62913b5-07a3-417c-985a-f5717810ac43"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e737","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Gawrońska","uuid":"460C840E891E8EEE7181499CD109D35094ABC656E93B442CB1672889104EA283FF7EFB07A15C897462DF2E851B552AD7710382255C474418592D3F41A9DF772B","orcidId":"0000-0003-1060-3641","documentHash":"fc929342-362e-46de-98bc-fa340cb37000"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e70c","name":"Robert","lastName":"Dyja","uuid":"A3163A74E24C8B67A9825623ADA078C5F350E0002C2F52AEA44828D9B58046048895D1AB3C2AD67D588E7BD998E91E4114943C3759851D2B437026B7EF60F57B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6941-4728","documentHash":"e99440af-e85b-429f-ac18-1ffcb72c8d0b"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Koszykówka","Wyniki sportowe","Sprawność fizyczna","Trening sportowy","Gry sportowe","Bazy danych"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Basketball","Athletic performance","Physical fitness","Sports training","Drill-based games","Systematic review"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","uid":"bqEBivGW4eOgmsFFDSCuw-g","uuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","parentUuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","rootUuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego i Sportu im.

To achieve this, we conducted a literature search on PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science, adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. From the initial 626 studies retrieved, five were considered eligible for the current study. Among the five included articles, four conducted comparisons between the effects of SSGs and running-based high-intensity interval training. Regarding this, the four studies revealed a significant improvement in the final velocity during the 30–15 Intermittent Fitness Test, ranging from 4.07% to 7.29% following SSG-based interventions. This improvement was not significantly different from the comparator group. Additionally, two studies indicated that the SSGs group showed a significant advantage in change-of-direction time, with improvements ranging from −2.11% to 6.69% after interventions, and these results were not significantly different from the comparator group. However, the effects on repeated sprint ability yielded contradictory findings; two studies reported significant improvements ranging from −5.00% to −2.16%, while two others did not show significant effects following SSGs-based interventions. Similarly, in the linear sprint, the results of SSGs-based interventions were inconsistent. In summary, based on the available research, it can be concluded that SSG-based training is effective in significantly enhancing aerobic performance and change of direction, comparable to alternative approaches. However, the effects on repeated sprint ability and sprint performance are not consistently demonstrated."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488294","journalIssue":{"objectId":"659fe76f40970707a12f7244","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"107","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"4a551bd5-214d-49a1-9810-d625441552ca"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"107","pagesFromTo":"1-23","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00368504241231657","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e9af08409707132d32fae8","name":"Rui Miguel","lastName":"Silva","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4748ebf1-e6e7-4918-98bd-ec33c03056e5"},{"objectId":"65e9af08409707132d32fae7","name":"YongXing","lastName":"Zhao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"af138798-bbf0-469e-8f70-1b5ce734a340"},{"objectId":"65e9af08409707132d32fae6","name":"Hugo","lastName":"Sarmento","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d61ddc66-492e-4e18-918b-689378252cef"},{"objectId":"65e9af08409707132d32fae5","name":"Qi","lastName":"Xu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b0305cf0-c1fc-4879-a1b4-821ab1d7c13e"},{"objectId":"65e9af08409707132d32fae4","name":"Tingyu","lastName":"Li","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"11b2072e-cbe6-4fa9-b5ff-c7d7eb057746"},{"objectId":"65af32ba40e3ff6b129fa20b","name":"Filipe","lastName":"Batista Clemente","uuid":"856B05A23E2ADB59468DF33FE6FE1E022CD0BF8F631FB752209FA870B45CB94FC0754809C07C74A89D18A5F838B1F82ECA562F86586F1052CCF20EF750503D37","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f2917418-6f97-4b48-b889-e98a78531615"}],"doi":"10.1177/00368504241231657"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19","unrealistic optimism","reflective emotions","automatic emotions"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df20","uid":"bMvn9i-Wb4qNqQKvtk7hgiw","uuid":"c6e84f2a-bbff-4e0b-8fd5-dc507baff821","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Psychologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093cc878c28a0473b0f28","61cbd6397523401fc10d7909","65eeecbf40970749973e99b1","602e55c29543c7410626f11a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Anyone but Me: Unrealistic Optimism, Emotions and Anxiety in the Face of COVID-19 Pandemic","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","doi":null,"issn":"1661-7827","eissn":"1660-4601","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e236e16e-7430-4ac3-800c-033637860e22"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eeecbf40970749973e99b0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["61cbd6397523401fc10d7909","602e55c29543c7410626f11a","65eeecbf40970749973e99b1","5e7093cc878c28a0473b0f28"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The worldwide COVID-19 pandemic (and its consequences, such as lockdown and public health regimes) was a novel and stressful situation for most of people, and, as such, it significantly affected both cognitive and emotional functioning of individuals. In our study, we explored unrealistic optimism bias (the cognitive error giving people a feeling of invulnerability) and any declared preventive behaviours undertaken in order to minimise the risk of contagion. We also measured twelve specific emotions (differing in valence and origin) and the feeling of the anxiety caused by the coronavirus. The results allowed us to confirm the occurrence of unrealistic optimism bias (being significantly stronger for men than women), which correlated negatively with the declared number of preventive behaviours. Unrealistic optimism was also positively correlated with negative automatic emotions and negatively correlated with positive reflective emotions. We created models accounting for the variance of general anxiety, finding significant predictors for both separate groups of younger and older adults (negative emotions, both automatic and reflective; and preventive behaviours). However, there was an effect of positive emotions (both automatic and reflective) having a protective role from the feeling of general anxiety, which was significant for the older group only. Our findings may be a valuable cue for coping with crisis situations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488296","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63b293944097074fedfc4938","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"20","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"c8688a7e-6094-443c-9941-d306b57a88a6"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"20","pagesFromTo":"301","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/1/301","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eeecbf40970749973e99b1","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Warkocka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3eb5efd7-11ab-40b9-bd09-b10e810670eb"},{"objectId":"61cbd6397523401fc10d7909","name":"Adrianna","lastName":"Wielgopolan","uuid":"BC7D826D87BCABF1DE9E89FE8BF0687879F70094B7A78D63B6B3FEE6C85CCB87B621547BA7CFE650F98FDCC1F4EBD6B7E57AB728854329515A8BF1D5E25C221E","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f062fd3e-7f21-491b-a66c-c21373abac2a"},{"objectId":"602e55c29543c7410626f11a","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Pastwa","uuid":"A1649BD73A876F979504955E0940BCAD58D8E38891589574243D9D5ABA68AB958103230A58AD018B60B6CB8FAF7ECBE6FD4C5A79C5E82B02923FDCFF4072F5B1","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fcac50c6-f1bc-4518-bc39-eeeafd352dbb"},{"objectId":"5e7093cc878c28a0473b0f28","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Imbir","uuid":"50824B89AE0A4AEEC34DD1BCA98E9153361BFBDD3F802CE6608D1A9016DE7FA52C1F8D3C0E5E5A3BDEF404C846F332DBE15E0C4F0BC97274D7BE6674E7AE196F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3630-5602","documentHash":"7bbbce95-4a14-4148-8886-580c659f3830"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph20010301"},{"mainLanguageName":"turecki","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6554c9bd4097076913ea6322","doi":null,"title":"Uluslar

study aims to present Paweł Ciompa’s (1867–1913) econometric theory of bookkeeping, associated with the banking sector and vocational education in Galicia, a territory seized by Austria as a result of the partition of Poland. Ciompa presented his theory of bookkeeping in Polish in the work Zarys ekonometryi i teorya buchalterii [An outline of econometrics and the theory of bookkeeping] and in German in Grundrisse einer Oeconometrie und die auf Nationalökonomie aufgebaute Natürliche Theorie der Buchhaltung [An outline of econometrics and the development of a natural theory of bookkeeping based on economics]. Both were published in Lviv in 1910. The concept presented in these works constitutes an original econometric and geometric approach to the description of economic phenomena. It has a didactic value despite the fact that it has not found many followers, and accounting historians find it difficult to place it unambiguously in the research trends of the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488299","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"370-392","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/6GSNSBSQZCGRK93SRTAT/full","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709245878c28a047392cf3","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Sojak","uuid":"F8FD2AB335B8EC1AF99A1A536FDBBD5D198DB711E42521BB5D28C46297DBCF7D231893D8DD71E2CC2AF2245600E885A446AD9B0BB6AC5BC7826E308A3DF0E98E","orcidId":"0000-0001-6477-5030","documentHash":"2ca41446-3ddf-4385-a71a-9075bc130a50"}],"doi":"10.1177/10323732221088336"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["stan

In order to accurately identify the surface defects of lithium battery, a novel defect detection approach is proposed based on improved K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Euclidean clustering segmentation. Firstly, an improved voxel density strategy for KNN is proposed to speed up the effect for point filtering. Then, the improved clustering segmentation strategy is applied to distinguish point clouds with defect features. The outline fitting algorithm based on the least square method is applied to determine geometric features of each surface defect which are used to classify defect types. Furthermore, experimental results show that the proposed surface defect detection method reaches 99.2% accuracy and 35.3-ms average time consumption for data processing. Finally, an industrial application example of lithium battery production is demonstrated, which meets the requirements of industrial application. All these reports exhibited that the industrial visual inspection system with rapid measurement is an effective method and guarantees for accelerating industrial production and manufacturing in the future."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488310","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65ead1bf409707216ed8e8bf","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"127","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"e7073606-4c5f-4247-a8fd-5e0fc14c1496"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"127","pagesFromTo":"971-985","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00170-023-11507-w","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eae8d640970762632bc726","name":"Darius","lastName":"Andriukaitis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0f530fbd-3df5-4591-a2ff-165bb290d557"},{"objectId":"65eae8d640970762632bc725","name":"Xiaoqiang","lastName":"Guo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"53b9142d-a78a-4ae1-b27b-f852e62055bb"},{"objectId":"65eae8d640970762632bc724","name":"Lequn","lastName":"Wu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"69c3a54a-1f5b-4db7-b32d-73ccef67eef0"},{"objectId":"65eae8d640970762632bc723","name":"Xinhua","lastName":"Liu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"abe37d28-0169-457e-adfd-b7c9c2d0dfbd"},{"objectId":"643a0c2840e3ff4630cec040","name":"ZHIXIONG","lastName":"LI","uuid":"702756DCCCD3492C7F8BEE876ECFF5320F12A813CAE78A9EF23A2EFD6E44E8974DA4C0167114F64ABED373F069177BE3B59258C22EAA67DBD18E6C027CAFAFBA","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"59b058ba-526e-4828-8f00-3046d9f8887c"},{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae592","name":"GRZEGORZ","lastName":"KRÓLCZYK","uuid":"CBFCAB23248F107BE0869A0A1B95424418771F3BF1C3230726107C2E5AFCDAD7015626B297AF4BA3889E7234B4F73D33C256E065E8A33D085071A5B816F9E9BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2967-1719","documentHash":"983b593f-a262-4fbd-83c5-754137e069b1"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00170-023-11507-w"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"652692db4097075dd4eb06d0","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-37608-5","title":"War

paper aims to answer whether firms of different sizes and stock liquidities differ in the choice of external sources of financing in companies listed in CEE countries. To this end the net debt issuance is regressed on the financial deficit. In regressions Pecking Order Coefficients are allowed to vary across firms with different sizes and stock liquidities. The results indicate that companies with less liquid shares prefer issuing debt to cover financial deficits more than companies with more liquid shares. This implies that stock liquidity may substitute debt issuance in alleviating the adverse effects of information asymmetry, especially in relatively small com-panies. This is the first study in which the relationship be-tween liquidity and debt-equity choice is considered solely from a    pecking order theory point of view. Also this is the first study in which stock liquidity effects on capital struc-ture are studied in the CEE countries. Research results may point to the advantages of increasing the liquidity of shares which may contribute to reducing information asymmetry and thus a better allocation of resources."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488317","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"9","pagesFromTo":"115-136","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.ue.poznan.pl/ebr/article/view/800","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a047398768","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Stereńczak","uuid":"C0666524129239EC37EA9288DC103C325A151EB5369D0ECB5E6AC3EF305167C336594FF88115C8B44279B5CB95314E4B46E4E064677FC393C66C3F2308995F15","orcidId":"0000-0003-4825-3229","documentHash":"89bbaf44-bc24-463a-b412-df14ce6b980a"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393aaf","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Kubiak","uuid":"9B3DC7A48A99197364D17F41392E0E80A858A6D70648A81852379A4E42EF0840B7F7EB353D0BE3C267513363574C479D12CD062C72BF5DB85CCEB42A7EC3FDCC","orcidId":"0000-0001-6479-7811","documentHash":"faa0ffec-5e7d-4fb0-99ca-5e61a0cd641c"}],"doi":"10.18559/ebr.2023.3.800"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["digested pulp","agricultural biogas plant","solid particle characteristics","methodology for rheological parameters"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a64c0","5e709392878c28a0473ad1b7","5e709347878c28a0473a63b3","5e709346878c28a0473a634d","5e709346878c28a0473a62d2","5e709345878c28a0473a6249","5e709346878c28a0473a6370"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Preparation of Samples for the Study of Rheological Parameters of Digested Pulps in a Bioreactor of an Agricultural Biogas Plant","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1073","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-02-19","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eef78b4097076263b97d13","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a56","5e709346878c28a0473a62d2","5e709346878c28a0473a6370","5e709347878c28a0473a64c0","5e709347878c28a0473a63b3","5e709346878c28a0473a634d","5e709345878c28a0473a6249","5e709392878c28a0473ad1b7"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The studies of the rheology of digested pulp from agricultural biogas plants have often been fragmentary and non-standardised due to their complexity and time-consuming nature. As a result of measurements, it was possible to develop a procedure and range of measurements for the correct determination of the parameters of the carrier substance. The applicability of the coaxial cylinder measurement system was demonstrated for assessing the rheological parameters of digested pulp from a fermenter that utilises agricultural biomass. To determine the characteristics of solid particles, the Zingg diagram was used, inter alia, allowing the comparison of particles from each fraction. The analysis of the shape and size of solid particles may help to describe the onset of motion of this phase, flow type, or sedimentation type. The authors propose a completely new research approach to obtain an appropriate, repeatable test conditions of medium, which is the carrier liquid from the biogas plant reactor. The proposed methodology and the scenario of the entire study make it possible to achieve scalable and comparable test results in any laboratory. The proposed solution eliminates the influence of most external factors on the sample and rheological measurements, and the effectiveness of the presented procedure was confirmed in tests."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488321","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"1-24","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/4/965","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a56","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Gruszczyński","uuid":"109E4D34BAEAFBEC44D9EE6F50B2505B15C8B81C6CF911E23B070A1EE6BF51A9F48328261707F658171C37053B50B8464DD1FA4E2ED6CEF2A35899BA07196D57","orcidId":"0000-0003-3663-2723","documentHash":"65fb4d2f-0d43-4cbc-9549-4419eaa730c2"},{"objectId":"5e709392878c28a0473ad1b7","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Czekała","uuid":"E24B0EF79ADE746A5CDDF6C627931C54362882CA58696B25E667825B581A8472B1B9EB2AC9975882E18DB48CAD3A93377621CD009D0AF0A5502427954A88D153","orcidId":"0000-0002-7750-9265","documentHash":"ec1eb463-dec3-4790-81d5-66546e6b6632"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a64c0","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Zawadzki","uuid":"7B68E2E628BCCCF394F6CF46C87DF06393F4B850DD84B292D48D58666703F84A77D1EC83742FC3BD5DA6AC75BFCC2B9FBDB6276227EC7A054784493D14B99665","orcidId":"0000-0002-5425-4669","documentHash":"7aad45de-b1fb-4753-895d-277e182ab65c"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a63b3","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Pawlak","uuid":"BDFE86FC334A033D0DCC60C36446DA094F0E7089B865113822E49BA7EE23FF603D3CB1BF3CEC87D2D0B1EB6FE6D6E8F970506F2E5FA9F4C452B1271E976B1B0D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7714-9749","documentHash":"d5bda11d-b49d-4cff-989c-d5cf150f6740"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a6370","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Mazurkiewicz","uuid":"D25538007E2A80705BB9185B8066E6774887A6FFE9C26C4310AD8419A4F1D7DB254D38B4E37DF53A1422383122DA78840AD8CE6DB8B0CA988109758E2ABBB4B7","orcidId":"0000-0002-7560-4779","documentHash":"47d20e51-3b9f-42da-8dbc-fce6383cc810"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a634d","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Matz","uuid":"E41800C8F84FA99C9C271DAB0C5E6DD451755AABED2505B79BC72D07977A23AE62F2B7A34EA003908F02A0B6EACEED17FF9B27C16937137B5233150E5995ADEA","orcidId":"0000-0002-6602-2603","documentHash":"a601917a-3f6f-4f45-8fa4-2617b3e1b25d"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62d2","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kałuża","uuid":"4A0D3A0D39E1E57E48CBD173E26AC208D8CF301661ACD7DD9FFBD837E58C1B3F1FFE792E1C099EF5BB036653F474CA2F29795B385C2FE510F5DAB5762889ED3B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5829-502X","documentHash":"57a13477-c7a4-4a9c-9c62-99fd120acf0f"},{"objectId":"5e709345878c28a0473a6249","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Dach","uuid":"47EE67E3109054FCF61127152B986C819D4B22095B4241BDB397F0F4B27354CFD907FC68959B66B6B94F180C5A6924A9010B45BD16B007D49E1F279279E207DD","orcidId":"0000-0002-3162-1198","documentHash":"fab69fed-be29-42d3-95a4-7f7eaed38350"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17040965"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["serwicyzacja przemysłu","chińskie ICT","przemysł europejski"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["servicification of manufacturing","Chinese ICT","European manufacturing","production fragmentation"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A New Chapter in Value Chain Connections between China and Europe: Are Advanced Services a New Area of Chinese Influence in European Manufacturing?","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c7ce","mniswId":"10851","title":"Journal of Economic Integration","doi":null,"issn":"1225-651X","eissn":"1976-5525","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"6e75184a-0b7f-4cfe-8638-7f760c4c9f4b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9568f40970762631a02a7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af8e5"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"One way to mark the presence of Chinese companies in Europe is the servicification of manufacturing with advanced services such as information and communication (ICT).

Wynika to zarówno z przyrodniczych walorów rzeki i jej doliny połączonych z miejską przestrzenią, z założeń urbanistyczno-architektonicznych, często odznaczających się unikatowymi walorami kulturowymi, jak i specyficznych funkcji miast nadrzecznych. Woda jest największą ozdobą obszarów zurbanizowanych, czynnikiem akcentującym i podnoszącym walory estetyczne krajobrazu, czynnikiem stwarzającym wyjątkowe możliwości aranżacji i ważnym elementem dziedzictwa kulturowego wielu miast. Dotyczy to także urządzeń technicznych związanych w różny sposób z wodą (mosty, nabrzeża, fontanny, wodociągi, wodne wieże ciśnień). Szczególne efekty w kształtowaniu krajobrazu miejskiego uzyskuje się przez zespolenie wody z zielenią i architekturą, m.in. wprowadzanie błękitno-zielonej infrastruktury. Rzeka kształtuje miasto, które decyduje jednocześnie o jej postrzeganiu i funkcjach. Zmieniające się wraz z upływem czasu uwarunkowania gospodarcze, polityczno-społeczne, kulturowo-cywilizacyjne i krajobrazowo-przestrzenne wyznaczają nowe relacje i kierunki rozwoju terenów położonych nad rzeką. Procesom rewitalizacji terenów nadrzecznych i ich harmonijnego włączania się w przestrzeń miasta sprzyja coraz powszechniejsza świadomość społeczna konieczności ochrony dziedzictwa przyrodniczego, kulturowego i cywilizacyjnego. Brak jest jednak przełożenia na podejmowane decyzje polityczne, gospodarcze i praktyczną skuteczność prawa. Prawo i uznanie rzeki za cenne dziedzictwo przyrodniczo-kulturowe wcale nie gwarantuje jego ochrony. Zgodnie z Ramową Dyrektywą Wodną woda nie jest produktem handlowym takim jak każdy inny, ale dziedzictwem, które musi być chronione. Obecne priorytety naszego państwa związane z gospodarką wodną są jednak jednoznacznie utylitarne. Rządowe programy, plany, polityki oraz planowane i prowadzone inwestycje hydrotechniczne w ogóle nie służą ochronie zasobów wodnych oraz zapewnieniu dostępu do czystej wody. Rzeki nie są w żadnym zakresie traktowane jako dziedzictwo przyrodniczo-kulturowe, źródło czystej wody dla ludzi oraz miejsce występowania różnych ekosystemów. To tylko szlaki transportowe, woda dla energetyki oraz odbiorniki ścieków. W miastach niezbędne są skoordynowane działania na rzecz poprawy warunków hydrologicznych, ukierunkowane zwłaszcza na procesy spowolnienia krążenia wody w krajobrazie miejskim. Problem dostępności do wody nie jest tylko problemem technicznym. To także kwestia edukacji i kultury, bowiem nie ma obecnie nadal świadomości ważności ochrony zasobów wodnych i ich znaczenia dla zachowania cywilizacji i kultury. Szczególnie niewielka jest edukacja dotycząca rzek, ich roli kulturowej i świadomości dziedzictwa. Potrzeba szerokiej edukacji dotyczącej wartości krajobrazów kulturowych, w tym krajobrazów nadrzecznych. Dotyczy to także przyczyn i skutków ich degradacji i bezmyślnego niszczenia oraz sposobów ich ochrony."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Riverside areas are considered extraordinary in all cultures, and of all places where people live, riverside cities are special. This is due to both the natural values of the river and its valley combined with urban space, urban and architectural assumptions, often characterized by unique cultural values, and the specific functions of riverside cities. Water is the greatest decoration of urbanized areas, a factor that emphasizes and enhances the aesthetic value of the landscape, a factor that creates unique arrangement possibilities and an important element of the cultural heritage of many cities. This also applies to technical devices related in various ways to water (bridges, quays, fountains, waterworks, water towers). Particular effects in shaping the urban landscape are achieved by combining water with greenery and architecture, e.g. introducing blue-green infrastructure. The river shapes the city, which at the same time determines its perception and functions. The economic, political and social, cultural and civilizational as well as landscape and spatial conditions that change over time determine new relations and directions of development of the areas located by the river. The processes of revitalization of riverside areas and their harmonious incorporation into the city space are fostered by the increasingly common social awareness of the need to protect the natural, cultural and civilizational heritage. However, there is no translation into political and economic decisions and the practical effectiveness of the law. The law and recognizing the river as a valuable natural and cultural heritage do not guarantee its protection. Under the Water Framework Directive, water is not a commercial product like any other, but a heritage that must be protected. However, the current priorities of our state related to water management are clearly utilitarian. Government programmes, plans, policies and planned and conducted hydrotechnical investments do not serve to protect water resources and ensure access to clean water. Rivers are in no way treated as a natural and cultural heritage, a source of clean water for people and a place where various ecosystems occur. These are only transport routes, a source of water for the power industry and sewage receivers. In cities, coordinated actions are necessary to improve hydrological conditions, in particular actions aimed at slowing down water circulation in the urban landscape. Green areas play a very important role in them, which is now more and more appreciated. The problem of access to water is not just a technical problem. It is also a matter of education and culture, because there is still no awareness of the importance of protecting water resources and their importance for the preservation of civilization and culture. Education concerning rivers, their cultural role and awareness of heritage is particularly low. The need for broad education on the value of cultural landscapes, including riverside landscapes. This also applies to the causes and effects of their degradation and thoughtless destruction, as well as the ways of their protection."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488324","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"131-169","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://turystykakulturowa.org/ojs/index.php/tk/article/view/1415","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e9699940970762631a1910","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kasprzak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"64d95b39-a237-4d51-a44f-d9d31f043f0e"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e20f","name":"Beata","lastName":"Raszka","uuid":"6B311A5F4A9DF1D328300B75ED3E5821366ACA32C50A4F089BFA3CE24E4E621AC6354DB20A82E69A0ED6948BA08E718332AB4C7C120F818183592C73D90A91C8","orcidId":"0000-0002-1757-2625","documentHash":"99bbb98b-7999-40a3-bdf6-2460d9e3eeac"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df1f","uid":"b0noSHIUtJa6Uw08fQ9NYJQ","uuid":"03cbc2ce-336f-4f80-872b-657ea8d2cccc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Prawa i Administracji","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709353878c28a0473a74bb"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet Warszawski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709353878c28a0473a74bb"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Rzymskie wzory dobrej legislacji","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa83c9aff2974850cd39","mniswId":"486057","title":"Palestra","doi":null,"issn":"0031-0344","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"878f701f-4548-4d08-aded-05ccbc45f03a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eed97b40970749973cca21","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709353878c28a0473a74bb"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059488326","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eed97b40970749973cca22","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"e6a2b8f7-f10c-491c-baaf-78ac824f47b4"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"133-134","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://palestra.pl/pl/czasopismo/wydanie/01-2024/artykul/rzymskie-wzory-dobrej-legislacji","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709353878c28a0473a74bb","name":"Maria","lastName":"Zabłocka","uuid":"5BE7CAC39A82FF3C062D0BB3886FB4D18988442B213F94CE0B603941614329CF3FCD17CB5AA4677AD447212CE20B1B8AF80CED94DF9B1A89206988558A01A1C3","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"216d7d39-d142-4bd0-b272-1b414bdea596"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["corporate social responsibility","ESG","sustainable development","individual investors"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Environmental aspects of investing in the Polish stock exchange market according to individual investors","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"61b9abddad204581b62eb7a4","mniswId":"29973","title":"Financial Internet Quarterly","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2719-3454","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f1519dd1-6bfb-456e-8476-70764e068464"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-01-11","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e978a040970762631b1597","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7091fd878c28a04738e377"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the article is to present and analyse the attitudes of Polish society and individual investors towards challenges of environmental protection.

Thermal comfort and personal adaptive behaviours of the 69 occupants were assessed using a questionnaire while, simultaneously, indoor environmental parameters were monitored. Perceptions of thermal comfort were then compared to those predicted from modelling. We found that many people were comfortable in warmer and more humid conditions than is assumed by national building codes, with many people opting for use of fans at set at high speeds instead. Large lots close to parks had the lowest use of air conditioners in the warm seasons, with very little air-conditioner use at other times."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488333","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"266","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778822002456/pdfft?md5=3d5b5afa571eca7fa4b5100d49a9e21f&pid=1-s2.0-S0378778822002456-main.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e9755240970762631a8b6c","name":"S.

Through informative intentions we try to make evident the content\r\nof a message to a receiver, or to make evident what we want to communicate to him/her:\r\ncommunicative intentions are used to make evident the very fact that we intend to communicate. One hypothesis is that ostensive-inferential communication is what makes human language possible. Since an extensive literature has highlighted the role of the\r\nTheory of Mind in ostensive-inferential communication, this hypothesis fits with the idea\r\nthat a mechanism for mentalizing underlies human communication. The aim of the present paper is to stress the role of lower-level mechanisms, specifically of motor simulation, in the recognition of informative and communicative intentions, in order to outline\r\nan embodied account of ostensive communication. Specifically, the hypothesis is that this\r\nprocess is involved in language acquisition during development, and that it plays a role\r\nin the associative learning process involved in language acquisition during childhood. To\r\nthis aim, in future research it may be useful to test the involvement of motor simulation\r\n(specifically, phono-articulatory and semantic) in the recognition of informative and\r\ncommunicative intentions in toddlers. Since some models of language evolution focus on\r\nthe role of motor simulation, a supplementary goal is to deepen its role in the biological\r\nevolution of language, focusing on the specific link between motor simulation and intentions in the framework of ostensive-inferential model."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488355","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://avant.edu.pl/wp-content/uploads/A-Delliponti-Motor-Simulation.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63a3cf397523402197993c62","name":"Angelo","lastName":"Delliponti","uuid":"57DF99CAE8E7DF403E446AEEE80E7486084AFCD8FE2C76B0DDDF70D79DB05F9518F5A3976EF97A7037EFDDD2C49BF8106DBE2040D10FEE494D19A9CB916AA7D7","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"446a76cd-9a38-4729-a207-d22239f8aef0"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Receiver clock parameter","Stochastic modeling","Multi-GNSS","Galileo","Kinematic PPP","Static PPP","PPP time transfer"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709437878c28a0473b83c7","6243c0a87523402df099a2e9","5e709276878c28a047396118","5e709422878c28a0473b6d76"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Stochastic modeling of the receiver clock parameter in Galileo-only and multi-GNSS PPP solutions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e6a","mniswId":"7309","title":"GPS Solutions","doi":null,"issn":"1080-5370","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e20d137e-3368-46c0-bd03-f1e42613709a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-10-27","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eaf18e40970762632c29e7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6243c0a87523402df099a2e9","5e709422878c28a0473b6d76","5e709276878c28a047396118","5e709437878c28a0473b83c7"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In Precise Point Positioning (PPP), the receiver clock parameter is typically estimated independently in each observation epoch, which increases the noise of the estimated station coordinates and troposphere parameters due to correlations. Applying stochastic modeling to the receiver clock parameter stabilizes PPP solutions and reduces clock noise for the time transfer. However, the receiver clock modeling is possible only for the GNSS receivers connected to the utmost stable atomic clocks. We propose receiver clock modeling that involves the Markov stochastic process in the form of a random walk. We test different levels of random walk constraints for GNSS stations equipped with different types of clocks for Galileo-only and multi-GNSS solutions in kinematic and static PPP. In multi-GNSS solutions, the common clock parameter is derived with inter-system biases (ISBs). This raises the question of the constraints that should be imposed on the common clock only or also on the ISBs. We found that similar results can be achieved by imposing constraints on the common clock parameter and estimating ISB as a constant parameter and when constraining the common clock parameter and ISBs with a ratio of 1:100. Other ratios of clock-to-ISB constraints, such as 1:1 and 1:10, give inferior results. In the kinematic PPP, stochastic clock modeling has a marginal impact on the North and East coordinate components, whereas the Up component is substantially improved for GNSS receivers equipped with hydrogen masers. In the static PPP, the clock modeling improves the time transfer, due to the reduced noise of the clocks."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488357","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"28","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10291-023-01556-9","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6243c0a87523402df099a2e9","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Mikoś","uuid":"833599301C84CCA086A0243C1FF8A09D9D7A5EA4A20D67E9588CEE44066BE41359B80D05A3AC4784C56560FE4366CDA1222A5241C03632263FCBCBFCB5194E3A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"63aff09f-5b5a-46fa-9edb-8b5f750e71d2"},{"objectId":"5e709437878c28a0473b83c7","name":"KRZYSZTOF","lastName":"SOŚNICA","uuid":"22D515E8674D468ED4D4CF62223E7EECD8B8352CEB0CD1836B9DDC1CE8294387C0820DC8358CDFCBC932A875FC2E9DCD5A7090797CD99D2610AC43E60CE18002","orcidId":"0000-0001-6181-1307","documentHash":"083640a6-2e12-412c-8dfb-f1627940b3cb"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6d76","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Kaźmierski","uuid":"5981482D3F990652B8C98CCB767F7CB00D1165F221C461FDB104FBEEEE02F523B3874786112BC409CBAC5C75B659F29B95675FF4431D6160E10A02F09320EAB0","orcidId":"0000-0002-7927-9416","documentHash":"0d50890e-0c0c-49e6-ac2f-ed2a712582ca"},{"objectId":"5e709276878c28a047396118","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Hadaś","uuid":"4A99594710E9040CA242D65D081A1CFAB1E0450124D124C455F0CE852629B587EFE6D179ED578B652D2E6C871CD592B7D5FAF9713E0C7FBBB3B255D494DF8FEE","orcidId":"0000-0002-4409-5078","documentHash":"4a46da2e-e663-4087-b2cc-c266df617599"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10291-023-01556-9"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"658d59d74097076c1457f851","doi":null,"title":"Władztwo komunalne w hanzeatyckich miastach Prus i Inflant w średniowieczu : studia i materiały","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-65127-85-3","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"http://www.tnt.torun.pl/pl/sprzedaz-wydawnictw/poza-seriami/wladztwo-komunalne-w-hanzeatyckich-miastach-prus-i-inflant-w-sredniowieczu-studia-i-materialy","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"d3454438-10da-4874-a194-2ccf41bba770","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb952","mniswId":"75100","name":"Wydawnictwo Towarzystwa Naukowego w Toruniu","documentHash":"39f61033-da01-4e32-bd86-7871b0a14aca"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","uid":"b_b7HPtUTCJYlxfss9Ssv-A","uuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","parentUuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","rootUuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","name":"Uniwersytet Mikołaja Kopernika w Toruniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f1a48e47523405869ccc31a"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"<I>Salutationes</I> ryskiej i rewelskiej korespondencji w XIII-XIV wieku","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e8417040970762631416b0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f1a48e47523405869ccc31a"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article discusses the usage of intitulatio and inscriptio formulas in the correspondence sent and received by two cities of medieval Livonia, Riga and Reval.

Unfortunately, waste biomass may be contaminated with toxic persistent organic pollutants, such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDF) and dioxin-like biphenyls (dl-PCB). Literature does not provide consistent measurements on how the low-temperature thermochemical processing, such as torrefaction, affects the toxicity of biomass. This contribution assesses how a torrefaction treatment, conducted at 200 °C, modifies the toxicity due to PCDD/PCDF/dl-PCB in biomass. We deploy the XDS-CALUX biotest on five types of waste biomass (sewage sludge, tree bark, cattle manure, spent coffee ground, common reed), before and after treatment. The content of total dioxin- & biphenyl fraction compounds in the raw biomass, investigated in this study, varies from 0.14 to 3.67 pg BEQ·g−1d.m., and in the torrefied biomass between 0.17 and 6.00 pg BEQ·g−1d.m.; BEQ stands for bioanalytical equivalent. This increase is statistically insignificant at p = 0.05, taking into account all types of examined biomass. This proves that low-temperature torrefaction cannot detoxify biomass, i.e., chars, produced from biomass characterized by elevated concentration of PCDD/PCDF/dl-PCB, will reflect the contamination of the feedstocks. With respect to heavy metals, we conclude that only the content of Cd in biomass, and, to a lesser extent, the abundance of Cu and Fe, modify the toxicity of this material during its thermochemical treatment at low temperature."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488362","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"351","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653524001516?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eef7914097076263b97d31","name":"Bogdan Z.

The focus is on examining how migration is used by Russia as a geopolitical tool to influence the security landscape of these regions.\nMethods:\nEmploying a case study methodology, the analysis draws upon a diverse range of data sources and scholarly literature. It scrutinises Russia's tactical approaches towards Finland and other countries situated on NATO's eastern flank, shedding light on the broader implications for regional stability and security.\nResults:\nThe findings underscore Russia's deployment of migration as a geopolitical lever, exerting significant pressure on national security frameworks. In response, Finland has strengthened its defence mechanisms and sought to enhance international cooperation to effectively counteract these challenges.\nConclusions:\nAfter joining NATO, Finland plays a key role in ensuring the security of the northern flank. Due to its location, this country is compelled to respond in real time to all possible threats that come with the direct proximity of the Russian Federation. Consequently, Finland is, in a sense, a frontline state and other countries should draw from its experience."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488365","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"54-62","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.defencesciencereview.com.pl/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094e9878c28a0473c6c0f","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kaczmarek","uuid":"34FE0625B3B9F8F3118038859ACA360B82A95B8081AFC19130D4A99F2D33BE8A9C03270164F1E7E139E2F46AB166DDF95A7977CFEBB3D4472949D65726E61E9C","orcidId":"0000-0001-8519-1667","documentHash":"f4904bc8-a975-42b0-81a3-55dba8270546"}],"doi":"10.37055/pno/186131"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65b3b0f2409707713d01af3d","doi":null,"title":"Impulsy.

by stock-level evidence of the issuance anomalies, we examine whether a similar effect drives the cross-section of country stock returns.

The quintile of markets with the highest share increase underperforms their low-issuance counterparts by 0.85 % per month.

It shows the way to becoming a translator, the first encounter with the prose of Olga Tokarczuk and further stages marked by successive translations of her texts. It is worth adding that these were not only the translation stages, but also scholarly ones. Irina Adelgejm owes her reflection on the autopsychotherapeutic potential of the word in literature to the book The Last Stories by Olga Tokarczuk, which in turn became the impetus for her to write a book of over 600 pages – Psychology of Poetics. Autopsychotherapeutic functions of a literary text (on the material of Polish prose in the years 1990–2010).\r\n\r\nIn the article the word “way” is often used because it is a metaphor for the translation process: the desire to follow the author’s footsteps, to walk carefully, step by step, word for word. In this context, the subject of experiencing the translated text, assimilating it by the awareness of even false memories, translation difficulties resulting from, among others, this profound experience of reading, but also from working with the realities, and – which is extremely important – responsibility for the translated word, and the issue of translation ethics are analysed.\r\n\r\nThe translator often remains invisible, but in the end it is he/she, not only the author, who authors the text and he/she who signs the translated content with his/her name.

We tested it on five mining tremors with magnitudes of 3.4–4.0, looking both at event detection and its kinematic characterisation. Here we show a high agreement, at the level of 1 s, between GNSS and seismic solutions for the earthquake first epoch detection. Also, we show that high-rate multi-constellation (GPS + Galileo) GNSS can reliably characterise low-magnitude shallow earthquakes in terms of induced displacements and velocities, and, including their peak values, respectively, at the level of very few millimetres and 1–2 cm/s, paving the way to the routine use of GNSS-seismology for monitoring human activities prone to cause small earthquakes and related potential damages."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488392","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-47964-2","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eaf1a440970762632c2a60","name":"Mattia","lastName":"Crespi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"69188280-249e-4f9d-85e4-71c2e690b959"},{"objectId":"65eaf1a440970762632c2a5f","name":"Marco","lastName":"Fortunato","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3c7f807d-8818-445f-9e95-cc729ee43536"},{"objectId":"65eaf1a440970762632c2a5e","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Kudłacik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7c171301-5116-4dc8-97cf-74b0a53ae090"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6d76","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Kaźmierski","uuid":"5981482D3F990652B8C98CCB767F7CB00D1165F221C461FDB104FBEEEE02F523B3874786112BC409CBAC5C75B659F29B95675FF4431D6160E10A02F09320EAB0","orcidId":"0000-0002-7927-9416","documentHash":"0d50890e-0c0c-49e6-ac2f-ed2a712582ca"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047390eed","name":"Jan","lastName":"Kapłon","uuid":"9B20B87C66ED66DFEB0A6C6B637487810B6C062099DC5B3BFD95E40B25449D4250638B33465D1C9B281739097E0F30E14DC9555B527AE4290E7340BEA4AA58DF","orcidId":"0000-0002-0068-0865","documentHash":"65f7ff27-5ca4-4a4f-8069-3218f9a813be"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-47964-2"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["tree bark","hydrophobicity","biomass","wettability","moisture","biomass combustion"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Assessment of Bark Properties from Various Tree Species in Terms of Its Hydrophobicity and Energy Suitability","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1073","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-13","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eef80e4097076263b97ffc","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["634a1b297523402e34127284","65eef80e4097076263b97ffd","5e7091fc878c28a04738e2c9"]},"issue":"18","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Wood bark is a by-product of the forestry industry with significant quantitative potential. Due to the higher heating value and hydrophobic character (dictated by the content of hydrophobic extracts in the chemical composition of the bark) facilitating long-term storage and transport, bark is considered a valuable material to be integrated into the energy industry as a substrate for combustion and co-combustion. However, the heterogeneous structure of the biomass causes significant differences in these parameters between different types of bark. For this reason, this study aimed to analyze the energy usefulness and hydrophobicity of 14 species of bark occurring in large amounts across Europe. Bark’s higher heating value has been shown to range from 17.239 MJ·kg−1 ± 0.318 MJ·kg−1 to 21.618 MJ·kg−1 ± 0.375 MJ·kg−1, and most species are extremely hydrophobic in the WDPT (water drop penetration time; 70–10,495 s) and MED (molarity ethanol droplet; 8.5–24%) tests. Nevertheless, the statistically significant differences between the species in the hydrophobicity tests indicate that the storage of individual types of bark should be adapted to the species and preceded by an analysis of its hydrophobicity. It was also shown that the WDPT test seems to be more suitable for the analysis of highly hydrophobic biomasses, due to the possibility of better differentiation of the level of hydrophobicity between species showing the same degree of hydrophobicity. In addition, the best type of bark that could be implemented in the power industry from the point of view of hydrophobicity and combustion characteristics was Silver Birch bark."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488395","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"1-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/18/6586","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eef80e4097076263b97ffd","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Sabat","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"727f26d9-f979-41f2-9215-a34e4f244e77"},{"objectId":"634a1b297523402e34127284","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Sobol","uuid":"1B126E6CEBBF4A38097C6728597F44F1983BEDC25D352257D130192BE9285D17D9CAE30078C34867F2C3232301D23766727D3ED24DD9F30DF93BD68A4EECAFCC","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a00fc696-6f23-4b8d-bf86-89c5a1d3220a"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e2c9","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Dyjakon","uuid":"F74BAF8F6279A46A527E44C36DCBC5DB8339885230FBAC88875230CADF86137D39B3E09B2164BA20982EF696F9BB3739975CA2C017923A431DEF31419FB263BD","orcidId":"0000-0003-3618-2099","documentHash":"4fbd2733-ee85-4519-9736-048644e8527d"}],"doi":"10.3390/en16186586"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["FGMs","ceramic reinforcements","mechanical performance","ballistic behaviors","fracture"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","uid":"bQp8ITDzg_V-1GFpvOVvvtg","uuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","parentUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","rootUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","name":"Politechnika Opolska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a4878c28a0473ae592"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A comparative study on mechanical and ballistic performance of functionally graded Al6061 composites reinforced with B<inf>4</inf>C, SiC, and Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c92c","mniswId":"11761","title":"Journal of Materials Research and Technology","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2238-7854","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ce8a8bb8-a249-4187-aef0-9d54dcea7549"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-02-21","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2023,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eacd0e40970762632a3c72","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65eacd0e40970762632a3c73","65eacd0e40970762632a3c74","65eacd0e40970762632a3c75","65eacd0e40970762632a3c76","5e7093a4878c28a0473ae592","65eacd0e40970762632a3c77"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the present study, functionally graded Al6061 composites reinforced with boron carbide (B<sub>4</sub>C), silicon carbide (SiC), and alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) were prepared using the stir and centrifugal casting techniques. Arc-shaped functionally graded metal (FGM) specimens were treated with a hot-rolling process to enhance their mechanical properties and obtain laminated plates. Then, the impacts of ceramic reinforcements on the density, microhardness, tensile strength, and ballistic resistance of FGMs were studied. Moreover, the microstructural properties of the specimens were analyzed to elucidate the particle gradient from the inner to the outer surface. As a result, the microstructure observations revealed that the ceramic particles are dispersed from the inner to the outer periphery of the FGMs with centrifugal acceleration. A more homogeneous particle distribution was obtained in B<sub>4</sub>C-reinforced FGM compared to those of SiC and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The hot-rolled FGM specimen reinforced with B<sub>4</sub>C offered the lowest density. The microhardness was improved by 32% and 30.4% in the inner to outer regions of the SiC- and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-reinforced FGMs, respectively, while it was improved by 22.6% in B<sub>4</sub>C-reinforced FGM. On the other hand, the tensile strength and elongation of the B<sub>4</sub>C-reinforced FGM specimen were better than those of the SiC- and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-reinforced FGMs. In addition,

belt conveyor system is one of the essential equipment in coal mining. The damages to conveyor belts are hazardous because they would affect the stable operation of a belt conveyor system whilst impairing the coal mining efficiency. To address these problems, a novel conveyor belt damage detection method based on CenterNet is proposed in this paper. The fusion of feature-wise and response-wise knowledge distillation is proposed, which balances the performance and size of the proposed deep neural network. The Fused Channel-Spatial Attention is proposed to compress the latent feature maps efficiently, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence is introduced to minimize the distribution distance between student and teacher networks. Experimental results show that the proposed lightweight object detection model reaches 92.53% mAP and 65.8 FPS. The proposed belt damage detection system can detect conveyor belt damages efficiently and accurately, which indicates its high potential to deploy on end devices."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488404","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65e99def409707132d31d360","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"71","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"9d84d8b7-04d3-4e24-8586-5b05aa425228"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"71","pagesFromTo":"161-172","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110016823001965?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e99d8740970762631d5fa6","name":"Atilla","lastName":"Incecik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"183da0f9-e696-48e0-b8cb-4c7576d9b23b"},{"objectId":"65e99d8740970762631d5fa5","name":"Adam","lastName":"Glowacz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9fdfb152-23d4-48f8-9106-b7ad3292321e"},{"objectId":"65e99d8740970762631d5fa4","name":"Paolo","lastName":"Gardoni","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"99d6d197-e241-4afb-91a8-d08a9583733e"},{"objectId":"65e99d8740970762631d5fa3","name":"Xinhua","lastName":"Liu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7bd70840-30cc-4e0b-825c-87f0c065574c"},{"objectId":"65e99d8740970762631d5fa2","name":"Xiaoqiang","lastName":"Guo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"86356cd9-b5ed-4411-871d-947aaf605338"},{"objectId":"643a0c2840e3ff4630cec040","name":"ZHIXIONG","lastName":"LI","uuid":"702756DCCCD3492C7F8BEE876ECFF5320F12A813CAE78A9EF23A2EFD6E44E8974DA4C0167114F64ABED373F069177BE3B59258C22EAA67DBD18E6C027CAFAFBA","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"59b058ba-526e-4828-8f00-3046d9f8887c"},{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae592","name":"GRZEGORZ","lastName":"KRÓLCZYK","uuid":"CBFCAB23248F107BE0869A0A1B95424418771F3BF1C3230726107C2E5AFCDAD7015626B297AF4BA3889E7234B4F73D33C256E065E8A33D085071A5B816F9E9BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2967-1719","documentHash":"983b593f-a262-4fbd-83c5-754137e069b1"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.aej.2023.03.034"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["health","economic growth","System-GMM","linear","and non-linear estimation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Does health contribute to economic growth?

The current study attempts to estimate the effect of health on regional economic growth in Indonesia. Balanced panel data is set covering 34 provinces from 2015 to 2020. The panel data is estimated using system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). The findings reveal that smoking level contributes significantly and positively on regional economic growth, while health service has no effect. The non-linear impact of smoking level on regional economic growth is U-shaped. It means that higher smoking level stimulates regional economic growth by the increasing of aggregate spending. The local governments should design health service program and control smoking level properly so that the health risk of cigarette consumption does not offset its benefit to the economy. The policy design will produce better human health and life in all provinces in Indonesia.

This usually results from a significant deterioration in the precision of the structural form equations’ parameter estimations. \r\n It is therefore necessary to resolve the validity of using the consistency-guaranteeing 2SLS \r\nestimator in such a case. A reduction in the 2SLS estimator precision leads to the use of the ordinary \r\nleast squares method (OLS). The use of OLS results in a lack of estimator consistency. Significant \r\nimprovement in the estimation precision is gained, on the other hand, which allows cognitive error \r\navoidance. Such a cognitive error means possible removal of an important explanatory variable, \r\nreducing the system of interdependent equations to a recursive model or even a simple model. The \r\nuse of such an empirical model in forecasting results in a lack of forecast convergence, which makes \r\nthe forecasts useless in economic entity management. Ultimately, the methodology is chosen by the \r\nresearcher, together with the user. They must decide which is more important - the estimator \r\nconsistency or its precision, these properties are unattainable simultaneously."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488410","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"41-52","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://air.ue.katowice.pl/pdf/2022/4_Wisniewski.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739bf6b","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Wiśniewski","uuid":"0ED3B40BD7F5FDCA291FD35AD3B9F04237CD2E27652564FD591B3B8A3DDF19AC04171DF3FC0AB4CE1A9DA7CA2E6FBF452FA2E85E265EDDA78399B4755A368026","orcidId":"0000-0002-7606-2748","documentHash":"af74e601-0dc9-4d85-b573-3a47d5d52f81"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","uid":"bQp8ITDzg_V-1GFpvOVvvtg","uuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","parentUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","rootUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","name":"Politechnika Opolska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["643a0c2840e3ff4630cec040","5e7093a4878c28a0473ae592"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Garbage detection and classification using a new deep learning-based machine vision system as a tool for sustainable waste recycling","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a98","mniswId":"20222","title":"Waste Management","doi":null,"issn":"0956-053X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"0f1a726e-571d-46de-a80c-42f2a6b87e28"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9c04f409707626322a632","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65e9c04f409707626322a633","65e9c04f409707626322a634","5e7093a4878c28a0473ae592","65e9c04f409707626322a635","65e9c04f409707626322a636","643a0c2840e3ff4630cec040"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Waste recycling is a critical issue for environment pollution management while garbage classification determines the recycling efficiency. In order to reduce labor costs and increase garbage classification capacity, a machine vision system is established based on the deep learning and transfer learning. In this new method, an improved MobileNetV2 deep learning model is proposed for garbage detection and classification, where the attention mechanism is introduced into the first and last convolution layers of the MobileNetV2 model to improve the recognition accuracy and the transfer learning uses a set of pre-trained weight parameters to extend the model generalization ability. In addition, the principal component analysis (PCA) is employed to reduce the dimension of the last fully connected layer to enable real-time operation of the developed model on an edge device. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method generates 90.7 % of the garbage classification accuracy on the “Huawei Cloud” datasets, the average inference time is 600 ms on the raspberry Pi 4B microprocessor, and the model volume compression is 30.1 % of the basic MobileNetV2 model. Furthermore, a garbage sorting porotype is designed and manufactured to evaluate the performance of the proposed MobileNetV2 model on the real-world garbage identification, which turns out that the average garbage classification accuracy is 89.26 %. Hence, the developed garbage sorting porotype can be used a effective tool for sustainable waste

This study explores rheological characteristics of\r\nmixes of whey ice cream with protein ingredients.\r\nMaterials and methods. The viscosity characteristics of the mixes\r\nwere studied by the method of rotational viscometry. Foam overrun\r\nand foam resistance of ice cream mixes were determined using\r\nmodified methods.\r\nResults and discussion. The expediency of using protein\r\ningredients in whey ice cream mixes to increase their nutritional value\r\nwas shown. Addition of whey protein isolate in the amount of 3–5%,\r\nmicellar casein, 3%, or whey protein concentrate, 3%, increased the\r\nfoam overrun of whey ice cream mixes, while addition of soy protein\r\nisolate decreased it. The highest rate of foam resistance, 57.6–58.4%,\r\nwas recorded for the mix with 3–5% of whey protein isolate.\r\nBased on the results of the analysis of flow rheograms of ice cream\r\nmixes with various protein ingredients, they were classified as food\r\nsystems with a coagulation structure, characterized by pronounced\r\nthixotropic properties. In the case of micellar casein, whey protein\r\nconcentrate or whey protein isolate, the thixotropic ability of the mixes\r\nincreases from 58.2% to 62.2–72.2%. Soy protein isolate does not\r\nshow the specified technological activity.\r\nThe highest thixotropy of the mixes was observed for mixes with\r\n3% micellar casein and 3–5% whey protein isolate due to their specific\r\nability to form a spatial coagulation structure, which spontaneously\r\nrestores the structure after destruction due to the presence of numerous\r\nlow-energy bonds. Whey protein concentrate has a moderate effect on\r\nthe rheological characteristics of the mixes, while the presence of soy\r\nprotein isolate leads to a partial loss of the ability of the mixes to\r\nspontaneously restore the destroyed structure.\r\nThe possibility to increase the total protein content in ice cream\r\nfrom 3.45% to 6.02–7.81% due to the use of technologically effective\r\nmilk-protein ingredients has been proven.\r\nConclusions.

We analysed the differences in respondents' assessments for 12 experimental scenarios taking into account the variability of the above factors. The method was based on factorial designs. The respondents rated the variables from a set of visualisations that differed systematically in terms of the independent variables. The study involved 150 people who evaluated computer visualisations of park landscape in terms of privacy and safety. We compared the respondents' mean scores for the experimental scenarios by performing three-way analyses of variance for dependent samples. The respondents considered flat or lower ground without the presence of another person in the vicinity to be the safest. In terms of privacy, landscapes higher up, surrounded by dense vegetation and without the presence of other people in the vicinity, were rated the highest. The results yielded some practical conclusions. Privacy without compromising safety will be offered by places located away from people who might attack (safety) or monitor us (privacy). Flat ground seems to be optimal from the point of view of safety and privacy at the same time - this level is the safest, and privacy may be enhanced by nearby dense vegetation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488421","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"242","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169204623002670","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e9694940970762631a178d","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Łągiewka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e4274c83-534b-4c82-8cfc-71cf98885378"},{"objectId":"65e9694940970762631a178c","name":"Viktoriia","lastName":"Dudar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"372bdcf4-7123-4dac-856c-ca31c8b1157c"},{"objectId":"65e9694940970762631a178b","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Bilska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2e240146-e1a4-41ad-bb27-e376da6a1a91"},{"objectId":"65e9694940970762631a178a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Betkier","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0c16ee0e-5a44-47a7-b8e0-6a90d11860f9"},{"objectId":"65e9694940970762631a1789","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Iwankowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6970fa7e-1c3c-4afa-afdf-8bd7caa8e286"},{"objectId":"65e9694940970762631a1788","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Zalewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ab7829b4-3c89-4474-8958-fd14a43f91a6"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e1d8","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Lis","uuid":"D480E9E176F76A9DEC130F1B5D8BC308CF9BA9AFF810F78B9F44D80F4D5D2AB7E9995380B2EF4DF501E4A6E7E2FC5F4C867008E32C0E84CA29CA324D1EB3D41E","orcidId":"0000-0002-0464-3770","documentHash":"a52f4316-ab1a-4a40-8bff-c82e4211c8f5"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.landurbplan.2023.104948"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65eecfe040970749973c3126","doi":"10.4324/9781003308096","title":"Safety,

people are often over-represented in morbidity and mortality statistics associated with hot and cold weather, despite remaining mostly indoors. The study “Improving thermal environment of housing for older Australians” focused on assessing the relationships between the indoor environment, building characteristics, thermal comfort and perceived health/wellbeing of older South Australians over a study period that included the warmest summer on record. Our findings showed that indoor temperatures in some of the houses reached above 35 °C. With concerns about energy costs, occupants often use adaptive behaviours to achieve thermal comfort instead of using cooling (or heating), although feeling less satisfied with the thermal environment and perceiving health/wellbeing to worsen at above 28 °C (and below 15 °C). Symptoms experienced during hot weather included tiredness, shortness of breath, sleeplessness and dizziness, with coughs and colds, painful joints, shortness of breath and influenza experienced during cold weather. To express the influence of temperature and humidity on perceived health/wellbeing, a Temperature Humidity Health Index (THHI) was developed for this cohort. A health/wellbeing perception of “very good” is achieved between an 18.4 °C and 24.3 °C indoor operative temperature and a 55% relative humidity. The evidence from this research is used to inform guidelines about maintaining home environments to be conducive to the health/wellbeing of older people."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488424","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"31","pagesFromTo":"1-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4433/13/1/96/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e9755b40970762631a8d4c","name":"Veronica ","lastName":"Soebarto","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fc06dd16-fe91-4168-a19e-e93d4c1dea74"},{"objectId":"65e9755b40970762631a8d4b","name":"Jian","lastName":"Zuo ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"722b3409-f389-48a5-b52a-f70a1850bc3e"},{"objectId":"65e9755b40970762631a8d4a","name":"Renuka","lastName":"Visvanathan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ccd1101d-a0fe-40a1-b4ba-c365a6018a2c"},{"objectId":"65e9755b40970762631a8d49","name":"Larissa Arakawa ","lastName":"Martins","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"61ab7f37-62da-4936-8637-0184c95efe75"},{"objectId":"65e9755b40970762631a8d48","name":"Helen","lastName":"Bennetts","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"14c99085-0786-4cb0-9d3f-6ff23affca53"},{"objectId":"65e9755b40970762631a8d47","name":"Pisaniello","lastName":"Dino","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"364da9ce-5a65-4413-aa1b-ff0e7651a9d7"},{"objectId":"65e9755b40970762631a8d46","name":"Terence","lastName":"Williamson","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"30b15a29-baee-415a-b162-29092f51d3c9"},{"objectId":"65e9755b40970762631a8d45","name":"Alana","lastName":"Hansen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1841545a-ac6e-401d-bc57-4b17ba933391"},{"objectId":"65275a2940e3ff22d34ab9c7","name":"JOOST","lastName":"HOOF","uuid":"857E2BB15B2A692D79E99BC2B06CB85CCCFED582F26F683B585E7DF6106505710F2594EBCCFBDB786B64099029C5DC49144243EBA4965707DF0A446C83659693","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"18236d3a-4785-455d-b289-e7751d5ed261"}],"doi":"10.3390/atmos13010096"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["emerytura","system emerytalny","demografia","starość"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pension","pension system","demography","old age"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Formalne i nieformalne zabezpieczenie emerytalne : postawy i oczekiwania Polaków wobec zmian demograficznych, społecznych i ekonomicznych : kontekst europejski","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a4e5","mniswId":"200037","title":"STUDIA BAS","doi":null,"issn":"2080-2404","eissn":"2082-0658","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e62e0d33-8be3-40fc-9e34-1ba3eac5786b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-31","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e978ca40970762631b2b44","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65e978ca40970762631b2b45","5e7092c3878c28a04739c264"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the article is to discuss the importance of formal and informal sources of retirement security of\r\nPoles in the face of current economic, social and demographic changes.

As a result, it has negative effects and a significant impact on the agro-industrial sector. There is still no viable biocompatible treatment for Huanglongbing, despite enormous efforts to combat this disease and decrease its detrimental effects on citrus production. Nowadays, green-synthesized nanoparticles are gaining attention for their use in controlling various crop diseases. This research is the first scientific approach to examine the potential of phylogenic silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) to restore the health of Huanglongbing-diseased ‘Kinnow’ mandarin plants in a biocompatible manner. AgNPs were synthesized using Moringa oleifera as a reducing, capping, and stabilizing agent and characterized using different characterization techniques, i.e., UV–visible spectroscopy with a maximum average peak at 418 nm, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with a size of 74 nm, and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX), which confirmed the presence of silver ions along with different elements, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy served to confirm different functional groups of elements. Exogenously, AgNPs at various concentrations, i.e., 25, 50, 75, and 100 mgL−1, were applied against Huanglongbing-diseased plants to evaluate the physiological, biochemical, and fruit parameters. The findings of the current study revealed that 75 mgL−1 AgNPs were most effective in boosting the plants’ physiological profiles, i.e., chl a, chl b, total chl, carotenoid content, MSI, and RWC up to 92.87%, 93.36%, 66.72%, 80.95%, 59.61%, and 79.55%, respectively; biochemical parameters, i.e., 75 mgL−1 concentration decreased the proline content by up to 40.98%, and increased the SSC, SOD, POD, CAT, TPC, and TFC content by 74.75%, 72.86%, 93.76%, 76.41%, 73.98%, and 92.85%, respectively; and fruit parameters, i.e., 75 mgL−1 concentration increased the average fruit weight, peel diameter, peel weight, juice weight, rag weight, juice pH, total soluble solids, and total sugarby up to 90.78%, 8.65%, 68.06%, 84.74%, 74.66%, 52.58%, 72.94%, and 69.69%, respectively. These findings enable us to develop the AgNP formulation as a potential citrus Huanglongbing disease management method."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488434","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"28","pagesFromTo":"1-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/28/5/2044","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e82d99409707626313b916","name":"Hammad Ul","lastName":"Hassan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ac6fe9ed-f668-4684-9d06-f35be0d06480"},{"objectId":"65e82d99409707626313b915","name":"Zia ur Rehman","lastName":"Mashwani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e964cb01-9b5c-44cd-bb59-75c485e1e94d"},{"objectId":"65e82d99409707626313b914","name":"Naveed Iqbal","lastName":"Raja","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8fb14604-bd96-46c3-82a9-79086a8882e1"},{"objectId":"65e82d99409707626313b913","name":"Abida","lastName":"Akram","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"06aa81c6-c279-4928-aa4b-f49a65e89584"},{"objectId":"65e82d99409707626313b912","name":"Wajiha","lastName":"Seerat","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"22e152cd-6c18-44aa-a473-c96a0df94d55"},{"objectId":"65e82d99409707626313b911","name":"Maria","lastName":"Ehsan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a36b1ffc-c598-47c5-9877-91cfd0eef469"},{"objectId":"65e82d99409707626313b910","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Shahbaz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"89a1b9fd-36fd-4f87-ae57-debb67fc0df3"},{"objectId":"65e82d99409707626313b90f","name":"Fozia","lastName":"Abasi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ef7c1239-3a13-40e5-aeb5-a70e5770164c"},{"objectId":"65e82d99409707626313b90e","name":"Muhammad Umair","lastName":"Raza","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"061007cf-d413-4606-b04f-8004aa9e1b4b"},{"objectId":"5e709231878c28a0473916a6","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Proćków","uuid":"70701C5C678163514436375EF8CAD6D3DB2B353579CDC817CDB9CDC66060DA03F8247EF622FD5202713335D60FD7F634D7DE07E31CA1363A9333A985C3EC803F","orcidId":"0000-0003-4100-3438","documentHash":"3f63635c-e25d-4333-ba43-89dbe7f84a86"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules28052044"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Application of the gravity data inversion","Quasigeoid modelling","Edge efect in quasigeoid modelling","GNSS/levelling data assessment"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"PL-geoid2021: A quasigeoid model for Poland developed using geophysical gravity data inversion technique","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d49878c285145476e03","mniswId":"210","title":"Acta Geodaetica et Geophysica","doi":null,"issn":"2213-5812","eissn":"2213-5820","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"1deba1ff-3e01-4b9d-b33f-5043ab18f225"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-08-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65eaf1f840970762632c2c33","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7091fc878c28a04738e255","65eaf1f840970762632c2c34"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents the results of research and analyses related to the development of a new quasigeoid model fitted to GNSS/levelling data for the area of Poland (PL-geoid2021). The model was determined employing two procedures based on the Geophysical Gravity data Inversion technique (GGI method): procedure A consisted of the determination of the gravimetric quasigeoid model in the first step and its subsequent fitting to GNSS/levelling data in the second step, and procedure B consisted of a one-step determination of the model fitted to GNSS/levelling data. Both models were developed using the global geopotential model SGG-UGM-2 and gravity data covering the area of Poland, and slightly extend beyond Poland's southern and northern borders. The average model was adopted as the final model. It was demonstrated that the accuracy of the gravimetric quasigeoid model had a very low dependence on the reference topographic mass density model used. On the basis of this model, the GNSS/levelling datasets were also assessed and outliers were identified. The estimated accuracy of the gravimetric model, determined based on four GNSS/levelling datasets, was in the range of ± 1.2 to ± 1.7 cm, in terms of the standard deviation of the differences between the measured and model-determined height anomalies. Due to partial lack of gravity data just beyond the Polish border, the edge effect was also analysed. The accuracy of the final quasigeoid model (estimated in the same way as the gravimetric model) ranges from ± 1.0 to ± 1.2 cm. It should be noted, however, that this assessment is not fully independent because three of the four sets of GNSS/levelling points used for it, were also used to build the final model."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488436","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"58","pagesFromTo":"321–343","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40328-023-00422-x","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eaf1f840970762632c2c34","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Owczarek-Wesołowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5bdc70a8-dfb4-4284-a189-ceabc81d1df5"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e255","name":"Marek","lastName":"Trojanowicz","uuid":"768C20CE8666D6A9390E757A080FB170BC4E869A01E8AE7C7492769AB2D6A043136AE04927E194629F024B2215A84EAF6B05F3C3F3A479BABBD3F0CBBA75CD5F","orcidId":"0000-0001-9751-0389","documentHash":"647af7ba-b851-40fe-9bb0-7bf921ce9bd4"}],"doi":"10.1007/s40328-023-00422-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["foreign direct investment","FDI","risk"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Risk perception in practice of Polish MNCs in Kazakhstan during COVID-19 time","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479dd8","mniswId":"27350","title":"Ekonomia i Prawo-Economics and Law","doi":null,"issn":"1898-2255","eissn":"2392-1625","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d21b9620-e9c5-47d3-a1c7-20018c12baa9"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_ND","releaseDate":"2022-09-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9936540970762631d5c3c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092bd878c28a04739be12","5e7092bd878c28a04739be1f","5e709454878c28a0473ba8c1"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Motivation: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a major crisis in global economy. The year 2020 will be remembered in the history of global economy as the year of a massive supply and demand shock, and, consequently, a slump in economic growth in most countries. The effects of the pandemic will be felt to varying degrees by the majority of the world’s economic entities. One such effect is the radical decrease in global foreign direct investment (FDI). It is hard to assess now how heavily the pandemic will influence the long-term FDI trends. The perception of the pandemic risk is, however, likely to heighten. This article deals with foreign direct investment risks, and more specifically, with the pandemic risk seen as one of natural risks in COVID-19-related contexts.\r\nAim: The article aims to identify how the enterprises with Polish capital in Kazakhstan perceive the pandemic risk in comparison with other FDI risks. The authors of this paper were co-investigators on a scientific research project concerning FDI in Kazakhstan as exemplified by the investment intensity of Polish enterprises. The project was carried out from 2019 to 2021, i.e., when the pandemic started and during its course. The research concept was, however, created before there were any signs of the pandemic. Therefore, the research questions regarding FDI risk in Kazakhstan were not to any extent inspired by this occurrence. Nevertheless, the question about the pandemic risk was included in the research tool. Thus, the perception of this risk became the subject of research. The findings of partial research that are presented in this article are original in nature, because the assessments constituting their basis were formulated at a time when Kazakhstan, like other countries around the world, struggled with the pandemic and when its effects were unknown.\r\nResults: According to the enterprises with Polish capital in Kazakhstan, the main areas of risk entailed in their operation in this country were, most importantly, the risks of the investment country and global risks. Local currency exchange risk ranked 1st; as many as 70% of respondents said that this risk perception was high. This was followed by global economic events (e.g. depression), performance risks (e.g. product price, transfer risks, the price of capital) and government policy risks (e.g. tax reforms, monetary reforms, price controls, trade restrictions, nationalisation, government regulation, barriers to earnings repatriation). The 5th most distinctly perceived risk by the studied enterprises was global social events risks, including the pandemic risk. 40% of the surveyed entities defined this risk perception as high, and 30% each as medium and small. The fact that the pandemic risk ranked 5th among other FDI risk components in Kazakhstan indicates its great significance to the enterprises operating there at an early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, i.e., when the level of uncertainty caused by the pandemic in terms of both its economic and its social effects was very high."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488438","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"21","pagesFromTo":"583-601","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://apcz.umk.pl/EiP/article/view/40343","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709454878c28a0473ba8c1","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kuczmarska","uuid":"7E30111EEE1D9B5946BDBA784F079AE74A8212102B74B8C199DC0194343A5E741C146C71165E44A5EA359ABD2A5707C8F355C24117D3038821E21432CCD9DEA7","orcidId":"0000-0002-7587-5122","documentHash":"fa6f58d3-d695-43ad-950c-f1fcbd3960b5"},{"objectId":"5e7092bd878c28a04739be1f","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Karaszewski","uuid":"8E5AA19148A39A2E8955228D6D87B3BA4E700B927B23948BF40F2F62BCB698BCA337C683A27E751944DE3679D813DB5EBD35569EF2EFB93DFE24D02717E977C7","orcidId":"0000-0002-8351-4589","documentHash":"54f99a71-de02-4ace-bcec-6fceee74ab7c"},{"objectId":"5e7092bd878c28a04739be12","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Jaworek","uuid":"71A5814D8805215CDE75866AA9D60167D46CA78490B58AF08C94BAA859C04F828693A474F69EF5A0D16807A7452B49A514563AAF3651B5868C2D14B1074D4644","orcidId":"0000-0003-1448-1127","documentHash":"a0689d17-fb2d-4423-8671-46d7906f35e1"}],"doi":"10.12775/eip.2022.031"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Biphenyl","enantiotropic nematic","terminal alkoxy chains","magnetism"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","uid":"btSYdQGYDtmYBdiC2rKR_nQ","uuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","parentUuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea5","rootUuid":"bcec464c-f81e-4ff1-b0f0-2c9581715fe5","name":"Instytut Fizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092bc878c28a04739bab0","5e709414878c28a0473b5e1a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Synthesis, mesomorphic and magnetic properties at room temperature of biphenyl ester-aromatic imine with terminal alkoxy chains and methoxy substituent","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d04","mniswId":"13689","title":"Liquid Crystals","doi":null,"issn":"0267-8292","eissn":"1366-5855","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"efed819e-d4db-44ec-9b65-11dcf2769b71"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e8438640970704995486fc","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65e843864097070499548703","65e843864097070499548704","65e843864097070499548705","65e843864097070499548706","5e709414878c28a0473b5e1a","5e7092bc878c28a04739bab0"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A series of calamitic biphenyl ester-aromatic imine derived from the reaction of 4-formylphenyl-4’-(alkyloxy)-[1,1’-biphenyl]-4-carboxylate and p-anisidine have been successfully synthesised and characterised. The general molecular structures of ultimate compounds show the central fragment made up by a hybrid core of biphenyl ester-aromatic imine in which the terminal alkoxy chains, CnH2n + 1 in which n = 7–12 were connected to biphenyl while the other end consists of methoxy moiety attached to a phenyl ring. All the target compounds under polarised lights exhibit enantiotropic nematic phase of which the temperature range was further supported by DSC analysis. It can be summarised that the lengthening of terminal alkoxy chains has contributed to the lowering of melting and clearing temperatures as well as the thermal stability of nematic phase.

Most lubricants used now are produced with the use of hydrocarbon base oils, originating from the crude oil processing. They create a notable ecological hazard. To eliminate this hazard, there is a strong pressure on the development and introduction into use of lubricants for various biodegradable applications. The paper presents studies on the obtaining of modified vegetable oils, which are characterised by their improved lowtemperature properties, in view of their application as the base oils. Four different vegetable oils were solvent dewaxed by a mixture of methyl ethyl ketone - toluene solvents (MEK-TOL) under similar process conditions as those used during the solvent dewaxing, used for the oil dewaxing and slack waxes of petroleum origin de-oiling in industrial refinery plants. It has been found that this process allows for an important improvement in the low-temperature properties of vegetable oils, and in particular for the lowering of the cloud, pour, and solidification points. The modification of vegetable oils is related to a change in the fatty acids profile. A clear increase in the content of saturated acid glycerides was observed in the precipitated deposit, as compared with the filtrate (modified vegetable oil), which confirmed the selectivity of the dewaxing process. The conducted studies have shown a possibility of the effective application of a classical dewaxing process to improve the low-temperature properties of an atypical raw material, such as vegetable

The analyzes consider the practical use of low-cost devices in surveying works. In the network solution, the accuracy of the GNSS positioning based on low-cost receivers can be characterized by the repeatability of the baseline length of 1 and 6 mm in 24 h and 10 min observation sessions, respectively. The field experiment of 4 GNSS receivers and 3 GNSS low-cost receivers allowed for establishing a precise geodetic control network. The accuracy of the control point coordinates determined with low-cost GNSS receivers equals a maximum of 17 and 40 mm for the horizontal and height components, respectively. Therefore, low-cost GNSS receivers can provide positioning accuracy at the some centimeter level and can support land surveying and geodetic monitoring activities."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488472","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eeed8840970749973eb8ab","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"e1933364-ae09-4613-83b2-858314f4b550"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"255-267","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jag-2022-0042/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eeedba40970749973ec143","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Dominiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"64ed1a75-676a-4334-8fb5-5b274425a8e9"},{"objectId":"617a0b297523400564d4b520","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Marut","uuid":"14FECFE7173CCD0DB87F1671D7405D64DA8B8C83FFC41F5E08EF74FF54E75851C2D7EA49D2C6DDE7C73DA9636821BBF87FF44C83A0CA3AC94F46A44244E52EBA","orcidId":"0000-0001-9877-1898","documentHash":"1788383b-42a7-4d3c-ae71-c0d70e32a0b4"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6d76","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Kaźmierski","uuid":"5981482D3F990652B8C98CCB767F7CB00D1165F221C461FDB104FBEEEE02F523B3874786112BC409CBAC5C75B659F29B95675FF4431D6160E10A02F09320EAB0","orcidId":"0000-0002-7927-9416","documentHash":"0d50890e-0c0c-49e6-ac2f-ed2a712582ca"}],"doi":"10.1515/jag-2022-0042"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["płacenie pod stołem","system emerytalny","szara strefa"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["envelope wages","pension system","shadow economy"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Consequences of Envelope Wages in a Defined-Contribution Pension System – The Case of Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa83c9aff2974850cd3e","mniswId":"201046","title":"Polityka Społeczna","doi":null,"issn":"0137-4729","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"6a8f849b-371c-4297-b274-f7362fc40b80"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2023-06-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e979ac40970762631b4c24","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65e979ac40970762631b4c25","5e709252878c28a047393ad6","5e70924f878c28a0473938ab"]},"issue":"5-6","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W systemach emerytalnych o zdefiniowanej składce zjawiska powiązane z szarą strefą mają znaczący wpływ na wysokość indywidualnych emerytur. W artykule przeanalizowano wpływ płacenia pod stołem (fragmentu szarej strefy) na przyszłą sytuację emerytów w Polsce. Opracowanie bazuje na modelu mikrosymulacyjnym, w ramach którego wygenerowano 20 tysięcy przykładowych biografii osób, które w roku 1999 wchodziły na rynek pracy i były w wieku 18-25 lat. Wyniki pokazują, że instytucja emerytury minimalnej oraz płeć świadczeniobiorców mają kluczowe znaczenie dla relacji między wypłatami pod stołem a świadczeniem emerytalnym. W polskim systemie emerytalnym w przypadku ponad połowy kobiet wypłaty pod stołem nie mają wpływu na wysokość przyszłych emerytur – niezależnie od scenariusza, otrzymują one jedynie emeryturę minimalną. W takiej sytuacji wypłaty pod stołem są szczególnie korzystne dla pracownika – zwiększają bieżący dochód bez pomniejszania dochodu w przyszłości. Z punktu widzenia państwa oznacza to jednak niższe bieżące dochody publiczne oraz wyższe przyszłe koszty związane z dopłatami do emerytur minimalnych. Opracowanie pokazuje także, że dla pozostałych kobiet oraz niemal wszystkich mężczyzn płacenie pod stołem skutkuje proporcjonalną redukcją przyszłych świadczeń: niższą medianową emeryturą, niższą przeciętną stopą zastąpienia, wyższą stopą ubóstwa osób starszych (zwłaszcza kobiet) oraz większymi nierównościami w wysokości świadczeń."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In defined-contribution pension systems, the shadow economy significantly impacts individual pensions. This paper\r\ninvestigates how a common feature of the shadow economy, namely envelope wages, affects the future pensions of wage\r\nearners. The study is based on a microsimulation model comprising 20,000 sample biographies of individuals having entered\r\nthe labour market at 18 to 25 years of age in 1999. It shows that the institution of the minimum pension and the gender of the\r\nbeneficiary are crucial for the relationship between envelope wages and pensions.\r\nIn the Polish pension system, more than half of women’s envelope wages do not affect their future pensions – regardless of the\r\nscenario, they only receive the minimum pension. In that case, envelope wages are highly beneficial for the worker concerned – they\r\nincrease the current income without negatively impacting the future income. From the state’s perspective, however, this means lower\r\ncurrent public revenue and higher future cost of subsidising the minimum pension. The study also shows that for other women and\r\nalmost all men, envelope wages result in a proportional reduction of their benefit levels, that is: a lower median pension, a lower\r\naverage replacement rate, a higher level and depth of old-age poverty (especially for women) and more significant pension inequalities."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488474","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"590","pagesFromTo":"1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://polityka-spoleczna.ipiss.com.pl/resources/html/article/details?id=611613","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e979ac40970762631b4c25","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Sawulski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e06f9d68-2525-4853-b4ed-086b18381412"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393ad6","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Bartkowiak","uuid":"CE8D53432A0EB094DF221952F9693B7F6A1B523E686F38D59249E9333BA1EE1635BFBBEFD02D77C6302C2C05938EA71C96DE4AA3F4248581AA1E0A8133F017A7","orcidId":"0000-0002-1711-1060","documentHash":"af42d037-946c-4aab-9294-daa67c984576"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a0473938ab","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Ratajczak-Leszczyńska","uuid":"88E50D5954BE2679890E9DE740A60B1C8B811FF5B83082C555FFBF3BF6F69DEB6B1612235AC8525AB990BCEE9F51EFF0555A2F6873BD4B256A1502FE987D9372","orcidId":"0000-0002-2709-4698","documentHash":"7e47ec1e-97d8-418a-a254-484d66cc942b"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["bioterroryzm, procedury szpitalne,  izolacja pacjenta, zapobieganie chorobom zakaźnym."]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bioterrorism, hospital procedures, patient isolation, infectious disease prevention"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"651d9f6140970737b8504b1b","doi":null,"title":"Terroryzm a bezpieczeństwo – zagrożenia, prewencja, perspektywy","year":2023,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-67881-02-9","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://bc.wydawnictwo-tygiel.pl/public/assets/933/Terroryzm%20a%20bezpieczeństwo%20–%20zagrożenia,%20prewencja,%20perspektywy..pdf","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"eb0d632c-55b8-433e-9605-94b6fa19cb3f","publisher":{"objectId":"610809959543c70b144e702c","mniswId":"85900","name":"Wydawnictwo Naukowe TYGIEL Sp. z o. o.","documentHash":"0d57bd73-1897-49e3-a7d9-d36929fd7806"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcda","uid":"bHeYtjjfY4ce3IZzTvh2chw","uuid":"4ab10dcb-1c97-4a34-94a6-70107b058fd0","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcda","parentUuid":"4ab10dcb-1c97-4a34-94a6-70107b058fd0","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcda","rootUuid":"4ab10dcb-1c97-4a34-94a6-70107b058fd0","name":"Akademia Śląska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094b6878c28a0473c2302"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Terroryzm a bezpieczeństwo – zagrożenia, prewencja, perspektywy","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65edf99c4097073bb24f8a08","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094b6878c28a0473c2302"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Zgłoszenie się do szpitalnego oddziału ratunkowego osób poszkodowanych w ataku bioterrorystycznym \nbyłoby sytuacją nietypową dla standardowego funkcjonowania szpitala, co wymaga opracowania procedur \npostępowania na wypadek masowego napływu pacjentów poszkodowanych.

Second, an artificial neural network (ANN) optimised by the grey wolf optimiser is designed to establish a mirror model of the cigarette machine to fast calculate the machine output quality factors, including the rod break rate, single cigarette weight, and circumference index. Lastly, an improved multiobjective grey wolf optimisation algorithm is used to optimise these three quality factors simultaneously to obtain the optimal operating parameters of the cigarette machine. A machine swarm (including four cigarette machines) in the real world is used to evaluate the developed optimisation method, and the testing results demonstrate that the proposed multiobjective optimisation method is able to improve the three quality factors by at least 50 %, which greatly reduces the unqualified rate of cigarettes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488492","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65eeed1e40970749973ea751","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"29","number":"5","doi":"","documentHash":"6d3614ca-5ec8-4409-a674-9c5df6da183e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"79-85","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65eeecd34097076263b96008","name":"Zhibin","lastName":"Zhang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7942f23e-f9db-42b1-89ed-da97be06e5a8"},{"objectId":"65eeecd34097076263b96007","name":"Xiaohang","lastName":"Zhang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e4ca5944-c122-4f26-a1b5-0d7c90b1028e"},{"objectId":"65eeecd34097076263b96006","name":"Wei","lastName":"Rao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"169beee4-e80a-41f1-a9d8-26a2311e82ed"},{"objectId":"65eeecd34097076263b96005","name":"Lin","lastName":"Zhong","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1ff76d0c-2ced-487d-8676-33809453a9c1"},{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae592","name":"GRZEGORZ","lastName":"KRÓLCZYK","uuid":"CBFCAB23248F107BE0869A0A1B95424418771F3BF1C3230726107C2E5AFCDAD7015626B297AF4BA3889E7234B4F73D33C256E065E8A33D085071A5B816F9E9BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2967-1719","documentHash":"983b593f-a262-4fbd-83c5-754137e069b1"}],"doi":"10.5755/j02.eie.35085"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["organic foods","text mining","big data","sentiment analysis","Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)","topic modeling","machine learning"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Modeling the public attitude towards organic foods : a big data and text mining approach","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547e165","mniswId":"23834","title":"Journal of Big Data","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2196-1115","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"a346985b-c03d-4e59-9d39-c09ce1b55097"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-06","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9938540970762631d5da5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60436aaa9543c711bc6ea990","5e709203878c28a04738e989"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study aims to identify the topics that users post on Twitter about organic foods and to analyze the emotion-based sentiment of those tweets. The study addresses a call for an application of big data and text mining in different fields of research, as well as proposes more objective research methods in studies on food consumption. There is a growing interest in understanding consumer choices for foods which are caused by the predominant contribution of the food industry to climate change. So far, customer attitudes towards organic food have been studied mostly with self-reported methods, such as questionnaires and interviews, which have many limitations. Therefore, in the present study, we used big data and text mining techniques as more objective methods to analyze the public attitude about organic foods. A total of 43,724 Twitter posts were extracted with streaming Application Programming Interface (API). Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm was applied for topic modeling. A test of topic significance was performed to evaluate the quality of the topics. Public sentiment was analyzed based on the NRC emotion lexicon by utilizing <jats:italic>Syuzhet</jats:italic> package. Topic modeling results showed that people discuss on variety of themes related to organic foods such as plant-based diet, saving the planet, organic farming and standardization, authenticity, and food delivery, etc. Sentiment analysis results suggest that people view organic foods positively, though there are also people who are skeptical about the claims that organic foods are natural and free from chemicals and pesticides. The study contributes to the field of consumer behavior by implementing research methods grounded in text mining and big data. The study contributes also to the advancement of research in the field of sustainable food consumption by providing a fresh perspective on public attitude toward organic foods, filling the gaps in existing literature and research."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488493","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"9","pagesFromTo":"1-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40537-021-00551-6","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"60436aaa9543c711bc6ea990","name":"Anupam","lastName":"Singh","uuid":"40C433F25BB207FD6DC3793578E68A00098CC8D5AC103071D1445FB80EC73261E22478BE5FC9D1CC649E594BFC144C54D18691B3BA3F5A7F876DA273319462C9","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9186b72f-4d89-418a-b268-58e61710be60"},{"objectId":"5e709203878c28a04738e989","name":"Aldona","lastName":"Glińska-Neweś","uuid":"F217355008770E7F102B140F6212FFACD426AF8D5319B949CBD259049AB6D44A58F014CF1F6CBE90F7AEF3CFC033603659B31CDF8B6E10795A9A64260B565D5E","orcidId":"0000-0002-5415-1563","documentHash":"4f5dbfda-2c41-41d9-ac01-3213b7a18936"}],"doi":"10.1186/s40537-021-00551-6"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["EŚW","usługi"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CEE","services"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65e963e140970762631a0f60","doi":null,"title":"European Perspectives on Innovation Management","year":2024,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-3-031-41795-5","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-41796-2#about-this-book","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"57630e10-ccbd-471f-9ac7-f4c2d669b5e0","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"A Ray of Hope for Central and Eastern Europe: Has the ICT Service Sector Become a Cure for Lagging Behind the Rest of EU Countries in Global Value Chains?","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e963e540970762631a0f6e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af8e5"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The CEE economies (CEE) had relatively high positions in GVCs during the first years after EU accession. However, over time, CEE was reduced to factories assembling intermediate products. The advanced links of the value chain were dominated by Western European countries, as well as Asian countries (mainly China). However, an opportunity has arisen for CEE economies in rebuilding their position in GVCs in terms of a new sector services. In view of the adoption of Industry 4.0 by many economies, the article focuses on ICT services as a potential source for the renewed position of CEE economies in GVCs. The main objective of the study is to analyse the place held by CEE in GVCs in services, especially in ICT services. The study verifies the hypothesis that services, particularly ICT services, are becoming a new activity through which CEE countries can improve their relative position in global production linkages. The results of the study proved inconclusive. Only selected CEE economies (usually with smaller GDP) performed better in ICT service in GVCs. The largest economies generally worsened their positions in the services’

The Technology Acceptance Model was estimated, and its results were checked for robustness. The scope of the information collected in telematics systems is defined in terms of its perceived utility and perceived ease of use at the operational management level. The latent factors affecting technology use are defined and implemented.\r\nFindings: Most respondents (80%) claimed that telematics systems had a considerable influence on the effectiveness and efficiency of the whole company's operation. It contributed to a higher number of orders executed per time unit, more effective use of the driver's working time, and increased the entrepreneurs' trust in the company. The companies employing more workers recognize the higher usefulness of telematics systems and are motivated to use the technology more widely than smaller enterprises. TAMs estimated separately for small and medium-sized enterprises did not significantly differ among the parameter estimates.\r\nResearch limitations/implications: The Technology Acceptance Model is a useful analytical tool for evaluating telematics technology acceptance by the road transport sector. The study is based on a random sample of enterprises observed once in 2020. It is recommended to monitor them in two or three waves to compare the dynamics of the telematics usage process. It is planned to continue the study in that direction.\r\nPractical implications: The outcomes are valuable in practice twofold. Firstly, the extension of telematics systems use is interesting for final users, i.e., road transport companies that will find scope for their application. Secondly, the results are helpful for system providers who get knowledge on telematics perception from enterprise management.\r\nOriginality/value: Although widely applied to other IT systems, the TAM model has not been used to evaluate the use of telematics in road transport companies. The paper justifies TAM's categories at the operational management level in road transport enterprises, contributing to understanding managers' behavioral aspects of decision-making."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488500","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"723-741","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://managementpapers.polsl.pl/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/137-Buszko-Krupa-Chojnacka.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"615e5ba875234017e04fde2e","name":"Mirosława","lastName":"Żurek","uuid":"C466BAF418E9A38ECECCD206AAB91EC27FABAFE884A94C49CAA097ADBA4B4B7BBA2B32E0258BB638F07ED1A7F99F7766E5094ADF674B21CA7223EFD6D46FA7F4","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"89ceba00-a06e-4663-86c5-e4ceb298512b"},{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b86d3","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Zalewski","uuid":"D209FDF6D1FACFAB7FD0D0B18E802BFA93B007895B05945DC88BA830985E250B80BD741E2D6B79605E916F23812738CD515304C18AEBA5729670A76B0DD5FD86","orcidId":"0000-0002-4318-6752","documentHash":"a0098b44-036f-438d-8e32-7433b225b5de"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396ae8","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Osińska","uuid":"81E0D26C409D3AFAA30F93F24099F9654E2CA5AACC704730473889A1F8F642A4E8BBBC9E476847E01BC71C3D41E9B8E2281FF3632311BEE635F75504F0C90C40","orcidId":"0000-0002-9796-2892","documentHash":"25d1b9ee-2a8e-420e-a9eb-6d3ef814b513"}],"doi":"10.29119/1641-3466.2022.157.46"},{"mainLanguageName":"hiszpański","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["łacina","język hiszpański","język polski","periodyzacja historyczna","terminologia leksykologiczna","latynizmy"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Latin","Spanish language","Polish language","historical periodization","lexicological terminology","Latinisms"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Sobre el papel del latín y el concepto de latinismo desde la perspectiva española y polaca","mainLanguage":"spa","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d51878c285145479d37","mniswId":"496646","title":"Collectanea Philologica","doi":null,"issn":"1733-0319","eissn":"2353-0901","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"d283ee55-993d-4a27-9dac-c16299443546"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-12-16","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e9a92b40970762631fba43","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709210878c28a04738f580"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The objective of the article is twofold.

There is sparse research regarding the thermal regimes of Arctic rivers, especially in Svalbard, a geographical hotspot affected by extreme climate change and Arctic amplification. There is a need for improvement and better understanding of the factors influencing the stream water temperature regime. To address this research gap, we present a study of the non-glaciated arctic catchment, Fuglebekken (Spitsbergen, Svalbard). We propose methods for reconstructing the thermal regime of the Arctic stream based on available in-situ data. This study evaluates different sets of input variables with hourly time steps required to explain the variability in water temperature. The study comprises two modelling approaches, a stochastic transfer function Multiple Input Single Output and a supervised machine learning technique, Gaussian Process Regression, to simulate the water temperature in the years 2005–2022.\n\nThe ground temperature at a depth of 20 cm and total solar radiation were found to be the main forcings that explain most of the water temperature variability. The outputs of both models showed similar tendencies and patterns. A diurnal warming trend of 0.5–3.5 °C per decade has been detected in stream water temperature throughout the summer season. The highest increase of 6.0 °C in the water temperature in 2005–2022 was found to be present in the second part of June. The outcomes prove that the thermal regime of the Fuglebekken stream is sensitive to ongoing climatic changes. This variability is an important factor with many environmental implications."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488503","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65e99a90409707132d317de2","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"923","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"cbd426bd-fbbd-471b-a246-a7822beba895"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"923","pagesFromTo":"171298","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0048969724014372?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602ce4ca9543c7410626e4f8","name":"Marta","lastName":"Majerska","uuid":"2A924016FE505B19F9EE96E83EFBFDC70D0F5480C96355C38F3900B80157D5D871C6672FB8C58E2BE23FCF034FB0757F01F224E7C337B10F2404A6A549B89558","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"de93beb5-346e-4229-a4dd-f30619e49101"},{"objectId":"5e70944d878c28a0473ba07d","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Osuch","uuid":"A15CE4704BFC55F4D73C5551A1BF8F722C8079811C8D2926C74DE5E2098F109CCBA98FF443EA760E7212470B8FEC3F616067AD3C9D8E6C8BEC9D2B1C3908DE94","orcidId":"0000-0002-1887-3569","documentHash":"447f1351-672a-4b79-b06d-7741f68786bb"},{"objectId":"5e709392878c28a0473ad1ac","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Wawrzyniak","uuid":"C0584C144462F702B3240BEAC5B59EE267B2C41FD0108E80ADE2625711EBE1965DBD3F8183578828BBA3059F994E33D86CACFD8B0B3788616E7BE27271E913B5","orcidId":"0000-0003-3393-753X","documentHash":"e1b00415-43de-446c-8e75-68765156a8a8"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171298"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737e9d9","uid":"bnin_CfrOxQK6XxaYJytRhg","uuid":"3178cdc9-4bfd-44e5-a0dc-d37b30326a58","parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9d9","parentUuid":"3178cdc9-4bfd-44e5-a0dc-d37b30326a58","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9d9","rootUuid":"3178cdc9-4bfd-44e5-a0dc-d37b30326a58","name":"Instytut

modifications modulate histones H1 activity but their impact on proteins features was not studied so far. Therefore, this work was intended to answer how the most common modifications, i.e. acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination, can influence on histones H1 to alter their physicochemical and molecular properties. Investigations were done with the use of sequence-based predictors trained on various protein features. Because a full set of histones H1 modifications is not included in the databases of histone proteins, the survey was performed on the human, animals, plants, fungi and protist sequences selected from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database. Quantitative proportions of modifications were similar between the groups of organisms (CV = 0.11) but different within the group (p < 0.05). The effects of modifications were evaluated with the use of mutated sequences obtained through the substitution of modified residue of Lys, Ser and Thr by a neutral residue of the Ala. An advantage of deleterious mutations at the sites of acetylation, methylation and ubiquitination over the sites of phosphorylation (p < 0.05) indicate that this modification have more redundant character. Modifications evoke an increase of protein solubility and stability as well as acceleration of folding kinetics and a weaken of binding affinity. Besides, they also maintain a higher extent of intrinsic structural disorder. The obtained results prove that modifications should be perceived as relevant factors influencing physicochemical features determining molecular properties. Thus, histones H1 functioning is strictly correlated with the status of modifications."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059488506","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65ba2c574097075661c272d2","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"4bb0f094-2a6f-400b-aae6-bb624864383a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"[1-10], [e-pub ahead of print]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/07391102.2024.2316773","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a047397a7b","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kowalski","uuid":"F5006FCBBD1226104946864431A8B38BBD1EE0C7FAC1B2FF51864104DD4ACECD02B92B6A76E62D580AB2111CA770ED725D771934E312A419D20D501F311007F5","orcidId":"0000-0001-8856-5863","documentHash":"331ca995-6e0a-4a71-9d47-6be267d97365"}],"doi":"10.1080/07391102.2024.2316773"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA1OTQ4ODUwNg=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
