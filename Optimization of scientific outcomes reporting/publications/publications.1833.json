In the course of synthesis and storage of oligonucleotides a significant number of compound-related impurities can be generated. Purification protocols and analytical methods have become crucial for the therapeutic application of any oligonucleotides, be they antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), small interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNAs) or conjugates. Ion-pair chromatography is currently the standard method for separating and analyzing therapeutic oligonucleotides. Although mathematical modeling can improve the accuracy and efficiency of ion-pair chromatography, its application remains challenging. Simple models may not be suitable to treat advanced single molecules, while complex models are still inefficient for industrial oligonucleotide optimization processes. Therefore, fundamental research to improve the accuracy and simplicity of mathematical models in ion-pair chromatography is still a necessity. In this study, we predict overloaded concentration profiles of oligonucleotides in ion-pair chromatography and compare relatively simple and more advanced predictive models. The experimental system consists of a traditional C18 column using (dibutyl)amine as the ion-pair reagent and acetonitrile as organic modifier. The models were built and tested based on three crude 16-mer oligonucleotides with varying degrees of phosphorothioation, as well as their respective n – 1 and (P = O)1 impurities. In short, the proposed models were suitable to predict the overloaded concentration profiles for different slopes of the organic modifier gradient and column load."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198239","journalIssue":{"objectId":"675766affdbe83571745b262","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"1711","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"45b1a05d-089e-4a27-8118-eed5012407ed"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021967323006714?via=ihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677284a3fdbe831a38842f71","name":"Tomas","lastName":"Leek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6fbf927e-9f99-4839-883a-f04698a3ebbd"},{"objectId":"677284a3fdbe831a38842f70","name":"Manasses","lastName":"Jora","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ce73fedc-d686-426c-aeca-2156f6103b4b"},{"objectId":"677284a3fdbe831a38842f6f","name":"Marek","lastName":"Leśko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d8f760d3-4f00-4391-8efe-e6bce8ac161b"},{"objectId":"677284a3fdbe831a38842f6e","name":"Torgny","lastName":"Fornstedt","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9e25193f-c346-40da-a33a-d939d76c28aa"},{"objectId":"677284a3fdbe831a38842f6d","name":"Werngard","lastName":"Czechtizky","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c46d7350-eaca-43d8-9bbe-29c89b3c52dd"},{"objectId":"677284a3fdbe831a38842f6c","name":"Jorgen","lastName":"Samuelsson","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"51435274-d465-49e8-b29f-1ac404a8a8c3"},{"objectId":"677284a3fdbe831a38842f6b","name":"Kathrin","lastName":"Stavenhagen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2d3e2762-5785-4a73-beaf-f290acb05e5a"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395198","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kaczmarski","uuid":"F20C344B514883916A2963C7DC3F1536A382A8CC42B899361577940491B480FAC31507884217CED22DC77A7C7B8272890D21B86A942414C8D266EC23CFD6C63A","orcidId":"0000-0002-9209-1418","documentHash":"4c772c34-ddca-49ed-8fed-02392c05618a"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.chroma.2023.464446"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["futuryzm","sztuka nowoczesna","awangarda","eytka"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["modern art","furutism","ethic","avan-garde"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","uid":"bpBenp-xOEUyWFZisxulIDw","uuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","parentUuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","rootUuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","name":"Uniwersytet Kardynała Stefana Wyszyńskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b1df"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Zagadnienia etyczne w wystąpieniach awangardowych","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"61b9abf6ad204581b62ebaef","mniswId":"201121","title":"Colloquia Litteraria","doi":null,"issn":"1896-3455","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"7da01ec3-60aa-44fb-b92d-f7e838987d6d"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_ND","releaseDate":"2024-03-20","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"665f07a44097073a82421e18","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b1df"]},"issue":"2 (35) (2023)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article is focused on ethical issues of avant-garde.

The paper presents a method for the determination of the kinematic friction coefficient of friction pairs. The determination of coefficient of friction (COF) in sheet metal forming requires specialised devices that ‘simulate’ friction conditions in specific areas of the formed sheet. In this article, the friction behaviour of aluminium alloy sheets was determined using the strip drawing test. The 1-mm-thick 6082 aluminium alloy sheets in T6 temper were used as test material. Different values for nominal pressures (4.38, 6.53, 8.13, 9.47, 10.63, and 11.69 MPa) and different sliding speeds (10 and 20 mm/min.) were considered. The change of friction conditions was also realised with several typical oils (hydraulic oil LHL 32, machine oil LAN 46 and engine oil SAE 5W-40 C3) commonly used in sheet metal forming operations. Friction tests were conducted at room temperature (24 °C). The main tribological mechanisms accompanying friction (adhesion, flattening, ploughing) were identified using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The influence of the parameters of the friction process on the value of the COF was determined using artificial neural networks. The lowest value of the COF was recorded when lubricating the sheet metal surface with SAE 5W40 C3 engine oil, which is characterised as the most viscous of all tested lubricants. In dry friction conditions, a decreasing trend of the COF with increasing contact pressure was observed. In the whole range of applied contact pressures (4.38–11.69 MPa), the value of the COF during lubrication with SAE 5W40 C3 engine oil was between 0.14 and 0.17 for a sliding speed of 10 mm/min and between 0.13 and 0.16 for a sliding speed of 20 mm/min. The value of the COF during dry friction was between 0.23 and 0.28 for a sliding speed of 10 mm/min and between 0.22 and 0.26 for a sliding speed of 20 mm/min. SEM micrographs revealed that the main friction mechanism of 6082-T6 aluminium alloys sheet in contact with cold-work tool steel flattens surface asperities. The sensitivity analysis of the input parameters on the value of COF revealed that oil viscosity has the greatest impact on the value of the COF, followed by contact pressure and sliding speed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198246","journalIssue":{"objectId":"640ae99d4097073c0f4991c1","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"16","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"58c99aab-a30f-4d35-bf4a-21fd6ef61737"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/6/2338","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6772842afdbe831a388413d7","name":"Ján","lastName":"Slota","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"68d2d01d-b84e-404e-b657-2de6c36854f6"},{"objectId":"6772842afdbe831a388413d6","name":"Ivan","lastName":"Gajdoš","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5e24aec8-d0f5-401d-a747-003757bde79d"},{"objectId":"6772842afdbe831a388413d5","name":"Ľuboš","lastName":"Kaščák","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"69dc89fc-b71b-4fc8-8ee8-f5e0cfc499ec"},{"objectId":"6772842afdbe831a388413d4","name":"Marek","lastName":"Vojtko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"672222ba-cd7b-433d-850c-6c6ea32e36a1"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d60b","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Trzepieciński","uuid":"B1173B4E25A04EF20A9FC72135EA66107445195FB931A6F929E34828CBA837AE85B5284995C35F3192186D9A1A95198DD9965EC89FB78C1E42ABBEFD475C5341","orcidId":"0000-0002-4366-0135","documentHash":"819127f8-0b2e-43f0-ae91-077e24078b38"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma16062338"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"9781032473444","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"The Routledge Companion to Joseph Conrad","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":386,"publicationPlace":"Londyn","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"66ab8066fdbe832e1e9fb877","editors":[{"objectId":"67726ebbfdbe831a387d16ae","name":"Debra","lastName":"Baldwin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2f7ba9eb-0bf8-4f43-9f0b-bf0bb5d9ef39"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["67726ebbfdbe831a387d16ae"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060198248","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":"I","volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb75f","mniswId":"2100","name":"Routledge","documentHash":"64cc346c-fb88-4618-a71a-f3105e672a66"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/edit/10.4324/9781003385677/routledge-companion-joseph-conrad-debra-romanick-baldwin","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":"10.4324/9781003385677"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dopamine","ventral tegmental area","cocaine seeking","rostromedial tegmental nucleus","lateral habenula"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ce878c28a0473b120d","5e709419878c28a0473b62d1","5e709316878c28a0473a2ab2","602e0c269543c7410626eb1d","5e709415878c28a0473b5ed3"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","parentUuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","rootUuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

Previously, we have shown that brief optogenetic inhibition of VTA DA neurons with 1 s pulses delivered every 9 s attenuates cocaine seeking under extinction conditions in rats without producing overt signs of dysphoria or locomotor sedation. Whether recruitment of neuronal pathways inhibiting VTA neuronal activity would suppress drug seeking remains unknown. Here, we asked if optogenetic stimulation of the lateral habenula (LHb) efferents in the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) as well as RMTg efferents in VTA would reduce drug seeking. To investigate this, we measured how recruitment of elements of this inhibitory pathway affects cocaine seeking in male rats under extinction conditions. The effectiveness of brief optogenetic manipulations was confirmed electrophysiologically at the level of electrical activity of VTA DA neurons. Real-time conditioned place aversion (RT-CPA) and open field tests were performed to control for potential dysphoric/sedating effects of brief optogenetic stimulation of LHb-RMTg-VTA circuitry. Optogenetic stimulation of either RMTg or LHb inhibited VTA DAergic neuron firing, whereas similar stimulation of RMTg efferents in VTA or LHb efferents in RMTg reduced cocaine seeking under extinction conditions. Moreover, stimulation of LHb-RMTg efferents produced an effect that was maintained 24 h later, during cocaine seeking test without stimulation.

from the intrinsically disordered group (IDP) focus the attention of many researchers engaged in protein structure analysis. The main criteria used in their identification are lack of secondary structure and significant structural variability. This variability takes forms that cannot be identified in the X-ray technique. In the present study, different criteria were used to assess the status of IDP proteins and their fragments recognized as intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). The status of the hydrophobic core in proteins identified as IDPs and in their complexes was assessed. The status of IDRs as components of the ordering structure resulting from the construction of the hydrophobic core was also assessed. The hydrophobic core is understood as a structure encompassing the entire molecule in the form of a centrally located high concentration of hydrophobicity and a shell with a gradually decreasing level of hydrophobicity until it reaches a level close to zero on the protein surface. It is a model assuming that the protein folding process follows a micellization pattern aiming at exposing polar residues on the surface, with the simultaneous isolation of hydrophobic amino acids from the polar aquatic environment. The use of the model of hydrophobicity distribution in proteins in the form of the 3D Gaussian distribution described on the protein particle introduces the possibility of assessing the degree of similarity to the assumed micelle-like distribution and also enables the identification of deviations and mismatch between the actual distribution and the idealized distribution. The FOD (fuzzy oil drop) model and its modified FOD-M version allow for the quantitative assessment of these differences and the assessment of the relationship of these areas to the protein function. In the present work, the sections of IDRs in protein complexes classified as IDPs are analyzed. The classification “disordered” in the structural sense (lack of secondary structure or high flexibility) does not always entail a mismatch with the structure of the hydrophobic core. Particularly, the interface area, often consisting of IDRs, in many analyzed complexes shows the compliance of the hydrophobicity distribution with the idealized distribution, which proves that matching to the structure of the hydrophobic core does not require secondary structure ordering.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198266","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmolb.2023.1230922/full","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67729f73fdbe831a3889c5b0","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Konieczny","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8ac324c6-44f1-4dc2-bca4-024f9812e010"},{"objectId":"67729f73fdbe831a3889c5af","name":"Irena","lastName":"Roterman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b42a8837-7956-46f4-90ad-e8d5c5fad8ee"},{"objectId":"5e70920f878c28a04738f547","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Stąpor","uuid":"4DC534E01BB3FB769731ECC7E0876CBD03B30EE7119F8B5C95D4F16E9D1D0D33F4531B3C6E0048505FFBC7800BFA2992B902BDD4B6E03D49515B0F286189F747","orcidId":"0000-0003-3003-6592","documentHash":"bbbbb600-5950-496b-923a-2f7f903a4df5"}],"doi":"10.3389/fmolb.2023.1230922"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":"978-83-67170-19-2","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944a878c28a0473b9d20"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Kwitek rozumienia. Wybór tekstów o twórczości Andrzeja Sosnowskiego","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":"Kraków","translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":null,"translationFromPolish":null,"bookProjectNCN":null,"bookProjectFNP":null,"bookProjectNPHR":null,"bookProjectUE":null},"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"669003abfdbe83399d71ebc9","editors":[{"objectId":"5e70944a878c28a0473b9d20","name":"Marta","lastName":"Koronkiewicz-Kaczmarska","uuid":"975D68D92539477F63C3E30DC2273ADDF650D93C8594B70E212F074CD808DC9A75BDE293CB4FAB7662550B5B83ACA196A6DF04AA9EFCA4103FA21E441CCE4D79","orcidId":"0000-0002-9435-9916","documentHash":"1675b6b6-f1b0-4b26-9cf5-efd90073ac96"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["5e70944a878c28a0473b9d20"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060198270","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":"Nowa Krytyka i Esej","translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d7213a5878c284eaa45cc80","mniswId":"32100","name":"Instytut Literatury","documentHash":"88262f4a-d358-432a-bf01-b34bc9d0875c"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://katalog.nukat.edu.pl/lib/item?id=chamo:5719363&fromLocationLink=false&theme=nukat","numberInSeries":"14","authors":[],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["X-ray-based detection system","nondestructive testing","RBF neural network","alloy","aluminum plate","thickness meter"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

When the material’s composition is understood in advance, only then can the standard radiation thickness meter be relied upon. Errors in thickness measurements are to be expected in settings where the actual composition of the material may deviate significantly from the nominal composition, such as rolled metal manufacturers. In this research, an X-ray-based system is proposed to determine the thickness of an aluminum sheet regardless of its alloy type. In the presented detection system, an X-ray tube with a voltage of 150 kV and two sodium iodide detectors, a transmission detector and a backscattering detector, were used. Between the X-ray tube and the transmission detector, an aluminum plate with different thicknesses, ranging from 2 to 45 mm, and with four alloys named 1050, 3050, 5052, and 6061 were simulated. The MCNP code was used as a very powerful platform in the implementation of radiation-based systems in this research to simulate the detection structure and the spectra recorded using the detectors. From the spectra recorded using two detectors, three features of the total count of both detectors and the maximum value of the transmission detector were extracted. These characteristics were applied to the inputs of an RBF neural network to obtain the relationship between the inputs and the thickness of the aluminum plate. The trained neural network was able to determine the thickness of the aluminum with an MRE of 2.11%. Although the presented methodology is used to determine the thickness of the aluminum plate independent of the type of alloy, it can be used to determine the thickness of other metals as well."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198276","journalIssue":{"objectId":"653b7e83409707677d74557b","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"12","number":"21","doi":null,"documentHash":"9defb02b-45d6-4bda-80dc-8d575db728da"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/12/21/4504","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6772847afdbe831a38842d46","name":"Muhammad Umer Hameed","lastName":"Shah","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c751fe11-f621-41f5-998c-4a140440ab32"},{"objectId":"6772847afdbe831a38842d45","name":"Abdulilah Mohammad","lastName":"Mayet","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"210e607a-bdab-41ff-b9f1-b04237769687"},{"objectId":"6772847afdbe831a38842d44","name":"Hassen","lastName":"Loukil","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"40867aad-3b85-415b-a821-363924a1cf1b"},{"objectId":"6772847afdbe831a38842d43","name":"Muneer","lastName":"Parayangat","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8661f329-107f-4510-ab79-485ebb7e72bc"},{"objectId":"6772847afdbe831a38842d42","name":"Mohammed Abdul","lastName":"Muqeet","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c0a13447-015d-473e-9954-38882147d107"},{"objectId":"6772847afdbe831a38842d41","name":"Ehsan","lastName":"Eftekhari-Zadeh ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"05ed80c1-09ce-4545-94ed-455f06f3602f"},{"objectId":"6772847afdbe831a38842d40","name":"Ramy Mohammed Aiesh","lastName":"Qaisi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2fa46f2e-e570-4567-aed9-d3fa8fca3f5d"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951c9","name":"Robert","lastName":"Hanus","uuid":"27B0365A8F0B8BEA309E1C2EB6EBE0EC258CDCB28A0AC583BDDEF6F855D61C30859AE94778E48A3E51C8622920A6681F70541199F9D892C68B51538A27B7A643","orcidId":"0000-0001-8595-1478","documentHash":"15cca28c-94ab-43f1-b9f1-9999aa7bbb92"}],"doi":"10.3390/electronics12214504"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["LSTM","cargo-taxi","dopasowanie w logistyce","planowanie"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["LSTM","cargo-taxi","matching in logistics","planing"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70946c878c28a0473bcbe6","67725fb6fdbe831a387598ee","5e70925a878c28a047394347"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Prediction of transportation orders in logistics based on LSTM: cargo taxi","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65ba1ab34097073e10b15114","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c287715741a5f","mniswId":"1440","startDate":null,"endDate":null,"fullName":"International Work-Conference on Artificial and Natural Neural Networks","shortName":"IWANN","city":null,"country":null,"website":null,"isEdition":false,"documentHash":"bdac0293-8064-4fd2-8210-3309781ed797"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70946c878c28a0473bcbe6","5e70925a878c28a047394347","67725fb6fdbe831a387598ee","67725fb6fdbe831a387598ef","67725fb6fdbe831a387598f0"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This work presents the application of LSTM neural network in prediction of transportation orders. In case of logistic transport, the empty return routs can be minimized by matching new orders in the vicinity of drop off of actual order.

For this reason, this study aimed to obtain highly bioactive preparations in the form of powders from the fruits, leaves, and flowers of six species of hawthorn (Crataegus L.) using solid phase extraction (SPE). Ultra-performance liquid chromatography analysis (UPLC-PDA-MS/MS) showed a high concentration of phenolic compounds (in the range from 31.50 to 66.06 mg/g), including the highest concentration in hawthorn fruit preparations. Fruit preparations also showed the highest antioxidant activity (through scavenging of O2˙− and OH˙ radicals), antidiabetic activity (inhibition of α-amylase and α-glucosidase), and anticancer activity, mainly against colon cancer cells (Caco-2). At the same time, hawthorn flower preparations showed the highest biocompatibility against normal colon cells (CCD841CoN) and anti-inflammatory activity (trypsin inhibition). Correlation and principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the health-promoting potential was most influenced by the content of falavan-3-ols.

This study aimed to compare the microbiota composition between children with PKU and healthy controls. Methods: Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we analysed microbial communities at six phylogenetic levels. Results: Our findings revealed significant differences in the gut microbiota: Euryarchaeota was more abundant in controls (p = 0.01), while Bacilli and Lactobacillales were higher in PKU children (p = 0.019). Methanobacteriales were significantly elevated in controls (p = 0.01). At the genus and species levels, PKU children had higher Streptococcus and Eubacterium dolichum (p = 0.019, p = 0.015), whereas controls had more Barnesiella, Coprococcus, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (p = 0.014, p = 0.019, p = 0.014). In the oral microbiota, control children exhibited significantly higher Bacteroidetes (p = 0.032), while PKU children had increased Bacilli and Betaproteobacteria (p = 0.0079, p = 0.016). Streptococcus and Neisseria were more prevalent in PKU (p = 0.0079, p = 0.016). Conclusions: These results suggest that PKU and its dietary management significantly alter the gut and oral microbiota composition. Understanding these microbial shifts could have implications for managing PKU and improving patient outcomes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198301","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"3915","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/22/3915","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6773050efdbe831a389f0062","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Mikoluc","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7e08734c-2225-457a-877b-609f86516071"},{"objectId":"5ffeab45085dcb0e357dcc3d","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Nowosad","uuid":"12EE17E3755561AFE76756678912FA0C2A1DCBAD7ED13EFE93F2ACE50C7BCC5D3CB09DB866F03DF41A2F51C25B972DEA7587C36F126F099A318E5FA914AB528A","orcidId":"0000-0001-7664-1240","documentHash":"6185792e-cba4-4dfa-abbc-1a7ae4b135c7"},{"objectId":"5f814b97085dcb410a25ec7e","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Ostrowska","uuid":"7E35C17A2E512409962ABB5DEA11C29B4EF4D971F0F9AB59F3E723217C5C2E9E2AB79E3FC16723372A7C5348D4E39B96216A2C89F65D4708C7A721DB198A836E","orcidId":"0000-0002-1218-3225","documentHash":"f2ebc2f8-0e9c-45c5-908d-c219e6f39e5f"},{"objectId":"5e709463878c28a0473bc0ff","name":"Elwira","lastName":"Komoń-Janczara","uuid":"75107B19DC1DA415D67E8843B1CD4AF67287C6538740C241D0E12CB05D5E3DFE0935459FFF883952493BABB46EC7569AA01B7B558FAD225B509C99499E0E69C4","orcidId":"0000-0003-4579-4994","documentHash":"f9756212-d002-45d9-aca1-7a3639da82d8"},{"objectId":"5e709378878c28a0473aa885","name":"Hubert","lastName":"Szczerba","uuid":"B09D4FC25BFA5E065C49F94F8C56AF21EB402690B5E7E141207BE74CFB4ADC184255424757E045AE88B25F4D40E95CE450AD19463C1DAF66E201FCD66DB4C7C4","orcidId":"0000-0001-7429-1777","documentHash":"3a8671aa-0a9f-462a-8dca-2d60f95b528a"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Foreign

Biometric, technical, and elemental analyses of the grape stalk biomass were conducted. We evaluated the mass, length, and width of the stalks and their contribution to the total cluster mass. The higher and lower heating values, moisture content, volatile compounds, ash, fixed carbon content, and elemental composition were analysed. Emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide, sulphur, and particulates were also measured. A significant influence of the cultivar on the assessed biometric and technical parameters was found. ‘Muscaris’ exhibited the highest calorific value (HHV 16.44 MJ·kg−1) and the lowest ash content (9.99%). The highest carbon content (45.51%) was recorded for ‘Seyval Blanc’, and the highest hydrogen content (6.74%) for ‘Muscaris’. Nitrogen oxide emissions were the lowest for ‘Seyval Blanc’, making it more environmentally friendly. The biomass of grape stalks from PIWI varieties, particularly ‘Muscaris’ and ‘Seyval Blanc’, shows high energy potential and can be effectively utilised as a renewable energy source. Our results could be summarised as ‘sustainable energy production and reduced greenhouse gas emissions from grape stalks’."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198307","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"6043","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/23/6043","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67730279fdbe831a389ef923","name":"Richard","lastName":"Danko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"736ccdb1-835d-4469-8919-1ad64e3b51f2"},{"objectId":"67730279fdbe831a389ef922","name":"Radek","lastName":"Sotolár","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6f34447f-4280-44c1-900d-b07a8c4a64f9"},{"objectId":"67730279fdbe831a389ef921","name":"Anna","lastName":"Borkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aa46c09c-f604-426b-ab57-fddf109346c5"},{"objectId":"633e3da97523402e340f9c3b","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Buczyński","uuid":"22E2AF0F3C1369406B8B59BBE34A81C7B43BA7B0A44CBF657A793B24FAA531AB3EBC9A9CEB829426F4E114E1E8DC166E04FF8271D27DF39206BBCF3E4D9665DF","orcidId":"0000-0003-2322-6881","documentHash":"2fcdc146-c539-412d-952a-d4e0bff20b60"},{"objectId":"5e7093d8878c28a0473b1d77","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Klimek","uuid":"4E0611FBFAAC9896E351D9C29966B126BCC2AE0888E95135B0C423502CC7EB7E65D6CE6BA9C1BB7693A0E36B0D366D18D1254081FB294BF3CF15BDCE4733D9EE","orcidId":"0000-0001-6638-894X","documentHash":"1338b896-b663-42cd-bed6-08146c78a44b"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af889","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Maj","uuid":"0C83BD46884781CE7D45908D291093FDEEA06A9BDA9DCF956D2A0CC9B7E4D423C4321471263C54FE33BF6E920CCC174F4FBD201E7E76597925E5566351AF0A18","orcidId":"0000-0001-9052-6265","documentHash":"0d93e3a4-6005-4e64-8346-95801c1e6425"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390934","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kapłan","uuid":"090223E35558918E88AE250A165AE5FC0DCC5A422C06C7C985CEE53074BC570E3778C13B08452D04AC10051527739D0399365739042664083894B3AFBD47D954","orcidId":"0000-0002-3833-9275","documentHash":"547354a0-1a08-46b8-97ae-35b415cad1c5"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17236043"},{"mainLanguageName":"włoski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Perception of space","Cognitive Grammar","construal","trajector/landmark alignment","preposition"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092eb878c28a04739f2da"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Il ruolo delle preposizioni nella percezione del mondo.

Preposi-tions are lexical elements treated in different ways in linguistic studies: some researchers argue that the preposition is semantically empty, on the contrary, its function is to combine two elements or linguistic structures in a sentence; others say it has some semantic features. There are many exam-ples of expressions in Italian and Polish (or in other languages) in which the prepositional phrases differ  in  the  translations,  i.e.,  some  prepositions  are  untranslatable  (they  do  not  have  a  lexical  equivalent)  and  some  are  not  translated  with  use  of  their  so-called  equivalents.

Furthermore, this is the first phylogenetic evidence for the existence of a dual infection with BLV strains belonging to different genotypes within the same host: G4 and G7.

This paper presents a smart bibliometric literature review of supply chain research. The objectives are: (i) to identify supply chain research interest and research impact across subject areas; (ii) to capture trends of supply chain research in the last four decades; (iii) to identify research domains related to supply chain and development of these research domains over time; (iv) to explore the impact of COVID-19 on areas of supply chain research. Authors process 116,759 documents related to supply chain research, published between 1969 and 2021, retrieved from the Scopus database. After providing statistics regarding research interest and research impact, they use a corpus of abstracts to perform topic modeling. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) with Gibbs sampling, 13 research domains related to supply chain research are identified: Ecology; Food supply chain; IT support of supply chain; Retail-oriented supply chain; Risk and disruptive aspects of supply chain; Performance management; Value management and social aspect; Production; Sustainability & development; Models & optimization; Effective inventory management; Supply chain management systems; Supplier and logistic analytics. We also present the individual areas of supply chain research during COVID-19 pandemic."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198326","journalIssue":{"objectId":"675763e4fdbe8357174598a6","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"183","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"8558c127-f0a1-4518-b90c-cbd0dcefe853"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-23","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360835223005442","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67728460fdbe831a38842bd0","name":"Peter","lastName":"Madzík","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"61df376f-ecd0-4fd7-9332-44f1667e6376"},{"objectId":"67728460fdbe831a38842bcf","name":"Lukáš","lastName":"Falát","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cd05315b-97d3-4358-85ae-12caaa3a8390"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d593","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Zimon","uuid":"25D4217FC1B9CB7DC34BAAA116DE23C12771A030F8FF6C350A2083D4F860B7A0BB2A49DAA403DAE5B87D67E4B59D7DDB2F98AC698067D5C6AC8408A4CB80C690","orcidId":"0000-0002-3097-5445","documentHash":"c1dfd8c3-97b7-46dc-8425-e3b95ffe62f2"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.cie.2023.109520"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","uid":"bt6mbuLY9Vpc_KWGkV1Lk4w","uuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709422878c28a0473b6e36","5e709224878c28a047390946","5e7093ae878c28a0473aef2f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Physical properties of plant extracts with biostimulant potential produced using cold plasma and low-pressure microwave discharge","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479bc7","mniswId":"200186","title":"Agricultural Engineering","doi":null,"issn":"2083-1587","eissn":"2449-5999","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"6b478ce2-c18d-46e4-80ae-7a6da5930c6e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-11-17","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67504870fdbe8357178f9019","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ae878c28a0473aef2f","5e709422878c28a0473b6e36","5e709224878c28a047390946","67730292fdbe831a389ef960","67730292fdbe831a389ef961","67730292fdbe831a389ef962","67730292fdbe831a389ef963"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The changing climate, causing more frequent abiotic stresses, has generated interest in products that can mitigate the negative impacts of these changes.

However, there is limited research on how production methods and techniques affect the physical properties of biostimulants, such as density, viscosity, and surface tension. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the manufacturing process on these properties. The biostimulant was produced via hot water extraction using either cold plasma or low-pressure microwave discharge. Results showed that neither method reduced the surface tension of the biostimulants, but they significantly influenced the viscosity and density. Given these changes in physical properties, further research on droplet spectrum and plant coverage during application is necessary to determine the optimal technical parameters for effective spraying."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198329","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"28","pagesFromTo":"277-285","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://sciendo.com/pl/article/10.2478/agriceng-2024-0017","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67730292fdbe831a389ef963","name":"Pavol","lastName":"Findura","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b4316422-9321-415e-b033-f37fa4c1bee8"},{"objectId":"67730292fdbe831a389ef962","name":"Pavel","lastName":"Olsan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7acb9f5b-ed40-40c5-937f-746187240702"},{"objectId":"67730292fdbe831a389ef961","name":"Petr","lastName":"Bartos","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0151e067-54c1-48ea-8be9-1a5758b4a9cb"},{"objectId":"67730292fdbe831a389ef960","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Bohata","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"863f5118-b6c9-4130-a582-2b343b5f49a8"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6e36","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Ogrodniczek","uuid":"A9D5190B21666B4D9C09CCAC92640FE35CE10F6E08A9E41616E89195F767E0306F2C9AFDD4142A57BD176DBAFF689116D64EA69AE59DF713D68BB1802442FD7F","orcidId":"0000-0002-6484-2245","documentHash":"972968c2-bcba-443c-b894-4ef49ffe9f61"},{"objectId":"5e7093ae878c28a0473aef2f","name":"Anna","lastName":"Krawczuk","uuid":"682B3AEB2AF44B1D24D44BBFF0CBAAA2B61A2019C298600508889070AE94F006F7A3850EB6572F03D63654A3FE65E976B0F205DE9042FBCC5589B3CBB508E5EA","orcidId":"0000-0001-6227-7740","documentHash":"9a91320d-a241-4ba8-80f3-a96a039b1ff6"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390946","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Kocira","uuid":"7148F336DBA337E5119B9A2B928C5F4BE203940BC588BB1409B557F3DB3E982300402D3312C5B299883B6B02B979BF83C17EBFCD89309B0638F7201F3DA089DF","orcidId":"0000-0002-2888-3023","documentHash":"acae37a7-57e9-483a-847e-5797d6c0c36c"}],"doi":"10.2478/agriceng-2024-0017"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS)","hybrid","road load","on-road tests","vehicles emission","chassis dynamometer"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Among the most important of these are driving cycle and road load. These parameters also affect the hybrid drive control, including the combustion engine operation or driving in electric mode. In most studies, tests carried out on chassis dynamometers concern type approval cycles (NEDC—New European Driving Cycle, WLTC—World-wide harmonized Light duty Test Cycle, FTP— Federal Test Procedure), which differ from real on-road tests. Consequently, the different driving cycles do not allow for results similar to those obtained during on-road driving, especially as the actual cycles on the road are unrepeatable. It is also important to determine the effect of the motion resistance function adopted for chassis dynamometer tests on exhaust emissions and fuel consumption. For this purpose, the authors tested a hybrid car under road and laboratory conditions for the same driving cycle. The analysis was conducted for an example urban road cycle in Rzeszow (URRC). The purpose of the study was to determine the differences in the results of gaseous emissions (THC, CO, CO2, NOx) and fuel consumption (energy) of a hybrid car under road conditions, with the results of tests conducted on a chassis dynamometer, for the same cycle and three functions of resistance."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198348","journalIssue":{"objectId":"64c8c1d24097073b97dac6c2","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"16","number":"15","doi":null,"documentHash":"6c7e7b66-dfb3-4095-9f46-e1439ecf517e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/15/5723/htm","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6772845afdbe831a38842b75","name":"Sergii","lastName":"Boichenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b33febbd-61a9-452d-b09f-a8e0bda0b8ad"},{"objectId":"6772845afdbe831a38842b74","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Longwic","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cf14db3a-969d-4f3e-a334-fc4c9db3d253"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d602","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Balawender","uuid":"0C2F2EA4A49ECC8D5994615D3BBCE2AA9E40D3D4C488B43435FF6B1A1E65DA3C1764F28A4B6C8A14A35D296565ED04106A0DF97DCD7CEA520879D4B7F645BA1D","orcidId":"0000-0002-1219-8611","documentHash":"968fb669-fca8-48fa-88dc-63aa373374e4"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d58a","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Lew","uuid":"125C3ACF82B24AD1524EC7F3B447E76430781BB57DDE28A3D3ABE2F3AE13062ED510261710A9A0DFC3CE39C1486FCCCBE058B81F189C9A06FE7679E483164C6A","orcidId":"0000-0003-0019-1428","documentHash":"a002ab4d-e8f7-49c2-982a-ff8d06fff764"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d57e","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Wojewoda","uuid":"28703EAEAB5E7D5FC88D7D94CA63C6088101946D4BDC9129765CE58C548FCD4922D55FD4DED5F0ED78922DA55D1C2DEFEB6FE27AE7DB78EEFC7DB5E3E2E754C2","orcidId":"0000-0003-1197-9392","documentHash":"b1783579-35af-4f64-943a-1af8b5d6590b"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951f9","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Woś","uuid":"0C936B93580B831338DC610A6F51E8AEECA67D863358D9D61BFF2AA60AEC03973F5A7C55D174A8C9D012D7086B7BE56E2664C7D4F9E3634DB5D24BA2F3ADD6E1","orcidId":"0000-0003-2730-3258","documentHash":"72c6bfaa-b977-4c69-bb88-fc493beb9ba0"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951f5","name":"Hubert","lastName":"Kuszewski","uuid":"A3CFA9B27EEBF2E25AF3C583B815D3352C5BEBBE7F8605A83C8CCDD8A383555D4F2B8B775117DA7EC6776C487076B8F8DA0876884B1FE746F12FFC857E7F2FC3","orcidId":"0000-0002-2294-6249","documentHash":"32e187ed-7a14-4078-a1e1-f06a9aa0e3e3"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951f4","name":"Artur","lastName":"Jaworski","uuid":"B5F54FAEC8ECB017F321D7A14523413B4F3CBD823FE98272A7CF3933D76D98E2586886EA9C074169E3973945B90EAF44BEE89FE46161474CA8E52FE4FCADBD33","orcidId":"0000-0002-1599-1711","documentHash":"4a6b8539-e59a-43ef-b5cc-53a7b75bf0b2"}],"doi":"10.3390/en16155723"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","uid":"bt6mbuLY9Vpc_KWGkV1Lk4w","uuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709225878c28a047390a9d","5e709224878c28a047390970"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Elastic recovery in-die during cyclic loading of solid anaerobic digestate","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1944","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-12-06","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6756c3d1fdbe8357172f8fca","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709225878c28a047390a9d","5e709224878c28a047390970"]},"issue":"23","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Anaerobic digestate represents a valuable organic by-product, with one of the main challenges being its enhanced utilization. Pelletization offers potential benefits by improving the digestate’s storability, facilitating transport, and significantly expanding its application as a fertilizer or biofuel. Understanding the mechanisms of densification and their impact on the final product quality is essential and served as the inspiration for this research. Its primary focus was stress relaxation and the subsequent elongation of pellets within the compaction chamber (in-die). It investigated the hypothesis that elastic recovery, resulting from internal stress relaxation once the compressive force is removed, has direct implications for pellet quality. The investigations were conducted using a Zwick universal machine. Samples of digestate with varied moisture levels, i.e., 10, 13, 16, 19, and 22%, were loaded with amplitudes of 8, 11, 14, 17, and 20 kN. Ten loading and unloading cycles were employed. Elastic recovery (in-die) (ERin-die) in the investigated digestate increased with rising MC and compaction pressure but decreased with increasing cycle number. There was little correlation between ERin-die and pellet strength. Permanent strain energy exerted the greatest influence on pellet quality.

As an important tool to protect the energy environment and promote national economic transformation, it is important to investigate the relationship between environmental regulation and energy security to ensure energy security. Here, we measure the level of energy security by region based on provincial panel data, empirically analyze the direct and spillover effects and spatial heterogeneity of environmental regulation on energy security, and also explore the non-linear characteristics of environmental regulation on energy security driven by fiscal decentralization and marketization. The results show that there are regional differences and spatial dependence in China’s energy security, indicating that environmental regulation contributes to the level of energy security, but the effect of environmental regulation varies across regions and the positive impact of environmental regulation is enhanced when the degree of fiscal decentralization and marketization crosses a specific threshold. Finally, the paper puts forward relevant policy recommendations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198351","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6479ae404097070bf863e7d4","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"116","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"df8b5096-0661-4993-a0ef-9eab24a97788"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"113-124","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1342937X23000126?via=ihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6772841afdbe831a3884130a","name":"Chen","lastName":"Wang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8a864dea-d0f9-4752-9066-5922070efb05"},{"objectId":"6772841afdbe831a38841309","name":"Xiaowei","lastName":"Ma","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9bc358cb-41a0-4216-8017-c166de0256a2"},{"objectId":"6772841afdbe831a38841308","name":"Weiliang","lastName":"Tao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"af435c75-0ef4-4b82-bae2-722b22bf13b1"},{"objectId":"6772841afdbe831a38841307","name":"Xin","lastName":"Zhao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"54fa86a9-9d2c-4db4-932a-bafeb7d49a62"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d624","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Mentel","uuid":"E1026B8F297A97E1E35653A0C1A2E30D2FA6DCFB2927658A518E7F0DE1CCC0F1A9BAB41D97156E169E767E02181269C28E2E93D03501F342E123A9D4E2B5EE25","orcidId":"0000-0002-6371-1219","documentHash":"ea5ff81a-7599-4377-8832-255b6610876f"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.gr.2022.12.017"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["analiza wzbogacania szlaków","sekwencjonowanie RNA pojedynczych komórek","algorytm dla pojedynczej próbki","skuteczność algorytmu"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["pathway enrichment analysis","single-cell RNA sequencing","single-sample algorithm","algorithm effectiveness"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65bb9ee94097076263f9bc6f","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-07802-6","title":"Bioinformatics and biomedical engineering. 9th International work-conference.

The aim of this study was to measure the performance of three single-sample gene set enrichment algorithms, based on their ability to obtain the statistical significance of enrichment in each cell separately using scRNA-Seq data. The peripheral blood mononuclear cell dataset was used in the evaluation process and individual enrichment within the B cell subtype was investigated based on reference gene set collection. Sensitivity, specificity, prioritization, and balanced accuracy were used as evaluation metrics, accompanied by correlation analysis between gene sets. AUCell, originally designed for scRNA-Seq, showed the best sensitivity and balanced accuracy, good prioritization and acceptable specificity. However, large correlation between gene set size and specificity was observed, so we recommend its usage on large gene sets (>80). Moreover, the computational time is much longer compared to other tested methods. Among other algorithms, CERNO gave very high specificity and prioritization, but the sensitivity needs to be enhanced by algorithm improvement. Finally, the problem of the “gold standard” dataset and gene set collection that could be used for gene set analysis algorithms performance evaluation in scRNA-Seq, was stated and the initial solution was presented."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198368","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"33-44","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"672056b8ece3984a39605092","name":"Anna","lastName":"Mrukwa","uuid":"58FBF41938B215651D2840ACCE8655684E7CC1727ABE72EFBD34345239E47F3C2B8E28AF8839F820043B4A0CC9C2B9AAA98512A250E0721B0E73B8FB9BB829CF","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8b8cd8be-d5c2-438b-af8a-b6c074e178b0"},{"objectId":"5e709419878c28a0473b6391","name":"Michał","lastName":"Marczyk","uuid":"03FB7FD81BD2866B6519B4F57B0F974716E4751E30C33B60F8A37467F1A6947B1C3E6952A80E8C4D61CAB7F721D73AB6C2BFFC6208660D239827C7A6C9BF4F1A","orcidId":"0000-0003-2508-5736","documentHash":"73ab7f4c-d05a-4dc8-8fb8-e74a0fcf9bd5"},{"objectId":"5e709384878c28a0473abb3f","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Żyła","uuid":"510FCC3F878F9B32334E25C99C6822E17C17E750732C813E3903E267ACCEA85FB1E9AA22E6D7AF71323E53C924318776A860B6688AFC54221CF6562FAC835F7D","orcidId":"0000-0002-2895-7969","documentHash":"1e6995b8-da65-4ed6-b820-95f017ddc4c7"}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-07802-6_3"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["kanonicy regularni laterańscy","klasztor","muzyka","Kraków"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["music","Canons Regular of the Lateran","Kraków","cloister"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","uid":"bpBenp-xOEUyWFZisxulIDw","uuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","parentUuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","rootUuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","name":"Uniwersytet Kardynała Stefana Wyszyńskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b055"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Ofiarność muzyków kapeli klasztornej w świetle XVIII-wiecznej księgi przychodów zakrystii Kościoła Bożego Ciała w Krakowie","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"61b9abe9ad204581b62ebac3","mniswId":"201049","title":"Musica Ecclesiastica","doi":null,"issn":"2353-6985","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"091676fe-2f4f-458e-8d8c-20eae21b293a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_SA","releaseDate":"2024-07-21","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"66f6c7d7fdbe831edeb1e748","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b055"]},"issue":"19","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W archiwum kościoła Bożego Ciała w Krakowie przechowywana jest księga dochodów zakrystii („Regestra perceptarum”) z lat 1711–1787.

While proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as pantoprazole (PTZ) show promise in treating these ulcers, data on PTZ's pharmacokinetics (PK) in adult goats and sheep are limited. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating and comparing PTZ's PK in these species following single intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) administrations. Five healthy male goats and sheep were included in the study. PTZ concentrations in plasma samples were determined using a validated analytical method. Non-compartmental analysis was conducted, and statistical comparisons were made between IV and SC administrations and between species. Sheep and goats showed similar systemic exposure levels regardless of the administration route. However, sheep had a shorter t1/2 due to a higher Vd compared to goats. Cl values were comparable in both species, with low extraction ratio values. There were no significant differences in Cmax and Tmax between the two species with regards to SC administration, and complete bioavailability was observed. The MAT exceeded the t1/2 in both species, indicating a potential flip-flop phenomenon. Considering the AUC as a predictor for drug efficacy, and observing no significant differences in systemic exposure between sheep and goats for any route of administration, dosage adjustment between the two species may not be necessary. In field settings, SC administration proves more practical, providing not only complete bioavailability but also a longer half-life compared to IV. Further studies are warranted to explore the PK/PD of PTZ in small ruminants with abomasal ulcers, to fully comprehend its therapeutic efficacy in such scenarios."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198386","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"305","pagesFromTo":"106138","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090023324000777?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677300fffdbe831a389ef708","name":"Mario","lastName":"Giorgi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7d400301-d7e8-4486-a3cb-9e93cf3957b2"},{"objectId":"677300fffdbe831a389ef707","name":"Amnart","lastName":"Poapolathep","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"832743d9-7f6a-4393-8805-1d5abd7e43bb"},{"objectId":"677300fffdbe831a389ef706","name":"Firas","lastName":"Serih","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fb24fc5e-11e6-45cd-80c8-6ceeaf4e96e9"},{"objectId":"677300fffdbe831a389ef705","name":"Charbel","lastName":"Fadel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"51e87219-6d21-46ba-8981-d6ef94efbb64"},{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af87f","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Lisowski","uuid":"3388B6827FC4888A84E1FC9A3408BED8D0793180A1A8953D73F6CC087C7943EA144754A992B2C5216D2FBB9F209D01BC443605A8D063E53D53DC656A034A72DD","orcidId":"0000-0003-1463-9908","documentHash":"db047534-ba36-4416-b525-90b5313edfe7"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a047390983","name":"Beata","lastName":"Łebkowska-Wieruszewska","uuid":"7E4E56BE8712FC4ECA0C2EBDA99B1787493DF2AD538B832069421B70F6F8C25F48ECCF8522E29C06D02AAAEF749A70A27BDE8DF9C6C26517E6C24B3DC99C5F47","orcidId":"0000-0002-1569-0599","documentHash":"4f2a258c-3dfd-40e4-ad01-fc72731ded64"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.tvjl.2024.106138"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["robot społeczny","teoria społecznego uczenia się"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["social robot","theory of social learning"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6385c1cf40970769ab69dd53","doi":null,"title":"Automatyzacja procesów dyskretnych.

The tact, which has the content of a time window for performing the operation is used for discrete processes. Due to the fact that multimodal transportation of goods is carried out on a large network, time is one of the most important criteria for their perfection. Two timing criteria are applied in the article, which take into account the fact that the multimodal process must be synchronized and that the transportation of a large group of goods can be carried out in separate parts. An estimation criterion was also applied, which takes into account constant, variable, contingent costs, which are carried out depending on the structure of the process. The goal of the study is to create such multimodal cargo delivery routes that are characterized by the highest level of selection criteria. In contrast to known studies, the dependence of the optimization criteria of the multimodal process on the total volume of cargo delivery was shown. The method of analyzing the transport scheme of multimodal transportation and the corresponding algorithm and computer program were developed. The methodology involves a complete review of all possible route options using three types of continent transport, namely road, rail, and river.

Although   digital transformation is often lauded for enhancing innovation through various  technological  advancements  and  collaborative  tools,  this research highlights a critical yet underexplored consequence—the stifling  of  employee  creativity.  By  examining  the  mechanisms  of employee  surveillance  and  digital  stress,  as  well  as  the  resultant information overload and decline in spontaneous interactions, the paper  accentuates  the  human  cost  of  an  uncritical  embrace  of digitalization. It argues that while digital technologies can serve as catalysts   for   innovation,   they   can   simultaneously   erode   the informal,  creative  spaces  that  foster  original  thought,  ultimately impeding the very innovation they aspire to enhance. To reconcile the advantages of digital transformation with the need topreserve creativity,   the   paper   suggests   an   approach   that   values   and nurtures  the   human   element   alongside   the   adoption  of  new technologies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198414","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"28","pagesFromTo":"55-61","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://asej.eu/index.php/asej/issue/view/63","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393aad","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Koczerga","uuid":"A5A6D6108CE91B6CBC6655F36D9188FD879B0826FB7CFAE2CB557E8F344442DB42941C1B75C8EC1C8CB4EB5BF88E690CC9CF86079D090304F59E76614C4AABC1","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c4094b1a-bff3-44c1-8e86-a8957d3018dc"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"67322ae2fdbe8303494637b1","doi":null,"title":"Prewencja weterynaryjna z elementami zarządzania zdrowiem stada","year":2024,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-68090-47-5","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"http://katalog.nukat.edu.pl/lib/item?id=chamo:5799869&fromLocationLink=false&theme=nukat","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"49bb5e35-a251-46c3-976c-e371677cd5de","publisher":{"objectId":"5d3826ae878c2809a72ec590","mniswId":"22100","name":"Edra Urban & Partner","documentHash":"a67f9716-f79f-406a-a08f-607179986af7"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny -

Hence it is the subject of study at many university majors. Since teaching practical usage of theory at a distance is difficult or even impossible, we present novel mechanisms that significantly enrich e-learning platform functionalities in individualized learning of databases installed on the teacher-managed server. The crucial component of our proposal, Data Adapter, allows for interactive querying and manipulating of the NoSQL databases through an e-learning platform. The Adapter is complemented by the Learning Paths component, which enables teachers the creation of individualized didactic paths for students with special educational needs. The e-learning platform load tests confirm that new activities do not substantially affect the comfort of students’ work. Its impact on learning effectiveness was verified by rating the competence test for the group of 104 course participants. Half of them were the participants of the e-learning NoSQL course and used the developed mechanisms, while the remaining, control, group was taught with the conventional methods. The research shows that the proposal successfully improves teaching modern NoSQL languages. The scores improvement in the e-learning group of students compared to results in the control group is noticeable, and observed differences are statistically significant."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198422","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"6585932f4097076c14c420ec","mniswId":null,"startDate":"2022-09-07","endDate":"2022-09-09","fullName":"26th KES International Conference on Knowledge-Based and Intelligent Information & Engineering Systems","shortName":"KES2022","city":"Verona","country":"IT","website":"https://repozytorium.bg.ug.edu.pl/info/conference/WUT150430/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"dd309be1-9f99-45f0-bc51-8cac97c5bf15"},"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"3330-3339","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050922012819","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a047395f5f","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Werner","uuid":"98BF512EFB77A75D0AAAE44A8F83810D3986C2F0B43FBA19E112DA184A55AEF27B97D0ED50551640F845D5F315CB8AF3632DF1C7C7ED2BDFC5668678F96C5574","orcidId":"0000-0001-6098-0088","documentHash":"4d7107b0-4c12-4498-adf6-ea2a240e1230"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.procs.2022.09.391"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Life Writing","British and Irish Literature","Literature and Cultural Studies","Literature and Media","Modernism","Polish Literature","photography"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":"978-3-031-36898-1","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922e878c28a047391345"]}],"type":"BOOK","title":"Face Forms in Life-Writing of the Interwar Years","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":"Cham","translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":null,"translationFromPolish":null,"bookProjectNCN":null,"bookProjectFNP":null,"bookProjectNPHR":null,"bookProjectUE":null},"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65de0f574097076263d1d148","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922e878c28a047391345"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This book is an interdisciplinary study of the engagement with and representation of the face across literature, photography, and theatre. It looks at how the face is an active agent, closely connected with the history of the media and the social interactions reflected in media images. Focusing on the dynamic period of the interwar years, it explores a range of case studies in Poland, UK, and the US, and examines artists like Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz (Witkacy), Virginia Woolf, Debora Vogel, Sir Cecil Beaton, Theodore Władysław Benda, and Edward Gordon Craig. Teresa Bruś argues that these writers and photographers defended the face against threats from modern life – not least, the media. She focuses on transformations of the face in life writing across a range of media and draws attention to the artists’ autobiographical narratives."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198426","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":"2730-9185","series":"Palgrave Studies in Life Writing","translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb885","mniswId":"46100","name":"Palgrave Macmillan","documentHash":"bbef3f09-e653-452e-b7e6-8ca04f79b40e"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-36899-8","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70922e878c28a047391345","name":"Teresa","lastName":"Bruś","uuid":"2D7916BB8596EC13F28B70ABC3DD90892E81437488DEE7CD68E8C1FAD295189460A8ED754939B166B285D116F2EB63B1883597F71A488856A6A857545ED4BADF","orcidId":"0000-0003-2845-7195","documentHash":"54f0338e-f5d2-4907-955e-0e97265ff9a2"}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-36899-8"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Automatic Heart Rate Detection during Sleep Using Tracheal Audio Recordings from Wireless Acoustic Sensor","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bf1a","mniswId":"5040","title":"Diagnostics","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2075-4418","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"39f0ab20-dff4-4c25-a21a-f57d5d573c52"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-11","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65cb2cb8409707626355dcb3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d0878c28a04739d49c","6772596bfdbe831a38743c16","6772596bfdbe831a38743c17","6772596bfdbe831a38743c18","6772596bfdbe831a38743c19","6772596bfdbe831a38743c1a"]},"issue":"18","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060198431","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6772596bfdbe831a38743c1a","name":"M.","lastName":"Ładogórska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6170519a-d8fa-4a33-bb3f-db9149de6122"},{"objectId":"6772596bfdbe831a38743c19","name":"C.","lastName":"Chousidis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4ca17c46-7ea6-4dfc-95dd-f6842c877571"},{"objectId":"6772596bfdbe831a38743c18","name":"A.","lastName":"Georgakis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b2acf3dd-e9ed-4946-a25a-9fc9ef7b97da"},{"objectId":"6772596bfdbe831a38743c17","name":"M.","lastName":"Młyńczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3200efc8-07e4-4840-a11b-7f1ac461aa8c"},{"objectId":"6772596bfdbe831a38743c16","name":"JZ.","lastName":"Tomaszewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e8f42d8f-ff73-43fc-bd7a-023fd87f6173"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d49c","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Kukwa","uuid":"658FDBBF5E179CBFBAD8C3659A14EFB21D3F7730DDDD8962E8DAE1997F2AD609571BE9D2C6D505955D2A76B6D525DA4C6DBC1432EC776369041C8940B121929C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7ea8c1c3-96d1-4892-87b9-4dae5780d1c2"}],"doi":"10.3390/diagnostics13182914"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["renewable energy","bibliometric","CiteSpace"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Therefore, in the reclamation of fly ash landfills, an integrated approach is required, including the introduction of exogenous organic matter into the top layer of ash. This study assessed changes in the content and quality of organic matter in soils developing on a reclaimed fly ash landfill. This study included reclaimed areas without the introduction of EOM (RV_1—the direct introduction of plants) and with the introduction of EOM (RV_2—surface humus and RV_3—sewage sludge). In samples taken 15 years after reclamation, the contents of total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN), the fractional composition of organic matter, the susceptibility of organic matter to oxidation, and soil carbon management indices (carbon pool index (CPI), C lability (L), lability index (LI), and carbon management index (CMI)) were determined. The study results showed that the use of EOM in the reclamation of the ash dump significantly increased the content and improved the quality parameters of organic matter and thus influenced the initiation of the process of organic matter accumulation. In RV_1 soil, the accumulation of carbon resources was only found in the topsoil. An increase in carbon resources in the 15–40 cm layer was only noted in the variants in which EOM was introduced (RV_2 and RV_3). Carbon management indices showed that organic matter transformations covered only the top layers of these soils and were closely related to the EOM inflow. The interdependence of the CPI and L was most beneficial in the soil reclaimed with sewage sludge. In the soil of this reclaiming variant, the CMI had a value above 100, which indicates the initiation of the soil-forming process. Significant differences between the assessed reclamation variants were confirmed by means of PCA based on organic matter quality indicators. The organic matter content and quality indicators were the most favorable in the soil of variant RV_3. The obtained results confirmed that the introduction of EOM into the top layer of fly ash has a beneficial effect on the accumulation and quality indicators of organic matter and thus on the development of the soil-forming process in Technosols developing on a reclaimed fly ash landfill."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198441","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"10579","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/23/10579","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6773011ffdbe831a389ef75e","name":"Zofia","lastName":"Durczyńska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8321251e-d584-4e16-ba47-acb4391c88b8"},{"objectId":"5e7093ab878c28a0473aec7e","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Myszura-Dymek","uuid":"034F301C520D0A3E737065C924A112BB2FBDD06A26735BB390FC6C86746E2790633165E1D99979B25C150F63CEFB6EC551C67BF27EAC193037AFD7BA56EF57F8","orcidId":"0000-0002-5378-924X","documentHash":"7c03ef63-7a84-4941-a203-6db1a538f8f3"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a047390a5f","name":"Grażyna","lastName":"Żukowska","uuid":"76EDA3FADBBCDEB2A64654136E260D26B68B4FB10D49269C3BBCE8D5ECDD5AACF84AA12F0AE4BEF309CD72A2B517498512D2C6D506DEBDFB589D4250BD7FDAC9","orcidId":"0000-0002-8189-6675","documentHash":"70d7e7d8-c970-4807-a7de-71a17cc2246e"}],"doi":"10.3390/su162310579"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-83-7847-905-5","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922e878c28a047391458"]}],"type":"BOOK","title":"Aposjopea.

verification of the quality of cryopreserved semen derived from native cattle is one of the tasks performed at the bank as recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the quality of semen from PR bulls stored for 40, 50 and 60 years in the BMB using standard evaluation parameters such as sperm motility as well as structural-functional parameters such as plasma membrane integrity, transmembrane mitochondrial potential and sperm chromatin damage. Semen pellets from 27 PR bulls (3 ejaculates/bull) were tested. The data were analysed by one-way and two-way ANOVA, and the significance of the difference (P≤ 0.01) between the means was determined using Duncan’s test. Our study results revealed that the long-term storage of semen had no effect on sperm characteristics after thawing. However, statistically significant differences (P≤0.01) in sperm plasma membrane integrity and transmembrane mitochondrial potential, following storage in liquid nitrogen were noted between bulls at all time points. However, there were no significant differences (P>0.01) in sperm chromatin damage between breeds or between different storage times, and the degree of DNA fragmentation ranged from 0.4 to 0.8%."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198457","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"42","pagesFromTo":"241-254","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://sciendo.com/pl/article/10.2478/aspr-2023-0034","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6772f7b5fdbe831a389eddc0","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Kocik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a3de862a-e998-4719-9554-91e12be5b765"},{"objectId":"6772f7b5fdbe831a389eddbf","name":"Monika","lastName":"Trzcińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"92db586f-90ba-4b5f-9eee-bc83827c423d"},{"objectId":"6772f7b5fdbe831a389eddbe","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Bryła","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b4e70310-425d-4106-b4fc-508ee793ed83"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a0473908d5","name":"Artur","lastName":"Burmańczuk","uuid":"630A701C07B41E7B12F9A6DE259D051BC6B77B1A5433C84BBABB18591603FCC7E8FC838596C33207AA4EEE9C0C2AA1FB4983D2B51BF189659E03EF3185CCCBCA","orcidId":"0000-0002-2354-7696","documentHash":"0752e9ea-548d-4e05-9f02-7f4dfc3398d6"}],"doi":"10.2478/aspr-2023-0034"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet

contributes to this process. Isozymes are distinct proteins that catalyze the same enzymatic reaction but can have different kinetic characteristics, subcellular localization, and tissue specificity. Cancer-dominant isozymes that catalyze rate-limiting reactions in critical metabolic processes represent potential therapeutic targets. Here, we examined the isozyme expression patterns of 1,319 enzymatic reactions in 14 cancer types and their matching normal tissues using The Cancer Genome Atlas mRNA expression data to identify isozymes that become cancer-dominant. Of the reactions analyzed, 357 demonstrated LID in at least one cancer type. Assessment of the expression patterns in over 600 cell lines in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia showed that these reactions reflect cellular changes instead of differences in tissue composition; 50% of the LID-affected isozymes showed cancer-dominant expression in the corresponding cell lines. The functional importance of the cancer-dominant isozymes was assessed in genome-wide CRISPR and RNAi loss-of-function screens: 17% were critical for cell proliferation, indicating their potential as therapeutic targets. Lists of prioritized novel metabolic targets were developed for 14 cancer types; the most broadly shared and functionally validated target was acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1). Small molecule inhibition of ACC reduced breast cancer viability in vitro and suppressed tumor growth in cell line– and patient-derived xenografts in vivo. Evaluation of the effects of drug treatment revealed significant metabolic and transcriptional perturbations. Overall, this systematic analysis of isozyme expression patterns elucidates an important aspect of cancer metabolic plasticity and reveals putative metabolic vulnerabilities.</jats:p>\r\n

aim of the study was to assess whether the personality profile of laying hens can be a selection criterion.\r\nThe analyses involved two breeds: Rhode Island White (RIW) and Rhode Island Red (RIR), reared in individual\r\ncages. The behavioural profile of three generations of birds comprising 1333 RIW hens and 3180 RIR hens\r\nwas determined with the use of the novel object test (NOT). The following behaviours were recorded: escape,\r\navoidance-approach, immobility, and approach. Based on its reactions, the birds were assigned to: proactive\r\nor reactive profile groups. The genetic parameters of the behavioural profile and the phenotypic and genetic\r\ndependency between the behavioural profile and the performance traits were estimated.

Regardless of the fact that the overwhelming majority of previous research works dealing with gastric ulceration in pigs focused on the role of the nutritional determinants, including chemical composition of feeds, cereal type, finely ground pelleted diets, and feed additives, conclusions presented therein remain highly ambiguous. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the disease on production performance, and investigate the influence of selected non-dietary risk factors on the prevalence of gastric alterations in finishing pigs reared under conditions of 11 modern farms located in Poland.\r\nResults\r\nA total number of 26,043 finishing pigs was examined. 15,228 (58.47%) had gastric ulcers. Intact stomachs were detected in 6176 animals (23.71%). Parakeratosis and erosion were observed in 2551 (9.80%) and 2088 (8.02%), respectively. Among eight continuous variables two were found to be significantly associated with prevalence of the gastric ulcer: the growing number of animals in the herd, which was negatively correlated (P = 0.002; ρ = -0.37), and the growing average entry weight of animals transported to the finisher farm (P = 0.047; ρ = 0.24), which increased the risk of gastric ulcers prevalence. Among 12 nominal variables, problems with the quality of farm management (P = 0.041), and usage of straw as a bedding material (P = 0.002) were identified as determinants significantly associated with occurrence of the analysed health problem.\r\nConclusions\r\nAmong 20 non-nutritional variables analysed in our study only few factors were found to be associated with the prevalence of the disease. The impact of broadly understood management issues on gastric health in finishing pigs deserves further research."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198504","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://porcinehealthmanagement.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40813-024-00362-0","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6681afc9fdbe83464abe2c2e","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Cybulski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"53ba30c5-1298-4207-86d9-e44e744c9c15"},{"objectId":"5e70934f878c28a0473a6e5e","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Stadejek","uuid":"BADA35AEDE903C4FA383C9D1E8FE611CF0F3AB630FC46814556D052509D28EBC9963C5FC723D225517EE9CBDE5FF725C616A8D89A737F1202C967F61161B3AF8","orcidId":"0000-0002-8889-8120","documentHash":"2e679c47-38e3-4479-a3a8-fe68dd50a22a"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cb1","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Larska","uuid":"B141F329FCEAE537CBBD403DB20EF5682F61733751D3074FAE52498A02662E8A698C6E4BB506A212CBCAAD49E882CE3BC8B3B325375745B32F8A6A5A8D07E028","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"59dda705-be56-4ee7-9d4e-6b4b6bc19fd5"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b65","name":"Artur","lastName":"Jabłoński","uuid":"24CD11CF70FC912BA7D92DFC17B9939997FB37D8D86BA1344DAE23F699211D724C2ADF8068F5C59B4CB45076D9ECB179FA5DFD2E9D4A6C9D897EFC2F18BD47EB","orcidId":"0000-0002-3796-4132","documentHash":"daf93ced-8263-4547-95c5-e37b432fb679"},{"objectId":"5e709307878c28a0473a17a4","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Woźniak","uuid":"5F5807F7D8A12090CE9E46EF20FBA6AABA6700127108CC2F60F34A701FB1B8589890BDAEBC48DC026439BBE3E3363B70411B3D0F33174E0B7E68B5607B1BB66B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6078-3172","documentHash":"b069e298-14c6-49e5-bb5e-682f1b024085"}],"doi":"10.1186/s40813-024-00362-0"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","uid":"bt6mbuLY9Vpc_KWGkV1Lk4w","uuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709262878c28a047394c23"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Problem marnotrawstwa żywności na przykładzie wyrobów mięsnych – analiza problemu na obszarze województwa lubelskiego","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"61b9ac13ad204581b62ebb5f","mniswId":"201291","title":"Gospodarka Mięsna","doi":null,"issn":"0367-4916","eissn":"2449-9536","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"MINISTRY","editor":null,"documentHash":"13fa0dfd-aef8-44a3-8f5e-04e465107eb7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6745c0e8fdbe832d85ebcbe0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709262878c28a047394c23","67730b92fdbe831a389f0770"]},"issue":"10","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Artykuł dotyczy problemu marnotrawstwa żywności. Straty i marnotrawstwo żywności w czasie pogłębiającego się światowego kryzysu żywnościowego, spowodowanego obecną sytuacją geopolityczną ale także pandemią COVID-19, przyczyniają się do zachwiania bezpieczeństwa żywnościowego. Niedobór żywności jest obecnie ogromnym problemem dla milionów ludzi głodujących na świecie, przede wszystkim w krajach rozwijających się na kontynencie afrykańskim i azjatyckim, ale jak się okazuje nie tylko tych rejonów dotyczy. Dane statystyczne wskazują, że całkowita ilość zmarnotrawionej żywności w krajach Unii Europejskiej w 2020 r. to prawie 57 mln ton. W Polsce z jednej strony marnuje się 4,8 mln ton żywności rocznie, a z drugiej jednocześnie w skrajnym ubóstwie żyje około 1,6 mln osób. Problematyka strat i marnotrawstwa żywności ma również ogromny wpływ na zasoby naturalne, różnorodność biologiczną, środowisko przyrodnicze, gospodarkę i zrównoważony rozwój, zagrażając tym samym bezpieczeństwu żywnościowemu. Problem ten znalazł odzwierciedlenie w unijnych Celach Zrównoważonego Rozwoju. Ograniczenie strat i marnotrawstwa żywności ma szansę przyczynić się do poprawy bezpieczeństwa żywnościowego na świecie oraz dla zmniejszenia presji na środowisko przyrodnicze."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198506","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"151153","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sigma-not.pl/publikacja-151153-problem-marnotrawstwa-%C5%BCywno%C5%9Bci-na-przyk%C5%82adzie-wyrob%C3%B3w-mi%C4%99snych-%E2%80%93-analiza-problemu-na-obszarze-wojew%C3%B3dztwa-lubelskiego-gospodarka-miesna-2024-10.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67730b92fdbe831a389f0770","name":"Beata","lastName":"Paćkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8f931af8-cc98-481d-8dd5-ab2359a3e53e"},{"objectId":"5e709262878c28a047394c23","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Dudziak","uuid":"94CCB44B5D991DE29233C3F043724FB3CE27F9D6E1858D582687142865034DB3467D03E304C856F92F033E52A5AB34E4B3D7BAB8B6EE948EAB6D1F9550F00834","orcidId":"0000-0002-4884-5403","documentHash":"54e1540d-fae7-40ae-b0df-1da137c4a4a6"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["penalized likelihood","regression","model reduction","sparse prediction","information criterion"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","uid":"b_b7HPtUTCJYlxfss9Ssv-A","uuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","parentUuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","rootUuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","name":"Uniwersytet Mikołaja Kopernika w Toruniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092c1878c28a04739c259"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df1a","uid":"bo-gzHUCaPNoq216Hhf4uRQ","uuid":"04d8f337-6a41-4c73-b0ee-a3f1a9293995","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Matematyki, Informatyki i Mechaniki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["633b9aaa7523402e340ef5c5","5e709356878c28a0473a79bf","6763ef0dfdbe830ff2f8c64e"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df15","uid":"bR42jPDMRkKGHv60Y9Q25kQ","uuid":"9b699ae6-6e42-406f-ab02-2d5c171b6c86","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Fizyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["633b9aaa7523402e340ef5c5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Improving Group Lasso for high-dimensional categorical data","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64d2060440970767b851c487","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"5cac621c878c2877157418c4","mniswId":"952","startDate":null,"endDate":null,"fullName":"International Conference on Computational Science","shortName":"ICCS","city":null,"country":null,"website":null,"isEdition":false,"documentHash":"9690889e-bedf-4a40-a0bf-ea4bccddb401"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c1878c28a04739c259","633b9aaa7523402e340ef5c5","5e709356878c28a0473a79bf","6763ef0dfdbe830ff2f8c64e"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Sparse modeling or model selection with categorical data is\r\nchallenging even for a moderate number of variables, because roughly one parameter is needed to encode one category or level. The Group Lasso is a well known efficient algorithm for selection of continuous or categorical variables, but all estimates related to a selected factor usually differ.\r\nTherefore, a fitted model may not be sparse, which makes the model interpretation difficult. To obtain a sparse solution of the Group Lasso, we propose the following two-step procedure: first, we reduce data dimensionality\r\nusing the Group Lasso; then, to choose the final model, we use an information criterion on a small family of models prepared by clustering levels of individual factors. In the consequence, our procedure reduces dimensionality\r\nof the Group Lasso and strongly improves interpretability of the final model. What is important, this reduction results only in the small increase of the prediction error. In the paper we investigate selection correctness of the algorithm in a sparse high-dimensional scenario. We also test our\r\nmethod on synthetic as well as the real data sets and show that it outperforms the state of the art algorithms with respect to the prediction accuracy, model dimension and execution time.

The problem was analyzed, and methods of solving it were presented. Various data acquisition scenarios and their impact on the feasibility of the task were analyzed. A method for detecting smoke objects over buildings using stationary video sequences acquired with a drone in hover with the camera in the nadir position is proposed. The method uses differential frame information from stabilized video sequences and the YOLOv7 classifier. A convolutional network classifier was used to detect the roofs of buildings, using a custom training set adapted to the type of data used. Such a solution, although quite effective, is not very practical for the end user, but it enables the automatic generation of a comprehensive training set for classifiers based on deep neural networks. The effectiveness of such a solution was tested for the latest version of the YOLOv7 classifier. The tests proved the effectiveness of the described method, both for single images and video sequences. In addition, the obtained classifier correctly recognizes objects for sequences that do not meet some of the initial assumptions, such as the angle of the camera capturing the image.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198523","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/4/2235","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70925a878c28a0473944a6","name":"Marek","lastName":"Szczepański","uuid":"90A80009F236E7EA2765059C4C93EE7E3AD01846464064893A194B813060DB133282D48F5B707F2FF1862CE8B86C7AABA87A18393AE4BF8F18C7F208E1EAA411","orcidId":"0000-0003-1501-2154","documentHash":"3efe31bb-295d-42a4-b493-edc2abca8183"}],"doi":"10.3390/s23042235"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bovine luukaemia","cytokines","flow cytometry"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cad","5e709342878c28a0473a5d4f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Cytokine secretion in stem cells of cattle infected with bovine leukaemia virus","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5ebffdcead49b31ccece4fb3","mniswId":null,"title":"Journal of Veterinary Research","doi":null,"issn":"2450-8608","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"287fa6d2-77d3-4359-b58d-23d047d5d8d7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"MARCH","releaseDateYear":2024,"releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":2},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"665ef2304097073a8240b6c5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709342878c28a0473a5d4f","5e709342878c28a0473a5cad"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: Bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) is a Deltaretrovirus responsible for enzootic bovine leukosis, the most common neoplastic disease of cattle. It deregulates the immune system, favouring secondary infections and changes in the blood and lymphatic tissues. Blood homeostasis depends on functional haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Bone marrow is populated by these cells, which express CD34+ and CD35+ surface antigens and produce and release cytokines involved in the maintenance of haematopoiesis. The aim of the study was determination of the profile of cytokine production by CD34+ stem cells of cattle naturally infected with BLV. Material and Methods: The HSCs were generated from the blood and lymphoid organs of cows infected with BLV and healthy control cows with immunomagnetic separation and anti-CD34+ monoclonal antibodies. Isolated CD34+ cells were cultivated for two weeks with interleukin (IL)-4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) were determined in culture fluid by flow cytometry. Results: The expression of IL-6, IL-12p70 and TNF-α in blood HSCs was higher in BLV+ cows than in the control animals. In bone marrow HSCs of infected cows, IL-12, TNF-α and IFN-γ were more concentrated, but in these cows’ spleen HSCs only expression of IL-10 was elevated. In HSCs isolated from the lymph nodes of leukaemic cows, only TNF-α secretion was lower than in control cows, the other cytokines being more potently secreted. Conclusion: Infection with BLV caused statistically significant differences in cytokine expression by HSC CD34+ cells.\nKeywords: bovine leukaemia virus (BLV), stem cells CD34+, cytokines, flow cytometry."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198525","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66179b27409707791fcbd7da","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"68","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"695a3039-005c-4a80-8a7f-9d491b7d2271"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"68","pagesFromTo":"19-33","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/jvetres-2024-0012","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d4f","name":"Maria","lastName":"Szczotka","uuid":"ADF16A0DC33C7E23F46E1C620BBE349C2AB6A18A9C9909107A228536F5F1742277D154D2DCD82C6537D2A8632E5C4391955675EADA516AAA2CDFD89BA5D564C5","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ebfccb1f-95d9-4d87-86f7-3bbcd1ac8dd1"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cad","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Kuźmak","uuid":"DCBC0C5773B0C346D5DBB40E3262D8E29184B62793C0D18E82B24E595E4F33FDCB74C41AEC4D6B60F253051482EC522138B936B5ED82B4345F33391A0BD19DAB","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b123658e-4d9a-4155-9ddf-df23aa13556a"}],"doi":"10.2478/jvetres-2024-0012"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","uid":"bt6mbuLY9Vpc_KWGkV1Lk4w","uuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ab878c28a0473aec7e","5e709225878c28a047390a5f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Assessment of the effectiveness of open-cast sand mine reclamation","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479bc1","mniswId":"540","title":"Advances in Science and Technology-Research Journal","doi":null,"issn":"2080-4075","eissn":"2299-8624","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d231421f-b42b-42c2-879b-aa7186856cf8"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-11-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67404976fdbe832d853a40b3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709225878c28a047390a5f","5e7093ab878c28a0473aec7e","6773050dfdbe831a389f002b"]},"issue":"8","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the study was to assess the effect of sewage sludge (industrial and municipal) as components of com-\r\nposites with anthropogenic soil, used to create the top (0–25 cm) cover layer of open-cast sand mine reclamation\r\non the content of organic carbon and plant nutrients (total N and available forms of P, K and Mg).

The study aimed to analyze the prevalence, and define the impact on the species conservation, the source of coronavirus infection, and the role of the European bison in the transmission of the pathogen in Poland. Molecular and serological screening was performed on 409 European bison from 6 free-ranging and 14 captive herds over the period of 6 years (2017–2023). Presence of coronavirus was confirmed in one nasal swab by pancoronavirus RT-PCR and in 3 nasal swab samples by bovine coronavirus (BCoV) specific real time RT-PCR. The detected virus showed high (> 98%) homology in both RdRp and Spike genes to BCoV strains characterised recently in Polish cattle and strains isolated from wild cervids in Italy. Antibodies specific to BCoV were found in 6.4% of tested samples, all originating from free-ranging animals. Seroprevalence was higher in adult animals over 5 years of age (p = 0.0015) and in females (p = 0.09). Our results suggest that European bison play only a limited role as reservoirs of bovine-like coronaviruses. Although the most probable source of infections in the European bison population in Poland is cattle, other wild ruminants could also be involved. In addition, the zoonotic potential of bovine coronaviruses is quite low."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060198551","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6597d34e40970755be5e2b9e","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"7b2bf3c4-186e-4bd9-8908-044ad024e285"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"12928","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-63717-1.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6661772d409707458fb21ea5","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Pomorska-Mól","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a4025aca-8ee4-4ab3-a7a3-aa8ae7750cd6"},{"objectId":"6661772d409707458fb21ea4","name":"Michał K.","lastName":"Krzysiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"13712243-cd60-4664-b6c5-f1dbe98db594"},{"objectId":"6661772d409707458fb21ea3","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Tomana","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7e4e5514-b2c0-4134-9dee-81f9b2a7d556"},{"objectId":"5e7093ed878c28a0473b36c5","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Socha","uuid":"6036D7D79FB2FDA007337AD74DA8CE2A06BA94CA316C1481598BAB1EEA1C0EB837183E2A083D8667A9FABD63781EA3F34A131ABDDF2FAE34F4D7B3042BA7CD76","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cf42920a-12a6-4167-a84a-a72b77b3acc1"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5cb1","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Larska","uuid":"B141F329FCEAE537CBBD403DB20EF5682F61733751D3074FAE52498A02662E8A698C6E4BB506A212CBCAAD49E882CE3BC8B3B325375745B32F8A6A5A8D07E028","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"59dda705-be56-4ee7-9d4e-6b4b6bc19fd5"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-024-63717-1"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","uid":"bt6mbuLY9Vpc_KWGkV1Lk4w","uuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Lublinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709225878c28a0473909a4","61cbd6397523401fc10d7961","5e709463878c28a0473bc0eb","5e709224878c28a0473908c6","5e70947c878c28a0473be3c1","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a98","67730516fdbe831a389f021d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Mycolicibacterium fortuitum (Mycobacterium fortuitum) complex infection in a captive Soccoro dove (Zenaida graysoni)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478e2c","mniswId":"14214","title":"Medycyna Weterynaryjna","doi":null,"issn":"0025-8628","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"7e1ddf8d-ae73-466a-a954-ccae7c1919cf"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2024-05-16","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67404457fdbe832d8539e709","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947c878c28a0473be3c1","5e709224878c28a0473908c6","61cbd6397523401fc10d7961","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a98","5e709463878c28a0473bc0eb","5e709225878c28a0473909a4","67730516fdbe831a389f021b","67730516fdbe831a389f021c","67730516fdbe831a389f021d"]},"issue":"10","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Mycobacteriosis caused by Mycolicibacterium fortuitum (formely Mycobacterium fortuitum) occurs all over\r\nthe world and has been reported in mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and, most often, in fish.

Therefore, it is intended primarily for students of philosophy and doctoral students. The authors’ intention is to offer an introduction to independent philosophical work adopting the resources offered by digital humanities, a field which has recently revolutionized the humanities. Digital technologies have significantly changed the ways of working with texts. The introduction of digital tools into philosophy makes it possible to study its broader context and track distant connections between ideas, and significantly facilitates work on source material.\nThe book consists of seven chapters covering the main issues of modern methodology in philosophy. We begin by introducing how to study philosophy, how to find trustworthy texts, and how to benefit from using a library, which is the basic workplace for the humanist. Then we turn to the computer as an important tool of the contemporary philosopher, and discuss topics such as text editing, and the use of search engines for locating Internet resources. The third chapter is devoted to matters related to philosophical writing. We start with ethical issues, and then look at the main types of philosophical works. We also deal with the characteristics of the disseration as a genre. In the fourth part of the book, we discuss the formatting of lists of references and footnotes. The next chapter deals with the art of presenting one’s own research results – in this part of the book we outline the best practices in designing lectures and multimedia presentations.\nIn the last two chapters, which are mainly intended for PhD students.

It has been shown that the two main components of mineral dust silica (SiO2) and alumina (Al2O3), the proportion of which in the dust reaches 95%, have at the same time the highest hardness, which determines the wear of engine components. It has been shown that the greatest wear of two frictionally cooperating surfaces is caused by dust grains with sizes equal to the thickness of the oil film at any given time. It was shown that all dust grains with grain sizes above 1 μm cause accelerated wear of two mating components, but the greatest wear is caused by grains in the 5÷20 μm range. The effect of excessive wear of the piston‑piston ring‑cylinder (P-PR-C) association of the engine, resulting from actual vehicle operation and bench tests, on the decrease in compression pressure, the intensity of exhaust gas purging into the oil sump and engine power is presented. It was shown that the primary component of oil contamination is mineral dust, which penetrates from the intake air into the oil located on the surface of the cylinder liner, from where the rings scrape it into the oil sump. The effect of dust particles on the erosive wear of the compressor and turbine in the engine supercharger is discussed. The results of an empirical study of the effect of deposition of mineral dust grains and oil on the measuring element of the air flow meter on the change in the value of the generated output voltage, which is a measure of the air flow into the engine, are presented."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060201670","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"70","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ts.publisherspanel.com/issue/16559","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a04739948d","name":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Dziubak","uuid":"E5ED48A59EAB21E93EE4D5B207902380461240E8E7AD5925B32E2DA9863591B1B6BA06E57594A350665F62C710A54786EEEF54119D441C728571857E831F2A68","orcidId":"0000-0002-1609-3518","documentHash":"ba0e60fb-9075-4f53-86e1-b060bdef5521"}],"doi":"10.5604/01.3001.0054.8182"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Interwencje

veinal necrosis caused by the potato virus Y (PVY) substantially affects yields and crop quality of tobacco. PVY shows high variability in virulence due to numerous mutations and recombinations. The types of resistance available for tobacco include the va type, effective against some PVY isolates but succumbing to others, and the Nicotiana africana-derived type, fully effective in its native genetic milieu but limited to varying degrees of tolerance when transferred to N. tabacum. The objective of this study was to evaluate the pyramiding potential of these two sources of resistance in alloploid hybrids of Nicotiana tabacum x N. africana. To this end, amphidiploids involving N. tabacum cvs. VAM and Wiślica, each being the carrier of a different variant of the va gene, were created and advanced from F1 to two subsequent selfed generations and to BC1 generation with either VAM or Wiślica as the recurrent N. tabacum parent. The hybrid populations thus produced were challenged with two PVY necrotic isolates, IUNG 23 and IUNG 20, mild and severe isolate belonging to the PVYN-Wi and PVYNTN groups, respectively. The mild isolate failed to infect any of the hybrids or parental species. The hybrids varied in their response to IUNG 20. The F1 and F2 populations were composed of asymptomatic hosts to PVY and of those showing mild vein clearing but no necrotic plants. There was a progressive increase in ability to resist PVY in successive amphidiploid generations, with 30 and 10% of fully resistant plants appearing in the F3 amphidiploids involving VAM and Wiślica. Further research is needed to account for the appearance of segregants completely resistant to PVY, since neither N. africana factor is fully expressed in N. tabacum, nor do the va alleles confer resistance against PVYNTN isolates."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060201681","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6756e4f2fdbe833c07e85f9e","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"12","doi":null,"documentHash":"01177292-a047-45f6-abf8-0708333543e1"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"2284","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/14/12/2284/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70949d878c28a0473c079e","name":"Anna","lastName":"Depta","uuid":"1A495BC3C3821C8824119AE99D644887EA3BFD6B679D0B4D7BCDA0EE898A9B9E21DACDB0FF5B03652312BF2C53438ADE5960B3C87268D07D057F6048E647E38A","orcidId":"0000-0001-7578-5197","documentHash":"6bcf99f0-b84f-476e-89ac-e7fbc32c5204"},{"objectId":"5e709298878c28a047398b4a","name":"Teresa","lastName":"Doroszewska","uuid":"125128816E9C97895B68C6D24A47D784B6B3EDDBE1D72D9DA7840D80C90C2F54E8F8933EB3C7511CEFF2CF70EB42708A6726404EB1E3E9A3A4A75A410D10A7A3","orcidId":"0000-0002-2362-7119","documentHash":"38f2f7c6-4b7f-4e6e-928c-964b36ec41c7"},{"objectId":"5e709298878c28a047398a66","name":"Apoloniusz","lastName":"Berbeć","uuid":"C63E426736201C4BC50661418DAEB13605C5F2B91106CB1306CE998E081AC9DD1B4841A9D60E9A4F6352A293D90079B9F8AE1BBB23B629B3CBE71362FB6A3C9E","orcidId":"0000-0003-2021-4199","documentHash":"cea1c56a-0c70-41ce-a4fc-81dc1a108e0d"}],"doi":"10.3390/agriculture14122284"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["sekwencjonowanie","uczenie maszynowe","przetwarzanie języka naturalnego","wyrównywanie","transkryptomika"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["natural language processing","transcriptomics","machine learning","alignment","sequencing"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709204878c28a04738eb73","617373a97523400564d230a0"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A mapping-free natural language processing-based technique for sequence search in nanopore long-reads","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454773be","mniswId":"2599","title":"BMC Bioinformatics","doi":null,"issn":"1471-2105","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"2b949bb1-b4de-4a9f-85c1-cc1cbe4f4e98"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-11-13","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"677279e9fdbe831a387ef90a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["617373a97523400564d230a0","5e709204878c28a04738eb73","67727b57fdbe831a387f60e5","67727b57fdbe831a387f60e6","67727b57fdbe831a387f60e7"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In unforeseen situations, such as nuclear power plant’s or civilian radiation accidents, there is a need for effective and computationally inexpensive methods to determine the expression level of a selected gene panel, allowing for rough dose estimates in thousands of donors.

Autor ukazał nie tylko ponadczasową wartość nauczania Błogosławionego, ale również – w wielu aspektach – prekursorski charakter tego nauczania. Wykorzystując odpowiednio dobrane cytaty, pokazał zarówno ludzki, jak i duchowy klimat towarzyszący nauczaniu Prymasa i jego niezwykle barwny oraz pełen różnorodnych skojarzeń i porównań, a przy tym prosty i zrozumiały, język poszczególnych wypowiedzi."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The monograph \"The Spirituality of lay Catholics. A study of the teachings of Blessed Stefan Wyszyński\" examines the teaching of the Primate of the Millennium on three key topics: the vocation of lay Catholics to holiness and apostolate and the Marian dimension of their spiritual life. The treatment of these concerns is preceded by an overview of the impact of Blessed Stefan Wyszynski on the development of the Polish theological thought. The author demonstrates not only the timeless value of teaching of the  Blessed, but also in many aspects its pioneering nature in relation to the later teaching of the Church. Through well chosen passages he conveys both the human and spiritual setting of the Primate's teaching and its extraordinarily colorful language rich in various analogies and comparisons, while remaining simple and accessible."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060201735","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":"Studia i Materiały - Uniwersytet im.

timeline of the presence of Polish poetry in Italy in the period 1991-2021 can be divided into two spans of equal length. Up until 2006, the scene is dominated by the masters of the second half of the twentieth century, Zbigniew Herbert, Czeslaw Milosz, Tadeusz Rózewicz and Wislawa Szymborska, albeit with various publishing fortunes. Since 2006, some new directions have been observed. Italian translators and publishers began to benefit from the support of the Book Institute (an organisation inaugurated by the government in 2004 to promote Polish books abroad), further stimulated by the arrival of a poet, Jaroslaw Mikolajewski, as director of the Polish Institute in Rome in 2006. This led to the translation and publication of many works of Polish literature in Italy. In particular, many poets who were young at the time (born after I960) flourished. At the same time important gaps were also gradually beginning to be filled, a process that can only be said to be almost complete in recent years. Indeed, since late 2010s translators and publishers have finally started to turn to Renaissance and 19th century poetry, with the publication or re-edition of important works by Jan Kochanowski (also from Latin) and Adam Mickiewicz (see for instance Pan Tadeusz). As far as twentieth-century poetry is concerned, discrete attention has been paid to the poets of Nowa Fala (of particular note are the italian successes of Adam Zagajewski and Ewa Lipska), but pre-World War II poetry remains almost unknown. A separate discourse should be made for Karol Wojtyla, the popular pope who, at least until his death in 2005, saw his poems reprinted several times in Italy, and especially for Szymborska, whose fortunes in Italy have been quite exceptional and always on the rise since being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1996. The article gives an account of the books published during the thirty-year period, presenting and analysing data and also focusing on the work of translators and publishers; it also shows the importance of other channels for the dissemination of Polish poetry during the thirty-year period: blogs, newspapers, magazines, festivals, etc. Some hints are also made about the presence of Polish poetry in the works of Italian authors (poets, writers, musicians). Finally, the author outlines some working hypotheses for translators, scholars and publishers in the coming years."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060201759","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"42","pagesFromTo":"19-37","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://rosa.uniroma1.it/rosa01/europa_orientalis/article/view/2839/2516","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2be1","name":"Leonardo","lastName":"Masi","uuid":"3F0D37750CE9668BEDD9373A8CB1732FE7C7AD107E1B79C14CDACFB3D19C237535D707558921913BE34BB3A77D200C0B721661C454D9BC4528677FAC39CAE7CF","orcidId":"0000-0003-0085-8405","documentHash":"548aa9d8-985d-4b5d-85cf-179757f214c9"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["psychologiczne koncepcje kryzysów","interwencja w kryzysie psychicznym","rozwój osobowości","kryzys psychiczny"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["psychological crisis","psychological crisis intervention","psychological concepts of crises","personality development"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"677273cafdbe831a387dd9f6","doi":null,"title":"Pomoc osobie w kryzysie","year":2023,"volume":"62","isbn":"978-83-68027-00-6","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://researchportal.amu.edu.pl/info/book/UAMca700431025d4c218b83638a947c2250/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"010ef5a6-937a-4831-93fe-f9cb235b1153","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb948","mniswId":"72800","name":"Wydawnictwo Pallottinum","documentHash":"698d4d2d-981d-477a-ada0-b06ffa466de5"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de17","uid":"bPE2PjbeOl7yC2KHqaQECkQ","uuid":"9eec5244-9085-4de9-9ad9-a77b7ad693bc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de17","parentUuid":"9eec5244-9085-4de9-9ad9-a77b7ad693bc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de17","rootUuid":"9eec5244-9085-4de9-9ad9-a77b7ad693bc","name":"Uniwersytet im.

Najpierw zajęto się historią teorii kryzysu, by następnie ukazać i poddać ocenie klasyczne ujęcie kryzysu rozumianego jako zaburzenia homeostazy. Kolejną omawianą koncepcją kryzysu jest podejście poznawcze, które przyjmuje, że kryzys emocjonalny łączy się z procesami kognitywnymi i ich zaburzeniami. Przeciwwagą dla podejść traktujących kryzys w sposób kliniczny jest koncepcja rozwojowa kryzysu, która ukazuje jego charakter normatywny i pozytywny dla rozwoju osobistego w ciągu życia. Na koniec, ukazany zostaje psychosocjokulturowy paradygmat kryzysu, który eksponuje w kryzysie charakter salutogenetyczny oraz holistyczny. Szczególnie podkreślona zostaje koncepcja resilience, która obejmuje zdolność człowieka do „odbijania się od dna” i szybkiego powrotu do zdrowia psychicznego w obliczu wydarzeń traumatycznych. Analizę kończy przedstawienie integracyjnej koncepcji kryzysu o charakterze eklektycznym. Oprócz ukazania różnorodności powyższych podejść, często należących do wielorakich kierunków psychologii, w artykule określono pewną ciągłość rozwoju koncepcji kryzysu w ostatnich dziesięcioleciach. Jednocześnie potwierdzona została słuszność dalszego posługiwania się pojęciem kryzysu, nawet w obliczu pewnych niejasności teoretycznych i niejednoznaczności poszczególnych koncepcji kryzysu."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article analyses the issue of how psychologists use the concept of crisis. First, the history of crisis theory is described. Then, the classic approach to the crisis, understood as disturbances in homeostasis, was presented and assessed. Another concept of crisis discussed is the cognitive approach, which assumes that emotional crisis is related to cognitive processes and their disorders. A counterbalance to approaches that treat crisis in a clinical way is the developmental concept of crisis, which shows its normative and positive nature for personal development throughout life. Finally, the psychosociocultural paradigm of crisis is presented, which highlights the salutogenetic and holistic nature of the crisis. Particularly emphasised is the concept of resilience, which includes a person’s ability to „bounce back” and quickly regain mental health in the face of traumatic events. The analysis ends with the presentation of an integrative concept of crisis of an eclectic nature. In addition to showing the diversity of the above approaches, often belonging to various fields of psychology, the article shows a certain continuity in the development concept of crisis in recent decades. At the same time, the validity of continuing to use the concept of crisis was confirmed, even in the face of certain theoretical ambiguities and ambiguity of individual crisis concepts."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060201763","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"9-57","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://researchportal.amu.edu.pl/info/article/UAM69445f3c1b9440868e9d7a83cc966f31/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092f1878c28a04739f9e2","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Soiński","uuid":"956725FE24FE7FC7672A14934796C9BF87346032343A5F06651BB033B7E742D3D4104733F04655E7DCD599B5168BF22529DC52D94AAA5EFBB4BCE41F7A3D6C28","orcidId":"0000-0003-4212-2711","documentHash":"b5542f65-1f8c-457f-90c5-c5bf9383595d"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["błogosławieństwa","miłosierdzie pastoralne","pary w sytuacjach nieregularnych","pary tej samej płci"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["couples in irregular situations","blessings","pastoral mercy","same-sex couples"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6772702bfdbe831a387d5301","doi":null,"title":"Fiducia supplicans","year":2024,"volume":"19","isbn":"978-83-7014-998-7","ismn":null,"issn":"1898-2972","url":"https://researchportal.amu.edu.pl/info/book/UAMa5c3ce50e86c446bb799c0c64baac20b/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"de3b7aff-6b7c-4713-bf1c-755d994abe0f","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb948","mniswId":"72800","name":"Wydawnictwo Pallottinum","documentHash":"698d4d2d-981d-477a-ada0-b06ffa466de5"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de17","uid":"bPE2PjbeOl7yC2KHqaQECkQ","uuid":"9eec5244-9085-4de9-9ad9-a77b7ad693bc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de17","parentUuid":"9eec5244-9085-4de9-9ad9-a77b7ad693bc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de17","rootUuid":"9eec5244-9085-4de9-9ad9-a77b7ad693bc","name":"Uniwersytet im.

Wartość tej deklaracji polega głównie na tym, iż wnosi ona nowatorski wkład w duszpasterskie znaczenie błogosławieństw, co pozwala poszerzyć i wzbogacić ich klasyczne rozumienie, ściśle związane z perspektywą liturgiczną. Prezentowana w deklaracji teologiczna refleksja opiera się na duszpasterskiej wizji papieża Franciszka i stanowi rzeczywisty rozwój w odniesieniu do tego, co do tej pory zostało powiedziane o błogosławieństwach przez Magisterium i w nauczaniu Kościoła.

The importance of this declaration stems mainly from the fact that it makes a unique and innovative contribution to the pastoral meaning of blessings, allowing for a broadening and enrichment of the classical understanding of blessings, which is closely linked to a liturgical perspective. The theological reflection presented in the declaration is founded on Pope Francis’ pastoral vision and constitutes a significant advance in comparison to what has previously been said about blessings by the Magisterium and contained in Church teachings. The article begins by delving into the declaration’s main theological and pastoral premises, followed by a discussion of the varied reactions of Catholic circles to the document. Finally, the causes of dispute about the content of the document are addressed, including whether it is feasible, as suggested by the Dicastery, to separate the blessing of a particular couple from a specific type of union they establish that is not sanctioned by the Church. The declaration demonstrates that Francis' policy represents the Church's shift away from absolutizing any matters by canon law and toward decentralization of authority in the governance of the Church."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060201771","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"11-30","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://researchportal.amu.edu.pl/info/article/UAMc1c17cf28c30489ab3ded2edddfb8f5e/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092f1878c28a04739f9dd","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Bohdanowicz","uuid":"82AB4ADECD61DD6F60D8B6BE3C171F21E4224F44B611BCA39131BFBB9044DD382FB680E8BCB52ACD1B0FBA977D90B357FB66FC7687F65DEA2CC039BFBEFB85E3","orcidId":"0000-0001-6799-9515","documentHash":"79d7c7e8-1848-4ff1-a129-6e58d8da9b19"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Rola

paper presents a concept of architecture and ontology layouts for the development of multiagent model-based predictive control systems. The presented architecture provides guidelines to simplify the development of agent-based systems and improve their maintainability. The proposed multiagent system (MAS) layout is split into multiple subsystems that include agents dedicated to performing assigned tasks. MAS implementation was prepared which can use provided algorithms and actuators and can react to changes in its environment to reach the best available control quality. An example of MAS based on the proposed architecture is shown in the application of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration control in a laboratory-activated sludge setup with a biological reactor. For that application, MAS incorporates agent-based controllers from the boundary-based predictive controllers (BBPC) family. Presented experiments prove the flexibility, resilience, and online reconfiguration ability of the proposed multiagent system."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060201785","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"72","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.pan.pl/Content/131105/PDF-MASTER/BPASTS_2024_72_4_4192.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebedc2b752340254fc42074","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Pośpiech","uuid":"C3BEF531A07273DC81DED606F23CE4664238C738BEAF4175259665A89BD4A6B12558DD295C92D3819DEFA02E85A8DA38B2AB879864CA295008B76E2474E22752","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1e184824-8ca7-4dd7-8c27-dc52bf5f6745"},{"objectId":"5e70927d878c28a0473968f9","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Stebel","uuid":"14C5BC8FB314F0C02424E53793E9B9666BF50A70CC2A9A3AEA583D4971FA483EEE5ABDE41158DFA645524A23F288C1566702E3B319D030592EB6F11624EC3CE9","orcidId":"0000-0003-2912-6742","documentHash":"784ded09-cf58-489d-b1dd-2addb8973e6b"},{"objectId":"5e709220878c28a0473903a1","name":"Witold","lastName":"Nocoń","uuid":"B425E78DE5E865B3B879719E7FAE1E078957F713579CB5E8CF27D4CE3EC693300C26CB65B3DC3AF489C3755344449CCD99A2167969D6F966A2984F1E4A3D368D","orcidId":"0000-0002-4785-958X","documentHash":"6559e08b-bc57-4c3f-814d-8deee9744493"}],"doi":"10.24425/bpasts.2024.150114"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Wrodzona przepuklina przeponowa - diagnostyka i leczenie","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a269","mniswId":"1001554","title":"Pediatria po Dyplomie","doi":null,"issn":"1508-0110","eissn":"2449-965X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"f97013ed-ad4f-4610-9790-b86098cdce97"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67724766fdbe831a38689ae8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70933e878c28a0473a582f"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060201786","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"26","pagesFromTo":"41-49","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://podyplomie.pl/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70933e878c28a0473a582f","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Lange","uuid":"42B41DD233482837BFFA13D61ADC1350C8DB06BAAD828DEBC70B2C8B900B755B08505F53102381BAE99020C73CD2870CB079AB90B74881C6D3ED8F8980F00085","orcidId":"0000-0003-4165-6455","documentHash":"3aa57171-7e80-4855-9ffb-92c6802a16c8"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"włoski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":"9791254961117","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Ad posteritatem.

Furthermore, a universal modification is proposed that can improve the MCS performance by adding a feedforward compensator. Both numerical and experimental tests are conducted to validate the introduced concepts.

Especially important in this is research on coastal tourism, which is both a linear and area-based activity. An increased interest in coastal tourism has been determined by the fact that around 40 percent of the world’s population lives on the coast or within the coastal zone, and these communities are dependent on coastal tourism besides their other professions, such as fisheries, agriculture, and commercial port activities.\n\nNordic coasts combine a rich maritime heritage and tradition with an unrivalled diversity of landscapes and natural refuges. Its oceans and seas are known for their biological richness and great beauty. Coastal and maritime tourism constitutes one of the Nordic countries' most important touristic thematic sub-sectors. With further perspectives for growth in the coming years, coastal and maritime tourism’s full potential is yet to be unveiled. Guaranteeing the conditions for sustainable coastal and maritime tourism development may significantly contribute to Nordic's economic growth and employment. It can also support the sustainable development of the more remote coastal regions, bringing the Nordics closer together and endowing coastal communities with sustainable solutions for the future."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060201822","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-73187-7","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-73187-7"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Psychomotor

UV radiation is measured using a custom UV scanner at different distances from the burner in the vertical combustion chamber. The designed scanner uses a sensitive silicon carbide (SiC) photodiode, and its dynamical properties are investigated in the present work. Subsequently, experiments are performed for coal particles at different combustion temperatures and at different measuring locations of the scanner. The measurement data are processed in the frequency domain using the proposed algorithm, and two indicators for evaluating the combustion intensity are proposed. The obtained results show that the proposed indicators provide unequivocal information about the combustion intensity as a function of the combustion temperature."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060201856","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2224-2708/13/6/68","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67726d50fdbe831a387ce3d5","name":"J.

a remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) is an extremely challenging task that requires precise maneuvering and navigation in complex and often unpredictable environments. The operator faces numerous difficulties, including limited visibility and communication constraints, and the need to interpret data from various sensors. This paper describes a method for calibration of a wearable system equipped with inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors that control the underwater manipulators. To implement a solution that allows the robot to be controlled by the operator's hand movements, it is necessary to measure the movement of the arm. This task is carried out using the IMU sensors, which are mounted in appropriate places on the ROV operator's suit to allow mapping the movement of his/her upper limbs. These movements are transferred to the manipulator's arms on the ROV, making it possible to interact with the environment by - manipulating objects under-water."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060201866","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"36-46","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.astrj.com/Underwater-Human-Arm-Manipulator-System-Calibration,183569,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67726066fdbe831a3875ad68","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kozyra","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"43d36dec-2a3d-475c-affb-c041360cfb38"},{"objectId":"6174c5287523400564d2b064","name":"Piotr ","lastName":"Ściegienka ","uuid":"F03F9C338E1456B9DAEAA28117E13BE12748A1C20F54FA55C513360BC2AA419E29D65E07D60B05842C7E0A24257DF625BA619A96E8451F4E9ADF557E7DB92254","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"37dae737-f294-47c7-aa7b-24e97cf984cd"},{"objectId":"5e70946c878c28a0473bcbe6","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Grzejszczak","uuid":"7FE7C429F29C1398D12917EFB7FD6DC8EBA5890C1463DA4CF28D30297CBBAFD272A2942F4C42B46D112B256A74E4527D9BE24421EA91E446D7A8107121E6B6E0","orcidId":"0000-0002-1114-3619","documentHash":"5b3f0f90-8080-4998-ba2b-e7dba7f74479"},{"objectId":"5e70927a878c28a04739674f","name":"Robert","lastName":"Bieda","uuid":"CF4773AE1C3DE823D83E73E2876A13E39BAE224E4A82CF5BAC2A43336060A19D04917BC7AD5C4488796EF26BE9554916800B4EBE25C088EA976690E45B5DD88A","orcidId":"0000-0001-7485-0073","documentHash":"228bdc59-d468-4af8-8c38-d42fc9c428b2"},{"objectId":"5e709264878c28a047394e05","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Jaskot","uuid":"9D658989000EB9B5BB58C0F56DF458E794BE0EFC10F8F35EFC661EB084F0ED34E702198BE1669F6F09035C758D198466E40D9C56AC2087B33DDD3A02C2763EF6","orcidId":"0000-0001-9557-9366","documentHash":"13c445d2-87be-4e53-a496-e99a81911ff5"},{"objectId":"5e709222878c28a04739066e","name":"Artur","lastName":"Babiarz","uuid":"8153E4FCA40FD556094888C065B728DA0F6B6AEFC2DB7A530C4CE9717955FA6C3A2B09780BBB47EFF7372337D097599BE9D990BE3ACE5B39E55D83C728983DBA","orcidId":"0000-0002-7841-7151","documentHash":"1b156a17-c48d-4b0f-941a-1bdba9bc7ddb"}],"doi":"10.12913/22998624/183569"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["MOS","operator Grünwalda-Letnikova","pochodna ułamkowa","obraz kolorowy","ocena jakości obrazu"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["MOS","color image","fractional derivative","image quality assessment","Grünwald-Letnikov operator"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a1878c28a047399956","5e709210878c28a04738f5a9"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Application of fractional derivatives in image quality assessment indices","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547713b","mniswId":"1493","title":"Applied Numerical Mathematics","doi":null,"issn":"0168-9274","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"522215a2-2e20-4cb0-be86-8a2fddff9303"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-06-07","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67727163fdbe831a387d6edf","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092a1878c28a047399956","5e709210878c28a04738f5a9"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objective image quality assessment involves the use of mathematical models to quantitatively describe image quality. FR-IQA (Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment) methods using reference images are also often used to evaluate image processing and computer vision algorithms. Quality indices often use gradient operators to express relevant visual information, such as edges. Fractional calculus has been applied in the last two decades in various fields such as signal processing, image processing, and pattern recognition. Fractional derivatives are generalizations of integer-order derivatives and can be computed using various operators such as the Riemann-Liouville, Caputo-Fabrizio, and Grünwald-Letnikov operators. In this paper, we propose a modification of the FSIMc image quality index by including fractional derivatives to extract and enhance edges. A study of the usefulness of fractional derivative in the FSIMc model was conducted by assessing Pearson, Spearman and Kendall correlations with MOS scores for images from the TID2013 and KADID-10k databases. Comparison of FD_FSIMc with the classic FSIMc shows an increase of several percent in the correlation coefficients for the modified index. The results obtained are superior to those other known approaches to FR-IQA that use fractional derivatives. The results encourage the use of fractional calculus."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060201873","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"204","pagesFromTo":"101-110","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092a1878c28a047399956","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Frąckiewicz","uuid":"65DE756F8134C4846064CCBBF1BF7891336AFD309CA9C572B8ECC16A1934CB59ED738B0243B7D0AC06D21BACA0C46E0036107271180E09120E41F5BAE939E08B","orcidId":"0000-0002-3147-2348","documentHash":"1b7bc2b8-3bc1-4a93-ac75-d624721799cf"},{"objectId":"5e709210878c28a04738f5a9","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Palus","uuid":"5D87E5540FB708A8D4EA717A9AC2AA1200AE5E0F836C8FC5613BCF0EE791DE8648ED6387E1C4F165CEE5F50A5D3E4719BCDAB3841DC3810C4224251BBF360D16","orcidId":"0000-0002-4044-7531","documentHash":"60f287d1-2111-4ef4-8cf3-bdf527d91f75"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.apnum.2024.06.005"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62d51cec4097074b28a7a7b1","doi":"10.53271/2022.028","title":"Chirurgia.
