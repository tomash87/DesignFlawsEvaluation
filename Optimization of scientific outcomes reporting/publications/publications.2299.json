By strategically placing a flight-ready superconducting magnet at varied positions in the Schiaparelli reentry capsule of the ExoMars mission, we discern its impact on essential flow properties. The primary consequence of MHD during atmospheric entry is the generation of the Lorentz force, which increases the shock standoff distance resulting in a reduction of the heat flux on the spacecraft by pushing high-energy plasma particles away. Through different magnet configurations, three distinct cases are formed to comprehensively understand the effects and implications of each setup. The study is performed using the COOLFluiD MHD\r\nfor EnTries, an in-house ATD solver. For case 1, the magnet’s placement behind the ExoMars forebody at the stagnation point reduces the heat flux. In case 2, the magnet’s relocation to the shoulder region explores its potential to mitigate communication blackouts by influenc-\r\ning the wake region’s flow. However, this positioning also induces shock bending, leading to variations in post-shock species mass frac- tions and heat flux spikes in the post-shock region. Case 3, involving an additional magnet where the shock bends in case 1, showcases a consistent increase in shock standoff distance across the forebody, providing a longer relaxation zone for species equilibration. Our find-\r\nings highlight that while the strength of the applied magnetic field is crucial, the magnet’s size is equally pivotal in determining ATD behavior. Case 3 emerges as the most promising configuration, consistently reducing heat flux across the forebody and maintaining it in\r\nthe afterbody. This study underscores the potential of multi-magnet configurations as next-generation MHD heat shields for Martian atmospheric entry, emphasizing the criticality of magnet placement and configuration in enabling future MHD-enhanced deep space\r\nexploration missions.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739075","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"36","pagesFromTo":"1-25","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article/36/3/036103/3268289/Influence-of-magnetohydrodynamics-configuration-on","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6645f02a409707626369c8d5","name":"Andrea","lastName":"

the present work, potentiometric sensors with polymer membranes used for chlorhexidine (CHXD) determination were developed.

The active compounds used in the membrane were cyclodextrins, crown ethers, and ion exchangers. The best-constructed electrode was based on neutral heptakis(2,3,6-tri-O-benzoyl)-β-cyclodextrin with lipophilic salt (KTpClBP)—potassium tetrakis(4-chlorophenyl) borate—dissolved in plasticizer, DOS. The presented electrode is characterized by an average cationic slope of 30.9 ± 2.9 mV decade−1 within a linear range of 1 × 10−6 to 1 × 10−3 mol × L−1, while the value of the correlation coefficient is 0.9970 ± 0.0026. The response time was about 5 s when increasing the sample concentration and about 10 s when diluting the sample. The electrode potential is independent of the pH within a range of 4.0–9.5. The polymeric membrane sensor was successfully applied for assays of chlorhexidine digluconate in pure samples and pharmaceutical samples. The relative error from three replicate measurements was determined to be 1.1%. and the accuracy was RSD = 0.3–1.1%.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739080","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"9508","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/23/9508","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65ca0c5f40970762634cb75d","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Sokal","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"613864bb-5210-4ded-991f-c8d15bbe147a"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a008c","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Lenik","uuid":"68EDD5AA03089A468BEEDFE193635A847D5CFE7C67CDE73F7A56AA200DDADBD370EECE513BC5C73391F959277C2D1736C496FB6AEEE470AC6D40C0C58882606F","orcidId":"0000-0002-2364-4429","documentHash":"ac488f3a-b579-4b0b-9e75-31fce9034134"}],"doi":"10.3390/s23239508"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["thermal resistance","internal structure","porous microspheres"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f7878c28a0473a0246","5e7092f7878c28a0473a024d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Porous Copolymers of 3-(Trimethoxysilyl)propyl Methacrylate with Trimethylpropane Trimethacrylate Preparation: Structural Characterization and Thermal Degradation","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1944","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-09-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6711f386fdbe831eab26af9a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f7878c28a0473a0246","5e7092f7878c28a0473a024d"]},"issue":"19","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>Porous polymeric microspheres are among the most effective adsorbents. They can be synthesized from numerous monomers using different kinds of polymerization techniques with a broad selection of synthesis factors. The main goal of this study was to prepare copolymeric microspheres and establish the relationship between copolymerization parameters and the porosity and thermal stability of the newly synthesized materials. Porous microspheres were obtained via heterogenous radical copolymerization using 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (TMPSM) as functional monomers and trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate (TRIM) as the crosslinker. In the course of the copolymerization, toluene or chlorobenzene was used as the pore-forming diluent. Consequently, highly porous microspheres were produced. Their specific surface area was established by a nitrogen adsorption/desorption method and it was in the range of 382 m2/g to 457 m2/g for toluene and 357–500 m2/g in the case of chlorobenzene. The thermal degradation process was monitored by thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry methods in inert and oxidative conditions. The copolymers were stable up to 269–283 °C in a helium atmosphere, whereas in synthetic air the range was 266–298 °C, as determined by the temperature of 5% mass loss. Thermal stability of the investigated copolymers increased along with an increasing TMPSM amount in the copolymerization mixture. In addition, the poly(TMSPM-co-TRIM) copolymers were effectively used as the stationary phase in GC analyses.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739081","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"4796","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/19/4796","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092f7878c28a0473a024d","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Rogulska","uuid":"C08650477353B85F5EBED659CAC61CDD40D3CB9A52B9B5B05B6FB2198DBC6AB7E8188D57B58DD4EA0DB5B094CFD8DD580111C422F5925AB8B81081D588E9E2C4","orcidId":"0000-0002-0649-5484","documentHash":"e9060b2c-37b5-4df6-9bc6-b9d06e0438be"},{"objectId":"5e7092f7878c28a0473a0246","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Maciejewska","uuid":"EBE0A5423C49E0D0D55020F1AA543B1D8263F4FD40BA528A1CED4AA40A6EAC69E9672A48BDC94AF5F436CDA5725B435CB55E98BA49F1B0D054D132E21D1CC0CD","orcidId":"0000-0002-3734-9965","documentHash":"8e2a4688-0346-4717-a60c-084e30371d15"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17194796"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Hydrogen

there is a need for new sources of noble metals due to their dwindling natural resources. This paper presents studies on the sorption of noble metals such as Au(III), Pt(IV), Pd(II) and Rh(III) from model chloride solutions on a newly prepared Amberlite XAD-16–Aliquat 336 sorbent. A “warm impregnation” method without the use of toxic organic solvents was applied to impregnate the polymer matrix. The influence of such factors as hydrochloric acid concentration, sorbent mass and phase contact time was investigated. Kinetic as well as adsorption isotherm studies were carried out. The sorption capacity of the synthesized sorbent was Au(III)—94.34 mg/g, Pt(IV)—45.35 mg/g and Pd(II)—46.03 mg/g. Based on thermodynamic considerations, their sorption proved to be endothermic, as the values of ΔH° &gt; 0. Sorption was spontaneous and favourable (ΔG° &lt; 0). After leaching the RAM module, there was obtained a real solution, in which the metal contents were determined: 38.10 mg/g of gold and 1.76 mg/g of palladium. Totals of 99.9% of gold and 45.4% of palladium were removed from the real leaching solution, with other elements in the solution.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739086","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"1234","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/6/1234","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6711f3effdbe831eab26cffa","name":"Karolina Jadwiga","lastName":"Zinkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5758c4af-c04d-4c44-8e62-5ab8133070c8"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a04739feb4","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"A64DEF5493DA5CD70DFF10A5B94F8BC752D072E1AEF5BD2812CC81E8F6DC7E5362E0F86E70EBD36CDF27BC2A77704F373FFB2653CD8B33E29258061906A9E9F5","orcidId":"0000-0003-2820-397X","documentHash":"1e7f8d4f-a53e-429e-a1ab-e1fda9bee74c"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a04739feb1","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Hubicki","uuid":"7910F5692172A70C945544BFE52804F2A193A04A053D0E263928196BCDDF4F18F7C5F457B58C8B825FE5BC27E1F928849C3007B2F8F029F90D25B17DF0B8A5BA","orcidId":"0000-0001-7561-9930","documentHash":"138af09f-6af3-40fb-afa3-783effb41ec9"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17061234"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["foundation of quantum mechanics","quantum time","quantum clock"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Quantum Clock in the Projection Evolution Formalism","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d572","mniswId":"19958","title":"Universe","doi":null,"issn":"2218-1997","eissn":"2218-1997","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"9906613c-d624-4d92-8b48-3ec0757a383b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-03-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65e7069d4097076263089cab","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f4878c28a04739fe63","5e7092f7878c28a0473a01f0"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Using the projection evolution (PEv) approach, time can be included in quantum mechanics as an observable.

Thus, there is continuous need to study and develop numerical algorithms of control methods. In this paper, we would like to present our introductory study of a new simple method of investigations of such systems based on vector field properties and reduced amount of applied information. Firstly, we present the basis of our approach for extraction of nonlinear indicators of two-dimensional systems. We show that basing on simplified analyses and exploiting half of commonly applied information, we can precisely estimate widely applied indicators. We prove that our method is simpler, more efficient and more accurate than commonly applied algorithms. After the introductory analysis, we extend our studies and apply the presented method in investigations of complex systems, based on the analysis that we discussed in the first part of the article and carried out in two-dimensional subspaces. We present simplicity and effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate how it simplifies investigations of complex dynamical phenomena. We verify our method studying the example of synchronization and chimera phenomena in the chosen set of coupled oscillators."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739091","journalIssue":{"objectId":"640f1a95409707703509bf16","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"111","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"42641215-b3c9-48e2-b3a3-275e1676d826"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"111","pagesFromTo":"16215-16236","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11071-023-08665-7","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67347ca7fdbe830349fe3755","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Sagan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"76dc9330-4125-4f93-8c41-038f8a5ed5e7"},{"objectId":"67347ca7fdbe830349fe3754","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Denysenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"87e5fbe0-4965-4bcc-ac2f-ad3a9cc25b1c"},{"objectId":"6040ca449543c711bc6ea883","name":"Sandra","lastName":"Zarychta","uuid":"B4E2E45235102A020F8764C0C72F189F9198AEE01058C259DF1131321B1545FEFD2369CEAF5BE5BEA0634105E789B70DB70DFC4A25E2386D287FC98953D8DF80","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a7516d7a-4ec6-45eb-8cb4-2b01d5dd907b"},{"objectId":"5e709335878c28a0473a4eac","name":"Artur","lastName":"Dąbrowski","uuid":"6B8EC12822C014F6A6484138CD4E2EEA3F4CDB72CC17FB4DA8A6495121304772A46CC427F8F95923C99B9196A186251785AF002A9D804593ABB367B746C6A5F5","orcidId":"0000-0001-9536-7371","documentHash":"8621a140-a3c7-434d-8e01-7303c39acf74"},{"objectId":"5e7092ba878c28a04739b924","name":"Marek","lastName":"Balcerzak","uuid":"65DE51836F75A67CCB690A92F8C505E0EB8A594D00895ECC221D82C1D5BD965471F4205A76855FCD986BEFFCB300E5C3AB56BD7CECF1631B787E252FE8815F21","orcidId":"0000-0002-2144-6162","documentHash":"5d82f92b-f1b4-498c-91b1-bbf8e0af72ee"},{"objectId":"5e709269878c28a047395448","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Stefański","uuid":"70AB03E232ADD47A018C455E29D7CA1CB91D0DF3DF61CC0CE6D16C881D0175BCFF871C0F188F1EACC748AFBB0B9AC197EE5942D933D4FC62A260026F5DD35CA1","orcidId":"0000-0002-3210-5080","documentHash":"27be6e56-4149-4a29-af46-abf6a88af4bb"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11071-023-08665-7"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093c5878c28a0473b0747"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Open sensu shaped graphene oxide and modern carbon nanomaterials in translucent hydrophobic and omniphobic surfaces – Insight into wetting mechanisms","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775cb","mniswId":"3472","title":"Chemical Engineering Journal","doi":null,"issn":"1385-8947","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"89a565d0-e4d6-4fd9-8a85-2913c3124bf4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6426c7354097075f21c7fa63","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["677d1f0ffdbe831a382db401","677d1f0ffdbe831a382db402","677d1f0ffdbe831a382db403","677d1f0ffdbe831a382db404","677d1f0ffdbe831a382db405","677d1f0ffdbe831a382db406","677d1f0ffdbe831a382db407","677d1f0ffdbe831a382db408","5e7093c5878c28a0473b0747","677d1f0ffdbe831a382db409","677d1f0ffdbe831a382db40a","677d1f0ffdbe831a382db40b","677d1f0ffdbe831a382db40c","677d1f0ffdbe831a382db40d","677d1f0ffdbe831a382db40e"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Thermal feathering of modern carbon nanomaterials (CNM), among them single walled carbon nanohorns (SWCNH) and carbon nanoonions (CNO), in polyethylene (PE) is applied to produce new durable, transparent hydrophobic, superhydrophobic and omniphobic surfaces. To increase SWCNH reactivity, they were converted into open sensu shaped graphene oxide (OSSGO). Next omniphobicity was introduced by fluorination. New superhydrophobic and hydrophobic translucent surfaces were deeply characterized by using spectroscopic methods, tribological analysis and contact angle (CA) measurements. Thermal feathering and fluorination by perfluorooctyl trichlorosilane (PFOTS) led to creation of grafted polysiloxanes and the attachment of fluorine-containing chains. The analysis of the Zisman plots, the adhesion tension vs. surface tension plots, CA and roll-off and hysteresis measurements results, together with Molecular Dynamics simulations, allowed to explain wetting mechanisms and the derivation on the adhesion tension vs. surface tension of liquids plots, suggesting surface freezing under the droplet as a new potential cause. Some new correlations describing the process of wetting are also discussed and explained. Fluorination creates translucent surfaces, and thus obtained materials can be used for red color filtering in self-cleaning coatings invisible for flying insects, which are a source of biological pollution of electronics that emit light in the open air at night."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739093","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"462","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d1f0ffdbe831a382db40e","name":"Artur P.","lastName":"Terzyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f98e9ee7-2b0a-4c3f-9ac9-2d1295e72fce"},{"objectId":"677d1f0ffdbe831a382db40d","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kujawa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8640fd73-a931-43b9-80e5-40ea86636702"},{"objectId":"677d1f0ffdbe831a382db40c","name":"Katsumi","lastName":"Kaneko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9855cfc5-4dba-4f4b-acdf-897e537fbb4e"},{"objectId":"677d1f0ffdbe831a382db40b","name":"Dariusz J.","lastName":"Smoliński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aa8098c4-1a56-4dab-87b7-ee2323bd5a29"},{"objectId":"677d1f0ffdbe831a382db40a","name":"Michał","lastName":"Świdziński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"14f833a7-8ab0-45b9-b105-d95562cc1788"},{"objectId":"677d1f0ffdbe831a382db409","name":"Samer","lastName":"Al-Gharabli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"67a4e235-cbf8-4a4e-8c9c-bc361869f5ec"},{"objectId":"677d1f0ffdbe831a382db408","name":"Krzysztof J.","lastName":"Kurzydłowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1d21a48a-b190-4796-a930-07b33e6263fc"},{"objectId":"677d1f0ffdbe831a382db407","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Łępicka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aee11581-97d0-4b21-b49e-39f120d7997a"},{"objectId":"677d1f0ffdbe831a382db406","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Zięba","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0c95e04b-7f4c-4fd8-910c-c2cb8ad1dd00"},{"objectId":"677d1f0ffdbe831a382db405","name":"Monika","lastName":"Zięba","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"510af00e-9291-4361-8875-00b8ac23a45d"},{"objectId":"677d1f0ffdbe831a382db404","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8679c82e-9118-4d9b-b5d0-6833960b5a24"},{"objectId":"677d1f0ffdbe831a382db403","name":"Grzegorz S.","lastName":"Szymański","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a9a31897-a07d-4dcc-a064-24091d07f18a"},{"objectId":"677d1f0ffdbe831a382db402","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Bryk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a205394c-15d1-4da3-935b-8deb531f9897"},{"objectId":"677d1f0ffdbe831a382db401","name":"Emil","lastName":"Korczeniewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"93b7a856-a2c2-4a9c-a74e-6dd77cfc278a"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b0747","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Boncel","uuid":"5B6F9899B70CE4B98A7E69AC2D1E181B1479A5D469FBDDB077476F789C04383E029C29A8993F84E40F1A12918D866B859D0CE10CB8BA8E857F0F3D747CBC4E89","orcidId":"0000-0002-0787-5243","documentHash":"fd590e22-7d8e-43a3-9ec5-a8d67bf8b5f2"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.cej.2023.142237"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"649c20c24097071386c52c16","doi":null,"title":"Nauka i przemysł -

However, studies of the dynamics and reaction kinetics of IgG–antigen binding under physiological crowding conditions are scarce. Herein, we develop a coarse-grained model of IgG consisting of only six beads that we find minimal for a coarse representation of IgG’s shape and a decent reproduction of its flexibility and diffusion properties measured experimentally. Using this model in Brownian dynamics simulations, we find that macromolecular crowding affects only slightly the IgG’s flexibility, as described by the distribution of angles between the IgG’s arms and stem. Our simulations indicate that, contrary to expectations, crowders slow down the translational diffusion of an IgG less strongly than they do for a smaller Ficoll 70, which we relate to the IgG’s conformational size changes induced by crowding. We also find that crowders affect the binding kinetics by decreasing the rate of the first binding step and enhancing the second binding step."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739097","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"127","pagesFromTo":"7442-7448","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcb.3c02383","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"659fc1e04097076c144aa960","name":"Svyatoslav ","lastName":"Kondrat ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"51c8bc12-9d47-499d-8d6f-1644648a4499"},{"objectId":"659fc1e04097076c144aa95f","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Skóra","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"97db15a3-de4b-4462-a600-6e6a233f7e6c"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a657d","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Raczyłło","uuid":"EC675FF6D1FAA718BC88494434DDA84DC74B5B0EE788B5CAF6EDD6D07C12FF9BDED5DB49DA8A84F7CCCB2A6DEE926A9D0B442C34A2BB77AA0F6BD45DD870881D","orcidId":"0000-0003-0993-2683","documentHash":"664b8ef8-f4e1-4e69-81cf-7766d7f96235"}],"doi":"10.1021/acs.jpcb.3c02383"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Functional materials","2D materials","Biocompatibility","Superbugs","Quantum dots","Waste management"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62ba67a8752340195a3a3c70","619db1b87523402fabde7d82","5e709333878c28a0473a4c3d","5e70926a878c28a047395462","5e709269878c28a047395424","5e709269878c28a04739542b","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1ba9","5e70926a878c28a047395461"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Engineering of brewery waste-derived graphene quantum dots with ZnO nanoparticles for treating multi-drug resistant bacterial infections","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c800","mniswId":"10984","title":"Journal of Environmental Chemical Engineering","doi":null,"issn":"2213-3437","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"2c348631-5868-4eef-85c7-66129fb74cda"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65dee1c0409707626326b917","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62ba67a8752340195a3a3c70","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1ba9","5e709269878c28a04739542b","5e709269878c28a047395424","5e70926a878c28a047395461","5e709333878c28a0473a4c3d","5e70926a878c28a047395462","619db1b87523402fabde7d82","6733517afdbe830349a36ff9","6733517afdbe830349a36ffa","6733517afdbe830349a36ffb","6733517afdbe830349a36ffc","6733517afdbe830349a36ffd","6733517afdbe830349a36ffe"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, the antibacterial efficiency of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) derived from brewery spent grain (BSG) in combination with zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles against the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated from clinical wound specimens is investigated for the first time.

The layered morphology of BSG-derived reduced graphene oxide (BrGO), d-spacing, and the average particle size of GQDs were further examined by a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). Compared to individual GQDs and ZnO, ZnO/GQDs composites showed a better antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. ZnO/GQDs also demonstrated significant efficiency in disinfecting the MRSA (ATCC and clinical isolates from wound specimens). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the substantial clustering of functional groups at the edges of nanomaterial. The disinfection mechanism of MRSA is elucidated for the first time with DFT calculations.

These ingredients included D-limonene or 3-methoxy-3-methyl-1-butanol, esterified vegetable oils, and alkyl polyglucosides (APG). Responsive surface methodology (RSM) optimization was used to identify the most efficient detergents for removing stubborn graffiti coatings. Two different types of black paint containing nitrocellulose or bitumen as components to strengthen the paint properties were used to create a stubborn graffiti coating on a marble surface. The effectiveness of the nanodetergents in removing the stubborn graffiti coatings was evaluated, and the results revealed a considerable variation in the pace at which the coatings could be removed by the nanodetergents, despite the fact that both paints strengthened with different additives showed similar surface properties. It was found that alkyl polyglucosides are highly efficient in stabilizing water-in-oil nanoemulsion systems, including diverse solvent types.

One promising direction is the development of nutritious ice cream, using a blend of different whey proteins. However, the production of whey ice cream is hindered by the occurrence of quality issues, primarily stemming from a low content of solids, particularly fat and protein. The development of natural components with distinctive technological attributes, such as the ability to bind excess moisture, enhance foaming properties, and replicate the taste of milk fat, is of significant relevance in food science. In this work, we investigated the influence of plant-based structuring ingredients on the viscoelastic characteristics of whey-based ice creams. Notably, mixes such as 0.4% Vianoks C45 + 0.75% oat β-glucan, 0.4% Vianoks C45 + 0.5% yeast β-glucan, and 0.4% Vianoks C45 + 3% whey protein complex + 10% vegetable purée from table beet have been proven to be effective stabilizing compositions. However, attempts to combine the whey protein complex with other types of vegetable purées like zucchini and broccoli did not yield satisfactory results.

Understanding the electron attachment properties of MpBQ and its ability to form anions is crucial in elucidating its role in these reactions. In this study, we investigate electron attachment to MpBQ employing a crossed electron-molecular beam experiment in the electron energy range of approximately 0 to 12 eV, as well as theoretical approaches using quantum chemical and electron scattering calculations. Six anionic species were identified: C7H6O2–, C7H5O2–, C6H5O–, C4HO–, C2H2–, and O–. The parent anion is formed most efficiently, with large cross sections, through two resonances at electron energies between 1 and 2 eV. Potential reaction pathways for all negative ions observed are explored, and the experimental appearance energies are compared with calculated thermochemical thresholds. Although exhibiting similar electron attachment properties to pBQ, MpBQ’s additional methyl group introduces entirely new dissociative reactions, while quenching others, underscoring its distinctive chemical behavior."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739111","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"9","pagesFromTo":"38032-38043","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.4c04899","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"66ed6264fdbe83273773ed22","name":"Stephan","lastName":"Denifl","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bcc73d98-1031-4cf7-9e16-5fe455b8916c"},{"objectId":"66ed6264fdbe83273773ed21","name":"Fábris","lastName":"Kossoski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9448a7d9-361f-450d-b7b5-36f1f2da88d6"},{"objectId":"66ed6264fdbe83273773ed20","name":"João","lastName":"Ameixa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"144e083a-c892-45ef-a12a-5af25498e505"},{"objectId":"66ed6264fdbe83273773ed1f","name":"Jiakuan","lastName":"Chen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4490c766-8ff7-4ebb-ba01-d4432353c440"},{"objectId":"5e7092f9878c28a0473a046f","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pelc","uuid":"7CA9227948EA03E09725C659DDCF7730CA9494CB81A2985ED2772B7C34767D3F1A0ECA506069EFE190F000AE3EF79EC91DA5C9FC8D5DDC9BB69079A6804D7ECE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2722-3429","documentHash":"91b4f41c-9260-46cf-8cda-c6e8309f4257"}],"doi":"10.1021/acsomega.4c04899"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f7878c28a0473a0250","5e7092f7878c28a0473a0247","5e7092f5878c28a04739febe"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Investigations of the carbonization process of hybrid polymer microspheres using the TGA-EGA method: assessment of the impact of sulphanilic acid on the process","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478b86","mniswId":"13040","title":"Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry","doi":null,"issn":"1388-6150","eissn":"1588-2926","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"93d6d5e4-f898-4c49-a7d1-6d672d3e4666"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-05-21","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6711f394fdbe831eab26b07d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f7878c28a0473a0247","5e7092f7878c28a0473a0250","5e7092f5878c28a04739febe"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The TGA-EGA technique was used to study the influence of sulphanilic acid (SA) on the carbonisation process of the hybrid terpolymeric precursors composed of methacrylamide, divinylbenzene, and trimethoxyvinylsilane.

The studies led to the conclusion that SA had the protective effect on the surface of the carbonized polymers. During impregnation and thermal treatment, SA produced a deposit in pores of the precursors.

The DSC studies proved that the melting points of the tested compounds depended on the position and type of the substituent at the phenyl moiety, whereas they did not depend on the furnace atmosphere. All the tested polynitrogenated heterocycles proved to be molecules with high thermal stability in both atmospheres, and most of them (1, 3–5) were more stable in oxidizing conditions, which indicated the formation of a more thermally stable form of the compounds when interacting with oxygen. The simultaneous TG/FTIR/QMS analyses confirmed that their pyrolysis process occurred in one main stage resulting in the emission of volatiles such as NH3, HNCO, HCN, CO, CO2, H2O, NO2, aromatic amine derivatives, alkenes (for compounds 1–5), and HCl (for the compound 5). On the other hand, the oxidative decomposition process was more complicated and proceeded in two main stages leading to the emission of NH3, CO2, CO, HCN, HNCO, H2O, some aromatics (for compounds 1–5), HCl (for compounds 3–5) as well as the additional volatiles such as N2, NO2, NH2OH, and (CN)2.

The performed comprehensive experiments not only revealed the most probable mechanism of their formation but also proved that these complexes are composed of two 5-CQA and two H2O molecules. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739116","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"47","pagesFromTo":"16686-16694","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/nj/d3nj03121g","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b9158","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Hołowiński","uuid":"C2BA683585BCBC467C1B30CA5F98B3F725DA6B18F7137880EA8D1F5B24615B7A908B8303A3579EC166223A575EC6A8DEB1F18AEED55AD94669E14B8C40CEB38B","orcidId":"0000-0002-2001-2338","documentHash":"6437eeb5-2826-40de-b621-4094e18fc01f"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a007c","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Typek","uuid":"4D875F69148305F8AF7020AC0E680BF1BB9B659485521D72F950FB5FC1B01945C9E440B829DCD353A1738C889CA0BA196262761B7C4ACCD302A54E75DE88010E","orcidId":"0000-0003-3898-8491","documentHash":"a81379c1-44d0-458b-a0cb-0e7cdf6badbb"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a0073","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Dawidowicz","uuid":"D7C6824AD56B4E8FF5F31F6A1DDEF81A556BB93518828AC45CEF5FAF87B9BD1337A028828AAF6047123C97C49993437D4F3ACAAAA38C6F05DAF404381F3C5043","orcidId":"0000-0003-3251-2337","documentHash":"b345ea35-6a91-4c1a-b4d6-7dabb5c2c21f"}],"doi":"10.1039/d3nj03121g"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Adsorption performance","Alginate composites","Clinoptilolite","Biochar","Reusability studies."]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f5878c28a04739feb0","5e7092f5878c28a04739feb1","5e709349878c28a0473a6675"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Applicability of new sustainable and efficient alginate-based composites for critical raw materials recovery: General composites fabrication optimization and adsorption performance evaluation","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775cb","mniswId":"3472","title":"Chemical Engineering Journal","doi":null,"issn":"1385-8947","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"89a565d0-e4d6-4fd9-8a85-2913c3124bf4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"637393aa4097070c79d62763","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709349878c28a0473a6675","5e7092f5878c28a04739feb1","5e7092f5878c28a04739feb0"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Based on the 2020 list of raw materials for the EU, there are 30 critical minerals on the critical raw materials list, among which the rare earth elements group is placed. This study demonstrates a viable approach to the increasing possibility of the critical materials recovery through biosorption. The environmentally friendly biosorbents were prepared modifying calcium alginate with biochar and clinoptilolite. Firstly, the optimization procedure was applied for obtaining new biocomposites. After that the adsorption studies of La(III), Ce(III), Pr(III), and Nd(III) ions as a function of solution pH, biosorbent mass, interaction time, initial metal concentration, temperature, and competing ions presence were carried out using the batch mode. The kinetic studies were analyzed using the pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order, Weber and Morris intraparticle diffusion, Boyd as well as Dumwald-Wagner kinetic models. The experimental equilibrium data were fitted using the Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm models. The thermodynamic functions, i.e. ΔG°, ΔH°, and ΔS° were also determined. Importantly, the biocomposite beads were readily regenerated using diluted mineral acids (exemplary 0.1 mol/dm3 HNO3) and moreover, the adsorption effectiveness was very satisfactory even after six adsorption–desorption cycles (97%). New biocomposites as potential sorbents were characterized with ATR/FT-IR and XPS spectroscopy, SEM, EDX, OM and AFM microscopy, nitrogen adsorption, TG/DTG, CHNS, XRD as well as the sieve analysis and pHpzc measurements. After the interactions of the alginate composites with La(III) ions, a possible sorption mechanism was analyzed by ATR/FT-IR, XPS, and EDX spectroscopy."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739118","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-23","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1385894722027346?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709349878c28a0473a6675","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Fila","uuid":"35B6B87A93157FAB9F7903D23100DD11FABE203C2D6B29C9BA190A4A4DBDF89B3C47CF226B929B2C18B5FDE1C037DFF7FBEB9754BF5AD05E2F2B0784B4E707AC","orcidId":"0000-0001-9807-6166","documentHash":"5113214d-a97e-4044-8ac3-591d1106fac9"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a04739feb1","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Hubicki","uuid":"7910F5692172A70C945544BFE52804F2A193A04A053D0E263928196BCDDF4F18F7C5F457B58C8B825FE5BC27E1F928849C3007B2F8F029F90D25B17DF0B8A5BA","orcidId":"0000-0001-7561-9930","documentHash":"138af09f-6af3-40fb-afa3-783effb41ec9"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a04739feb0","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Kołodyńska","uuid":"FA2324C466959DFD2C3E66266E45982DA96FBB7AC83B47C689602C90D9990110198960C3F5054AB4A287BD9AD32FD01EC83E51567F858530DE22C9596172176F","orcidId":"0000-0002-1788-5648","documentHash":"772d06dd-60d9-4521-8da6-fbaf8521150f"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.cej.2022.137245"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6671325c4097074fa15825f7","doi":null,"title":"Nauka i przemysł – lubelskie spotkania studenckie (2024)","year":2024,"volume":null,"isbn":"9788322798065","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://bazawiedzy.umcs.pl/info/book/UMCS6f80ec9ed0d045fe92b1ebedbf68b1d2/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"1cd2b68c-1037-41bf-b2dc-54ad0d75ea70","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb8f4","mniswId":"59500","name":"Uniwersytet Marii Curie-Skłodowskiej w Lublinie","documentHash":"d938889a-f872-4771-bf34-8062ee136ee9"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f5878c28a0473a008e","6711f401fdbe831eab26d1e8","6711f401fdbe831eab26d1e7","6711f401fdbe831eab26d1e9"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Woltamperometryczne procedury oznaczania kurkuminy","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6711f401fdbe831eab26d1e6","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6711f401fdbe831eab26d1e7","5e7092f5878c28a0473a008e","6711f401fdbe831eab26d1e8","6711f401fdbe831eab26d1e9"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Niniejsza praca przedstawia zbiór informacji na temat popularnego związku używanego w żywności jako antyoksydant – kurkuminy, oraz jej zachowanie z chemicznego punktu widzenia.

Co–Fe mixed oxides with the general formula Co<jats:sub>4x</jats:sub>Fe<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>y</jats:sub> (Co: Fe = 4: 1) were deposited as the guest oxides using the two-step method: (i) solvate-stimulated modification of the surface of fumed nanocarriers with the mixture of cobalt nitrate (II) and iron (III) formate and (ii) subsequent heat treatment up to 600 °C to form Co<jats:sub>4x</jats:sub>Fe<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>y</jats:sub>. The aim of this paper was to study the influence of the composition and structure of fumed oxide matrices and deposited guest phase on the morphology of the resulting composites in the gaseous and aqueous media using the XRD, XPS, FTIR, nitrogen adsorption and SEM/EDX, as well as quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS) methods. The low-temperature nitrogen adsorption isotherms have a sigmoidal shape with a narrow hysteresis loop characteristic of mesoporous materials. The specific surface area (<jats:italic>S</jats:italic><jats:sub>BET</jats:sub>) of the composites varies from 48 to 82 m<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>/g, showing a tendency towards a decrease in the <jats:italic>S</jats:italic><jats:sub>BET</jats:sub> values by 10–26% in comparison with the initial nanocarriers. The SEM data show the denser aggregate structure of nanocomposites compared to the initial carriers. The primary particle size was in the 30–60 nm range and the EDX data confirm the formation of a guest phase on the mixed aluminosilicate carriers, mainly in the surface patches corresponding to the alumina structure. According to the QELS data, there is a tendency to form aggregates of 100–10 μm in size in the aqueous media. The XRD method shows that the deposited metal oxides are in the form of crystalline phases of Co<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>4</jats:sub> with the crystallites of 25–26 nm in size for the individual SiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> and Al<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> nanocarriers and 34–37 for the mixed ones, but the iron oxide reflections were not identified for the composites.

They offer simple preparation and convenient modification provided by a whole range of synthesis factors, e.g., starting monomers, cross-linkers, initiators, porogens, polymerization techniques, and temperature. The main aim of this study was to synthesize polymeric monoliths and determine the correlation between polymerization parameters and the porosity and thermal stability of the obtained materials. Polymeric monoliths were synthesized directly in HPLC columns using N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (NVP) and 4-vinylpiridine (4VP) as functional monomers, with trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate (TRIM) serving as the cross-linking monomer. During copolymerization a mixture of cyclohexanol/decane-1-ol was used as the pore-forming diluent. Polymerization was carried out at two different temperatures: 55 and 75 °C. As a result, monoliths with highly developed internal structure were synthesized. The value of their specific surface area was in the range of 92 m2/g to 598 m2/g, depending on the monomer composition and polymerization temperature. Thermal properties of the obtained materials were investigated by means of thermogravimetry (TG).

Initially, the influence of molecular weight and solution pH on simple polyamino acids (poly(L-aspartic acid) and poly(L-lysine) binding was determined. Considering the obtained dependencies, the polymer adsorption layer conformation was proposed in the systems containing block copolymers (both diblock and symmetrical triblock) consisting of polypeptide as well as poly(ethylene glycol) fragments. The presented studies focused on the application of two experimental methods. The polymer adsorption was carried out using the batch method and the adsorbate concentration was determined spectrophotometrically. Then, the turbidimetric measurements were taken. The analysis of the obtained results showed that the adsorption process of block copolymers depends on two factors. Firstly, the solution pH determines both the nature of the interactions of the copolymer structural units with the solid surface and the conformation of the polypeptide chains. The second parameter influencing the adsorption layer structure is the ratio of the lengths of both blocks. Introducing a short PEG fragment into the polymer main chain may improve the polymer adsorption properties by increasing the number of interactions with the adsorbent surface.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739141","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"28","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/28/24/8080","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709349878c28a0473a66c1","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Ostolska","uuid":"4217ECD754131A8EB0D9B5E6B2ABA7BC97D1DD3D22FBFEFABD1AC35975ABF6322D3652EE45BCEC162843CBA1A0BA7EDA6C601D153109D2C9777D8AD1F2CE0F99","orcidId":"0000-0002-1988-2475","documentHash":"4c327464-9dad-4dbb-a91f-edb8d5e60dde"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a00b4","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Wiśniewska","uuid":"2DF4CC491F626BD1CD8F560E01027C2F6A453AF6547F520BD1B38A0881FC857BB636AF42C44010AB6A850008F1B48C2B3FA6D6A190743BC9949FB05DF03B1847","orcidId":"0000-0003-4003-9877","documentHash":"e6694d39-5f77-436d-a2a8-8b9942fdd7e6"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules28248080"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Numerical algorithms","Computational fluid dynamics","Plasma flows","Communication blackout","Hypersonic flows","Ray tracing"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df71","uid":"bVfQitUiCXefHxSrzVxWFmQ","uuid":"6b4ab5b8-ee21-43a7-a91e-148512c57a44","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Matematyki, Fizyki i Informatyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"3D ray tracing solver for communication blackout analysis in atmospheric entry missions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454777a0","mniswId":"4242","title":"COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS","doi":null,"issn":"0010-4655","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"b8a152f3-5740-488f-8850-2d4176f78097"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-10","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63ea14a1409707102ac68ef1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63ea14a1409707102ac68ef3","63ea14a1409707102ac68ef4","63ea14a1409707102ac68ef5","63ea14a1409707102ac68ef6","63ea14a1409707102ac68ef7","63ea14a1409707102ac68ef8","6325312975234038513dfa2b"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"During the atmospheric entry phase at hypersonic speed, the radio communication from/to a space vehicle can be disrupted due to the formation of a plasma sheath within the surrounding flow field. In order to characterize such communication blackout phases, this work presents a numerical methodology combining Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations of ionized chemically reacting entry flows by means of Computational Object-Oriented Libraries for Fluid Dynamics (COOLFluiD) and a ray tracing analysis by means of the newly developed BlackOut RAy Tracer (BORAT). The latter is based on the numerical solution of the 3D Eikonal system of equations, offering a fast, efficient and accurate method to analyse the interaction between electromagnetic signals and weakly ionised plasmas. The proposed methodology, and BORAT in particular, is first verified on popular benchmark cases and then used to analyse the European Space Agency (ESA) 2016 ExoMars Schiaparelli entry flight into Martian environment. The corresponding results demonstrate the validity of the proposed ray tracing approach for predicting communication blackout, where signals emitted from the on-board antenna undergo reflection and refraction from the plasma surrounding the entry vehicle, and the advantage of a 3D approach for analysing real flight configuration."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739143","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63ea14a1409707102ac68ef2","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"286","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"b4ab6acb-6eb0-48ca-825a-4fb688286f76"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"286","pagesFromTo":"108663","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465523000085?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63ea14a1409707102ac68ef8","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Lani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"da19d4c4-9cd4-4e1c-9acf-495c12e964dd"},{"objectId":"63ea14a1409707102ac68ef7","name":"Alessandro","lastName":"Munafò","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"31591dc2-f020-48c0-8c40-bc05e8583ac5"},{"objectId":"63ea14a1409707102ac68ef6","name":"Jan","lastName":"Thoemel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7fe4ceea-1146-47ec-9f79-cde3473b4519"},{"objectId":"63ea14a1409707102ac68ef5","name":"Johannes","lastName":"Laur","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"afa6564b-53b5-42b0-80c4-fd6f1de22f78"},{"objectId":"63ea14a1409707102ac68ef4","name":"Vatsalya","lastName":"Sharma","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6870c0f8-73ff-4979-937c-ff57b70695ab"},{"objectId":"63ea14a1409707102ac68ef3","name":"Vincent F.","lastName":"Giangaspero","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c0e021d4-2de7-4f95-843d-efb43b8f1ed5"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2b","name":"Stefaan","lastName":"Poedts","uuid":"E30515B6831744043DFF6116308CAADF77B5F0C972E5A368DB49146E9779BB06976217A98AF4D837221C3ED8E97238836204CBB8C77804B509343F88AD17DDF9","orcidId":"0000-0002-1743-0651","documentHash":"c635d010-d0a5-4637-8a13-98fc1c24e343"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.cpc.2023.108663"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["density functional theory","contact angle","heterogeneous surface","water model"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f8878c28a0473a02fe"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Contact angle of water on a model heterogeneous surface.

The surface heterogeneity results from the pre-adsorption of a layer of spherical species. The pre-adsorbed molecules can also be a mixture of molecules of different sizes. The presence of pre-adsorbed layer causes geometrical and energetical heterogeneity of the surfaces. Two cases are considered. The pre-adsorbed molecules can either behave like hard-sphere obstacles, or they can also attract the molecules of water. In the first case, an increase of the amount of pre-adsorbed species leads to an increase of the wetting temperature, but this increase does not depend linearly on the amount of obstacles.

AA was determined using the DPPH (2,2′-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) and β-carotene methods. It was proven that the AA of extracts depends not only on the extraction technique and AA assessment method but also on the place of plant cultivation. The smallest activity was determined using the β-carotene bleaching method, while the highest values were obtained using the FRAP method. On the other hand, the ABTS method showed a greater activity of the Albanian herb prepared using the Soxhlet technique. In addition, the antioxidant properties of extracts were compared with those of rutin standard solutions, showing that this characteristic component of cistus is not the only one that determines AA of extracts. As a result, the rutin content is not an indicator of the antioxidant properties of extracts. The other polyphenolic compounds, although occurring at lower concentration levels compared to rutin, modify the resultant AA of extracts.

The obtained results show that it is possible to cross-link chloroprene rubber with silver(I) oxide.

As the Ag2O content in the composition increases, the cross-link density of the vulcanizates\nalso increases. However, the use of 1 phr of Ag2O is insufficient to obtain a suitably extensive network. Exclusively, the incorporation of 2 phr of Ag2O results in obtaining vulcanizates with\ngreat cross-link density. The obtained compositions are characterized by good mechanical properties, as evidenced by high tensile strength. The performed thermal analyses—differential scanning\ncalorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TGA) allowed us to determine the course of composition cross-linking, but also to determine changes in their properties during heating. The results of\nthe thermal analysis confirmed that CR can be cross-linked with Ag2O, and the increasing amount of oxide in the composition increases the degree of cross-linking of vulcanizates.

For example, exotic superconducting phases are often obtained by chemical substitution in Mott insulators. Compared to Mott insulators, impact of chemical substitution on excitonic insulators is not well explored yet. In the present work, space‐resolved angle‐resolved photoemission spectroscopy of the model Ta<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>Ni(Se<jats:sub>1‐x</jats:sub>S<jats:sub>x</jats:sub>)<jats:sub>5</jats:sub> is reported in which S substitution for Se is used to control the excitonic behavior.

Patients who recovered from COVID-19 and require rehabilitation due to varied impairments should be provided an opportunity to participate in an individualized, complex rehabilitation program starting from acute care and being continued in the post-acute and long-term rehabilitation phase. It is recommended to offer out-patient and in-hospital rehabilitation procedures depending on the type and persistence of symptoms and dysfunctions. The aim of this paper is to present the qualification process of post-COVID19 patients for an in-hospital complex rehabilitation program developed on the basis of pulmonary physical therapy. Methods: The presented qualification program was developed on the basis of clinical experience of over 2000 patients participating in the pilot program of in-hospital rehabilitation launched in September 2020 and based on the Regulation of the Polish Minister of Health of 13 July 2020. Results: The proposed model of patients’ qualification rests on well-known and validated tools for functional assessment: exercise tolerance assessment, dyspnea intensity assessment, functional fitness assessment, assessment of arterial blood saturation, lung ventilation function assessment, assessment of long-lasting COVID-19 symptoms, and patient’s basic mental health condition. Conclusions: The proposed qualification model for the post-COVID rehabilitation program allows us to introduce adequate qualifications followed by much needed assessment of the health effects."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739170","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67b30847fdbe8362a55eb565","name":"Anna","lastName":"Szczegielniak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ef87817b-f2a4-4156-9aaa-e8cfe5724913"},{"objectId":"5e709237878c28a047391d09","name":"JAN","lastName":"SZCZEGIELNIAK","uuid":"C082C73EE5C6A1F871216FF481AF314D95A1C09C34F85B5674EBDECB67698995AFDE3EBC062E0238E2F96E721374996713945D68F78D84DA872E8527CCD77059","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"73edee1e-ed5c-46b5-b471-b16d130ade50"},{"objectId":"5e709222878c28a04739063b","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Łuniewski","uuid":"62A0D0B04307D9AC343AFD0249B8F68BCB63CAF4B31919FB4AE0D9183F53B013067EE5E5FEE1F95AC1DE23B63011CBE5C4D5F6EE221562B0CFE8214947CD2C7D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2ad9b3bf-4fef-4e9c-ba68-9bf743ce3cca"},{"objectId":"5e709221878c28a0473905e9","name":"KATARZYNA","lastName":"BOGACZ","uuid":"EF4093A5C43F32077AF6EC0069DEDE768B910035942F8925886756CBF1CD57450841EFCD41DCE4C58C7853268B19300FF2640E038F01DF7FE537D799421BDE5D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"84005923-ccd3-4523-96c8-5473ad6166f4"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph191610450"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Irlandia","ustrój Irlandii","polityka Irlandii","Polacy w Irlandii"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":"978-83-67253-66-6","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Irlandia 1921–2021.

New, more efficient methods of its isolation are sought, paying increasingly more attention to the methods within currently available extraction techniques that, owing to the optimization of the process, not only increase the extraction efficiency but are also economical and environmentally friendly. This article proposes a procedure for the extraction and analysis of one of the vitamin K vitamers, i.e., vitamin K1, using PLE and LC-MS/MS. It has been shown that the PLE technique can be optimized with a mathematical model—accelerating and reducing the costs of the extraction process—which, together with process automation, bodes well for industrial applications. The optimized process was used to extract vitamin K1 from various vegetables, showing very different contents of the test compound ranging from 1.22 to 114.30 µg/g dry weight for avocado and spinach, respectively. In addition, by showing the effect of water within the material subjected to extraction on the variable yield of vitamin K1, attention was drawn to the need to standardize the analytical methods used

the current study, iron-loaded dead leaf ash (Fe-DLA) was used as a novel catalyst in the heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process (HCOP) for textile wastewater containing Reactive Black 5 (RB-5). The research demonstrates a significant boost in removal efficiency, reaching 98.76% with 1.0 g/min O3 and 0.5 g/L catalyst dose, by investigating key variables such as pH, ozone and catalyst doses, initial concentration, and the presence of scavengers in 1 L wastewater. The addition of tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) reduced RB-5 elimination, indicating the involvement of OH radicals. Catalyst reusability decreased slightly (2.05% in the second run; 4.35% in the third), which was attributed to iron leaching. A comparison of single ozonation (Fe-DLA) adsorption and catalytic ozonation processes (Fe-DLA/O3) revealed that the combined process improved dye degradation by 25%, with removal rates ranking as Fe-DLA adsorption O3 Fe-DLA/O3, with an impressive 76.44% COD removal.

These predictions stipulate the presence of strong shell closures at the neutron numbers N=136 (actinide region) and N=196 (superheavy region) simultaneously at nonvanishing all four octupole deformations α3μ=0,1,2,3≠0. In contrast to the traditional notion of magic numbers, the new notion refers to simultaneous nonspherical configurations (α3μ≠0, α2μ=0). In this article we study the nuclear equilibrium deformations with α33≠0 combined with nonvanishing quadrupole deformation, α20≠0. One easily shows that such geometrical shapes have a threefold symmetry axis and are invariant under the symmetry operations of the D3h point group. We employ a realistic phenomenological mean-field approach with the so-called universal deformed Woods-Saxon potential and its recently optimized parametrization based on actualized experimental data with the help of the inverse problem theory methods. The presence of parametric correlations among 4 of 12 parameters in total was detected and removed employing Monte Carlo approach leading to stabilization of the modeling predictions. Our calculations predict the presence of three nonoverlapping groups of nuclei with D3h symmetry, referred to as islands on the nuclear (Z,N) plane (mass table). These islands lie in the rectangle 110≤Z≤138 and 166≤N≤206. The “repetitive” structures with the D3h symmetry minima are grouped in three zones of oblate quadrupole deformation, approximately, at α20∈[−0.10,−0.20] (oblate normal deformed), around α20≈−0.5 (oblate superdeformed) and α20≈−0.85 (oblate hyperdeformed). Importantly, the energies of those latter exotic deformation minima are predicted to be very close to the ground-state energies. We illustrate, compare, and discuss the evolution of the underlying shell structures. Nuclear surfaces parametrized as usual with the help of real deformation parameters, {αλμ=α∗λμ}, are invariant under Oxz-plane reflection, the symmetry also referred to as y simplex (ˆSy). For the shapes with odd-multipolarity (λ→λodd=3,5,7,...) it follows that E(−αλodd,μ)=E(+αλodd,μ). It turns out that the predicted equilibrium deformations generate symmetric double (or “twin”) minima separated by potential barriers, whose heights vary with the nucleon numbers, possibly inducing the presence of parity-doublets in the spectra. To facilitate possible experimental identification of such structures, we examine the appearance of such doublets solving the collective Schrödinger equation. Implied suggestions are illustrated and discussed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739184","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"107","pagesFromTo":"054304","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.107.054304","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"649c06e04097071386c424c5","name":"H.

Although soil washing can effectively remediate metal-contaminated soils, it can generate significant amounts of soil washing wastewater (SWW). This study investigated the effectiveness of using activated carbon and various biochars to treat SWW from the remediation of soil heavily contaminated with cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn) with soluble humic substances (SHS) from municipal sewage sludge. Willow biochar (BW), plant biomass biochar (BPB), coconut shell biochar (BCH), and Norit SX2 activated carbon (ACN) were tested at different dosages (12.5–100 g/L) and adsorption times (30–1440 min) for the treatment of SWW. At 100 g/L dosage, biochar removed Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn with 56–83%, 32–41%, 18–42%, 75–83%, and 44–83% efficiency, respectively, while ACN removed them with 87–95% efficiency. Only BW and ACN removed soluble organics with efficiencies of 49% and 94%, respectively, at the highest dosage. Adsorption of metals and soluble organics was mainly controlled by physisorption and chemisorption.

In order to study the influence of the carbon precursor on the physicochemical properties of biocarbons there were used the precursors: cones, sawdust, and bark of various tree species. The obtained adsorbents were characterized based on the results, of the N2 adsorption, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), elemental analysis (CHNS), thermogravimetry (TG), derivative thermogravimetry (DTG), and differential thermal analysis (DTA), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy FT-IR (ATR) and the Boehm’s titration method as well as pHpzc (the point of zero charge). The adsorption capacity and the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia were also studied. The obtained activated biocarbons were characterized by the large specific surface area (515 to 1286 m2/g) and the total pore volume (0.27 to 0.46 cm3/g) as well as the well-developed microporous structure (76 - 90%). The maximum NH3 adsorption capacity of the activated biocarbon was determined to be 2.93 mmol/g (FC (Fir Cone)).

The structure analysis showed that 1–3 crystallize as (NO3)-bridged compounds and that the lanthanide(III) ion acts as a joint connecting two [CuH2L] coordination units. In each heterotrinuclear unit, an asymmetry in the degree of planarity of the bridging CuO2Ln fragments is observed. The CuII ions are five- and six-coordinate, with distorted square pyramidal and octahedral geometry, respectively, whereas the LnIII ions are nine-coordinate. The solvates 1–3 are stable at room temperature, and their desolvation process is consistent with the loss of water and/or methanol molecules.

Therefore, there is a critical need for a rapid, selective and routine approach to quantifying 6-thioguanine in body fluids to support a clinical application. A fully validated HPLC method has been developed to determine 6-thioguanine in whole blood samples using 5-bromouracil as an internal standard. 6-Thioguanine nucleotides were released from erythrocytes by perchloric acid, and then hydrolysed at 100 °C to the parent thiopurine, 6-thioguanine. The following validation parameters of the method were determined: specificity/selectivity, linearity range (479-17,118 ng/mL, R > 0.992), limits of detection (150 ng/mL) and quantification (479 ng/mL), accuracy (- 5.6 < Bias < 14.7), repeatability (CV 1.30-3.24%), intermediate precision (CV 4.19-5.78%), extraction recovery (79.1-103.6%) and carryover. Furthermore, the stability of the drug in whole blood samples under various storage conditions was investigated.

This study utilises a modelling approach to investigate the impact of perturbed solar wind conditions caused by multiple interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) on the evolution of solar energetic particle (SEP) distributions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility of SEP models in evaluating the performance of solar wind and coronal mass ejection (CME) models. To illustrate\r\nthese concepts, we focussed on modelling the gradual SEP event that occurred on 2023 March 15.\r\nMethods. We utilised the 3D magnetohydrodynamic model EUHFORIA (EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting Information Asset) to simulate the various ICMEs that caused the highly perturbed solar wind conditions observed during the March 15 event. We conducted three separate EUHFORIA simulations, employing both non-magnetised and magnetised models for these ICMEs. To analyse the behaviour of energetic particles in the simulated solar wind environments, we employed the energetic particle transport and acceleration model PARADISE (PArticle Radiation Asset Directed at Interplanetary Space Exploration).\r\nResults. In the vicinity of Earth, the three EUHFORIA simulations exhibit strong similarities and closely match the observed in situ data. Nevertheless, when incorporating these distinct solar wind configurations into PARADISE, notable disparities emerge in the simulated SEP intensities. This discrepancy can be attributed to the different magnetic enhancements and closed magnetic structures introduced by the different CME models within the EUHFORIA simulations. These variations strongly impact the transport mechanisms of SEPs, leading to significant deviations in the particle intensities simulated by PARADISE. Furthermore, our findings\r\nhighlight the significance of cross-field diffusion even in scenarios with reduced perpendicular mean free path. This effect becomes particularly prominent when SEPs are trapped within the inner heliosphere due to the presence of ICMEs. In these scenarios, the extended duration of confinement allows the slower cross-field diffusion process to become more pronounced and exert a greater influence on the spatial distribution of SEPs, especially near and within the boundaries of ICMEs.\r\nConclusions. Solar energetic particle models enable us to indirectly validate the accuracy of the underlying solar wind and CME models across significant portions of the heliosphere, rather than solely relying on discrete points where spacecraft are situated. This broader validation provides valuable insights into the reliability and effectiveness of the CME models on a global scale."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739203","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"679","pagesFromTo":"1-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374153025_Advancing_interplanetary_magnetohydrodynamic_models_through_solar_energetic_particle_modelling_Insights_from_the_2013_March_15_SEP_event","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65a1030e4097076c145012a8","name":"Jasmina","lastName":"Magdalenic","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"792868b5-c4f7-4ec0-93b6-5eaaeb17df04"},{"objectId":"65a1030e4097076c145012a7","name":"Luciano","lastName":"Rodriguez","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b677f62f-4b07-4cf0-aca2-1a6e5b3aee10"},{"objectId":"65a1030e4097076c145012a6","name":"Angels","lastName":"Aran","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4bdc6d3f-5234-4631-a2ee-62a4b66724db"},{"objectId":"65a1030e4097076c145012a5","name":"Nicolas","lastName":"Wijsen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5ebc8be3-b71e-4b7d-9a11-e17bd3a7f90f"},{"objectId":"65a1030e4097076c145012a4","name":"Antonio","lastName":"Niemela","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a569101f-b453-4641-90c4-5ee416c8b563"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2b","name":"Stefaan","lastName":"Poedts","uuid":"E30515B6831744043DFF6116308CAADF77B5F0C972E5A368DB49146E9779BB06976217A98AF4D837221C3ED8E97238836204CBB8C77804B509343F88AD17DDF9","orcidId":"0000-0002-1743-0651","documentHash":"c635d010-d0a5-4637-8a13-98fc1c24e343"}],"doi":"10.1051/0004-6361/202347116"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Effect of anionic surfactants on the heavy metal ions removal by adsorption onto ion exchangers - batch and column studies","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547caf6","mniswId":"13187","title":"Journal of Water Process Engineering","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2214-7144","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"87fbff2e-7ab1-434e-8c3d-4455e1b0050c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"646c6e674097076e9c33d600","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ba878c28a0473afe01","65ca0c4840970762634cb501","5e7092f5878c28a04739feb1"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Adsorption of heavy metals by various sorbents has been widely studied by many scientists due to the processes of industrialization as well as the great concentration of these toxic and dangerous pollutants in the environment the elimination of which is significant important. The ion exchangers Lewatit MonoPlus SR7, Lewatit MonoPlus TP220, Purolite A830 and Lewatit AF5 were used as adsorbents to remove heavy metal ions (M(II)) such as zinc (Zn(II)), nickel (Ni(II)) and copper (Cu(II)) (especially Cu(II)) in the presence of anionic surfactants to examine the adsorption efficiency in such systems. The main objective of this paper were the kinetic, equilibrium, thermodynamic and column studies in the HCl–M(II)–anionic surfactant (AS) such as SDS (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate), ABS (Dodecylbenzene Sulfonic Acid) or ABSNa50 (Sodium Dodecylbenzene Sulfonate) systems. The largest adsorption capacities were obtained in the HCl–M(II)–AS systems for Lewatit MonoPlus TP220 (Cu(II): 9.9–10 mg/g; Zn(II): 8.5–8.9 mg/g and Ni(II): 7.3–9.2 mg/g) compared to the other ion exchangers. Therefore, after the first selection, Lewatit MonoPlus TP220 and the systems containing Cu(II) were further examined. The isotherms models were applied in the experimental data analysis and show that the Langmuir (determination coefficient, R2 > 0.993) and Temkin (R2 = 0.948–0.965) isotherm models exhibit the best fitting. The results of the temperature-dependent adsorption of Cu(II) in the presence of SDS on Lewatit MonoPlus TP220 suggested that the adsorption was spontaneous, thermodynamically favourable, and exothermic in nature (the enthalpy, ∆H° = −7.19 kJ/mol (↓CMC) and −7.03 kJ/mol (↑CMC). The largest working ion exchange capacities of the anion exchange resin were obtained for the ABS surfactant (Cw = 30 g/L (↓CMC) and 12 g/L (↑CMC)). As follows from the current investigations Lewatit MonoPlus TP220 has a great potential for the removal of Cu(II) in the presence of ABS and SDS. For comparison, Cu(II) ions removal by the micellar enhanced ultrafiltration process was also presented and exhibits 54–73.88 % Cu(II) removal efficiency in the presence of SDS and ABS."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739204","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"53","pagesFromTo":"103792","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65ca0c4840970762634cb501","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Staszak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ac8f09d0-03c0-4e3f-9201-ba50d0d968b1"},{"objectId":"5e7093ba878c28a0473afe01","name":"Anna","lastName":"Wołowicz","uuid":"F0C5CEFD5F617F619A25EA82F7F121C1B86CB0A6FBB284D908DFEFAD81499AA45DACD2028C2F62AA8335807B4B9C5C518EFAE1E7F740D536236DBA34E429636B","orcidId":"0000-0001-5451-4523","documentHash":"6e4fe6bb-06a3-4535-b75f-98596ece3363"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a04739feb1","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Hubicki","uuid":"7910F5692172A70C945544BFE52804F2A193A04A053D0E263928196BCDDF4F18F7C5F457B58C8B825FE5BC27E1F928849C3007B2F8F029F90D25B17DF0B8A5BA","orcidId":"0000-0001-7561-9930","documentHash":"138af09f-6af3-40fb-afa3-783effb41ec9"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jwpe.2023.103792"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cr (VI)Chitosan-alginate@Fe/Mn mixed oxide nanocompositeWastewater treatment"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709349878c28a0473a66bb"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A novel chitosan-alginate@Fe/Mn mixed oxide nanocomposite for highly efficient removal of Cr (VI) from wastewater: Experiment and adsorption mechanism","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c28514547818a","mniswId":"8662","title":"International Journal of Biological Macromolecules","doi":null,"issn":"0141-8130","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d8406c23-7ec9-462d-a028-2033a7b65cec"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6645ee99409707626369a1f3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709349878c28a0473a66bb","6711f3d7fdbe831eab26cdd6","6711f3d7fdbe831eab26cdd7","6711f3d7fdbe831eab26cdd8","6711f3d7fdbe831eab26cdd9","6711f3d7fdbe831eab26cdda","6711f3d7fdbe831eab26cddb","6711f3d7fdbe831eab26cddc","6711f3d7fdbe831eab26cddd","6711f3d7fdbe831eab26cdde"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this study, the synthesis and experimental theoretical evaluation of a new chitosan/alginate/hydrozyapatite nanocomposite doped with Mn2 and Fe2O3 for Cr removal was reported.

The adsorption properties were estimated based on equilibrium and adsorption kinetics measurements. The Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherms were applied to analyze the equilibrium data. The thermodynamic analysis of adsorption isotherms was performed. A number of equations and kinetic models were used to describe the adsorption rate data, including pseudo-first (PFOE) and pseudo-second (PSOE) order kinetic equations. The obtained test results show that the synthesized biomaterial, compared to pure chitosan, is characterized by greater resistance to high temperatures. Moreover, this biomaterial had excellent adsorption properties. For the adsorption of Cr (VI), the equilibrium state was reached after 120 min, and the sorption capacity was 455.9 mg/g.

This study aimed to investigate the generation and properties of biopolymers and microbial communities of activated sludge from a large, full-scale WWTP. EPS composition in the activated sludge changed mostly during the transition period from winter to spring. Higher temperatures favored higher protein (PN) concentrations and a higher PN/PSs (polysaccharides) ratio in tightly-bound EPS, stimulating bacterial aggregation. In the sludge, filamentous Microthrix sp. were abundant (~6%) but the settling properties of the sludge improved with increasing PN content in the bound EPS fraction. The content of alginate (ALE)-like polymers averaged 55–60 mg/g Mixed Liquor Suspended Solids, and ALE content in sludge and characteristics were stable during the year. The abundance of Nitrospira sp. and the marine group NS9 in activated sludge correlated with the ALE content in the biomass, pointing to the importance of biopolymer production for nitrogen-transforming microorganisms. The most common EPS-producer was, Candidatus Competibacter (3–4%). The abundance of the Roseiflexaceae family significantly increased in summer, as did the abundance of Trichoccus sp. and Flavobacterium sp. in winter. The study shows that seasonal temperature fluctuations do not significantly affect the production of polymers, especially alginate, which favors commercial ALE recovery. The non-uniform composition of ALE-like polymers shows the possibility of their use in areas that do not require a specific polymer composition, e.g., as environmentally friendly coating materials or sorbents. The study contributes to biopolymer recovery and valorization of activated sludge.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739217","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"6231","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/24/6231","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67c6e324fdbe830b4ec3e54a","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Oleskowicz-Popiel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b6b625af-5c48-4299-8f79-683f370bd043"},{"objectId":"67c6e324fdbe830b4ec3e549","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Jóźwiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"23936bae-26d2-43a5-9753-2158e1dd3bd4"},{"objectId":"67c6e324fdbe830b4ec3e548","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Pomian","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1016e057-08ea-4f5f-ac5e-240c78c22d3f"},{"objectId":"67c6e324fdbe830b4ec3e547","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Komorowska-Kaufman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"215ab731-73cf-4503-834a-1bccb508033a"},{"objectId":"67c6e324fdbe830b4ec3e546","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Florczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c3a3c3c3-6245-486d-bade-c266da56f8c3"},{"objectId":"67c6e324fdbe830b4ec3e545","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Ciesielski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"43f590a6-83ef-486b-a643-22e493527f39"},{"objectId":"67c6e324fdbe830b4ec3e544","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Cydzik-Kwiatkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5fff9f4a-c5c8-4789-8f0f-dccd095d5c8b"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a0098","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Pasieczna-Patkowska","uuid":"56E472BFBB31FA739D850CC5E4741E0285573159ECAA048C7E711D21A7EC4F308476C4304C8A53E4DEAD61B5F4A848BADCEC23BF39F73460FB77884B54655DE5","orcidId":"0000-0002-1271-3089","documentHash":"ca36be94-a38d-427b-980d-4c819412155c"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17246231"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Effect

In the latter, plant extracts are commonly used, the properties of which are attributed to the characteristic main ingredients. However, in a mixture the antioxidant properties of the individual ingredients do not always show an additive effect. This paper presents and discusses the antioxidant properties of naturally occurring flavonoid aglycones and their binary mixtures. In the experiments, model systems were used that differed in the volume of the alcoholic antioxidant solution in the measuring system and its concentration in the range in which it occurs in nature. Antioxidant properties were determined by ABTS and DPPH methods. The presented data proved that the dominant resultant effect in the mixtures is antioxidant antagonism. The magnitude of the observed antagonism depends on the mutual relations of individual components, their concentrations and the method used to assess antioxidant properties. It was shown that the observed non-additive antioxidant effect of the mixture results from the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds between phenolic groups of the antioxidant molecule. The presented results may be useful in the context of proper design of functional foods.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739222","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/12/10070","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a0079","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Olszowy-Tomczyk","uuid":"636D440396E59C5D7D0500BD7FA2896E6FD5F1FEC35FBD087A744714D846CC8561D50CA205CE597CC3F07A0AB87D57A1467338F360B4309228FA6BA4599DC2FC","orcidId":"0000-0002-8344-8534","documentHash":"3362f244-42e0-40a7-af84-b88627c6b193"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a0076","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Wianowska","uuid":"0E38CBF98830DEC596F5632D66D3D9E8EE872C9DBE5DA7D8C2B6887505E6347C039557452A93AC4C004FFA350F2068BFACE34DBCF2F255F9D513CAF8FD8E6D97","orcidId":"0000-0003-3968-3905","documentHash":"e961bb01-e7d7-425e-9216-bb02f94762ba"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms241210070"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Powder metallurgy","Metallic alloy","Atomization","Additive manufacturing","Titanium"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","uid":"bnV99khMVeG3t9dh4evZESg","uuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","parentUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","rootUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","name":"Politechnika Koszalińska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ae878c28a04739a9a4","5e7092ae878c28a04739a849"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Comparison of ultrasonic and other atomization methods in metal powder production","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479fd4","mniswId":"23766","title":"Journal of Achievements in Materials and Manufacturing Engineering","doi":null,"issn":"1734-8412","eissn":"2300-892X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e9f9282f-b822-4747-b229-eb192206388e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-01-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"645c9502409707440b24c0c0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ae878c28a04739a9a4","645c9502409707440b24c0c2","5e7092ae878c28a04739a849","645c9502409707440b24c0c3"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose\n\nThe results showed that the UA powder has a finer average particle size with a narrower statistical distribution of particles than those made by the GA method.

It is important to find an effective method for ensuring the safety and quality of plant materials used as food additives. Ozonated water is being considered by the EFSA for approval as a cidal agent for plant protection. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of ozonated water in improving the microbial safety of fresh-cut parsley leaves, with a particular focus on mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria and fungi. The yeasts and bacteria were identified with the MALDI-TOF MS system. Color changes on the surface of the parsley samples were measured in the CIE L*a*b trichromatic color model. The chemical composition of the essential oil was evaluated via gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GCMS). The microbial level of the fresh leaves varied and depended on the season. The highest microbial levels were found in the leaves picked in the summer and autumn, at 104 to 106 CFU/g for fungi and 106 to 108 CFU/g for bacteria. Among the isolates with the highest isolation frequency, bacteria belonging to Pseudomonas fluorescens, Staphylococcus warneri, and Bacillus megaterium dominated. The dominant yeasts and molds were Candida sp., Rhodotorula sp., Cladosporium sp., and Fusarium sp. The conditions for water ozonation (ozone dose and time) were established for both mono- and mixed cultures. Time of 3 min, ozone content of 0.5, O3 mg/L or 1 min, and 1.5 mg of O3 mg/L were sufficient for a 90% reduction in the number of living microorganisms. Yeasts and bacteria were sensitive to ozone treatment, excluding P. fluorescens rods. The tested mold strains were the most resistant. However, it was noted that organic matter might reduce the decontamination effect. The effectiveness of ozonation was negatively influenced by organic compound content above 1%. Spectrophotometric measurements of parsley leaves after ozonation, especially after 3 min treatment at 1.5 O3 mg/L, revealed morphological changes. The CIELAB color space (L*a*b*) changed in the direction of lightness and yellowness; however, ?E showed no statistically significant differences in comparison with the untreated leaves. In preliminary studies, no differences were noted in GLC-MS chromatograms for essential oils of parsley leaves before and after ozonation. The aroma of parsley treated with ozonated water was more intensely herbal than the control sample, probably due to the higher content of ? and ß phellandrene. The results of this study show that decontamination of parsley leaves by ozonated water containing 1.5 O3 mg/L in a closed 5 min process can effectively ensure the microbiological quality of fresh-cut parsley leaves. It can be concluded that ozone treatments in aqueous form appear to provide promising

are an attractive class of materials for smart and flexible electronics and are prepared from the combination of a polymer and ionic liquid which is entrapped in this matrix. Ionogels provide a continuous conductive phase with high thermal, mechanical, and chemical stability. However, because of the higher percentage of ionic liquids it is difficult to obtain an ionogel with high ionic conductivity and mechanical stability, which are very important from an application point of view. In this work, ionogel films with high flexibility, excellent ionic conductivity, and exceptional stability were prepared using polyvinyl alcohol as the host polymer matrix and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate as the ionic liquid using water as the solvent for energy storage application. The prepared ionogel films exhibited good mechanical stability along with sustaining strain of more than 100% at room temperature and low temperature, the ability to withstand twisting up to 360° and different bending conditions, and excellent ionic conductivity of 5.12 × 10−3 S/cm. The supercapacitor cell fabricated using the optimized ionogel film showed a capacitance of 39.9 F/g with an energy and power densities of 5.5 W⋅h/kg and 0.3 kW/kg, respectively confirming the suitability of ionogels for supercapacitor

utilization of plant based fillers: onion peels (OP) and durum wheat bran (WB) to obtain sustainable biocomposite materials with poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) is presented in this paper. The biocomposites were first obtained in pellet form by extrusion method and then injection moldings were made from the pellets. Two kinds of biocomposites were fabricated containing 15% and 30% wt. of OP or WB. Additionally, pure PBS moldings were prepared for comparative purposes. The effect of the filler type and its amount on the chemical structure, density, thermal, and thermo-mechanical properties of the fabricated composite samples was studied. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy results showed that the composite preparation method had no effect on the chemical structure of composite components, but weak interactions such as hydrogen bonding between OP or WB and PBS was observed. The addition of OP or WB to the composite with PBS reduced its thermal stability in comparison with pure PBS, all studied composites start to degrade below 290 °C. Additionally, the mechanical properties of the composites are worse than PBS, as the impact strength dropped by about 70%. The deterioration of tensile strength was in the range 20–47%, and the elongation at maximum load of the composites was in the range 9.22–3.42%, whereas for pure PBS it was 16.75%. On the other hand, the crystallinity degree increased from 63% for pure PBS to 79% for composite with 30% wt. of WB. The Young’s modulus increased to 160% for composition with 30% wt. of OP. Additionally, the hardness of the composites was slightly higher than PBS and was in the range 38.2–48.7 MPa. Despite the reduction in thermal stability and some mechanical properties, the studied composites show promise for everyday object production.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739234","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/20/6799","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"659fc18b4097076c144aa634","name":"Emil","lastName":"Sasimowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8fed5b82-8a5d-4e37-9ff0-7d76acd19639"},{"objectId":"5e7092f7878c28a0473a0251","name":"Marta","lastName":"Grochowicz","uuid":"4A132451AE6154E5E8185BA2EF4ADDE9F3D84D57EA5231FC456F3DF2A60EFBC97817147DFBF1B7A948AB1FEAC4C5E4668550D75A44CB66DA7D01DDF3A93ACBE9","orcidId":"0000-0002-9225-5232","documentHash":"652e8ea6-9a59-48f3-9346-94649519410f"},{"objectId":"5e7092f7878c28a0473a0249","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Szajnecki","uuid":"F7C3BAD82A18EEC25A9411E84E7D8345687ABD4DAA7C0DEA7BD2B38D75F6D88771DF58003F71FD0F36A2776A920230AA7DFF8FDA762EC7C4AE5B53F73CD3BD18","orcidId":"0000-0002-3043-7663","documentHash":"497e67fb-0711-4826-addd-05a6b428b842"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma16206799"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"64a933b34097075481552605","doi":null,"title":"Nauka i przemysł – lubelskie spotkania studenckie (2023)","year":2023,"volume":null,"isbn":"9788322797013","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://bazawiedzy.umcs.pl/info/book/UMCS408c16abbcb741968241a1e828ae55c5/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"d2029f40-e99e-49ae-9a7b-09a2a8b77f74","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb8f4","mniswId":"59500","name":"Uniwersytet Marii Curie-Skłodowskiej w Lublinie","documentHash":"d938889a-f872-4771-bf34-8062ee136ee9"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Stała mikroelektroda bizmutowa jako nowatorski sensor do oznaczeń śladowych stężeń Ga(III)","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"656880ac40970749a8d287cc","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f5878c28a0473a0091","657043e74097071b8e60c9b9"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060739235","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"136-139","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://bazawiedzy.umcs.pl/info/article/UMCSe57de1414d3943e9a308ce375d53a5b7/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"657043e74097071b8e60c9b9","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Wlazlowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bbe9ecf6-9927-4328-b5bb-1876f21277ef"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a0091","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Grabarczyk","uuid":"B24CA952A822B53951AFA8FB42C4AAAA19C20217D30BF175CB1E27B117BD67A558DBEB2697443412DDCA9B076AF269484D2A19009FEE5C2DFAC78A6079BE7DF1","orcidId":"0000-0002-0952-050X","documentHash":"f05882f9-1693-420a-8371-c9cbefccea17"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CO2 methanation","Neodymium","Nickel catalyst","Ceria","Alumina","Basicity"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Neodymium promoted ceria and alumina supported nickel catalysts for CO2 methanation reaction","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477156","mniswId":"1525","title":"Applied Surface Science","doi":null,"issn":"0169-4332","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"6b1a871d-474e-41fa-bd55-783bef013932"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-05-15","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"646f20944097076e9c3e34f4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f5878c28a0473a0094","5e7092f5878c28a0473a0099","5e7092f5878c28a0473a00c2","5e7092f5878c28a0473a009e","5e7092f5878c28a04739ffa4"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Two series of catalysts containing 20 wt.% nickel, promoted with different amounts of neodymium from 1 to 10 wt.% were prepared by the impregnation method, using nano-CeO2 and γ-Al2O3 as supports. Ceria supported nickel catalysts showed high activity in CO2 methanation reaction and weak activity changes were observed with an increase in Nd content. X-ray diffraction, hydrogen chemisorption and transmission electron microscopy studies evidenced a decrease in the average size of nickel crystallites and an increase in the active surface area of catalysts. The temperature-programmed reduction, oxidation and CO2 desorption, XPS, Raman and in-situ FTIR spectroscopy indicated complex changes in the nature of their redox and base centres.

Injection mouldings were subjected to biodegradation in compost-filled bioreactors under controlled humidity and temperature conditions. The effects of composting time (14, 42 and 70 days) and WB mass content (10%, 30% and 50% wt.) on the structural and thermal properties of the samples were investigated. Measurements were made by infrared spectral analysis, scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, and gel permeation chromatography. Results demonstrated that both the thermal and structural properties of the samples depended greatly on the biodegradation time. Specifically, their crystallinity degree increased significantly while molecular mass sharply decreased with biodegradation time, whereas their thermal resistance only showed a slight increase. This resulted from enzymatic hydrolysis that led to the breakdown of ester bonds in polymer chains. It was also found that a higher WB content led to a higher mass loss in the biocomposite samples during biodegradation and affected their post-biodegradation properties. A higher bran content increased the degree of crystallinity of the biocomposite samples but reduced their thermal resistance and molecular mass.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739238","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/21/6843","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"659fc1c14097076c144aa836","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Majewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"771142b8-5f22-489f-a8ba-b50f12a8bb17"},{"objectId":"659fc1c14097076c144aa835","name":"Emil","lastName":"Sasimowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6fb0857b-c89b-4c0a-80bc-56a166471686"},{"objectId":"5e7092f7878c28a0473a0251","name":"Marta","lastName":"Grochowicz","uuid":"4A132451AE6154E5E8185BA2EF4ADDE9F3D84D57EA5231FC456F3DF2A60EFBC97817147DFBF1B7A948AB1FEAC4C5E4668550D75A44CB66DA7D01DDF3A93ACBE9","orcidId":"0000-0002-9225-5232","documentHash":"652e8ea6-9a59-48f3-9346-94649519410f"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma16216843"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","uid":"bWyeXRlH0huS_TwqiYk7m5Q","uuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","parentUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","rootUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","name":"Uniwersytet

paper presents various aspects of the use of chromatography to determine the biological activity of substances. On the one hand, the use of chromatography to determine the lipophilicity of a substance, a property that affects all LADME steps in various biomimetic systems, is presented, using various descriptors such as the retention factor in pure water (or buffer with physiological plasma pH), the CHI value, and Chrom logD. The use of chromatography in biomimetic systems to determine the interaction of substances with phospholipids (IAM stationary phases) and transport proteins (stationary phases with immobilised proteins) is also discussed. On the basis of the retention data obtained in these systems, the volume of distribution of the substance and the degree of binding of the substance with the proteins in question can be determined. Chromatography is also a method used to determine the interaction of substances with specific membrane receptors at their site of action using membrane chromatography (MCM). Thanks to biological detection, chromatography can also be used to determine the antimicrobial activity (bioautography) of substances and the effect of substances on biochemical reactions taking place in organisms, such as antioxidant properties and the inhibitory activity of various enzymes (biological

Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are large-scale eruptions observed close to the Sun. They travel through the heliosphere and possibly interact with the Earth environment, creating interruptions or even damaging new-technology instruments. Most of the time their physical conditions (velocity, density and pressure) are measured in situ at only one point in space, with no possibility of having information on the variation of these parameters during their journey from the Sun to Earth.\n\nAim: Our aim is to understand the evolution of the internal physical parameters of a set of three particular fast halo CMEs. These CMEs were launched between 15 and 18 July 2002. Surprisingly, the related interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs), observed near Earth, have a low, and in one case a very low, plasma density.\n\nMethod:  We use the EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA) model to simulate the propagation of the CMEs in the background solar wind by placing virtual spacecraft along the Sun–Earth line. We set up the initial conditions at 0.1 au, first with a cone model and then with a linear force-free spheromak model.\n\nResults:  Relatively good agreement between the simulation results and observations concerning the speed, density and arrival times of the ICMEs is obtained by adjustment of the initial CME parameters. In particular, this is achieved by increasing the initial magnetic pressure so that a fast expansion is induced in the inner heliosphere. This resulted in the development of fast expansion for two of the three ICMEs. In contrast, the intermediate ICME is strongly overtaken by the last ICME, so its expansion is strongly limited.\n\nConclusions:  First, we show that a magnetic configuration with an out-of-force balance close to the Sun mitigates the EUHFORIA assumptions related to an initial uniform velocity. Second, the overexpansion of the ejected magnetic configuration in the inner heliosphere is one plausible origin for the low density observed in some ICMEs at 1 au. Furthermore, we conclude for one ICME, surrounded by two other ICMEs, that the in situ observed very low density has a possible coronal origin."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739247","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63034ac94097075e4a6b5f59","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"70","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"120486c0-66d9-4b60-b3a9-6a6a28060252"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"70","pagesFromTo":"1663-1683","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117722004847?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2b","name":"Stefaan","lastName":"Poedts","uuid":"E30515B6831744043DFF6116308CAADF77B5F0C972E5A368DB49146E9779BB06976217A98AF4D837221C3ED8E97238836204CBB8C77804B509343F88AD17DDF9","orcidId":"0000-0002-1743-0651","documentHash":"c635d010-d0a5-4637-8a13-98fc1c24e343"},{"objectId":"63048e1f40970739a7627df1","name":"Camilla","lastName":"Scolini","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d2b88868-c87e-4c5b-8329-d37ef328a8a9"},{"objectId":"63048e1f40970739a7627df0","name":"Evangelia","lastName":"Samara","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"81dd578e-f2c4-4de9-94cf-d9ea89b08ca5"},{"objectId":"63048e1f40970739a7627def","name":"Benjamin","lastName":"Grison","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e1d872f3-b6a3-4a3a-8fa6-62b5e2086679"},{"objectId":"63048e1f40970739a7627dee","name":"Sergio","lastName":"Dasso","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6d62b394-c990-454c-a0f6-7f3e71bb7da5"},{"objectId":"63048e1f40970739a7627ded","name":"Pascal","lastName":"Démoulin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"207a0f9f-cec8-4270-af40-64d7f2c45293"},{"objectId":"63048e1f40970739a7627dec","name":"Brigitte","lastName":"Schmieder","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e66c45db-3232-41eb-9482-ded1c89b220c"},{"objectId":"63048e1f40970739a7627deb","name":"Christine","lastName":"Verbeke","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ebc34ac2-0564-4924-8abb-588d1ef734f1"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.asr.2022.06.013"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Diogenes Laertios, Żywot Arystotelesa, nowy polski przekład"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Diogenes Laertius, the Live of Aristotle, a new Polish translation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"637b6ce44097076055e55128","doi":null,"title":"Viro Vere Academico Księga poświęcona pamięci profesora Bogdana Walczaka","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-66703-89-6","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"http://cwn.ajp.edu.pl/2022/55/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"5a6e4491-df8a-409f-9288-643bb85eed12","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb775","mniswId":"11000","name":"Akademia im.

COolfluid COrona uNstrUcTured (COCONUT) is a global coronal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model that was recently developed and will soon be integrated into the ESA Virtual Space Weather Modelling Centre (VSWMC). In order to achieve robustness and fast convergence to a steady state for numerical simulations with COCONUT, several assumptions and simplifications were made during its development, such as prescribing filtered photospheric magnetic maps to represent the magnetic field conditions in the lower corona. This filtering leads to smoothing and lower magnetic field values at the inner boundary (i.e. the solar surface), resulting in an unrealistically high plasma β (greater than 1 in a large portion of the domain).\r\n\r\nAims. We aim to examine the effects of prescribing such filtered magnetograms in global coronal simulations and formulate a method for achieving more realistic plasma β values and improving the resolution of electromagnetic features without losing computational performance.\r\n\r\nMethods. We made use of the newly developed COCONUT solver to demonstrate the effects of the highly pre-processed magnetic maps set at the inner boundary and the resulting high plasma β on the features in the computational domain. Then, in our new approach, we shifted the inner boundary to 2 R⊙ from the original 1.01 R⊙ and preserved the prescribed highly filtered magnetic map. With the shifted boundary, the boundary density and pressure were also naturally adjusted to better represent the considered physical location. This effectively reduces the prescribed plasma β and leads to a more realistic setup. The method was applied on a magnetic dipole, a minimum (2008) and a maximum (2012) solar activity case, to demonstrate its effects.\r\n\r\nResults. The results obtained with the proposed approach show significant improvements in the resolved density and radial velocity profiles, and far more realistic values of the plasma β at the boundary and inside the computational domain. This is also demonstrated via synthetic white light imaging (WLI) and with the validation against tomography data. The computational performance comparison shows similar convergence to a limit residual on the same grid when compared to the original setup. Considering that the grid can be further coarsened with this new setup, as its capacity to resolve features or structures is superior, the operational performance can be additionally increased if needed.\r\n\r\nConclusions. The newly developed method is thus deemed as a good potential replacement of the original setup for operational purposes, providing higher physical detail of the resolved profiles while preserving a good convergence and robustness of the solver."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739254","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"676","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/08/aa46788-23/aa46788-23.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65a1166f4097076c14503fc3","name":"Andrea","lastName":" Lani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2b2bc17c-4e69-449d-8519-8f39bc94bb73"},{"objectId":"65a1166f4097076c14503fc2","name":"Fan","lastName":"Zhang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"47dafef1-4a76-475e-9cca-396be19ca8d8"},{"objectId":"65a1166f4097076c14503fc1","name":"Błażej","lastName":"Kuźma","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f261e294-ab7a-48b9-ab7f-d988b31adad3"},{"objectId":"65a1166f4097076c14503fc0","name":"Michaela","lastName":"Brchnelova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"922e31ac-8960-47d3-bcb3-fcd528dd7dae"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2b","name":"Stefaan","lastName":"Poedts","uuid":"E30515B6831744043DFF6116308CAADF77B5F0C972E5A368DB49146E9779BB06976217A98AF4D837221C3ED8E97238836204CBB8C77804B509343F88AD17DDF9","orcidId":"0000-0002-1743-0651","documentHash":"c635d010-d0a5-4637-8a13-98fc1c24e343"}],"doi":"10.1051/0004-6361/202346788"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Alterations in the Anatomy and Ultrastructure of Leaf Blade in Norway Maple (<i>Acer platanoides</i> L.)
