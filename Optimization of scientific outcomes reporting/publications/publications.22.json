(Coleoptera: Bostrichidae), is a major global pest of cereal grains. Infestations are difficult to control as larvae feed inside grain kernels, and many populations are resistant to both contact insecticides and fumigants. We sequenced the genome of R. dominica to identify genes responsible for important biological functions and develop more targeted and efficacious management strategies. The genome was assembled from long read sequencing and long-range scaffolding technologies. The genome assembly is 479.1 Mb, close to the predicted genome size of 480.4 Mb by flow cytometry. This assembly is among the most contiguous beetle assemblies published to date, with 139 scaffolds, an N50 of 53.6 Mb, and L50 of 4, indicating chromosome-scale scaffolds. Predicted genes from biologically relevant groups were manually annotated using transcriptome data from adults and different larval tissues to guide annotation. The expansion of carbohydrase and serine peptidase genes suggest that they combine to enable efficient digestion of cereal proteins. A reduction in the copy number of several detoxification gene families relative to other coleopterans may reflect the low selective pressure on these genes in an insect that spends most of its life feeding internally. Chemoreceptor genes contain elevated numbers of pseudogenes for odorant receptors that also may be related to the recent ontogenetic shift of R. dominica to a diet consisting primarily of stored grains. Analysis of repetitive sequences will further define the evolution of bostrichid beetles compared to other species. The data overall contribute significantly to coleopteran genetic research."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086175","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"446

is a secondary metabolite of yeasts belonging to the Metschnikowia pulcherrima clade, and pulcherrimin formation is responsible for the antimicrobial action of its producers. Understanding the environmental function of this metabolite can provide insight into various microbial interactions and enables the efficient development of new effective bioproducts and methods. In this study, we evaluated the antimicrobial and antiadhesive action of yeast pulcherrimin, as well as its protective properties under selected stressful conditions. Classical microbiological plate methods, microscopy, and physico-chemical testing were used. The results show that pure pulcherrimin does not have antimicrobial properties, but its unique hydrophilic nature may hinder the adhesion of hydrophilic bacterial cells to abiotic surfaces. Pulcherrimin also proved to be a good cell protectant against UV–C radiation at both high and low temperatures."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086181","journalIssue":{"objectId":"622af1bf2467f040f2429782","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"27","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"4ebf97fa-5d00-4128-b703-4d40be087388"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/6/1855","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6735a44dfdbe83034961f444","name":"Renata","lastName":"Vadkertiova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ca13c48a-2d3f-407d-b5ad-564f5d247f96"},{"objectId":"6735a44dfdbe83034961f443","name":"Maria","lastName":"Nowacka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c2027975-4d74-4b36-a25b-0ffbd7f0d71f"},{"objectId":"5e7094be878c28a0473c2ea1","name":"Anna","lastName":"Rygała","uuid":"18088B6C985B42027A39FADC34197B99535D6B81923E8774C9F8A39C9B7CB2D750902F7103254DC97A399A055B175764F82FDA59BA2C7F6DE47CED00710BB2CF","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"79ddc507-3e72-4472-877b-e8e5e3c4c12f"},{"objectId":"5e709334878c28a0473a4d80","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Kręgiel","uuid":"ADD5B0426951351AEE598D0105F571DADBB9153A1482C8669F5001B912138761ABB42D057069BBFBA27B16AA7CA45F660DCADE76DD41E29E6E24C03F608D0B0A","orcidId":"0000-0002-4006-6464","documentHash":"08b518db-73ee-4d16-b530-9946e2e4fee9"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules27061855"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","uid":"bFhiVYWupXf-L0BTdpdX5dg","uuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","parentUuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","rootUuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","name":"Instytut

order to prevent oxidative damage, an experiment was conducted to determine the effectiveness of berries extracts (Aronia melanocarpa Elliot and Ribes nigrum L.) in the production of half-smoked sausages. The recipe of half-smoked sausages with a polycomponent composition of raw materials includes semi-fat pork with muscle tissue, tendon-free lean pork, tendon-free Muscovy duck meat, side pork, hydrated bamboo fiber.\n\nBerry extracts (Aronia melanocarpa Elliot and Ribes nigrum L.) at concentrations of 0.2–0.5 % to the weight of crude minced meat were added to the examined samples of minced meat. Sample No. 1 was a control, that is, made without the addition of extracts of berries.\n\nDuring the storage of products with extracts, an acidic number, a peroxide number, a thiobarbituric number, and the predefined indicators of microbiological safety were determined.\n\nThe addition of chokeberry extract in the amount of 0.2–0.5 % to the minced meat weight significantly slows down the hydrolytic oxidation of lipids in finished products, effectively inhibits the peroxide oxidation of fat. The use of blackcurrant extract also has an antioxidant effect but is weaker. Stabilizing the peroxide oxidation of lipids in half-smoked sausages has the effect of inhibiting the formation of secondary oxidation products, which is confirmed by the results reported here. The amount of secondary oxidation products was the smallest at the end of the shelf life of the product with a concentration of chokeberry extract of 0.5 % and was 0.197±0.001 mg MA/kg, which is 3.74 times lower than that in the control.\n\nThe addition of extracts of chokeberry and black currant reduces microbiological contamination and has a bacteriostatic effect. The most effective is the introduction of chokeberry extract in the amount of 0.05 %, which reduces the oxidative damage to fat by more than three times."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086196","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623727112467f0495b045a4e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"11 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"b96daa63-da3d-45b2-b748-8bd27ce8fd32"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"33-40","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/252369/250748","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62372d302467f0495b046284","name":"Olena","lastName":"Moroz","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4122-2331","documentHash":"077e3572-569c-4a82-a6a3-62225f22bbc2"},{"objectId":"62372d302467f0495b046283","name":"Oleksandra","lastName":"Haschuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2726-5271","documentHash":"3c129167-d71c-483f-a308-79a95ae36d6a"},{"objectId":"62372d302467f0495b046282","name":"Roman","lastName":"Svyatnenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0895-6982","documentHash":"175039fc-3f60-4a4c-985a-c31078bc6264"},{"objectId":"62372d302467f0495b046281","name":"Yevgeniia","lastName":"Shubina","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7153-999X","documentHash":"fe1876af-dbe9-45d3-a093-bd7debe8d8e1"},{"objectId":"62372d302467f0495b046280","name":"Andriy","lastName":"Marynin","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6692-7472","documentHash":"221d8151-0eb7-4790-8817-1d0e8aeba48b"},{"objectId":"62372d302467f0495b04627f","name":"Vasyl","lastName":"Tischenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8149-4919","documentHash":"596cfcc7-b629-489c-86cf-9c47c03bf2a5"},{"objectId":"62372d302467f0495b04627e","name":"Nataliia","lastName":"Bozhko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6440-0175","documentHash":"8f690332-cbbe-4395-b9b1-9f0cbc574108"},{"objectId":"62372d302467f0495b04627d","name":"Vasyl","lastName":"Pasichnyi","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0138-5590","documentHash":"3a66007a-f8d6-4a41-956c-8a9f21ebf160"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.252369"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-63216-65-8","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Poszerzamy horyzonty.

Production of exopolysaccharides increases the chance of probiotic survival in the gastrointestinal tract and promotes adhesion to the epithelium; In our previous research, LBP can be used as potential prebiotics. Therefore we hypothesize that LBP supported the adhesion of Lactobacillus spp. After adding LBP, the result showed that LBP promoted the adhesion of 7 Lactobacillus strains, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM had the maximum adhesion rate ranging from 6.2 ± 1.16 to 25.5 ± 1.80 CFU/cell. Specifically, the components of LBP were analyzed by gas chromatography, We found that the similarity of polysaccharide components mainly promoted adhesion. After adding antibiotics, the Lactiplantibacillus plantarum LP-39 was affected; LBP was then added to revert from 5.0 ± 0.63 to 6.5 ± 0.67 CFU/cell. These findings suggest that LBP is potential prebiotics and can enhance the adhesion of Lactobacillus to Caco-2

Beetroots were subjected to high-power microwave drying followed by low-power microwave drying (HMD+LMD), high-power microwave drying (HMD), low-power microwave drying (LMD), high-power microwave drying followed by hot air drying (HMD+HAD), hot air drying followed by low-power microwave drying (HAD+LMD), high-power microwave drying followed by vacuum drying (HMD+VD), and vacuum drying followed by low-power microwave drying (VD+LMD). The drying time, moisture content, hardness, color, microstructure, betalains, ascorbic acid, total flavonoids, 2,2′-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzоthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) of beetroots were analyzed. The shortest drying time (67.0 min) was observed in HMD, while VD+LMD required the longest drying time of 308.0 min. There was no significant difference in the moisture content of dried beetroots prepared by different microwave-assisted drying methods. Beetroots dried by HMD+HAD showed the highest hardness of 1332.0 g, VD+LMD led to the most desirable color with the lowest total color change. Porous structures were found in beetroots produced by HMD+LMD, HMD and LMD. Beetroots prepared by VD+LMD displayed the highest content of betacyanin, betaxanthin and total flavonoids. While beetroots dried by HMD illustrated the highest ascorbic acid content of 272.3 mg/100 g dry weight (DW). In terms of antioxidant activity, the highest FRAP value of beetroots obtained using VD+LMD was 14.95 mg trolox equivalent (TE)/g DW. Meanwhile, beetroots dried by VD+LMD exhibited the largest ABTS radical scavenging activity (16.92 mg TE/g DW). Compared to other microwave-assisted drying methods, VD+LMD is a more promising method for drying beetroots."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086232","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623727112467f0495b045a4e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"11 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"b96daa63-da3d-45b2-b748-8bd27ce8fd32"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"15-25","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/251942/250745","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6237286e2467f0495b045fb7","name":"Dan","lastName":"Gao","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3814-5374","documentHash":"f93061b4-72ef-4b04-87d7-0323114fd8e9"},{"objectId":"6237286e2467f0495b045fb6","name":"Zhenhua","lastName":"Duan","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9283-3629","documentHash":"36e47809-e89d-4941-a541-e402363fc057"},{"objectId":"6237286e2467f0495b045fb5","name":"Sergey","lastName":"Sabadash","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0371-8208","documentHash":"84ce11b9-ec0b-4b1d-b055-f19e37c977ca"},{"objectId":"6237286d2467f0495b045fb4","name":"Yan","lastName":"Liu","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6322-7013","documentHash":"803b2dea-c16a-4052-ae5a-86293e857b91"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.251942"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Enhancement of graphene-related and substrate-related Raman modes through dielectric layer deposition","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477144","mniswId":"1503","title":"Applied Physics Letters","doi":null,"issn":"0003-6951","eissn":"1077-3118","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"88fa8da5-9b7e-4764-8245-d217ada67123"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6239877d2467f009d3feb90b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709446878c28a0473b9726","5ebee44b752340254fc444a0","65c9fff340970762634b86b3","65c9fff340970762634b86b4","65c9fff340970762634b86b5","65c9fff340970762634b86b6"]},"issue":"6","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058086236","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"120","pagesFromTo":"063105","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65c9fff340970762634b86b6","name":"Tymoteusz","lastName":"Ciuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"21350498-7f7e-4cf1-9188-9c890772127c"},{"objectId":"65c9fff340970762634b86b5","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Wysmołek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3dcf9d16-7975-469b-bace-0a5e9d0b8d61"},{"objectId":"65c9fff340970762634b86b4","name":"Artur","lastName":"Dobrowolski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0724700b-86af-40f4-bc4d-e7f602a56870"},{"objectId":"65c9fff340970762634b86b3","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Jagiełło","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5349d186-fcce-4fb7-b311-30df7e8da152"},{"objectId":"5ebee44b752340254fc444a0","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Budzich","uuid":"D0362ABD7F7C523D560ADFA22542F9732E59943D1CCB3475101C0C42DF1F262304C9750D5378F76B4353580127C223ACB024F889DF985DBB625915D58538A973","orcidId":"0000-0001-8038-3942","documentHash":"c8015063-8dbb-42a2-84a4-719ba993d242"},{"objectId":"5e709446878c28a0473b9726","name":"KAROLINA","lastName":"PIĘTAK -

Microwave heating and current drive systems, especially lower hybrid current drive, can generate a significant population of suprathermal electrons in the plasma. Also, in the case of the runaway electron generation and mitigation by massive gas injection, the collisions with impurities can have a significant impact on the electron drag force. A correct description of the fast electrons collisions with non-fully ionized impurities requires calculation of the atomic form factor. This can be done with ab initio models that are accurate, though time consuming in practical applications. In this paper, we compare existing approximations of the form factors, based on the Thomas–Fermi or Pratt–Tseng models. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used as a reference method to determine the accuracy of the compared models. Based on this analysis, we propose some modifications of the existing models, tuned with numerical parameter optimization, which provide a higher accuracy while maintaining a short computation time. These modifications include multiple exponents in the Pratt–Tseng model and fitting the parameters of the form factor equation to the DFT-based results. Some applications of the presented models to the calculation of the elastic and inelastic collision frequencies for Fokker–Planck equation are presented, showing a good agreement between the results

point of departure is the hypothesis of the fundamental difference in viewing translation by the translator and by the target language reader: the former focuses on the original and a search for equivalents, whereas the latter has no contact either with the original or the process of translation. It is interesting that without contact with the original, the recipient of translation nevertheless has an illusion of accessing that original. Looking at translation as a linguistically secondary text largely determines the translator’s activity – but not the reception of the final product by the reader. In conclusion, one can hypothesize that translation is doubly conditioned: by the original text and by its future communicative context. In each, a textual point of reference can be determined: the original text and parallel texts, respectively. The translation’s secondariness is thus two-dimensional. It follows that translation, viewed above all as a linguistically secondary text (being based on an original), nevertheless functions independently of this feature.

Therefore, it becomes necessary to determine the conditions for the formation of a barrier for water absorption and to elucidate a mechanism for inhibiting the transfer of moisture to the material. In this regard, a mathematical model of the intensity of water mass transfer when using a polymer shell made of organic material as a coating has been built, which makes it possible to assess the effectiveness of the polymer shell by the amount of water absorbed. Based on the experimental data and theoretical dependences, the intensity of absorption of water by wood was calculated; and it has been established that the protective coating reduces the amount of water absorbed by more than 20 times. The results of determining the weight gain by a sample during water exposure indicate an ambiguous impact of the nature of protection on water absorption. In particular, this implies the presence of data sufficient for the qualitative process of inhibition of moisture diffusion; and detecting, on its basis, the point in time when the drop in the coating's efficiency begins. Analysis of the results of experiments reveals that the maximum increase in mass in the case of water absorption by a non-treated sample of wood was 40 % while the increase in the mass of wood samples treated with mixtures of oil and paraffin was less than 28 %. At the same time, the best protection is shown by a mixture of oil with paraffin within 90÷95 %. Thus, there are grounds to assert the possibility of directed regulation of wood protection processes through the use of polymer coatings that can form a protective layer on the surface of the material, which inhibits the rate of absorption of water."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086292","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62371c532467f0495b043ddb","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"10 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"00866e92-d0a0-418a-ae61-252ac34eb210"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"48-54","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/252176/250700","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623726302467f0495b0455e4","name":"Andrii","lastName":"Matviichuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4051-2484","documentHash":"6e2f624f-b135-417f-a8b4-b9ae293bc329"},{"objectId":"623726302467f0495b0455e3","name":"Kostiantyn","lastName":"Sokolenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4436-0377","documentHash":"2891eaab-e604-4499-8d26-d82e866751c8"},{"objectId":"623726302467f0495b0455e2","name":"Аleksii","lastName":"Tsapko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2298-068X","documentHash":"64e9177e-ec28-4c5a-900f-34aeceff2046"},{"objectId":"623726302467f0495b0455e1","name":"Serhii","lastName":"Mazurchuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6008-9591","documentHash":"118b46ec-8e6e-4181-9632-ccec021377e8"},{"objectId":"623726302467f0495b0455e0","name":"Oleksandra","lastName":"Horbachova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7533-5628","documentHash":"fc11974c-f59c-4b20-98e8-be1fbd535151"},{"objectId":"623726302467f0495b0455df","name":"Yuriy","lastName":"Tsapko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0625-0783","documentHash":"f55650c6-cbc9-4f32-9adc-93fbfd124aa5"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.252176"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["educational balls","gross motor","learning","locomotor skills","mathematical skills","object control","primary education","reading","writing"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","parentUuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","rootUuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

For example, several experiments show that children’s participation in Eduball, i.e., a method that uses educational balls with printed letters, numbers, and other signs, improves their physical fitness while simultaneously developing their mathematical and language skills. However, the question of who should conduct such classes to make them most effective (regular classroom teachers, physical education teachers, or maybe both in cooperation?) remains unanswered. Here, we replicated a previous Eduball experiment, but now, instead of one experimental group, there were three. In the first, Eduball-classes were conducted by the classroom teacher, in the second, by the physical education teacher, and in the third, collaboratively. After one year intervention, all experimental groups significantly improved both their cognitive (mathematical, reading, and writing) and gross motor (locomotor and object control) skills, and these effects were larger than in the control group participating in traditional PE. Importantly, there were no differences in progression between the Eduball-groups. Thus, our study demonstrates that methods linking PE with cognitive tasks can be effectively used by both PE specialists and general classroom teachers."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086299","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61eaa9aa2467f06f09e1bc9d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"19","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"2459da2e-8a6b-461b-a1c9-c173120520ea"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"art. 1275, s. 1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/3/1275","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61eff95a2467f0312281ffcf","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Korbecki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"97f94b81-88a6-435c-b1a7-9ee0fd8ecccb"},{"objectId":"602cc73e9543c7410626e326","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Rościszewska","uuid":"A6C4BBEAE8D6E9E2B49434076993927DC3F5CE99D1E19D0F70E0B26F810139D2392682B238ABD60D5C7D73208FF1702BC23FFE35110E028A62E91FD208FF2B49","orcidId":"0000-0001-7834-2316","documentHash":"193366d6-bb93-489c-bb9c-8bbbc62b82e4"},{"objectId":"5e7093bf878c28a0473b01e2","name":"Michał","lastName":"Klichowski","uuid":"E4812F365B59C26BB5833E94E9B1EAD7A0FD3CE11C97B23488895BEE94E540A4614619020C08D405057DF47C8098C6B0A05D74AA58D1E29498BD9C99D2AB479D","orcidId":"0000-0002-1614-926X","documentHash":"3fc50877-dc8d-4108-aadb-8bb17996a53a"},{"objectId":"5e70937f878c28a0473ab324","name":"Sara","lastName":"Wawrzyniak","uuid":"0DBDFA20B266D099952D954BB3663793040BD3A9B3F4444A95410746D1D2C57227BDAE153DB5360A3420589A2474D9D09F092FABC4B03AFCE9C1236C67C4C696","orcidId":"0000-0003-3040-6637","documentHash":"34943408-42f6-4505-8fb4-1f1d6c64fd17"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047395015","name":"Ireneusz","lastName":"Cichy","uuid":"8D2F70EBF02138DE634464660A686418EAAB5D00D8CCB784FBAF95414F58EAD2F96BD782F8CEB2C9454A0FF0D1BAFC0B419C56E405841E1A442CAEED007ACC81","orcidId":"0000-0001-6425-4139","documentHash":"c917444a-e86b-4912-9165-9a1ef95c64c8"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047394fd7","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Rokita","uuid":"BB088FBBA908D24FC179EDFB6638E13A4CAD828196AD72FE4591D983AFA88A776C79955C94F5F203D20DBDFA89044E9267E5718EBFE4D71BCC4C9627DEA602BB","orcidId":"0000-0001-5281-811X","documentHash":"026d8d14-4f21-4960-b134-351863e2b536"},{"objectId":"5e70925b878c28a047394529","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Przybyła","uuid":"53DA37C03AE5DEE46F95E84CA33150A0E9ED37674ECB68F7010CCC0442E610A85964AC17B0230292FAE430F3A75738447D1830186E2010480D55C9574E735893","orcidId":"0000-0002-8309-6559","documentHash":"a77a5d14-cac1-4628-b8ad-4c436e423b11"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["muscle progenitor","in vitro culture","cell therapy","CD markers","growth media"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Optimization of human myoblasts culture under different media conditions for application in the in vitro studies.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b93f","mniswId":"981","title":"American Journal of Stem Cells","doi":null,"issn":"2160-4150","eissn":"2160-4150","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"7506d509-8150-4ab3-b03e-49918d816efa"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62384d292467f067af11f168","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d3878c28a04739d748"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Human primary in vitro cell cultures are among the most challenging procedures in cellular biology laboratory practice. Myoblasts-progenitor of skeletal muscle origin represent a promising therapeutic cell source since the procedure of their isolation is not technically demanding, and the in vitro culture is relatively straightforward. Myoblasts could be considered as the candidates for clinical applications due to their regenerative potential, and as the carriers of therapeutic proteins introduced through genetic modifications. The main goal of this prospective study was to evaluate different myoblasts isolation strategies based on the pre-plating technique and cells density characteristics. Moreover, testing of different myoblast media formulations-both commercially available and in-house made was performed. Our goal was to establish the in vitro protocol of myoblasts culture allowing for preservation of the proliferative potential and desired phenotype. Our results revealed that in culture of myoblasts of human muscle origin, the pre-plate technique and cell density differences did not correlate with changes in the proliferative potential, however it was observed that low density cells maintained expression of the CD56 marker up to the higher passages. Assessment of different types of culture media confirmed the best performance for DMEM based media without Chicken Embryo Extract (CEE) addition. Cells cultured in DMEM+FBS medium revealed high expression of CD56 and CD90 antigens, absence of the hematopoietic markers and presented stable proliferation profile. This finding is in line with guidelines of regulatory agencies recommending removal of the xeno-derived reagents from the manufacturing process of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMP). In this study, human myoblasts culture was optimized in vitro under different media conditions. The next approach in assessment of myoblasts propagation for potential clinical applications will be testing of the clinical grade human platelet lysate (hPL) instead of the FBS."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086302","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8918417/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d748","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Rozwadowska","uuid":"8D5727BAD1A766511C68C8A1500460DE0E6B093B91DC6C5E10697D003C9BBF5D40F040C69FFD37E0AF25F11AF75C5A7E7C53D0FF9996491D525787AF5731BF92","orcidId":"0000-0002-5111-0870","documentHash":"450e5564-3334-47a5-9555-51b592a696b9"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["alginate","bio-scaffolds","central nervous system","hydrogels","manganese","MRI","stem cells"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","parentUuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","rootUuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

However, to date, its effectiveness remains unsatisfactory due to low precision and efficacy of cell delivery; poor survival of transplanted cells; and inadequate monitoring of their fate in vivo. Fortunately, different bio-scaffolds have been proposed as cell carriers to improve the accuracy of cell delivery, survival, differentiation, and controlled release of embedded stem cells. The goal of our study was to establish hydrogel scaffolds suitable for stem cell delivery that also allow non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We focused on alginate-based hydrogels due to their natural origin, biocompatibility, resemblance to the extracellular matrix, and easy manipulation of gelation processes. We optimized the properties of alginate-based hydrogels, turning them into suitable carriers for transplanted cells. Human adipose-derived stem cells embedded in these hydrogels survived for at least 14 days in vitro. Alginate-based hydrogels were also modified successfully to allow their injectability via a needle. Finally, supplementing alginate hydrogels with Mn ions or Mn nanoparticles allowed for their visualization in vivo using manganese-enhanced MRI.

We propose a short modified fragment of NPY that should at least partially have a spectrum of biological activity of the original peptide. The compound was named nonapeptide NP9.\n\nThe aim of our study was to investigate the ability of the modified fragment of NPY to influence spatial memory and learning.\n\nMaterials and methods: the study was performed on 24 one-year-old random-bred female rats weight 220–250 g. The animals were divided into 3 groups of 8 rats each: treated with a solvent (0.9 % NaCl), a solution of peptide NP9 0.02 mg/kg and the drug “Semax” 0.1 mg/kg. All drugs were administered intranasally. The study of the effect of the peptide NP9 on spatial memory and learning ability was performed in the psychopharmacological test the Morris water maze. Navigation parameters were analyzed using Noldus EthoVision XT 14 video tracking software. The escape latency, the distance moved, the average velocity and the meander were recorded. An inter-quadrant analysis of rat behavior was also performed, for which the frequency of appearance and time spent in certain quadrants were recorded.\n\nResults: nonapeptide NP9 in the Morris water maze test demonstrated the ability to accelerate the time to find a hidden platform, reduce the distance traveled, meander, and optimize the search strategy.\n\nConclusions: NP9 peptide has demonstrated the ability to positively influence learning and spatial memory. The improvement in cognitive performance of animals administered with the peptide NP9 was no less than that of the reference nootropic drug Semax. These results substantiate the feasibility of further research with the aim of pharmaceutical development of a new nootropic

new types of composite coatings for various purposes is the most important direction in chemistry. The synthesis of composite hydroxide-sulfide compounds can be useful in various areas of applied electrochemistry.\n\nUsing a simple two-step method, thin films composed of nickel hydroxide sulfide-polyvinyl alcohol were formed. The production of nickel hydroxide sulfide-polyvinyl alcohol composite was carried out by holding the nickel hydroxide-polyvinyl alcohol composite coating formed on the glass electrode with an electrically conductive substrate in a solution of 0.03 M Na2S for 10 minutes. The formation of nickel sulfide on the surface of nickel hydroxide was shown indirectly. It was shown that there were no changes in morphology after the treatment of the electrode in sodium sulfide solution.\n\nAs a result of the treatment, the electrochemical and electrochromic characteristics changed. There was some deterioration in the average coloration depth from 55 % to 49 % for the electrode containing nickel sulfide. The electrochemical characteristics also deteriorated slightly after the formation of the sulfide film, namely, the specific capacitance, which went to the passage of anodic and cathodic processes. However, the capacitance efficiency increased from 83 % to 87 % for the sulfide-treated film. Despite this, this simple method is considered to be potentially promising for the formation of electrodes for use in other electrochemical devices.\n\nIn addition, due to the treatment in a sodium sulfide solution, it became possible to roughly determine the size of the nickel hydroxide clusters in the nickel hydroxide-polyvinyl alcohol composite coating. These clusters did not exceed 430 nm in size, which was almost equal to the lower limit of the wavelength of the visible spectrum."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086320","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6234728f2467f00ffe957ab6","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"6 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"0482f772-1de1-4f25-8803-dec366196436"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"24-30","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/252634/250773","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62347b192467f00ffe95c56b","name":"Olena","lastName":"Melnyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-5763-0431","documentHash":"785e1ed5-f900-43e8-9b80-7aa207eef06c"},{"objectId":"62347b192467f00ffe95c56a","name":"Rovil","lastName":"Nafeev","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2721-9718","documentHash":"4c00408b-b10c-4794-b497-ad47a2251004"},{"objectId":"62347b192467f00ffe95c569","name":"Vadym","lastName":"Kovalenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8012-6732","documentHash":"699608ce-52bd-4983-ac23-f50d579b22f9"},{"objectId":"62347b192467f00ffe95c568","name":"Valerii","lastName":"Kotok","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8879-7189","documentHash":"37963248-65aa-49b5-81d3-4a2c687cf9dd"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.252634"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["quality assurance","higher education","accreditation","peer review","integrated assessment model"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61a643282467f0269e92f369","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Kharkiv National University of Radio Electronics","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623454942467f00ffe94bc9d","623454942467f00ffe94bc99","623454942467f00ffe94bc9a"]},{"id":"5ec5a8eead49b340fb5582c4","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"O.

It is noted that the quality of educational programs (EP) of higher education institutions is controlled by quality assurance agencies (QAAs) using an accreditation system. The key features of the accreditation process in terms of peer review are identified. The problem of accreditation process management, namely the subjectivity and lack of consistency of expert decisions, is highlighted.\n\nThe correlation method was applied to determine the interdependencies in expert assessments (competence, meaningful orientation of judgments, and perception of the linguistic rating scale). The identified types of variables make it possible to explain the existing measure of subjectivity that affects the collective conclusion of experts.\n\nA comprehensive methodology for quantitative evaluation of the EP quality under conditions of uncertainty based on the relative importance of the relevant criteria and subcriteria, as well as the levels of expert competence using the apparatus of fuzzy mathematics, is proposed. A basic model for the formation of a collegial expert opinion on the EP quality has been developed using the example of a system of quality criteria approved by the Ukrainian QAA. Variations in the expert values of the weight coefficients and parameters of fuzzy numbers in the context of the linguistic rating scale (“A – B – E – F”) made it possible to use the means of a computational experiment. The application of this model will allow managers to positively influence the existing ambiguity of the assessment method, which requires being guided by standard criteria and at the same time determining the EP innovativeness.

The edge wetting angle (θ0) and the ratio (dCosθ/dСS) were used as the criterion for assessing the wettability of solid substrates. In aqueous solutions (without acrylic resin), both surfactants improve the wetting of the substrates. For PS, all the substrates studied, depending on θ depression, can be arranged in a row: ST>PA>GL>TiO2.\n\nFor SPA: PA>TiO2>GL>ST. The introduction of an acrylic film-forming agent in the composition enhances the wetting ability of SPA (in comparison with the aqueous solution of surfactants). With an increase in the concentration of SPA from 0 to 4 g/dm3 in acrylic resin solutions, the edge wetting angle of steel decreases by 6÷8° (while in water by only 3°).\n\nWith respect to TiO2, the wetting activity of SPA does not depend on the acrylic content of the water. PS in acrylic-containing compositions exhibits worse wetting activity than SPA. The introduction of surfactants in the compositions improves the quality of coatings. With optimal SPA contents in the compositions, the corrosion rate of coatings is reduced (in distilled water by 45 %, in 60 % NaCl solution by 60 %). At the same time, the gloss of coatings increases by 50 % while adhesion increases by 2 points (according to ISO 11845: 2020). This is fully correlated with the nature of the effect of surfactants on the wetting of the steel substrate and pigment (titanium dioxide). Based on probabilistic-deterministic planning, the compositions of WB paints were optimized, ensuring their maximum wetting of TiO2 and ST.

The content of oxygen was modified by annealing at 800 °C/48h in different atmosphere (air, O2 and Ar). The Curie temperature TC increases from 250 K to 319.5 K and to 322.9 K with the content of oxygen.

The frequency dependence of ΔT (f) and the shape of maximum in ΔT (T) and −ΔSmax (T) indicate relaxation processes and presence of magnetic inhomogeneities which are present mostly in sample treated in Ar.

The collection contains two large groups of HBSs with different physical properties. The main distinction between the two groups is the evolutionary status of the primary star. The first group of about 100 systems contains a hot main-sequence or a Hertzsprung-gap primary star, while the second group of about 900 systems includes a red giant. For each star, we provide two-decade-long time-series photometry, in the Cousins <i>I</i>- and Johnson <i>V</i>-band filters, obtained by the OGLE project.

The permanent gully types are: (1) discontinuous gullies, mostly located on hillslopes and (2) large continuous gullies in valley bottoms.\nThis study seeks to improve our understanding of the development of discontinuous gullies over variable timescales (mostly 17–30 years, but also including data collected since 1961) by providing quantitative information on gully evolution and processes. Several methods were used to accurately measure and estimate gully growth. These include intensive field monitoring between 1978 and 2000 using the ‘stakes grid method,’ repeated levelling until 2019, analysis of aerial photographs and Caesium-137 analysis.\nThe discontinuous gullies occur as single, successive (chains) or clusters. These are associated with small catchments (usually <100 ha in area) and ephemeral peak runoff discharges are usually ≤2 m3 s−1. The ‘hydraulic radius at bankfull-channel’ tended to decrease downstream of the gully head, accompanied by a gradual increase in gully bottom width. A salient tendency observed during major runoff events was for the hydraulic radius of the flow to progressively decrease  downslope, accompanied by decreasing sedimentation rates on gully floors. The mean linear gully head retreat for 31 gullies was 0.97 m yr−1, indicative of a relatively slow erosion rate. However, their ‘pulsatory’ development was mostly controlled by runoff accommodation when runoff enters and is conveyed through a gully. We especially discuss the changing runoff pattern or ‘variable-geometry flow.’ The R2 of the association between linear gully head retreat or areal gully growth and catchment area indicated a weak correlation for discontinuous gullies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086382","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e16a442467f00328c73b9a","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"398","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"c0da4c08-9df0-4b97-8401-7de651fdee73"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"398","pagesFromTo":"108024","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X21004323?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61e16a442467f00328c73b98","name":"Michael Augustine","lastName":"Fullen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"58a9fecb-9bc8-4f39-b1fb-79e6c9dc6c23"},{"objectId":"61e16a442467f00328c73b96","name":"Lilian","lastName":"Niacșu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3b8578a5-2af2-4f26-b0ed-502e4fee4257"},{"objectId":"61e16a442467f00328c73b93","name":"Ion","lastName":"Ioniță","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1c040dba-9103-4810-82b5-ce70b5f3b378"},{"objectId":"5ebed7eb752340254fc40d73","name":"Jean","lastName":"Poesen","uuid":"D29B7A1EFC0A991B826FDD2646418935A73E1BDE11906E166850F8F3F1F4FC63467F00EC2A583721567180FC2DADCB5AAE2BA63502DB51AB5D6C1BDABD6657B9","orcidId":"0000-0001-6218-8967","documentHash":"f4ff93c0-be91-4abb-9708-a2e3a90838ff"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.geomorph.2021.108024"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["microclimate","air ionization","electrostatic charge","ultrasonic humidifier","triboelectric effect","air purification"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091c4878c28a047388864","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"National Aviation University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623720392467f0495b044959","623720392467f0495b044964"]},{"id":"61a78d172467f03711ea82f4","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Kharkiv National Automobile and Highway University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623720392467f0495b044961"]},{"id":"619f58742467f07d98671ee0","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Kyiv National University of Construction and Architecture","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623720392467f0495b044960","623720392467f0495b044963","623720392467f0495b044962","623720392467f0495b044955"]},{"id":"5e7091b9878c28a047386858","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Lviv Polytechnic National University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623720392467f0495b044954"]},{"id":"61a5e6992467f0269e7917c1","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"National Technical University of Ukraine «Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute»","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623720392467f0495b044957"]},{"id":"5f2a72b32467f01fd13571e5","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"National University of Food Technologies","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623720392467f0495b044956"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Monitoring and management ion concentrations in the air of industrial and public premises","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-25","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"623720392467f0495b04494d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["623720392467f0495b044954","623720392467f0495b044955","623720392467f0495b044956","623720392467f0495b044957","623720392467f0495b044959","623720392467f0495b044960","623720392467f0495b044961","623720392467f0495b044962","623720392467f0495b044963","623720392467f0495b044964"]},"issue":"10(115)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper reports a substantiated method and a designed device for controlling the concentrations of air ions in premises in accordance with the European standards SBM 2015. The use of an ultrasonic humidifier with a capacity of 25 W for two hours increases the concentration of negative ions around the device from 240 to 560 cm-3, positive ones ‒ from 260 to 410 cm-3. The intensity of the electrostatic field of a polymeric coating decreases from 5.1 to 0.2 kV/m. The disadvantage of the humidifier is a small radius of influence (1.0–1.5 m) and the inability to control the polarity of ions. It has been experimentally established that air cooling systems (split systems) deionize the air of the premises. Degrees of deionization and dominating polarity are unpredictable and different for devices of different manufacturers and brands. To control the ion composition of the air simultaneously with the maintenance of normative relative humidity and stresses of static fields, the structure was proposed and the effectiveness of a bipolar ultrasonic air ionizer with adjusted performance and dominating polarity has been tested. The maximum productivity of the ionizer is 4,000–5,000 cm-3. The radius of exposure is 5 m (reducing the concentration of ions with a distance to 500 cm-3). To pass the ionized air through an air capacitor, the number and predominant polarity of air ions are regulated by the polarity and voltage on the covers of the capacitor. It was established that in order to service a room with an area of 50 m2, an ultrasonic emitter with a capacity of 25 W would suffice. The adjustability of the device performance makes it possible to reduce or increase the service area. The ability to purify air from suspended particles is shown. During the two hours of operation of the ionizer, the dust content decreased from 4.3–4.4 mg/m3 to 1.4–1.6 mg/m3."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086394","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62371c532467f0495b043ddb","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"10 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"00866e92-d0a0-418a-ae61-252ac34eb210"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"24-30","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/253110/250694","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623720392467f0495b044964","name":"Sergey","lastName":"Zozulya","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1192-8088","documentHash":"2cb86a81-b937-46e9-a06a-9819a8260966"},{"objectId":"623720392467f0495b044963","name":"Iryna","lastName":"Aznaurian","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7085-7291","documentHash":"6d6cb3f5-8bf9-496b-a289-c710abbae824"},{"objectId":"623720392467f0495b044962","name":"Tetiana","lastName":"Petrunok","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3261-3296","documentHash":"7f568366-9792-4370-9c27-af563f856383"},{"objectId":"623720392467f0495b044961","name":"Oleg","lastName":"Bogatov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7342-7556","documentHash":"7423314c-ded0-4040-ac35-5ba1e7cf8ba6"},{"objectId":"623720392467f0495b044960","name":"Olena","lastName":"Panova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7975-1584","documentHash":"c4d1e5a8-5542-4075-bbc3-6a26eced2e8e"},{"objectId":"623720392467f0495b044959","name":"Oksana","lastName":"Tykhenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6459-6497","documentHash":"79a7e67d-0c8f-48eb-b069-16e31931c500"},{"objectId":"623720392467f0495b044957","name":"Larysa","lastName":"Levchenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7227-9472","documentHash":"b6bbe396-3601-4dce-922c-41f9cf59a9a0"},{"objectId":"623720392467f0495b044956","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Kasatkina","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6905-7502","documentHash":"be2a037b-c43a-4b5c-a21c-bdf7cb34b4cb"},{"objectId":"623720392467f0495b044955","name":"Valentyn","lastName":"Glyva","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-1257-3351","documentHash":"5fef0eb8-7ef3-4651-b836-9fc167686585"},{"objectId":"623720392467f0495b044954","name":"Borys","lastName":"Bolibrukh","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9879-7454","documentHash":"7defbc1a-617b-4e21-bde3-32d70fdba41c"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.253110"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fluid therapy","pyloric stenosis","hospital guidelines","control audit"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Fluid therapy in pyloric stenosis - assessment of the implementation of hospital guidelines","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a295","mniswId":"25626","title":"Polish Annals of Medicine","doi":null,"issn":"1230-8013","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f1cce524-893d-45cd-aeea-219d5dce0bf0"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61efa71b2467f0028737f9da","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6582a1584097076c14bb71ce","6582a1584097076c14bb71cf","5e7092e1878c28a04739e9e2"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction:\r\nThe preoperative correction of the hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alcalosis in children with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is essential to optimal outcome.\r\n\r\nAim:\r\nThe main aim of the study was the assessment of the implementation of hospital guidelines for intravenous fluid therapy in children with IHPS.\r\n\r\nMaterial and methods:\r\nIn our Department, at the beginning of 2018 hospital guidelines for intravenous fluid therapy in children were implemented.

The devised method allows one not to transfer access tokens with each request, which would make it possible for the attacker to authenticate as a valid user when compromising the connection, for example, when using a «person in the middle» attack.\n\nTwo variants of the method have been proposed and substantiated – simplified and improved, the scope of which depends on the needs for protection and technical capabilities of their implementation. The robustness of both variants is ensured by the practical inability to select the initial input data of the hash function used to form the signature. The improved version also makes it possible to protect access tokens at the stage of receiving them and provides protection against the attack of the recurrence of the request. Initial user authentication protection is achieved by using the Diffie-Hellman protocol to exchange a secret and access token. Using query IDs and time labels prevents the query from being reused.\n\nAdvanced security for access tokens is important because having an attacker’s access token gives the attacker full control over the user account. The use of SSL/TLS may not produce the desired level of protection for such important data.\n\nIt was established that the use of the proposed method does not add significant time costs.

The growth of environmental awareness and the adoption of a pro-environmental approach are considered to be the key megatrends with the greatest impact on the global economy in the upcoming years. According to Eurobarometer, EU citizens are particularly aware of the importance of protecting the environment. Although the negative environmental impact of European industry has improved over the past decades, EU citizens believe that there is further scope in terms of helping companies transition towards adopting more sustainable models. One of the factors contributing to the reduction in negative environmental impact is the participation of enterprises in voluntary programs such as the Environmental Management System (EMS), according to ISO 14001, or the Eco-management and Audit Scheme (EMAS). The whole population of Polish companies registered under the EMAS was included in the study and although the sample size was small, it was a full study, and for that reason allows for the generalisation and conclusion regarding the whole population of EMAS-registered companies in Poland. The results of the study conducted on EMAS-registered organisations in Poland in 2015 suggest that the average effectiveness of the EMAS observed between 2007 and 2014 was 66.4%. The aim of this study was to review the changes in EMAS effectiveness and benefits obtained by participating organisations after five years. The results indicate that the average effectiveness during the period of 2015–2020 increased to 79.1%; nevertheless, registered organisations recognise fewer benefits for participation in the scheme. The study has shown that as EMAS matures in organisations, it becomes more effective. It influences a lot of factors, such as environmental awareness and management commitment, the use of SRDs (including BEMPs), environmental performance indicators for specific sectors, the criteria for the excellence of assessing the level of environmental performance, and the skilful use of indicators in organisations.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086411","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/2/434","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f7bfae7085dcb410a25ea37","name":"Beata","lastName":"Paliwoda","uuid":"99C083A7BFBEFA981F44346C8BF932C8E61BD73C067FFA2FAECE153B182E0EEEF5186CFAD5CE4D642C1674370BB3E5771E66B2C48855AFD64324AA4A4776AD13","orcidId":"0000-0003-3095-1547","documentHash":"e7beb1c4-761f-4bd6-b21f-bbdd62c83cc8"},{"objectId":"5e709250878c28a047393957","name":"Alina","lastName":"Matuszak-Flejszman","uuid":"B96B3841C5AFEC04B474927DF5C98DF2587E13E54A625AD233F6095EF58DE289A6AA8D37BC01B4B9D9D10BD2022CEFCBD66089026BEA3625D29EC62039F304EE","orcidId":"0000-0001-5588-9343","documentHash":"290f4fd9-dee6-4c99-b59c-250533f49d73"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15020434"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["breast cancer","incidence rate","mortality rate","unemployment","urban-rural conditions"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

At present, based on a comprehensive evaluation of existing and contemporary studies, important questions arise regarding the causal role of amyloid and tau protein in the pathogenesis of AD (Morris et al., 2018). Analyzes of the available evidence does not allow obvious conclusion that amyloid, and especially tau protein, plays a key role in the etiology of AD (Morris et al., 2018). Evaluation of new data shows that accumulation of amyloid and altered tau protein is not the main cause of AD and more research is needed (Morris et al., 2018). As for the two substances planted to contribute to the development of AD, recent data indicate that the changes of amyloid and tau protein level and structure is triggered by some as yet unspecified factors, and then the triggered amyloid and tau protein interact with each other, exerting synergistic toxic effects on neurons and damaged neurons initiate the development of AD (Morris et al., 2018). It is certain that the pathology of amyloid and tau protein is currently ruled out as the sole cause of the development of dementia, as it cannot explain why about half of the world’s population have accumulation of different kinds of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the absence of dementia (Atlante et al., 2020). In these people, it was observed that the accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles increased exponentially with age (Atlante et al., 2020). In addition, it was noted that the appearance of hippocampus atrophy in elderly people with normal cognitive performance was not dependent on the presence of level and structure of amyloid (Atlante et al., 2020). Moreover, a multicenter study found that in patients diagnosed with AD, about one-third of the cases had no brain amyloid (Atlante et al., 2020)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086434","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62348ecd2467f00ffe96a45d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"78a643d4-3192-4eea-a557-3d513a30714d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"791-792","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.4103/1673-5374.322453","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396b03","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Pluta","uuid":"9577146BD29CCD8DF0F0C5A600A43C513B48042651FF09F22197FD50C05AD4896795EE5B62FBB34A4F036DBA74E2AE11EEB1DAFA334E82E83A198A00397A721D","orcidId":"0000-0003-0764-1356","documentHash":"b23d0b34-3d64-468b-92e5-10588f0bbeac"}],"doi":"10.4103/1673-5374.322453"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091c1878c28a047387e03","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Bar-Ilan University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709388878c28a0473ac10d"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df1a","uid":"bo-gzHUCaPNoq216Hhf4uRQ","uuid":"04d8f337-6a41-4c73-b0ee-a3f1a9293995","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Matematyki, Informatyki i Mechaniki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709358878c28a0473a7a07"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb3","uid":"bdcud9f5wTDoe2In0PutAaw","uuid":"96a58ef3-d4b3-4384-b9e4-4792d490536f","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb3","parentUuid":"96a58ef3-d4b3-4384-b9e4-4792d490536f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb3","rootUuid":"96a58ef3-d4b3-4384-b9e4-4792d490536f","name":"Instytut Matematyczny Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928f878c28a047397f55"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"On the Shroer–Sauer–Ott–Yorke predictability conjecture for time-delay embeddings","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547773e","mniswId":"4089","title":"Communications in Mathematical Physics","doi":null,"issn":"0010-3616","eissn":"1432-0916","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"de3da83d-9771-41bc-8c23-d9f639bbdddd"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6238e3b22467f067af14661a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709358878c28a0473a7a07","5e70928f878c28a047397f55","5e709388878c28a0473ac10d"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Shroer, Sauer, Ott and Yorke conjectured in 1998 that the Takens delay embedding theorem can be improved in a probabilistic context. More precisely, their conjecture states that if μ is a natural measure for a smooth diffeomorphism of a Riemannian manifold and k is greater than the information dimension of μ, then k time-delayed measurements of a one-dimensional observable h are generically sufficient for a predictable reconstruction of μ-almost every initial point of the original system. This reduces by half the number of required measurements, compared to the standard (deterministic) setup. We prove the conjecture for ergodic measures and show that it holds for a generic smooth diffeomorphism, if the information dimension is replaced by the Hausdorff one. To this aim, we prove a general version of predictable embedding theorem for injective Lipschitz maps on compact sets and arbitrary Borel probability measures. We also construct an example of a C∞-smooth diffeomorphism with a natural measure, for which the conjecture does not hold in its original formulation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086437","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6238e3b22467f067af146621","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"feb5f71f-2e9c-45c1-96d1-52f5830173f1"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"391","pagesFromTo":"609-641","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00220-022-04323-y.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac10d","name":"Adam","lastName":"Śpiewak","uuid":"FF27594290DFFDB45F551159D648873BA3D807F26BB3B934806CAE2DF1C09AEF506AF261E21F5F3680B10587ED6200F3C893F118385655A509A631C731E5C33E","orcidId":"0000-0002-5012-0428","documentHash":"855553c7-a27f-495f-80c3-687d066cbfac"},{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7a07","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Barański","uuid":"B10748B210FFF4DD468F6F812CADA05F3746D2B924EE0CBBC5C71F61C6FC4511FB4059A3CE20D5BCEAF687660928AB948E529C073C0529DB9BF03A1B0B789E9F","orcidId":"0000-0001-9753-7418","documentHash":"1a3f16ff-f6f3-4358-b7f6-0bcb19c5453f"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397f55","name":"Jonatan","lastName":"Gutman","uuid":"DF72D9BA5F63501FF9857863F662D96AA458FE0007BBD7953C5806ECDE7A902F8CFD7A37152E43CD150869F1A4DC64FE2BC1B44692EC6FE7404CE87FB4DEBE17","orcidId":"0000-0002-0878-0879","documentHash":"fc99378c-755f-40f2-899e-805e62950864"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00220-022-04323-y"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61efe1872467f031227ede3c"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938d878c28a0473ac926","5e709439878c28a0473b875d","5e709439878c28a0473b875e","5e70944d878c28a0473ba04a"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","uid":"bUD9SiLi4D9CSv6IIg7PEOg","uuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","parentUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","rootUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","name":"Państwowy Instytut Geologiczny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70944d878c28a0473ba07a","5e70922e878c28a0473912de"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Lithospheric Structure of the East European Craton at the Transition from Sarmatia to Fennoscandia Interpreted from the TTZ-South Seismic Profile (SE Poland to Ukraine)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478ea0","mniswId":"14412","title":"Minerals","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2075-163X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"9bb678cc-45b6-410c-97d7-92616192a9c5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-19","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61efe1862467f031227ede1e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709439878c28a0473b875d","61efe1862467f031227ede21","5e70922e878c28a0473912de","61efe1862467f031227ede23","5e70944d878c28a0473ba04a","5e709439878c28a0473b875e","61efe1862467f031227ede26","61efe1862467f031227ede27","61efe1872467f031227ede28","61efe1872467f031227ede29","61efe1872467f031227ede2a","5e70938d878c28a0473ac926","61efe1872467f031227ede2c","61efe1872467f031227ede2d","5e70944d878c28a0473ba07a","61efe1872467f031227ede2f","61efe1872467f031227ede3c","61efe1872467f031227ede58","61efe1872467f031227ede64"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The TTZ-South seismic profile follows the Teisseyre-Tornquist zone (TTZ) at the SW margin of the East European craton (EEC). Investigation results reveal the upper lithospheric structure as representing the NW-vergent, NE-SW striking overthrust-type, Paleoproterozoic (~1.84–1.8 Ga) Fennoscandia-Sarmatia suture. The Sarmatian segment of the EEC comprises two crustal-scale tectonic thrust slices: the Moldavo-Podolian and Lublino-Volhynian basement units, overriding the northerly located Lysogoro-Radomian unit of Fennoscandian affinity. The combined results of the TTZ-South and other nearby deep seismic profiles are consistent with a continuation of the EEC cratonic basement across the TTZ to the SW and its plunging into the deep substratum of the adjacent Paleozoic platform. Extensional deformation responsible for the formation of the mid to late Proterozoic (~1.4–0.6 Ga), SW-NE trending Orsha-Volhynia rift basin is probably also recorded. The thick Ediacaran succession deposited in the rift was later tectonically thickened due to Variscan deformation. The Moho depth varies between 37 and 49 km, resulting in the thinnest crust in the SE, sharp depth changes across the TTZ, and slow shallowing from 49 to 43 km to the NW. The abrupt Moho depth increase from 43 to 49 km is considered to reflect the overlying lower crust tectonic duplication within the suture

therapy (PDT) is safe and effective in the treatment of patients with actinic keratosis (AK). The aim of the study was to assess the efficacy, tolerability and cosmetic outcome of topical PDT in the treatment of AKs with three forms of photosensitizers: 5-Aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride (ALA-HCl), 5-Aminolevulinate methyl ester hydrochloride (MAL-HCl) and 5-Aminolevulinate phosphate (ALA-P). The formulations were applied onto selected scalp/face areas. Fluorescence was assessed with a FotoFinder Dermoscope 800 attachment. Skin areas were irradiated with Red Beam Pro+, Model APRO (MedLight GmbH, Herford, Germany). Applied treatments were assessed during the PDT as well as 7 days and 12 weeks after its completion. Ninety-four percent of patients rated obtained cosmetic effect excellent. The efficacy of applied PSs did not differ significantly. However, pain intensity during the PDT procedure was significantly lower in the area treated with ALA-P (5.8 on average) in comparison to the areas treated with ALA-HCl or MAL-HCl (7.0 on average on 0–10 scale). Obtained results show that ALA-P may undergo more selective accumulation than ALA-HCl and MAL-HCl. Our promising results suggest that PDT with the use of ALA-P in AK treatment may be an advantageous alternative to the already used ALA-HCl and MAL-HCl."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058088957","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6214e68a2467f02f1e620c34","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"d148fb4f-299e-4f67-b82a-5e7232a82372"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4923/14/2/346","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65731acd4097071b8e6fdd88","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Kwaśny","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f204eaa9-a8e5-4331-aa6c-771d2154b853"},{"objectId":"65731acd4097071b8e6fdd87","name":"Marta","lastName":"Niewiedzioł","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"75978334-c4d9-4022-a4c7-8a8cc6037bb4"},{"objectId":"607fe8fc9543c73526c48b37","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Szczepanik-Kułak","uuid":"037CFA645213B5FD31F730C44EAD11254E3D0012EF06F5C6C5C3BD2C60520F32674E643D7B22B10E3759D8D1E43CE0EAF85A3FBFC031B5B56B8A3E83FF730FFC","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"109de955-a269-4334-9eca-77b22515d779"},{"objectId":"5e7092c8878c28a04739c7fd","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Krasowska","uuid":"0685C102E375DB6283CE1E729B27AE193B33E1CEEE8176CCF41D62E106A099A457624942B6BCC03FE7026FFBD87E31394FA31BCA41FE979BCDAEAF8074839F7D","orcidId":"0000-0002-3176-9870","documentHash":"32d2eeeb-bf09-4044-85af-92a5c360eada"},{"objectId":"5e7092c8878c28a04739c7f3","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Kowalczuk","uuid":"FEE42F4F13266F2345CD3C31310D45EA02DB2A7ACBDA92E8376FF7DDED05EB69EE2D69C2CD563970A534FFC8F7779CBA54EECCA4359C20997AD7D6D44A6803F9","orcidId":"0000-0001-7458-5054","documentHash":"1b6424e1-853e-4b2b-989b-50ffdb1fa156"},{"objectId":"5e7092c7878c28a04739c767","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Gerkowicz","uuid":"9FD8245B6D95ABDA51C53DC53127FDC0A6A5C581378639DD45A52E791316035C0A82739ACDA48F0696C112C5E0D3B6DE066FD8C9E408ABAED82B92115B938599","orcidId":"0000-0002-9049-9612","documentHash":"5777191c-7ebc-47ea-8133-8f02c3f2493c"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397fbd","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Bartosińska","uuid":"749C1D268720A1D8F826239D35CBFD23993DA115768DDD7D9BCD13F94421B0A6DE16FD531195B4C19CD7A4154D1127C10F968FA1CF230447159AD57B47D42597","orcidId":"0000-0003-4106-3051","documentHash":"354d3963-53e4-4c58-af9f-c1bd39be0c77"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047394f82","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Raczkiewicz","uuid":"A94BD2FAF988F822DF2531021B0AB2C94D8072BED2C5E5413B288C26FF048C79DFFC7C951D69A28CD3CE79ED1321C4614B3C1728F1EBEE365B4E0F60017F091D","orcidId":"0000-0003-3517-6711","documentHash":"a421bd5e-fcaf-4eb3-81b9-ac6160d6fd82"}],"doi":"10.3390/pharmaceutics14020346"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bacterial

Observations of the star EPIC 220208795 (2MASS J01105556+0018507) reveal a single, deep and asymmetric eclipse, which we hypothesise is due to an eclipsing companion surrounded by a tilted and inclined opaque disk, similar to those seen around V928 Tau and EPIC 204376071. \n Aims: We aim to derive physical parameters of the disk and orbital parameters for the companion around the primary star. \n Methods: The modelling is carried out using a modified version of the python package pyPplusS, and optimisation is done using emcee. The period analysis makes use of photometry from ground-based surveys, where we performed a period folding search for other possible eclipses by the disk. Parameters obtained by the best model fits are used to obtain the parameter space of the orbital parameters, while the most likely period obtained is used to constrain these parameters. \n Results: The best model has an opaque disk with a radius of 1.14 ± 0.03 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>, an impact parameter of 0.61 ± 0.02 R<SUB>⊙</SUB>, an inclination of 77.01° ± 0.03°, a tilt of 36.81° ± 0.05°, and a transverse velocity of 77.45 ± 0.05 km s<SUP>−1</SUP>. The two most likely periods are ~290 days and ~236 days, corresponding to an eccentricity of ~0.7, allowing us to make predictions for the epochs of the next eclipses. All models with tilted and inclined disks result in a minimum derived eccentricity of 0.3, which in combination with the two other known small transiting disk candidates V928 Tau and EPIC 204376071, suggest that there may be a common origin for their eccentric orbits."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058088973","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"658","pagesFromTo":"A38","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...658A..38V","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6242c9c02467f01c2127aa50","name":"E.

As medical technology progresses and the quality of patient care improves, the survival time of patients with CF has increased, which results in more frequent comorbidities such as cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD). CFRD is the result of abnormal glucose metabolism characterized primarily by insulin deficiency, exacerbated periodically by insulin resistance. The aim of our study was to analyze the epidemiology of patients with CFRD in Poland on the basis of data collected from six CF treatment centers. Analyses were performed on 1157 CF patients who were treated at one of the six CF care centers. CFRD was diagnosed according to standard criteria. All data including demographics, types of CFTR mutations, CFRD duration, and microorganisms in the sputum were obtained from the patients’ medical history. Our study indicates that the prevalence of CFRD in Poland is 12.9%. CFRD was most often diagnosed between the ages of 11 and 20 (60% of patients), while 23% of patients were diagnosed between 21 and 30 years of age. Furthermore, we observed that approximately 3–5% of patients under the age of 10 had CFRD. We found out that the type of mutation did not affect the frequency of CFRD development. Factors that increased the risk of developing CFRD include underweight and chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Due to the extended lifespan of CF patients, the number of CFRD patients is currently increasing. We believe that the results of our study may complement information from other studies or may be useful in planning health policy in Poland."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058089010","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62444cd42467f070c45e3d80","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"19","number":"7","doi":null,"documentHash":"f1604025-c854-40bf-87a4-21628ddb662e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"4069","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/7/4069/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70946d878c28a0473bcd2e","name":"Sabina","lastName":"Galiniak","uuid":"122E9FE5C09FF1FE5D88B1887D30A64031797F893FE43DB2DED219E7A6A19D3D6007B62C186AEC3B2672C2C94BF506BD05389D4F18EC9C1AD2DEEAB26F838423","orcidId":"0000-0002-1129-3553","documentHash":"a128c8e4-c359-4e6b-b340-8bbec5b91380"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1ad7","name":"Marek","lastName":"Biesiadecki","uuid":"AF40B3D1CC972A01E3476CEF70A668F4F1E0E619C0F1553712573C1FCCDCB7220C2A65373285346409CD2DD4C9931E091959082AFD7AD85E0FD3693352F64FD5","orcidId":"0000-0003-4303-4393","documentHash":"fb049f61-a2d3-46fd-96e6-eb943b134845"},{"objectId":"5e709229878c28a047390e3d","name":"Marta","lastName":"Rachel","uuid":"26385A19499AC43BC249908A54D5181330276886BA7462105B1CF8E00442F4B3348A18B4819D0947B4146FEFBB48A54A83BFBDBE1CA29CFF3B983E3760CC4BA7","orcidId":"0000-0001-8622-3827","documentHash":"eed38cc1-315e-4c15-bd9b-134cd59fb71f"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19074069"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["microRNA","cancer","signaling","apoptosis","rho-associated protein kinase"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

The tests were carried out in a low-speed wind tunnel owned by Institute of Aviation Technology, Faculty of Mechatronics, Armament and Aerospace (FMAA), Military University of Technology (MUT, Warsaw, Poland). The model of “OSA” was tested at dynamic pressure q = 500 Pa within the range of slip angles β = from -28 to +28 degrees. The tests were carried out for the plane model in the so-called “plain” configuration, i.e. at non-deflected control surfaces and wing mechanisation elements. The model was tested in two variants – with floats and without floats. The effect of deflection of the flaps, ailerons and rudder on the aerodynamic characteristics of the test model was also examined. The obtained values of drag coefficient, lateral force coefficient and yawing moment coefficient are presented in the form of tables and graphs. \nThe tests showed that the floats had a significant impact on the curves of the characteristics. They result in a considerable increase of the value of the drag coefficient and in a deterioration of weathercock stability."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058089039","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6242f4ed2467f04b0b326b2c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"45a39046-8c67-496b-b18e-96b5ded0dee9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"27-44","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5604/01.3001.0015.8102","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709390878c28a0473acebe","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Majcher","uuid":"B7184636116E09AE29822F77C0B88594A71389BB65FB2FE134418F826B9E5BF514A8233F3F7BA899D5D49805AF5D4EE204A78D49AA99F4B58DD8F49CCDC63D01","orcidId":"0000-0002-4094-8766","documentHash":"0dfc3151-cd5a-4462-ae42-619cffe7e61a"},{"objectId":"5e7092a4878c28a047399c74","name":"Michał","lastName":"Frant","uuid":"4CB2E2E10A98DBEC27CF95BD2B054C26F89A3DE1250B3B59BCD7A66CC4D56EFC2B9A2AF2F1E9D20707BF30565609D1AE49C20C6E075C577C1097D78CECAA00DF","orcidId":"0000-0002-1372-9242","documentHash":"e380c641-982e-45d2-ae87-0dc1cb384b2b"},{"objectId":"5e7092a4878c28a047399c6c","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Wrzesień","uuid":"DD8359DEF31B90338918C52F00305B18D0786C3E897618FC6ADD1EB8DE9311485099193128899FB34CB2D41E3324AB438C5D2156092414F27498698BCDFCD170","orcidId":"0000-0002-4543-1256","documentHash":"9dd8cea4-04d6-47e2-9a44-43ee60e5464a"}],"doi":"10.5604/01.3001.0015.8102"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","uid":"b1CAWFlsJj7f886P9BWoCUQ","uuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","parentUuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","rootUuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","name":"Uniwersytet Radomski im.

Modern transportation solutions are susceptible to electromagnetic interference (Paś and Rosiński, 2017). Development of modern railroad infrastructure means not only stations and modern rolling stock, but also safe and reliable train traffic control systems based on the latest telecommunication and IT technologies (Ciszewski et al., 2017). In the last century these technologies were still considered dangerous and were introduced with great fear. Today, computerized systems for controlling railway traffic on the track are becoming the norm. Systems are created as \"overlays\" for existing relay systems or autonomous systems are built based on microprocessor systems (Burdzik et al., 2017). Today it is hard to imagine a modern control room without computer equipment. The introduction of microprocessor technology to railroad traffic control devices took place at the turn of the century. However, the use of modern radio systems in rail transport is the moment when technology based on the appeared in the world LTE (Long-Term evolution) standard. The development of modern data transmission technologies is integrally connected with the mobility of its users. In the presented article the author has tried to determine the impact of transmission synchronization on the basic transmission parameters of LTE signal (Chrzan, 2021). The convenience of using rail communications for its users is the possibility of uninterrupted access to data transmission services along the entire route of the train. Therefore, the research presented in this article was focused on the use of the public radio communication network for passenger data transmission and data transmission for railroad needs.\r\nThe article presents the influence of synchronisation of data transmission in open railway systems using GPS (Global Positioning System) technology. It presents a description of the physical phenomena associated with synchronisation, and presents the author's method for carrying out measurements on railway line No. 4. For this purpose, a diagnostic station was built and special software for data transmission encryption was prepared. The process of synchronisation of clocks with the use of uniform time was adopted as the basis. General measurement results and conclusions resulting from the use of open transmission in railway radiocommunication systems synchronised by the GPS system signal are presented.\r\n\r\n</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058089055","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"61","pagesFromTo":"39-49","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396b70","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"CHRZAN","uuid":"56BC810685563076EFC0DD1E48160FAE542463A5E12471780EFFB72886063E39AB86A1D29519BCAC0FD5C09BB152389F542BE75D98DDFAB5CB1B228B7E489FF7","orcidId":"0000-0003-4181-4847","documentHash":"9df59682-f248-49e8-95bd-974ab6246b16"}],"doi":"10.5604/01.3001.0015.8150"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737e9e0","uid":"bL0Qk8rG-imVKtCH3HYLLAA","uuid":"bde8e353-79e5-45f4-8f74-a372934b80ba","parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9e0","parentUuid":"bde8e353-79e5-45f4-8f74-a372934b80ba","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9e0","rootUuid":"bde8e353-79e5-45f4-8f74-a372934b80ba","name":"Instytut

We have carried out 10 epochs of observation spanning 2-655 d post-merger at a frequency of 944 MHz. Each observation covered 30 deg<SUP>2</SUP>, corresponding to 87 per cent of the posterior distribution of the merger's sky location. We conducted an untargeted search for radio transients in the field, as well as a targeted search for transients associated with known galaxies. We find one radio transient, ASKAP J005022.3-230349, but conclude that it is unlikely to be associated with the merger. We use our observations to place constraints on the inclination angle of the merger and the density of the surrounding environment by comparing our non-detection to model predictions for radio emission from compact binary coalescences. This survey is also the most comprehensive widefield search (in terms of sensitivity and both areal and temporal coverage) for radio transients to-date and we calculate the radio transient surface density at 944 MHz."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058089081","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"510","pagesFromTo":"3794-3805","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.3794D","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6242c9c22467f01c2127adb6","name":"A.","lastName":"O'Brien","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c82474e9-d789-46e1-ab68-29ed3aebb60f"},{"objectId":"6242c9c22467f01c2127adb5","name":"J.

The structure of the split-phase wire, the distance to the ground, and between the centers of the phases of the line are determined at the design stage. Based on these structural parameters, the value of specific energy losses associated with the corona discharge is calculated. Studying the impact exerted on the amount of losses by each structural parameter makes it possible at the design stage to determine the structure of a power transmission line (PTL) with low energy losses. Reducing energy loss when transporting it along the line is one of the most important issues in the strategy for the development of the energy industry at the stage of the \"green transition\". It has been established that most structural parameters have a weak effect on the values of corona losses, and, if there is a significant impact, the implementation of such solutions leads to a large increase in the cost of constructing an overhead transmission line. Based on the analysis of the results of calculations of corona losses in power transmission lines, it was determined that the corona losses in the middle phase of the transmission line are much greater than in the extreme phases. That has made it possible to devise a method for reducing power corona losses associated with the alignment of the capacities of all phases of PTL. This effect is achieved by calculating, based on the developed method, the splitting step of the middle phase of PTL. The calculation of the splitting step is based on the preliminary determination of the capacity of the extreme phases and the substitution of calculated values in the resulting expression for the splitting step. The possibility of such a reduction in corona losses should significantly increase the energy efficiency of AC power transmission lines, especially in areas with large periods of different weather that provoke the occurrence of a corona discharge on the wires of their phases. This circumstance causes an increase in this type of power loss."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058089136","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6244751d2467f070c45ec500","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"8 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"4806d56c-475c-4a20-906a-da8cd5995357"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"18-25","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/253384/250708","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6244762f2467f070c45eca7c","name":"Larysa","lastName":"Shylkova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0009-3502","documentHash":"3142e2c2-6661-4d6e-ba1e-6c0070beaaec"},{"objectId":"6244762f2467f070c45eca7b","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Savchenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7046-0633","documentHash":"f7beae4d-6fe0-4ce5-b1e1-81907cd9199f"},{"objectId":"6244762f2467f070c45eca7a","name":"Ihor","lastName":"Nazarenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6365-6777","documentHash":"32744639-2b1c-4df7-b750-d52889f013ed"},{"objectId":"6244762f2467f070c45eca79","name":"Dmytro","lastName":"Danylchenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7912-1849","documentHash":"fd873ea3-1418-4a09-a0bd-f5acde91b44c"},{"objectId":"6244762f2467f070c45eca78","name":"Eniola","lastName":"Olubakinde","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-5412-1850","documentHash":"7e547d07-88b4-4674-94f0-89f3efc2b9b2"},{"objectId":"6244762f2467f070c45eca77","name":"Sergii","lastName":"Shevchenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9658-7787","documentHash":"70042d8a-a0da-4dc3-b29b-ac75cc042b11"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.253384"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["praca najemna","opłata pracy własnej","dochód z rodzinnego gospodarstwa rolnego","typy rolnicze gospodarstw"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["paid labor","farmers’ own labor payment","family farm income","types of farming"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded4","uid":"bHCK3lStnAHd0QqbkMofeyA","uuid":"025510bc-23bd-4fb3-a33d-920d6d0c7a68","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded4","parentUuid":"025510bc-23bd-4fb3-a33d-920d6d0c7a68","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded4","rootUuid":"025510bc-23bd-4fb3-a33d-920d6d0c7a68","name":"Instytut Ekonomiki Rolnictwa i Gospodarki Żywnościowej - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094b3878c28a0473c1e61","5e70940d878c28a0473b580d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"WAGES FOR PAID LABOR, FARMERS’ OWN LABOR PAYMENT, AND PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY IN THE CASE OF POLISH FARMS CLASSIFIED BY TYPES OF FARMING","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa83c9aff2974850cd6d","mniswId":"201036","title":"Zagadnienia Ekonomiki Rolnej","doi":null,"issn":"0044-1600","eissn":"2392-3458","websiteLink":"http://www.zer.waw.pl/index.php?p=1","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"d2bc9ea4-6381-4f06-8dfd-82157126f9e4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"624301cc2467f04b0b329bc7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["624301cc2467f04b0b329bc9","5e70940d878c28a0473b580d","5e7094b3878c28a0473c1e61"]},"issue":"1(370)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Celem badań była ocena wynagrodzenia pracowników najemnych i opłaty pracy własnej przez dochód\nz gospodarstwa w różnych typach rolniczych gospodarstw w Polsce.

The paper also examines the impact of\nsubsidies on the payment of farmers’ own labor inputs and production efficiency. The research involved\nfarms keeping accounting records, which were classified by the FADN methodology (TF8). The analysis uses standard results from 2010, 2015, and 2019 processed in the FADN EU system. Relatively low\nwages for wage earners were observed on farms specialized in permanent crops (EUR 2.12–2.76/hour)\nand horticulture (EUR 2.05–3.32/hour), and quite high on mixed farms (EUR 4.05–6.67/hour) and\nfarms specialized in other grazing livestock (EUR 3.98–6.04/hour). Assuming wages for wage earners\nas the cost of one hour of farmers’ own labor, at the level of income without subsidies, farmers’ own\nlabor was fully paid only on farms specialized in horticulture and granivores, as well as in 2010 and\n2015 on farms specialized in permanent crops. On the other hand, income with subsidies ensured full\npayment of farmers’ own labor on farms specialized in horticulture and granivores; in 2010 on farms\nspecialized in field crops, as well as in 2010 and 2015 on farms specialized in permanent crops and\ndairy cows. In the remaining cases (i.e., types and years), farmers’ own labor inputs were partially\npaid (from 22.2 to 96.9%). The research concerned commercial farms with market-oriented production.

The vast landed estates, fiefdoms, gradually reorganised the feudal system towards an even greater exploitation of the peasant population.

The modified materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), thermogravimetry (TG), and N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, and tested as low-cost adsorbents for removal of Rhodamine B dye (RhB) from aqueous solutions. Batch experiments were conducted to study the effect of different operational parameters such as adsorbent dose, solution pH, and contact time. It was observed that the adsorption was strongly pH-dependent and that solution pH at 2.0 had the greatest removal efficiency for the dye. The experimental data were modeled using several isotherm and kinetic models such as Freundlich, Langmuir, Temkin as well as pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and intraparticle diffusion. It was found that the equilibrium adsorption data can be fitted well using the Freundlich isotherm model and the adsorption kinetics follows a pseudo-second-order model. The adsorption capacity of HU, HU-SA, and HU-OCPD was found to be 8.37, 13.1, and 17.8 mg/g, respectively. The results revealed that surface modification of halloysite via acid activation and polymer loading results in a significant increase in the removal of RhB from aqueous solution.

To address this issue, we report the synthesis and characterization of a series of curved and fully conjugated nitrogen-doped PAHs. Through structural modifications to the electron-accepting moiety, we are able to switch the mechanism of luminescence between TADF and RTP, and to tune the overall PLQY in the range from 9% to 86%. As a proof of concept, we constructed solid-state OLED devices which has not been explored so far in the context of concave N-doped systems being TADF/RTP emitters. The best-performing dye, possessing peripheral trifluoromethyl group adjacent to phenazine acceptor, exhibits yellow to orange emission with a maximum external EL quantum efficiency (EQE) of 12%, which is the highest EQE in an curved D-A embedded N-PAH to date."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058089157","journalIssue":{"objectId":"624357b22467f04b0b335044","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"266f9665-72b6-48a1-b126-0b997035fa46"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/anie.202202232","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"624357b22467f04b0b335041","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Data","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"63ea6c20-1e5b-459c-9ff3-5cc217009412"},{"objectId":"624357b22467f04b0b33503f","name":"Michał Andrzej","lastName":"Kochman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4445f7f2-aed0-4a47-9ecf-d4fe5d5d12a3"},{"objectId":"624357b22467f04b0b33503e","name":"Paola","lastName":"Zimmermann Crocomo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7a5b671b-398b-4977-a11e-362ef8cc0f23"},{"objectId":"5ebedba9752340254fc41e0c","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Wagner","uuid":"29D50DC5E55DA1E3908537EF7A8D9FD28C5A014C2C76F56CE409F15937DB935049B9FF9B40BB14D7525FC42E05BD1C991878F4D4EFFB7CEB0ED73CB42C047021","orcidId":"0000-0002-7754-2014","documentHash":"3d996526-1f31-405a-b74f-dbf770a2a729"},{"objectId":"5e7094bc878c28a0473c2c89","name":"Adam","lastName":"Kubas","uuid":"5502D7BBD854811ACE4A362AACF7E8E88D472EBF744D8A7CA3375962360A19B8C994FD5882E9191B79B6745D5F7A3AB2529D5A4D64C8AFBB3B7204C8694C6382","orcidId":"0000-0002-5508-0533","documentHash":"9f31decc-1aaa-47ff-8296-c27349c11c1e"},{"objectId":"5e70938e878c28a0473acae9","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Lindner","uuid":"EA31DC15F7060354624DF95EF003E2C066CF457AAE01FD6030EA87A57DDBBBDB43434D6DACCA187CFECBFD80B8EACF0DD23448C6AD6863A0BCF5E30D431E8A7C","orcidId":"0000-0002-5514-674X","documentHash":"27b617a7-fe9a-4b55-880d-383c5aa9d6d1"}],"doi":"10.1002/anie.202202232"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737def0","uid":"brcyYgRgvEjIItaX3WfS4aA","uuid":"b7bb6dea-d926-4b36-9e6d-e0ad8061342e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def0","parentUuid":"b7bb6dea-d926-4b36-9e6d-e0ad8061342e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def0","rootUuid":"b7bb6dea-d926-4b36-9e6d-e0ad8061342e","name":"Narodowy Instytut Geriatrii, Reumatologii i Rehabilitacji im. prof. dr hab. med.

We developed a mass spectrometry (MS)based multiple reaction monitoring (MRM)-protein-panel assay to precisely quantitate 53 established\ncancer-markers, TB-markers, and infection/infammation-markers currently assessed individually\nin the clinic, as well as potential biomarkers suggested in the literature for PE classifcation. Since\nMS-based proteomic assays are on the cusp of entering clinical use, we assessed the merits of such an\napproach and this marker panel based on a single-center 209 patient cohort with established etiology.\nWe observed groups of infection/infammation markers (ADA2, WARS, CXCL10, S100A9, VIM, APCS,\nLGALS1, CRP, MMP9, and LDHA) that specifcally discriminate TB-PEs and other-infectious-PEs, and\na number of cancer markers (CDH1, MUC1/CA-15-3, THBS4, MSLN, HPX, SVEP1, SPINT1, CK-18,\nand CK-8) that discriminate cancerous-PEs. Some previously suggested potential biomarkers did not\nshow any signifcant diference. Using a Decision Tree/Multiclass classifcation method, we show a\nvery good discrimination ability for classifying PEs into one of four types: cancerous-PEs (AUC: 0.863),\ntuberculous-PEs (AUC of 0.859), other-infectious-PEs (AUC of 0.863), and benign-PEs (AUC: 0.842).\nThis type of approach and the indicated markers have the potential to assist in clinical diagnosis in the\nfuture, and help with the difcult decision on therapy guidance."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058089166","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6204e9a22467f04219d00aa3","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"6f277079-92a2-4906-a3fd-56acdd571480"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"3054-3072","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06924-y","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"624413b62467f070c45d2f8f","name":"Agata","lastName":"Michalak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f19b3c01-134f-4db2-9ad3-33accc1a3edf"},{"objectId":"624413b62467f070c45d2f8c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Perzanowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"15e277c2-efa9-4068-ab25-41f6eec6f5af"},{"objectId":"624413b62467f070c45d2f8b","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Wojtaś","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9aa76a43-2d2b-4625-8ade-d340245babb8"},{"objectId":"624413b62467f070c45d2f8a","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kistowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1792d945-3af1-4288-9dbc-f5a5354bcf5a"},{"objectId":"60c2fea69543c723365438ff","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Robak","uuid":"CB82B205739ECD236A1E69BB924F3984EE4E6E0585705B243DEFB817D0FEFE1A4363666B7BDEAD441910CA0D3F313F57EE35C9E0EDDB36C9D919E05A20FC0BF3","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8156dbba-f530-42cf-994a-e74e6ab3a5be"},{"objectId":"5e709431878c28a0473b7f63","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Domański","uuid":"DC59AF3886ADD208D775F6ACB8E97847BC72A1882370AF29A586F1A5EDF3BED37E4756E1994C1412FE45A428376CE2BAA0AB433CC3368E15C76A92B3B018D0C6","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d2024c6c-fa47-4dd0-8f1a-4e5e8111ee84"},{"objectId":"5e7093ba878c28a0473afe34","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Targowski","uuid":"582FA1590E54F97BA278782677FF6889AA5E32952F8134B2A84EBAEC69C0B046191B193FFA4B5F51CCB179342E6BEA6FB98BAB869ACD8FD6C71C6B16ECB471EB","orcidId":"0000-0002-0008-1256","documentHash":"b786c81a-1417-470a-b2d4-0cddfb45ac88"},{"objectId":"5e709355878c28a0473a7795","name":"Michał","lastName":"Dadlez","uuid":"AB6878EB90CDE083E889C0001361097D102889F6C35B68D0971F05FE0F3C0131EABA0B22F470CDD80CC216D4D68F65B3EAAF639D1476AB7154D69AF7A5118530","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d4d99287-e1ae-4da6-9e86-399ecb8abb22"},{"objectId":"5e709271878c28a047395cb3","name":"GRZEGORZ","lastName":"KRASOWSKI","uuid":"42B04D55771572A21891D64C6C5BE07F2B7A0B728262BF47D9F058DED0DEAABF8C703F86A1F5EEA44DC1EA826D7A9E732A4600B7A3F17A29A19C0DDC5F376080","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"db258c1d-e11f-40d9-a5a1-2241606a4f53"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e178","uid":"bNsOc8LWMO-rYhuDMGKqClg","uuid":"b276c277-c4c6-4376-befd-8461236490bd","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wydział Mechatroniki, Uzbrojenia i Lotnictwa","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a4878c28a047399c6b"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","uid":"bTys6lup8WXcMPxvFMpH6iw","uuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","parentUuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de94","rootUuid":"b1d3f056-c144-4482-a61a-d169c8b67693","name":"Instytut Agrofizyki im.

The aim of the study was to check whether the different textures of sand beds affect the size and dynamics of the formation of craters and ejection curtain after high-velocity impacts. The experiments were conducted using an aluminium impactor at two impact speeds (~700 and ~1300 m�s-1) and a sand bed composed of either a broad range of sizes (<2.0 mm) or any of the three fractions obtained from it (<0.5, 0.5–1, 1–2 mm). The diameters, depths, wall slope, and rim heights of the resulting craters were measured. The ejecta curtain was characterized by the inclination angle of walls, base diameter, and expansion velocity. The mass of the transferred material and the depth of the impactor penetration were also determined. Additionally, the results were used to calculate dimensionless parameters commonly considered in crater studies (πV, π2 and α). The texture of the sand most clearly influenced the diameters of the craters, its effect could also be seen in the case of the distance covered by the ejected material. This information appears to be relevant for future research, providing some rationale to help assess in which aspects of the phenomenon the texture may be important."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058089168","journalIssue":{"objectId":"624431b92467f070c45dc1f3","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"487a7a1f-8bb1-4131-a26b-761ad40f6a25"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"e0265546","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265546","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094e2878c28a0473c5fcf","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Fikus","uuid":"A62CCDF9EAFDFF552538DB1259D47F353C111663DC809D3FC7CD21F19BCDB826B233109ECC329B891E79E5CEF54D3124CE08E648F41E9D60FE838862477EE45F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0383-6984","documentHash":"84dd2dda-b08a-40c4-8012-2fc1049de78d"},{"objectId":"5e70949c878c28a0473c054c","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Goździk","uuid":"300E1F222E60D5F0E55BFDC3FD89898FED07F237C09B67FB2ABC5D485E9E38DFBB18D5EAB41A2731F5190768E61182D08F643A3D059769C2AFE8C826C7442342","orcidId":"0000-0003-3190-5745","documentHash":"50e8889f-5bb9-478b-a34c-03e9d92253f3"},{"objectId":"5e709485878c28a0473bed87","name":"Cezary","lastName":"Polakowski","uuid":"4AF7AB8EF2AC2432569D60766819D89ED25AA65497D1B2C52A8541C0F64AA7D229198BADACED8D80373D8811311347320A06E50D45663662C7E8A74A0B816B02","orcidId":"0000-0002-1658-8334","documentHash":"437d41d6-c4d9-4bb0-97ef-7030545b287c"},{"objectId":"5e709485878c28a0473bed71","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Bańda","uuid":"D72C0510430810ABC68564053B66FA1A3FC86649BEF6FA89E304BC1704778C39C9F9BD43914F5826C12D7C0DC43304B7C5F0E0069D1F643798510EA536D4F074","orcidId":"0000-0002-7144-5459","documentHash":"85407483-434b-451f-9884-ad43b2b69f3f"},{"objectId":"5e709433878c28a0473b800f","name":"Agata","lastName":"Sochan","uuid":"A495E78853A967BB8F1243BB969357B5923B30FF87B473265E35DB3E58C4ABB5175D8B0C443E0D08AA182AF24CFCD383637B65036ECCDE02C3795FD957AAD24E","orcidId":"0000-0002-1987-0220","documentHash":"2593889d-30d9-4e24-a77e-c34a162be389"},{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b4243","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Ryżak","uuid":"3F37303D436DA666687B1EB086A7FD37A30A41C51CCCF5E3FF03C90F982EB0945AE1B4E79734058522B7238FE370084923DE7BF84C2E68DA0A724E627CB803D2","orcidId":"0000-0002-6400-5375","documentHash":"da5a258e-c5d6-450c-9f2f-ea84ae7ac45d"},{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b4234","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Bieganowski","uuid":"E7F82A31E688F9179FDA762D38D72BF6B2257BBE73779947DD0E9F62E9A1EF0B03DAF6DFA72C5298E3AC2F7C6884F87627C8F33BC61B22793EA223129170C251","orcidId":"0000-0002-3571-3241","documentHash":"2631b862-2d97-46f8-b59f-359a0df2942c"},{"objectId":"5e7093de878c28a0473b2399","name":"Michał","lastName":"Beczek","uuid":"9A82135E0FC8A69D58A5432CE000A30C814D9877D8F7D042C86627397887658A2E68A000044462C2716875F2E42DB971A3CD1D54855C4591C09C74A5B9CFB570","orcidId":"0000-0002-8851-0982","documentHash":"97de4dbb-a59b-44a5-8eeb-b9ec93bd14bb"},{"objectId":"5e7093de878c28a0473b2395","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Mazur","uuid":"A027A527910D028E84AB1F0861DC97B3BE36C2671CFD6A94554E4D864EF6CF3B04FCD0C85AC354DAEA2D3B0E24C83C06061BF14FAAA7D809CCFB47AA645C6DED","orcidId":"0000-0002-5520-3863","documentHash":"d2ee989c-19ef-49fd-98ac-68c84278420f"},{"objectId":"5e7092a4878c28a047399c7c","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Koperski","uuid":"B1E4AA27615DF3785FEB117B1F96CF52C3B5726AEE39080529DF059C8D2240CC4915438537F46A820AFBF986F8B3CC12DD1F1BBBFFBCBAF2F52112FBB30A323C","orcidId":"0000-0003-4815-954X","documentHash":"b4bbc00b-5dcd-4dcf-b932-b34c37165700"},{"objectId":"5e7092a4878c28a047399c77","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Janiszewski","uuid":"8FD740D533C583F36AC424EC3868CC5426EA97B245CCAB60F43B78334CE9A3E91F55D8C0961ADF0190BC35919FE0CD2ACC078A9E688623B2097C2FB068BD70B5","orcidId":"0000-0003-3783-8774","documentHash":"5a2c5974-d598-4fd5-9cdb-f81e45fbca9f"},{"objectId":"5e7092a4878c28a047399c6b","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Woźniak","uuid":"AFB07B972361BC7182FD5D3736759B6BA845748AB710B2E1748349E86B70556AF5B79B4F839A0825DDDBE2941BC654A244172F3626CF4E39EAC7A5FE6DCFA5BC","orcidId":"0000-0002-5555-3126","documentHash":"35468d54-6bcb-4174-a86f-a3a75c63fe36"}],"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0265546"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["pomiary masy","czujnik tensometryczny","waga elektroniczna"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mass measurements","electronic scale","strain gauge sensor"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","uid":"byIMgWh_9RUyyDH3dMzNDyw","uuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna im.

The article shows the potential application of MF and EF in agricultural production. Magnetic and electrical fields increase the shelf life of the fruit and improve its quality. Alternating magnetic fields (AMF) with a value of 0.1–200 mT and a power frequency of 50 Hz or 60 Hz improve plant growth parameters. MF cause an increase in firmness, the rate of maturation, the content of beta-carotene, lycopene, and fructose, sugar concentration, and a reduction in acidity and respiration. The most common is a high-voltage electric field (HVEF) of 2–3.61 kV/cm. These fields extend the shelf life and improve the quality of fruit by decreasing respiration rate and ethylene production. The presented methods seem to be a promising way to increase the quantity and quality of crops in agricultural and fruit production. They are suitable for extending the shelf life of fruit and vegetables during their storage. Further research is needed to develop an accessible and uncomplicated way of applying MF and AEF in agricultural and fruit production."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058089179","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6246a7e72467f0368b88ee8e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"6","doi":"","documentHash":"2be49b75-b403-4ebc-9d4c-176fbaba8196"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"ID number 3183","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/6/3183/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6246a7cc2467f0368b88ee58","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Słysz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"51c9bbd8-1ce8-4209-8ba0-4c48b1097a7f"},{"objectId":"5e7093a2878c28a0473ae1f2","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Saletnik","uuid":"21F106DD4C9354C492B2510E3A8D3416FF0B61B5D841FAA9A17CA432DB97AAEC5DC274F6E3896CA45AEBD376AA9F1E2696E277180F49F3D7397F1B373408A486","orcidId":"0000-0002-1297-3120","documentHash":"0a1f2d54-5fb3-43c6-9032-00e5d10774b1"},{"objectId":"5e7093a1878c28a0473ae1e8","name":"Bogdan","lastName":"Saletnik","uuid":"0AE312DB278B5BF6547BA9C42435C499111FB454C27C8F35AEE6512014935FA19C8852E0064DFD646405233C0978D99A24DD4FC4C45690A795F2F0289ECEE900","orcidId":"0000-0002-6640-218X","documentHash":"03719aaa-4add-4765-b9f1-72a396495d48"},{"objectId":"5e70934c878c28a0473a6aad","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Bajcar","uuid":"1A5E3BB0C73D8A43DFF27DE75C14F0303DD186D0F8DFB6A8A97B1B1C2ED2CA233DF1C0C9DDFBA2B6FF0CC40DDFECF03BCEAFF95D34CD2E543ECDD2EE68E67EDE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6029-1589","documentHash":"d3f002bc-aa31-492a-8282-6d74435302e5"},{"objectId":"5e709229878c28a047390e07","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Zaguła","uuid":"B407BD42FAF1751EDAE3A7506D870C5473CBFC91D25C0675E0898F877C3C199A62FF3D2992902F20B3FB14C3A7FD1FE4A3EB8FC032820B580CEC58750F98F525","orcidId":"0000-0002-6792-6575","documentHash":"2527d54b-d5e0-4ca3-932e-f52554a8baa2"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fa57","name":"Czesław","lastName":"Puchalski","uuid":"48A9D3645E6453E0D88B0B93081E2A47A8EA85C80F394FF00B2FE88C3F07C3AC1597E86C8AD8202506D2B049178D6B759B53F4C378EBDC237D2DED7581E77A34","orcidId":"0000-0001-5916-2678","documentHash":"7a0b2979-4837-40bc-bcb9-1a8ba26edd46"}],"doi":"10.3390/app12063183"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["online customer behavior","current trends during COVID-19 pandemics","soft modeling method"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709270878c28a047395a3c"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","uid":"bLoLgWizTVEIn0ZQBwSDx-Q","uuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","parentUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","rootUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","name":"Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709237878c28a047391ced","5e709256878c28a047393e14"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Application of the Soft Modeling Method to Evaluate Changes in Customer Behavior towards e-Commerce in the Time of the Global COVID-19 Pandemic","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d248","mniswId":"17941","title":"Risks","doi":null,"issn":"2227-9091","eissn":"2227-9091","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"cd24296f-d3db-479a-a478-0927c4f65a4a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-10","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6242da692467f04b0b31e6b1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709237878c28a047391ced","5e709256878c28a047393e14","5e709270878c28a047395a3c"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, business and consumer behavior towards online\nconsumption and digital payments has changed. This trend, although significant, may be observed,\nto a varying extent, among customers across the European Union. This study aims to investigate\nif, and to what extent, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a powerful impact on online consumer\nbehavior in EU (European Union) countries. The empirical research using a soft modeling method\nsupplements theoretical deliberations based on critical literature review. A conceptual model was\nadopted. Three first-order latent variables were selected for the analysis: “online customer behavior”,\n“online activity” and “willingness to spend online”, to which all analyzed indicators (14) were\nclassified. The analysis of the loadings of latent variables for 2019 and 2020 allowed the impact\nof the pandemic on customer behavior to be observed, although this was not the same across all\nEU countries. Clustering performed with the hit map enabled the identification of four groups\nof countries. Significant changes in behavior were observed in countries such as Poland, Ireland,\nRomania, Hungary, Slovenia, Spain, and Finland.

offers an opportunity to move away from fossil fuels, it may help to alleviate major drawbacks of intermittent renewable energy generation. The results of geochemical modeling of hydrogen-rock-brine interactions for sandstones, mudstones and claystones from the geological structures from Polish Lowland are presented. The pH of the pore water is a critical parameter that controls the extent of the reaction. Several dominant reaction schemes were distinguished, and goethite was indicated as responsible for the consumption of stored hydrogen. It was found that the changes in rock porosity in sandstones were much smaller than in mudstones and claystones. The Zaosie sandstones are more favorable for UHS than those from Chabowo. The degradation of cap rock integrity, requires each time further experimental research. The findings of this study can help for better understanding of the behavior of hydrogen, in terms of gas-rock-brine interactions, in conditions of its underground storage."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058089249","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"47","pagesFromTo":"10947-10962","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.134","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093bb878c28a0473afea7","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Labus","uuid":"D99318CE45F7F5F0D09540E7F177550C2E3DCF9B94EE0A30F56A4667EFC16AD665919881F0325379BC70B3134ABDB98FE8B7E080F643D70B580F3203CB0E6213","orcidId":"0000-0001-9854-154X","documentHash":"1158196b-9a75-4512-b6bf-3bec22568cbb"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397fcc","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Tarkowski","uuid":"2AFE12F221B22FD8721850C3FC2D31F42AEE8D98C986AF7D91E34BF8A78173830A97DD7C9E7B8C1025CB8E943CF10A410EBA407F565CF083D63AE3CB8AE55F9D","orcidId":"0000-0003-3294-1246","documentHash":"1eca9134-8e33-4c49-9e2f-04e3a563fb9a"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ijhydene.2022.01.134"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["advisory councils","local governance","local authorities","Poland"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709214878c28a04738fac5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"From Advice and Consultation to Local Co-governance.

ACs are conceptualized as the form of participation placed between ‘advising and opinion-giving’ and ‘co-governance’ according to Fung’s approach (2006). Youth councils, senior citizen councils, and councils for residents with disabilities – that operate in 65 Polish cities – are put under examination. The article presents the results of the desk research, questionnaire, and interviews with the AC members addressing the issues of the origins of ACs in Poland, their membership and the way members are recruited, and AC functions and their relations with city authorities and community. The authors conclude by pointing to the pro-active role of ACs in local governance, but also indicate that their role as a stakeholder in co-governance requires them to contribute to policy decisions going beyond and above the advice and consultation provided so far."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058089252","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"20","pagesFromTo":"55-76","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://pub.lex-localis.info/index.php/LexLocalis/article/view/1689","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62459fa32467f0155138d418","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Radzik-Maruszak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"199c4bc5-6b23-4425-8a9a-4fe5e82d085e"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fac5","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Pawłowska","uuid":"41249B3A029BEA892A637F973083BCFADAD22689EDBC633E7A4B09E9BF9C2A1A1C753F8434F12FFE83070ACA19B708C860778949ED23C4A47EF4D494252169E2","orcidId":"0000-0002-0083-3833","documentHash":"54c1ee3e-389c-4a3d-baa9-ad488e3146f1"}],"doi":"10.4335/20.1.55-76(2022)"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-65825-69-8","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de84","uid":"bUzXVrVXB6kIbjiOwxcMn0Q","uuid":"1035286a-f2d5-4650-b309-309eb37965e9","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de84","parentUuid":"1035286a-f2d5-4650-b309-309eb37965e9","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de84","rootUuid":"1035286a-f2d5-4650-b309-309eb37965e9","name":"Akademia Sztuk Pięknych w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398361"]}],"type":"BOOK","title":"On objects and their shadows II","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":71,"publicationPlace":"Katowice","translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"624459142467f070c45e84b2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709292878c28a047398361"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058089256","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb786","mniswId":"12700","name":"Akademia Sztuk Pięknych w Katowicach","documentHash":"2ceef992-4666-438b-b35d-625fbbe5d1c6"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://katalogi.bn.org.pl/discovery/fulldisplay?docid=alma991052986657005066&context=L&vid=48OMNIS_NLOP:48OMNIS_NLOP&lang=pl&search_scope=NLOP_IZ_NZ&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&tab=LibraryCatalog&query=any,contains,anna%20lorenc&offset=10","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398361","name":"Anna","lastName":"Lorenc","uuid":"45A4E18456EE87CF9EAA40ACC3016B26A645C9AC09FD1E07F50814A2A3773DF4E882C2BD8B405C69E800133E8FEEBCCE34DF396842089ECB982BAA273BB18A61","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5415af72-b2a6-4074-82a8-c3bf050dac60"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"hiszpański","keywords":[{"languageCode":"spa","keywords":["entonación","Análisis Melódico del Habla","oraciones interrogativas","español"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["intonation","Melodic Analysis of Speech","interrogative sentences","interlanguage","Spanish"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"624440972467f070c45e06ff","doi":null,"title":"Propuestas en fonética experimental: enfoques metodológicos y nuevas tecnologías","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-84-8458-590-9","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"http://hdl.handle.net/10256/20770","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"e9037aec-0260-4416-a5b4-4226799117c1","publisher":{"objectId":"624440972467f070c45e0704","mniswId":null,"name":"Universitat de Girona-Servei de Publicacions","documentHash":"58e244b7-438e-4c7c-a36a-f2ed42e59ca5"},"openAccess":{"mode":"PUBLISHER_WEBSITE","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"MARCH","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null}},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","uid":"bhdVW0TkXv39ZSgac65mGnw","uuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","parentUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","rootUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","name":"Uniwersytet Komisji Edukacji Narodowej w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70937f878c28a0473ab240"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"?Es mi pregunta una interrogativa en espanol?

They are also used in the pharmaceutical industry in the production of vaccines, enzymes and antibiotics, and mining for leaching some metals from mineral deposits and waste materials. The use of microorganisms is an interesting approach in the field of bioanalytics. This chapter fosuses on the application of microorganisms and other natural materials of plant and animal origin as bioserbents for the preconcentration, separation, and speciation studies of metal ions in analytical chemistry.

The aim of the study was to assess the usefulness of a commercial Optiplex Borrelia (OB) assay in the serological diagnostics of LD. Based on the results obtained in a previous study on the seroreactivity of the sera of patients with LD to Borrelia spp. antigens using enzyme immunoassays (ELISA) and immunoblotting (IB), the same sera were re-analyzed using the OB assay.\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nThe assays carried out with the use of OB method showed a statistically significant lower number of positive/borderline results for the presence of IgM antibodies, compared to the ELISA assay. Moreover, statistically lower positive/borderline results were obtained for antibodies in the IgG class with use of the OB method, compared to the IB assay and a two-stage diagnostic protocol (ELISA with IB). The specificity analysis showed that in both the IB and OB assays, anti-OspC IgM and anti-p41 antibodies were detected. Additionally, high positive/borderline values were found in the OB assay for native antigens derived from B. afzelii lysate. The IB assay most frequently detected antibodies against OspC, p39 (BmpA) and VlsE proteins in the IgG class. There were fewer positives/borderlines for anti-p41-I B. afzelii antibodies in the OB assay and a higher number for antigens: VlsE-C6, p18 B. afzelii (DbpA), and p39 B. afzelii (BmpA).\r\n\r\nConclusions:\r\nAnswering the question whether the OB assay could replace the traditional, two-step method of LD diagnostics, it can be concluded that it could not. It can be used to diagnose LD only as a complementary assay and not as an optimal and dedicated method of Borrelia spp. infection detection.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058089328","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"63–71","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.aaem.pl/Could-the-Optiplex-Borrelia-assay-replace-the-traditional-two-step-method-of-diagnosing,147277,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"658037624097076c14a971e1","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Dołęgowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ad1766d6-773a-4c55-8de2-1cad5ae7e61d"},{"objectId":"658037624097076c14a971e0","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Roszkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3f77da1d-4c2b-4595-8bae-717d99c5bada"},{"objectId":"658037624097076c14a971df","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Kwiatkowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9068fec2-84d3-42ac-b3a3-16b9b928bbcf"},{"objectId":"658037624097076c14a971de","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Dziatlik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6ea445c6-ac59-4b1b-85c9-ac3d404ee669"},{"objectId":"658037624097076c14a971dd","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Wojciechowska-Koszko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"77e651cb-df35-40aa-874c-2c78efe852cf"},{"objectId":"5e7093f1878c28a0473b3c5e","name":"Monika","lastName":"Sienkiewicz","uuid":"6B018EB014DE1DC522CB7B0C16B0A7422282E46A6832373E0C72A4905FCA8948CCAFEEDAC1B69EC9981A33784C899B045A5706D4AF36DBBC8317C679DB32E6E3","orcidId":"0000-0002-9823-4176","documentHash":"cbca3ee8-cfe2-49e5-833d-0e9ff4eedd57"}],"doi":"10.26444/aaem/147277"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bird nests","urban area","fungal communities","zoopathogenic fungi"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709442878c28a0473b90fe","5e709392878c28a0473acfff","6245712c2467f01c21db26d0","5f9284df085dcb424e4c1a59","5e70944a878c28a0473b9c08"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A Culture-Based Study of Micromycetes Isolated from the Urban Nests of Grey Heron (Ardea cinerea) in SW Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-2615","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"cf012089-3ed8-4dde-a05c-d5b280240cb4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-08","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6245712c2467f01c21db24b6","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709392878c28a0473acfff","5e709442878c28a0473b90fe","5f9284df085dcb424e4c1a59","5e70944a878c28a0473b9c08","6245712c2467f01c21db26d0","6245712c2467f01c21db26d1","6245712c2467f01c21db26d2"]},"issue":"6","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"There are many positive relationships between micromycetes and birds: They can spread fungal spores, and fungi facilitate cavity woodpecker excavation by preparing and modifying excavation sites. In turn, bird nests are mainly a source of potentially zoopathogenic fungi. The Wrocław city centre hosts the biggest grey heron breeding colony in Poland with at least 240 breeding birds pairs. To assess the possible public health risks associated with bird nests, the goal of the present study was to identify cultivable fungi present in the nests of grey herons (Ardea cinerea) in Wrocław. Additionally, attempts were made to determine whether the obtained species of fungi may pose a potential threat to animal health. Fungi were cultured at 23 and 37 ± 0.5 °C, and identified based on phenotypic and genotypic traits. Moreover, during routine inspection, visible fungal growth in some of the nests was found. Overall, 10 different fungal species were obtained in the study (Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus fumigatus, Botryotrichum piluliferum, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Epicoccum layuense, Mucor circinelloides, M.hiemalis, Penicillium atramentosum, P.coprophilum, and P.griseofulvum). They are both cosmopolitan species and a source of potential threat to humans, homoiothermous animals and plants. The greatest number of fungal species was obtained from the nest fragments with visible fungal growth incubated at 23 °C, and the least from western conifer seed bugs (Leptoglossus occidentalis) inhabiting the nests. The species such as A. fumigatus, P. coprophilum, and P.griseofulvum can be directly related to the occurrence of visible fungal growth on plant fragments of grey heron’s nests."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058089367","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani12060676","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6245712c2467f01c21db26d2","name":"Klaudia","lastName":"Litwiniak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8107e47d-6c35-4dfe-97a4-befbf66f20de"},{"objectId":"6245712c2467f01c21db26d1","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Przymencki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3051f53e-c2ca-4f6c-9b40-a330422489a8"},{"objectId":"6245712c2467f01c21db26d0","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kłosińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"399f5587-57d5-4fbb-b581-4df11396e547"},{"objectId":"5f9284df085dcb424e4c1a59","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Borzęcka","uuid":"7D2AE14518E1E73DBF3868947DF498AE25C23DE5B0B2DEE795659FE23BA77EA32C77717754250825CCCC21E1F64603714DA4A54D682F6FADD37E1489AC822428","orcidId":"0000-0002-7565-3140","documentHash":"2ae68738-7865-45cb-bc4e-48a2d9710c64"},{"objectId":"5e70944a878c28a0473b9c08","name":"Agata","lastName":"Piecuch","uuid":"CFB81A39BECDEE4BA74FE9F7B4F84AAF83025A66EC2219DB034BD7C1B29B071C0E62A948087656DA14709186DC032309F02A06959CFC54F556A6790F4D84488C","orcidId":"0000-0001-7791-8379","documentHash":"16768a6e-b591-4fc3-8e0c-9fab6511d408"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b90fe","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Ogórek","uuid":"DC58D14F534EB280F14F1306B53621E4D0E7ECDCE08FFDFC0A9A321A1FAA5FA1DC0542F75EB5E46B86467ECAF6789C2098BEE74A8CE82E7F275B3332638A130C","orcidId":"0000-0003-0564-7797","documentHash":"dd3ad912-238d-4680-b2e9-ba1df0fb1389"},{"objectId":"5e709392878c28a0473acfff","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Suchodolski","uuid":"10895BEF0045ACAFC0D14ED10FFBD94D8228451799024D1CD563E6A329D9633B7BFDDF92B675939A5EFB067320B08182D5A6617D6689DC24059B198D2C35C767","orcidId":"0000-0002-3442-638X","documentHash":"5cee78fd-9cef-4986-9556-d7200ba3a5af"}],"doi":"10.3390/ani12060676"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["artificial neural networks","shell-to-beam","homogenization","radial basis functions","parametrized optimization","thin-walled structure"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a5878c28a0473ae6f4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Parametric Optimization of Thin-Walled 3D Beams with Perforation Based on Homogenization and Soft Computing","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1944","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-22","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"624418c62467f070c45d531d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093a5878c28a0473ae6d6","624418c62467f070c45d531f","5e7093a5878c28a0473ae6f4"]},"issue":"7","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The production of thin-walled beams with various cross-sections is increasingly automated and digitized. This allows producing complicated cross-section shapes with a very high precision. Thus, a new opportunity has appeared to optimize these types of products. The optimized parameters are not only the lengths of the individual sections of the cross section, but also the bending angles and openings along the beam length. The simultaneous maximization of the compressive, bending and shear stiffness as well as the minimization of the production cost or the weight of the element makes the problem a multi-criteria issue. The paper proposes a complete procedure for optimizing various open sections of thin-walled beam with different openings along its length. The procedure is based on the developed algorithms for traditional and soft computing optimization as well as the original numerical homogenization method. Although the work uses the finite element method (FEM), no computational stress analyses are required, i.e., solving the system of equations, except for building a full stiffness matrix of the optimized element. The shell-to-beam homogenization procedure used is based on equivalence strain energy between the full 3D representative volume element (RVE) and its beam representation. The proposed procedure allows for quick optimization of any open sections of thin-walled beams in a few simple steps. The procedure can be easily implemented in any development environment, for instance in MATLAB, as it was done in this paper.\n."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058089377","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6241a3072467f0290d2dfe70","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"7","doi":null,"documentHash":"b570d4dc-59ac-4043-b660-8f9a1479c58d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"2520-1 - 2520-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/7/2520","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"624418c62467f070c45d531f","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Staszak","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8960-9573","documentHash":"86bc286c-1b8a-47bc-96fc-e543590ac766"},{"objectId":"5e7093a5878c28a0473ae6f4","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Garbowski","uuid":"C2B4DE757D8886907DAD1487B338EB3FFEFC81745770C595B50FE00A4709A2FF2A90E163029C241915F2629083E468C343504A15B14819FB7702EFA9344EBBF0","orcidId":"0000-0002-9588-2514","documentHash":"3b0e42a7-4e11-459a-813b-c6de44def90c"},{"objectId":"5e7093a5878c28a0473ae6d6","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Gajewski","uuid":"FD490B9C86DB9911B52BB64FA7D92DC8BFE2949BF592AADE14813A8502EB048199EA05211BCCA8EDDC0A6558062F0F49FACEA0A058FDD94E579AC760F62804E8","orcidId":"0000-0002-4292-0417","documentHash":"71cc06f3-253d-4dc9-8808-a65076119a60"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15072520"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Additive manufacturing; Material extrusion; Fused filament fabrication; PET-G; Cement-glass composite bricks; Waste disposal; Digital image correlation analysis"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b4878c28a047385b32","uid":"bS6M08TFKPbY503_RCN7QVg","uuid":"09856ec8-9220-4fe5-b068-d49e53a4db41","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Instytut Robotów i Konstrukcji Maszyn","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebeda7e752340254fc418cc","5e70929e878c28a0473994b5","5e709438878c28a0473b85db","5e70930c878c28a0473a1d6c","5e70929a878c28a047398ed5"]},{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1e4","uid":"bkbp2VYA4xopaIA4HrQlzTQ","uuid":"21621076-b7f2-4bc3-a5a5-e684c8630041","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wydział Inżynierii Lądowej i Geodezji","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709392878c28a0473ad089","5e709390878c28a0473ace8c","5e709408878c28a0473b5295"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Cement-glass composite bricks (CGCB) with interior 3D printed PET-G scaffolding","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c723","mniswId":"10360","title":"Journal of Building Engineering","doi":null,"issn":"2352-7102","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"d346fd1c-ec48-46ad-8f39-2279e3c0af15"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6245422c2467f0155137326f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709390878c28a0473ace8c","5e70929e878c28a0473994b5","5e709392878c28a0473ad089","5e709408878c28a0473b5295","5e70930c878c28a0473a1d6c","5e709438878c28a0473b85db","5e70929a878c28a047398ed5","5ebeda7e752340254fc418cc"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The construction industry is a key sector behind the climate change. Not only does it produce enormous amounts of greenhouse gases, but also absorbs tons of natural aggregates irreversibly. Therefore, this study proposes an alternative approach to the climate change problem by producing a cement-glass composite brick (CGCB) with a printed internal scaffold from recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PET-G). This novel construction material, which consists of about 75% of waste glass and 10% of recycled PET-G scaffolding, has a great potential for tackling this problem. The filling mixture itself – cement-glass mortar (CGM) – and ready-made bricks with an internal PET-G scaffolding (3Dhon structure) were tested to verify the accuracy of the assumptions. The scope of this study included mechanical and thermal tests to indicate the properties of the newly manufactured material. The analysis of the results showed that the final CGCB with 3D printed PET-G scaffolding has better thermal properties than CGM as thermal diffusivity (8%) and decreased specific heat (10%). Additionally, significantly reduced flexural strength and compressive strength has been observed (about 30% of both factors) with almost 100% larger strain during compression testing."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058089382","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352710222004429","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebeda7e752340254fc418cc","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Łuszczek","uuid":"380B9A85FE20C8DF1FC5715B28666C2C5CB6DFC4C5D4350630E3841F607041F7EF1B76DB8E5FB7DD0CFEFC85027C573E5E695AC73246EF69CAE8E8F255CE3E4F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6441-3881","documentHash":"349adced-2494-42af-b09d-bb10fd2268dc"},{"objectId":"5e709438878c28a0473b85db","name":"IRENEUSZ","lastName":"SZACHOGŁUCHOWICZ","uuid":"B33BAD43A1A09A75A9E7BD2EAC50D359464C3B5C526EE8C0A43E3C830C0F42B41EE78FEE0674E09C2A9F22D25D77534870FB7DDBA1F1E2E9A6EC31FF07702F7F","orcidId":"0000-0002-9548-9499","documentHash":"f47b8efb-6b31-4fd4-8322-8e5218c74e39"},{"objectId":"5e709408878c28a0473b5295","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Jackowski","uuid":"BC03E5A8D60334F84F884DB3C3505622B6F74607FF298831C93A2A1EA05A61A89EB77FA71AA8A31B66E06C5196B1870072E41A4757516D941B462CCD6186372F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0586-0945","documentHash":"40ba9710-41bc-4617-9beb-1b4a3df3c37d"},{"objectId":"5e709392878c28a0473ad089","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Łasica","uuid":"0B15EDCA0A6C641A5549823AEE1BD55E41C75F6643BF4BE6A9A9516A13726A8C5DFAC61D33547C19E7A1B3C3166E5743F8EE893BDDAE27A973254292B1B2717C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eb0a7064-f02e-44c7-9398-4b0d841b5e9c"},{"objectId":"5e709390878c28a0473ace8c","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Małek","uuid":"F1564F77B1B204F94BAFA7E480B3C9372506C65B2CBA389970E6928802462E8496F62DDCD135B93316D4287AA78934848BF04A12A5BDA74A983E70F87F1350F4","orcidId":"0000-0001-5086-3574","documentHash":"3d8057fd-52eb-47b0-83d6-3ad04ce3c3c8"},{"objectId":"5e70930c878c28a0473a1d6c","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Kluczyński","uuid":"A0BE04B257DB849480238ADD015FB4B4CE158DFE0CEF9552BE3E4B9C401A94B79F4BD63395F6D460E655293EE59F4F1F664FD227186A1B33A1C94E8470FBD5FC","orcidId":"0000-0002-6058-965X","documentHash":"2569dd81-630d-4d86-8589-c33d83df0d61"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a0473994b5","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Grzelak","uuid":"E9564761C15144BAF05ED3E8D4E0B3C8AF4B49E0B62A905A085169212D3E2014BED64CAC7FEA20E11697B9241A42FB87154ED5B03433E36DD5FC5288AF620E86","orcidId":"0000-0003-0675-1983","documentHash":"33f49ad9-f27b-430b-ac72-4403007531f1"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398ed5","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Torzewski","uuid":"236DC0B4248CB3717AA96760D3EC7B8BE01D9A76AEB591DBBEF9B60FF2C9107DD4184D904663F2351591C3BDFC625AFC122631511AFC04266D3FC6944508513F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6475-9997","documentHash":"4f427c17-cc04-43f2-b702-18b3739c1651"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jobe.2022.104429"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["electric power system","constant-power hyperbola","control system","optimization","correlation analysis"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5f6a57e52467f019c79dd19a","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"National University «Odessa Maritime Academy», Odessa, Ukraine","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6244759a2467f070c45ec957","6244759a2467f070c45ec956","6244759a2467f070c45ec958"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Optimization of the control system for an electric power system operating on a constant-power hyperbole","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-25","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6244759a2467f070c45ec954","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6244759a2467f070c45ec956","6244759a2467f070c45ec957","6244759a2467f070c45ec958"]},"issue":"8(115)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"For an electric power system (EPS) of the combined propulsion complex (CPC), working on a constant-power hyperbola (CPH), the strategy of managing power distribution between propulsion electric motors and own needs consumers has been improved. The study reported here aimed to reduce fluctuations in current consumption and load by optimizing voltage controllers and the rotation frequency of generator assemblies (GA). The system of EPS GA voltage and frequency stabilization was synthesized by determining, in the system of equations, the dynamics of the values of EPS links' time constants and the coefficients that correspond to control parameters. To define the characteristics of the control signals from the regulators of EPS GA rotation frequency and excitation voltage, the laws that control the speed and excitation current were calculated. After sampling the coefficients of the GA speed control regulator, the tasks for the excitation voltage controller were determined. The methodology of data acquisition was applied on the basis of a correlation between the EPS characteristics and the experimental characteristics of GA. The system of EPS dynamics equations was optimized in accordance with the structure and settings of the optimal controller and the probability of a situational error by using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. The optimization has made it possible to reduce the likelihood of a situational error during the synchronization of GA and enable the stable operation of GA close to the mode of operation on CPH. The power controller was tested under the mode of changing the load of own needs with the power levels of EPS on CPH in the range of 50‒100 % of the rated power. The range of deviations of the current consumed with an enabled GA rotation controller was 10 % of the average value. The range of EPS power deviations with the power controller turned on was 5 %."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058089402","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6244751d2467f070c45ec500","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"8 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"4806d56c-475c-4a20-906a-da8cd5995357"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"6-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/252172/250707","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6244759a2467f070c45ec958","name":"Valerii","lastName":"Shevchenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3229-1909","documentHash":"da621423-3e37-48a8-be0e-f0fbc9bb371d"},{"objectId":"6244759a2467f070c45ec957","name":"Albert","lastName":"Sandler","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0709-0542","documentHash":"db98e1af-2ee4-49cb-b178-aa360934bc70"},{"objectId":"6244759a2467f070c45ec956","name":"Vitalii","lastName":"Budashko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4873-5236","documentHash":"42245387-df0c-4c15-bab4-fbd3601f1edb"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.252172"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sustainable development strategy","decentralisation","territorial community","comprehensive assessment of the strategy"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de7c","uid":"b4qbOpQNJGA0228Xn5XpmqQ","uuid":"7e1c2a3a-90ae-40af-bd27-bb7d5df82733","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de7c","parentUuid":"7e1c2a3a-90ae-40af-bd27-bb7d5df82733","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de7c","rootUuid":"7e1c2a3a-90ae-40af-bd27-bb7d5df82733","name":"Państwowa Uczelnia Zawodowa im. prof.

We  investigated  a  particular  type  of obstacles  reported  by  entrepreneurs,  i.e.,  those  which  prevented  their  gaining  access  to  support instruments.  This  paper  delved  into  the  specificity  of  family  businesses  and  explained  why  per-ceptions of access to support could differ between family and non-family firms. Purpose  of  the  article: This  paper  seeks  to  identify  the  differences  between  family  and  non-family businesses in terms of their perceptions of different barriers that hinder access to support instruments. Methods: The main research processes were based on logistic regression models with a depend-ent variable: 0 for a non-family firm and 1 for a family firm.  As dependent variables 13 barriers to the access of public support instruments were adopted. The study was conducted on a sample of 386 Polish business entities. Findings & value added: The results confirmed the existence of differences between family and non-family  businesses  in  perceptions  of  barriers  towards  gaining  support  in  entrepreneurial  en-deavours.  Obstacles,  such  as  overly-complex  bureaucratic  procedures  and  requirements,  lack  of access  to  information  disseminated  by  business  support  institutions,  and  complicated  support settlement  procedures,  were  perceived  as  far  less  crucial  by  family  businesses  than  non-family businesses.  Family  businesses demonstrated a lower propensity to  use  real property  as  collateral or  transactions.  Additionally,  family  businesses  with  financial  resources  that  overlap  with  their own familial resources declared that they found it easier to make their own contributions to satisfy the requirements for support programmes or services. This paper makes several novel and signifi-cant contributions  to  the field.  First,  we  add  to existing  research  focusing  exclusively on family entrepreneurial  activity  by drawing  a  comparison  between  family  and  non-family firms in  terms of the perceived barriers towards gaining support. Second, we address different types of barriers. Our findings provide further evidence that different types of businesses perceive certain types of barriers differently.

A total of 30 million tons of straw is produced per year, of which there is a surplus of approximately 13.5 million tons of undeveloped straw. For energy purposes, straw from cereals or rapeseed is most often used. When analyzing scientific publications, it was noticed that, in Poland, large amounts of oat straw are produced, and there is no alternative use for it. Hence, we conducted research to determine the energy value of oat straw. Raw material was obtained from an individual farm from 2018 to 2020. Selected energy parameters for straw burned alone (100%) or co-fired with coal were analyzed in the following weight proportions: 70/30, 80/20, and 90/10 coal/oat straw. It was shown that changing weather conditions, in particular years, had a modifying effect on some of the energy parameters of straw. The calorific value of straw was lower than that of coal, but its impact on environmental pollution turned out to be significantly lower. The difference in combustion heat between coal and straw was 11.74 MJ·kg−1. Investigations into pollutant concentrations were performed for cubes of compressed straw and hard coal. Mixtures of these fuels were not studied in this part of the work. The combustion of straw resulted in a reduction of harmful NO, NOX, and SO2 pollutants and an increase in CO compared to coal combustion. As for hydrogen content—it was the highest in carbon and the lowest in straw. In the case of analytical moisture, an inverse relationship was observed. In the case of both coal and straw, the ash content varied throughout the years of research. As the boiler power increased from 5 to 25 kW, the consumption of burned raw material increased significantly. The results indicate that the surplus of oat straw can be rationally used to obtain thermal energy, including co-combustion with coal. This will allow one to avoid burning straw in the fields, which causes great harm to the natural environment"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058089468","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61cbda8d2467f06e5d2baa1c","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"760d3dbe-8ad6-41e2-a304-fdb06bb2a3e3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/1/331","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"658f150c4097076c145d7aae","name":"Wacław","lastName":"Jarecki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"97e38681-be8e-4a27-9b4b-8f3e9ff28285"},{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5ac","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Proszak-Miąsik","uuid":"848557ADA61635CE0B2F0729F5B8DC8BC5956132BE0E11CC1934793D71A467A6ECC7243BAB870E36C443A9321AF41E081206D96180F2995375175C9CA5494537","orcidId":"0000-0003-3974-4835","documentHash":"8b55b483-fe76-4017-b090-a3b4166e60a5"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d549","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"DFAB3D4824CBB52955935204B3B692769BDE5685DF1841E9158E49122FCE12C17F015062F21CD1702B7E35F176F2DF99D85849DA7687E1DE9871AA508706DA47","orcidId":"0000-0002-7460-6270","documentHash":"934317fb-e037-4048-87c4-41cb4d9f748c"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15010331"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e159","uid":"b3BEYaRNeUhYRZwn2byRwtQ","uuid":"14ef85af-ce21-4bcc-af89-677886e24750","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Instytut - Obserwatorium Astronomiczne","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709371878c28a0473a9a79"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Spiral density-wave structure parameters in the solar neighbourhood derived from longitudinal velocities of Gaia EDR3 OB stars: 3D approach","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f1a","mniswId":"14607","title":"Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","doi":null,"issn":"0035-8711","eissn":"1365-2966","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"74cb1c02-1f54-412e-a338-7cb4ea062692"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6242c9aa2467f01c21278db4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709371878c28a0473a9a79","6242c9c12467f01c2127ab0f","6242c9c12467f01c2127ab10","6242c9c12467f01c2127ab11","6242c9c12467f01c2127ab12"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Distances and transverse along the Galactic longitude velocities v<SUB>l</SUB> of 2640 Gaia EDR3 O-B2 stars of Xu et al. within 2.5 kpc from the Sun and 250 pc from the Galactic plane with relative distance and velocity accuracies of <10 and <50 per cent are selected.

Artykuł ma charakter przeglądowo-koncepcyjny. W tekście dokonano przeglądu rozwoju dyscypliny ekonomiki i organizacji gospodarstw rolniczych. Podkreślono, że oprócz podejścia analitycznego, które obecnie wpisuje się w główny, tj. neoklasyczny nurt myśli ekonomicznej, istotne miejsce w tej dyscyplinie zajmowało podejście organiczne, którego współczesne echa można odnaleźć w podejściu systemowym. Następnie przedstawiono dwa nurty uznane za fundamenty docelowej teorii RGR: myślenie systemowe oraz nową ekonomię instytucjonalną. Przedstawiono zarys koncepcji nowego podejścia do rodzinnego gospodarstwa rolniczego postrzeganego jako systemowa całość łącząca rodzinę i jej gospodarstwo domowe zaangażowane w produkcję rolniczą, przy czym istotnym atrybutem tej całości jest zdolność do redukcji wewnętrznych kosztów transakcyjnych (kosztów agencji). W konkluzji stwierdzono, że gospodarstwa rodzinne wciąż pozostają dominującą formą prowadzenia działalności rolniczej w Polsce, Europie i na innych kontynentach. Rodzinny charakter tych podmiotów tworzy ich specyfikę zarówno na poziomie celów, jak i zachowań, którą trudno zredukować do neoklasycznego modelu maksymalizującej zyski firmy. Potrzebne jest – komplementarne wobec dominującego ujęcia neoklasycznego – podejście holistyczne, systemowe, uwzględniające ścisłe związki między rodziną a rolniczą jednostką produkcyjną."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this article is to present the need for a view of a family farm that is complementary to neoclassical economics and outline the framework concepts on which the future systems theory of family farms could be based. The article is a conceptual overview. The paper presents the development of economics and organization of farms. It was emphasized that in addition to the analytical approach, which today fits into the neoclassical mainstream of economic thought, the organic approach, which is related to the contemporary systems approach, was also important in the discipline. The authors presented two trends considered to be the foundation of the target theory of family farms: systems thinking and new institutional economics. An outline of the concept of a new approach to family farms is presented as a systemic whole connecting the family and its household involved in agricultural production, with the possibility of reducing internal transaction costs (agency costs) being an important attribute of this whole. Family farms still remain the predominant form of agricultural activity in Poland, Europe, and other continents. The family nature of the entities creates their specificity both in terms of goals and behaviors, which is difficult to reduce to the neoclassical model of firm, which seeks to maximize profits.\nWhat is needed is a holistic, systems approach complementary to the predominant neoclassical approach, considering close relations between the family and the agricultural production unit."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058089491","journalIssue":{"objectId":"624301cc2467f04b0b329bcd","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"370","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"59a44230-47a4-4360-b743-6958e374bafa"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"42-86","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"pol","title":"Poza czarną skrzynkę – w stronę systemowej teorii rodziny rolniczej i jej gospodarstwa"}],"publicUri":"http://www.zer.waw.pl/pdf-143079-73453?filename=BEYOND%20THE%20BLACK%20BOX_.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b57e6","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Ziętara","uuid":"BB5286875AC879705112DD761694B38D0C8102A00C65EF515ED35753D81D68012CE4648E2201964E11F4E2E506E22F83A216303573816F34A5E0A68A4E858B06","orcidId":"0000-0002-3182-522X","documentHash":"4a5de5fe-e67b-47a0-8438-f56c5e5853e1"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a047392198","name":"Michał","lastName":"Pietrzak","uuid":"066215A674BD22D8CEC9D2C5652239280069661F7791B3D067954B159B4BCA9EFB3C1E9643312A85DAE39620C823EE8FCACD134A75EFA86B8A00A81B340BA6C8","orcidId":"0000-0002-0418-3436","documentHash":"9a01df5a-9f28-4f66-8cc7-553066582369"}],"doi":"10.30858/zer/143079"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA1ODA4OTQ5MQ=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
