We investigate the degree of obscuration in star-forming galaxies, based on the Balmer decrement (BD), and explore how this trend varies, over a redshift range of 0<z<0.345. We demonstrate that the radio-detected population has on average higher levels of obscuration than the parent optical sample, arising through missing the lowest BD and lowest mass galaxies, which are also the lower star formation rate (SFR) and metallicity systems. We discuss possible explanations for this result, including speculation around whether it might arise from steeper stellar initial mass functions in low mass, low SFR galaxies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060257604","journalIssue":{"objectId":"677d3ebafdbe833088b1261f","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"41","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"87de15d4-dbc7-4f22-94e7-f723a6ad6529"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"41","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/S132335802400002X","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d3ebafdbe833088b1263f","name":"E.","lastName":"Vardoulaki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"63d2c5c6-c2a5-4483-b9df-1c3a8d5594b9"},{"objectId":"677d3ebafdbe833088b1263e","name":"E.

Here, we studied how sequential postglacial colonization, shifts in habitat, and reduced host population sizes have influenced species richness and genetic diversity of Corynosoma (Acanthocephala: Polymorphidae) parasites in northern European marine, brackish, and freshwater seal populations. We collected Corynosoma population samples from Arctic, Baltic, Ladoga, and Saimaa ringed seal subspecies and Baltic gray seals, and then applied COI barcoding and triple-enzyme restriction-site associated DNA (3RAD) sequencing to delimit species, clarify their distributions and community structures, and elucidate patterns of intraspecific gene flow and genetic diversity. Our results showed that Corynosoma species diversity reflected host colonization histories and population sizes, with four species being present in the Arctic, three in the Baltic Sea, two in Lake Ladoga, and only one in Lake Saimaa. We found statistically significant population-genetic differentiation within all three Corynosoma species that occur in more than one seal (sub)species. Genetic diversity tended to be high in Corynosoma populations originating from Arctic ringed seals and low in the landlocked populations. Our results indicate that acanthocephalan communities in landlocked seal populations are impoverished with respect to both species and intraspecific genetic diversity. Interestingly, the loss of genetic diversity within Corynosoma species seems to have been less drastic than in their seal hosts, possibly due to their large local effective population sizes resulting from high infection intensities and effective intra-host population mixing. Our study highlights the utility of genomic methods in investigations of community composition and genetic diversity of understudied parasites."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060257618","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677e69d1fdbe831a3837abfa","name":"Tommi","lastName":"Nyman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"108f0bf0-79fc-4811-a28e-1b3dea7f0977"},{"objectId":"677e69d1fdbe831a3837abf9","name":"Snorre B.","lastName":"Hagen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"307b844d-14df-43f3-bd9c-6e03f3217ecc"},{"objectId":"677e69d1fdbe831a3837abf8","name":"Sonja","lastName":"Leidenberger","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bb84940d-7cbb-4c6f-a928-44ada608b8dd"},{"objectId":"677e69d1fdbe831a3837abf7","name":"Vyacheslav","lastName":"Alexeev","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"98d59512-df69-436c-ba65-f0f2fa266c02"},{"objectId":"677e69d1fdbe831a3837abf6","name":"Elena","lastName":"Andrievskaya","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f1b9e8f7-63e3-424b-8af9-899f7bd3ba5f"},{"objectId":"677e69d1fdbe831a3837abf5","name":"Evgeny","lastName":"Ieshko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"456a3c4a-492e-4d96-9dc3-8db8492e0f96"},{"objectId":"677e69d1fdbe831a3837abf4","name":"Christian ","lastName":"Lydersen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b47f882f-2f68-4425-9cb5-a247c0ec1b72"},{"objectId":"677e69d1fdbe831a3837abf3","name":"Kit M.

Przejawy indywidualnej przedsiębiorczości wśród tej grupy (tzw. srebrnych przedsiębiorców) mogą być spowodowane wieloma motywacjami, jednak czynniki te zazwyczaj pozostają nieznane dla dotychczasowych pracodawców lub nie stanowią ważnego powodu do zrozumienia i zatrzymania osoby dojrzałej w miejscu pracy. Celem artykułu jest przedstawienie nowych wyników naukowych dotyczących motywacji przedsiębiorczych, zarówno wewnętrznych, jak i zewnętrznych oraz doświadczeń srebrnych przedsiębiorców z Europy Wschodniej na przykładzie Polski. METODYKA: W badaniu przeanalizowano unikalną próbę 1003 właścicieli mikro i małych przedsiębiorstw z Polski. W próbie uwzględniono tylko osoby powyżej 50. roku życia. Kwestionariusz ankiety został zastosowany do zbadania motywacji i doświadczeń srebrnych przedsiębiorców, które wpłynęły na ich decyzję o założeniu działalności gospodarczej w późniejszym wieku. W artykule powiązano postawy wobec danego zachowania z motywacjami i wykorzystano czynniki bazujące na szansie (ang. „pull”) i wynikające z konieczności (ang. „push”). Jako narzędzia analityczne zastosowano regresję logistyczną i regresję najmniejszych kwadratów. WYNIKI: Badania wykazały, że głównym czynnikiem „pull”, wpływającym na rozpoczęcie działalności gospodarczej przez srebrnych przedsiębiorców jest spełnianie marzeń jako szeroko rozumiana potrzeba samorealizacji. Jednak czynniki „push” (takie jak: występowanie dyskryminacji ze względu na wiek w środowisku pracy oraz utrata zatrudnienia i brak innych perspektyw na rynku pracy) istotnie zmniejszały prawdopodobieństwo założenia własnej działalności w wieku powyżej pięćdziesięciu lat. Na podstawie pozytywnego wpływu czynnika „pull” można stwierdzić, że w Polsce aktywność przedsiębiorcza osób dojrzałych w późniejszym wieku jest wynikiem przedsiębiorczości opartej na szansie. Jeśli chodzi o zewnętrzne motywacje przedsiębiorcze to wsparcie otrzymane od rodziny jest najważniejszym czynnikiem związanym z otoczeniem jednostki, wpływającym na rozpoczęcie działalności gospodarczej przez srebrnych przedsiębiorców. Jednak wsparcie ze strony przyjaciół i wsparcie ze strony organów rządowych nie były istotnymi czynnikami dla srebrnych przedsiębiorców w naszym badaniu. IMPLIKACJE: Wyniki naszego badania mają implikacje zarówno dla pracodawców, jak i grup wspierających przedsiębiorczość. Po pierwsze, z punktu widzenia pracodawców, pojawienie się dyskryminacji ze względu na wiek w poprzednim miejscu pracy mogło skutkować rezygnacją z pracy na etacie we wcześniejszym wieku i szybszym rozpoczęciem działalności gospodarczej. Sugeruje to, że negatywne zachowania wobec starszych pracowników mogą być również związane z rezygnacją z pracy przez osoby młodsze. Z punktu widzenia organów rządowych i innych grup interesariuszy związanych z rozwojem przedsiębiorczości interesujący jest fakt, że wsparcie otrzymywane od organów rządowych w prowadzeniu działalności gospodarczej było statystycznie nieistotne dla każdej grupy respondentów. Sugeruje to potrzebę identyfikacji skutecznego wsparcia i zaprojektowania kompleksowej strategii rozwoju srebrnej przedsiębiorczości. ORYGINALNOŚĆ I  WARTOŚĆ: Zdecydowana większość wcześniejszych badań wykorzystywała dane wtórne lub koncentrowała się głównie na Europie Zachodniej, w szczególności Wielkiej Brytanii, Finlandii, Francji. Naszym wkładem jest dostarczenie wyników empirycznych na temat srebrnych przedsiębiorców z Europy Wschodniej, zwłaszcza z Polski. Nasze badanie obejmowało osoby, które faktycznie prowadzą własne przedsiębiorstwa, w przeciwieństwie do wcześniejszych badań, które uwzględniały osoby, które dopiero rozważają założenie działalności gospodarczej. Jest to szczególnie istotne w odniesieniu do badań intencji przedsiębiorczych osób dojrzałych do podejmowania działań przedsiębiorczych w późniejszym wieku oraz rzeczywistych motywacji srebrnych przedsiębiorców."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"PURPOSE: Along with demographic changes, it is increasingly frequent that many mature people resign from their full-time jobs and decide to start their own businesses at a later age. Entrepreneurial activity among this group of so-called\nsilver entrepreneurs can be caused by many motives, but these factors usually remain unknown to current employers or do not constitute a valid reason for understanding\nand keeping a mature person in the workplace. The purpose of this paper is to present new scientific results concerning entrepreneurial motivations, both internal and external, and the previous experiences of silver entrepreneurs from Eastern Europe based on an example from Poland. METHODOLOGY: We analyzed a unique sample of 1,003 owners of micro and small enterprises from Poland. The sample included only people over fifty. Our empirical study used a survey to explore the motivations and experiences of silver entrepreneurs that influenced their decision to start a business later in life. We linked attitude toward the behavior with motivation and utilized the “pull” and “push” factors. We utilized logistic regression to determine\nthe factors related to starting a business above fifty. We also used the ordinary least square regression to determine the relationship between the explanatory variables\nand the age of starting a business by the respondents. FINDINGS: We found that the main “pull” factor positively influencing the start of business activity by silver\nentrepreneurs is the fulfillment of dreams as a broadly understood need for selfrealization. However, the “push” factors (such as the occurrence of ageism in the workplace, as well as the loss of employment and lack of other opportunities on the labor market) significantly reduced the probability of starting a company at the age of over fifty. On the basis of the positive impact of a “pull” factor, it can be concluded that entrepreneurial activity at a later age is the result of opportunity-based entrepreneurship. Due to the negative impact of the job-loss factor, people made\nredundant started their business activity at an earlier age, before the age of fifty. Regarding external entrepreneurial motivations, the support received from family is the most important factor related to the individual’s environment affecting starting a business by silver entrepreneurs. However, the support from friends and the support\nfrom government bodies were not significant factors influencing starting a business at a later age.IMPLICATIONS: Findings from our study have implications for both\nemployers and groups who support entrepreneurship. First, from the point of view of employers, the occurrence of ageism in the previous workplace could have resulted in\nresignation from full-time employment at an earlier age and a faster start of business activity. It is surprising that negative behavior towards older employees may also be\nassociated with resignation from work by younger people. From the point of view of government bodies and other stakeholder groups related to the development of entrepreneurship, it is interesting that the support received from government bodies in conducting business activities was statistically insignificant for each group\nof respondents. This suggests the need to identify effective support and to design a comprehensive strategy for the development of silver entrepreneurship. ORIGINALITY AND VALUE: The vast majority of previous studies used secondary\ndata or focused mainly on Western Europe, in particular the United Kingdom, Finland, and France. Our contribution is to provide empirical evidence about the silver entrepreneurs from Eastern Europe, especially Poland. Our research included individuals who actually run their own businesses, opposite to previous studies that take into account people who are just considering starting a business. This is\nparticularly important in relation to research on the entrepreneurial intentions of mature people to undertake entrepreneurial activities at a later age, and the real\nmotivations of silver entrepreneurs."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060257630","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"129-167","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6cd4fdbe831a3837d926","name":"Daria","lastName":"Ilczuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6fede85d-a3d9-4e42-a5f6-7d920b0f6868"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398f7b","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Dopierała ","uuid":"627F551CBA5F1263D169EAF31A60871E60D750AADC0616AF882F0A8B4080A9A1560A169BD24E360FDF6BECEFE32FB5891CEB4739EC0C6B4C390E4D2BBFB76D45","orcidId":"0000-0002-8515-7642","documentHash":"70480545-9ff3-427a-b0bd-a325d16a0b37"},{"objectId":"5e709251878c28a0473939cd","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Bednarz","uuid":"9C70A2DCA07D314D94C22F732F1DB498E88E19078DE361A1ED478EF339B17E08626017B2A51704D7353AE245F902D8F66F088F7E0B548F6E1DA68B26AC16E753","orcidId":"0000-0003-4695-0258","documentHash":"f3be471e-6d91-4eca-b238-86309450459b"}],"doi":"10.7341/20231934"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["MSP","reputacja","media społecznościowe","zrównoważony rozwój","Kraje V4"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["small   and   medium-sized   enterprises","reputation","social   media","sustainability","V4 countries"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"64f1a14c4097071e6b539eef","doi":"10.24136/eep.proc.2023.4","title":"Contemporary Issues in Economy.

Currently, entrepreneurs are struggling not  only  with  the  uncertainty  of  the  business  environment  but  also  with  high expectations for businesses to be run in a sustainable way. Therefore, the impact of reputation   and   social   media   on   sustainability   is   an   area   of   interest   for entrepreneurs.  Purpose  of  the  article:    This  article  defines,  quantifies  and  verifies  the  effects  of reputation  and  social  media  on  the  sustainable  development  of  SMEs  in  the  V4 countries. Methods: Data  was  gathered  using  the  CAWI  method.  The  survey  was  designed based  on  a  literature  review  and  experts’  opinions.  Respondents  (owners/top managers  of  SMEs,  n=1090)  were  asked  questions  on  their  firms’  characteristics, e-reputation,  social  media  usage  and  sustainable  development.  Linear  regression modelling was utilised for the evaluation of the hypothesis.\r\nFindings  &  value  added: The  study  revealed  a  strong  relationship  between owners'  and  top  managers’  perceptions  of  the  importance  of  both  corporate reputation  and  sustainable  development.

aim of this study is to understand how performance management systems (PMS) affect the strategy development process. The research examines PMS implementation and evaluates how the implementation of PMS links measures with rewards, i.e., financial and non-financial, to influence strategy formation. This qualitative study is based on 74 semi-structured face-to-face in-depth interviews with board members, mid-level managers, and other employees in nine organizations. Theory-building is comprised of the transcribed and analyzed interviews using MAXQDA 12 software. Theory-testing, i.e., a verificatory stage, consisted of analyzing previously identified phenomena. Results suggest that PMS affects strategy development processes by influencing both employee relational and calculative trust in their superiors. It also indicates a direct behavioral effect on employee knowledge sharing and manager trust in their subordinates. As a result, this may determine the extent to which managers exploit shared knowledge while formulating a strategy. The research demonstrates there is a trade-off between PMS implementation and strategy development. A gap in the literature is filled by integrating relational and calculative trust with PMS implementation and showing how such changes in trust mediate knowledge sharing behavior and strategy development."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060257660","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"280-295","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6cdefdbe831a3837da70","name":"Roman A.","lastName":"Lewandowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"268eebf8-9620-48bb-920c-270c8e97990b"},{"objectId":"5e7094e8878c28a0473c6a0f","name":"Giuseppe T.","lastName":"Cirella","uuid":"9A3C5DC4748F19773F16C3D57C7364C96D1225C3582CDF8BDB0BCD7B9D57839A6AA6BD7F8B59BE75171305B93AB70141B8619B63296B22FE595046D1FDF13639","orcidId":"0000-0002-0810-0589","documentHash":"d3e46c0a-ccfa-414d-bc34-2242c6510008"}],"doi":"10.1007/s12063-022-00305-4"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["rtPCR","intron","bivalvia","mtDNA","DUI","NGS"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924f878c28a04739376a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Confirmation of the first intronic sequence in the bivalvian mitochondrial genome of Macoma balthica (Linnaeus, 1758)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477358","mniswId":"2459","title":"Biology Letters","doi":null,"issn":"1744-9561","eissn":"1744-957X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"4536d417-7481-4e91-826f-96828d91cf6a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-10-05","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6347d979409707209e51e839","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924f878c28a04739376a","677e6a2bfdbe831a3837bc18","677e6a2bfdbe831a3837bc19","677e6a2bfdbe831a3837bc1a"]},"issue":"10","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In 2020, the first male-type mitochondrial genome from the clam Macoma balthica was published.

change may dramatically increase nitrate (NO3−) production and transport from watersheds to the coastal area due to short-term heavy precipitation events. However, the response of the coastal filter to such pulse NO3− delivery is poorly studied. We measured NO3− reduction rates via denitrification and DNRA in intact sediments collected from the Goro Lagoon (Po River Delta, Italy). We contrasted 2 seasons (spring and summer) and 2 sites (with lower and higher than average lagoon salinity). We performed 15NO3− additions along a concentration series (50–2000 μM) far exceeding the annual NO3− variations (20–150 μM) to quantify nitrate reduction saturation thresholds. In both seasons and sites denitrification largely outcompeted DNRA and increased along the NO3− gradient, following Michaelis-Menten kinetics. At the site characterized by low salinity, maximum potential denitrification rates decreased from spring to summer, following the decrease in the abundance of burrowing macrofauna. DNRA followed the same seasonal trend but was not affected by NO3− addition. At the site characterized by high salinity, denitrification rates slightly increased and DNRA decreased from spring to summer, despite the establishment of chemically reduced conditions and the increase in pore water free sulfides concentration. The Goro Lagoon sediments displayed elevated buffering capacity against NO3− pulse additions. Such buffer capacity was mainly supported by denitrification through spring bioturbation, decreased summer pathlength of NO3− to the anoxic zone, and unknown mechanisms preventing sulfide toxicity and the dominance of DNRA at the high salinity site."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060257688","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"271","pagesFromTo":"1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6a2efdbe831a3837bc8a","name":"Marco","lastName":"Bartoli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"09ef6781-104e-4b48-97b3-c33758be6df8"},{"objectId":"677e6a2efdbe831a3837bc89","name":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Castaldelli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3d773b28-108f-4ef9-a706-fbf6d1f63fef"},{"objectId":"677e6a2efdbe831a3837bc88","name":"Monia","lastName":"Magri","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"53fb796f-3bcc-4dde-8ecc-22f0f97b8c53"},{"objectId":"616b8aa875234017e054d5a2","name":"Sara","lastName":"Benelli","uuid":"44B79BDB4AADC6D185C4670ABFF883B9F165E52F23B6F20A1B24BFA37ECB7A0F2FA1FFCE9089D877B192B53A7807349CE362F3E04528D6CFE8A58DF8C978B56C","orcidId":"0000-0002-1684-4609","documentHash":"96174392-82fd-45ac-b679-aafdf9670158"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ecss.2022.107856"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6405e98540970761b8e23a8b","doi":null,"title":"Zatoka

cloud cover over the Baltic Sea, estimated from satellite information, may differ by as much as several dozen percent between the day and night. This difference may result from both weather conditions and different algorithms used for the day and night. The diurnal differences in cloudiness measured by proprietary and operational systems were analysed as part of research on marine environmental assessment and monitoring. An optimised algorithm for 2017 was presented and supplemented with information from radiation modelling. The study showed that, in general, the average values of daily changes in cloud cover over the sea depend on the season, which generally corresponds to the length of the day and contrasts with the amount of cloudiness. The results were compared with available online data that met the night and day detection criteria, the climate model, and the climate index. The averaged analysis of seasonal changes showed that similar values of the satellite estimates are higher than those obtained from the climate model and the lidar estimation. The satellite estimates from SatBaltic showed the lowest uncertainty. The diurnal cycle was confirmed by all analysed systems. These results may indicate common physical mechanisms and a methodological reason for the uncertainty of satellite-based data. The results clearly showed the existing diurnal difference in the amount of cloud cover over the Baltic Sea and indicated that this difference is not always explained by the physical properties of the atmosphere. The probable causes for these uncertainties were identified and diagnosed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060257692","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"64","pagesFromTo":"299-311","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oceano.2021.12.005","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6a3efdbe831a3837bf0b","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Zapadka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"17b996ff-40dd-43c6-872b-909186a4c86c"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b76d","name":"Adam","lastName":"Krężel","uuid":"E9C5F3406EABC4706DCDEE6015AAAE4C8281CF2788C96D1786389E739AA7A57E8BF316FEC54CBEBE7FDD1B22280504D5092C321348762934046D5D056D0480D2","orcidId":"0000-0002-7930-3009","documentHash":"4a4aa62e-2957-42da-a466-2bbf64e76290"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a047393771","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Paszkuta","uuid":"1492BDF3E23D6FE0A784B9646ECF10D9B6BEB8AFD491021F677661214E5929F44D0B9E3AF7C25DB929F240208EDFDDFA889EC2387FAD6294FB8724546951B101","orcidId":"0000-0002-8506-0648","documentHash":"c27055b0-58f8-4abd-a63b-abaa694e09e3"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.oceano.2021.12.005"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["starzenie cieplne","mikrostruktura SEM","pianka poliuretanowa","właściwości mechaniczne","starzenie się wody morskiej","temperatura zeszklenia"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["polyurethane foam","thermal aging","seawater aging","SEM microstructure","glass transition temperature","mechanical properties"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["677e6dbafdbe831a3837ecbf","5e70923a878c28a04739200b","5e70923e878c28a0473924c2","5e70923e878c28a0473924ca","617373a97523400564d2320a","677e6dbafdbe831a3837ecc2","677e6dbafdbe831a3837ecc3","677e6dbafdbe831a3837ecc0","677e6dbafdbe831a3837ecc1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Characterization of changes in structural, physicochemical and mechanical properties of rigid polyurethane building insulation after thermal aging in air and seawater","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479323","mniswId":"16355","title":"Polymer Bulletin","doi":null,"issn":"0170-0839","eissn":"1436-2449","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"1509bafc-cdda-4bd0-af8e-da0d33f3f4b0"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-03-19","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61bcf4842467f07b6bfaee9e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923e878c28a0473924c2","5e70923e878c28a0473924ca","5e70923a878c28a04739200b","677e6dbafdbe831a3837ecbf","677e6dbafdbe831a3837ecc0","677e6dbafdbe831a3837ecc1","617373a97523400564d2320a","677e6dbafdbe831a3837ecc2","677e6dbafdbe831a3837ecc3"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The purpose of this study was the identification of qualitative and quantitative changes in the visual appearance, chemical structure, morphology and selected physicochemical and mechanical properties of the closed cell rigid PU foam while heated in air and seawater for predicting its performance and durability.

Laminates are placed in the water column to allow for SRP sorption onto Cc and then extracted, to remove Cc together with sorbed SRP from the ecosystem. Two Cc materials obtained by planetary ball milling of a ground limestone were used. We investigated (1) physical properties of laminates, (2) their SRP binding efficiency and (3) impact on water chemistry, under variable in-lake situations, simulating turnover, epilimnetic and hypolimnetic conditions, which correspond to equilibrium, oversaturation and undersaturation with respect to Cc, respectively. Laminates coated with Cc removed 9–33% less SRP as compared to loose Cc materials due to deactivation of Cc surface in the laminates. SRP binding by laminates was highly variable (removal of 14–67%) and dependent upon physical and sorption properties of Cc material used as well as environmental conditions, with the highest efficiency in the epilimnetic variant. Under hypolimnetic and turnover conditions, laminates typically slightly, but significantly, enhanced pH, alkalinity, Ca2+ concentration and saturation with respect to Cc, whereas in epilimnetic conditions an opposite effect was seen. Although field validations are needed, we propose laminates as a non-invasive, complementary method to traditional chemical SRP inactivation in lakes, to avoid accumulation of SRP binding agents in the environment and secure sustain SRP elimination from the water bodies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060257719","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"233","pagesFromTo":"1-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11270-022-05625-6","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6a0efdbe831a3837b84d","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Brenk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ae177db0-da06-42ea-8e6d-0ed59f8abfe2"},{"objectId":"677e6a0efdbe831a3837b84c","name":"Łukasz ","lastName":"Kozłowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"229d3448-c35a-4250-ac7f-427a8c679fea"},{"objectId":"677e6a0efdbe831a3837b84b","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Idźkowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1057c052-ba93-4c89-8c7c-a5bdfdce904c"},{"objectId":"677e6a0efdbe831a3837b84a","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Bańkowska-Sobczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3792a401-b582-465a-ad27-781e48128317"},{"objectId":"5e709433878c28a0473b80ba","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Pryputniewicz-Flis","uuid":"C33C79B88F47459498783E40C61FB9A9C567A47F8515EE89D3FA0A874863AFA2EE2F1BD0BCEF85CC4DB6892DC4F0D285BB10F99E9D05A33DAAEE90F65880B29C","orcidId":"0000-0002-7641-7238","documentHash":"d7698aa1-8bbe-41ee-a729-05f1fdfaabc1"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a04739375f","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Burska","uuid":"14AF94F4EA9D1DEA232BEFDE1F9F3EA62F1ED0B4D604BBC3CF01F57B2ECFE0D69AC30CF5699FDC917A2E9FF9BD1F28AD03BE18F9F3697B74DF3DEBA132C472BE","orcidId":"0000-0002-7708-528X","documentHash":"2a4b5042-ec92-48c0-97ce-a821cf4a78de"}],"doi":"10.1007/s11270-022-05625-6"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Odrębności w pracy ratowników w środowisku zamachu terrorystycznego","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"61b9ac09ad204581b62ebb36","mniswId":"201225","title":"Lekarz Wojskowy","doi":null,"issn":"0024-0745","eissn":"1509-5754","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"MINISTRY","editor":null,"documentHash":"10a92499-ff0c-46a0-8770-538ef5ade506"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_SA","releaseDate":"2023-09-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6577532f40970765803759bc","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f93dcfa085dcb424e4c1acf","5e7094b3878c28a0473c1eba"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060257721","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"101","pagesFromTo":"188-196","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.lekarzwojskowy.pl/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f93dcfa085dcb424e4c1acf","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Zachaj","uuid":"092D5DE25F8C1F4F9AFF8FFCE30EA00D80F6A8FB34872C0AE91124EBBF9285266DA93A4D8B3E69C3CAC6B2CC026E20A68EF4B528CA990376BBA3DB1D01C2556A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"445d9ea7-bf4d-4eb9-985a-51e2ccc6b226"},{"objectId":"5e7094b3878c28a0473c1eba","name":"Jan","lastName":"Stachurski","uuid":"43DBD578C2AE1846BFD90DFD4A59AFAE48A9450460FECF54E89CA7DF29302E39FEE8C152ED4A195A9F9AE6046EC302D227CAE79ACA061BDE22694FEC1A88657F","orcidId":"0000-0001-7097-4466","documentHash":"f6ae604d-892d-412d-a038-e1420c156357"}],"doi":"10.53301/lw/161154"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"67595283fdbe83757db1217f","doi":null,"title":"From Paganism to Christianity.

The main goal of the present research, therefore, was to provide conditions for triploidization of the European grayling and examine gonads of triploid individuals. High Hydrostatic Pressure (HHP) shock (9000 psi/5 min.) applied to activated and incubated grayling eggs at 10 °C between the 17 min. 30 sec. and 20 minute timepoints subsequent to the time of insemination resulted in inhibition of the second polar body release and triploidization. Histological analysis confirmed that all 1-yr-old cytogenetically confirmed triploids had gonadal tissues indicative of sterility with the gonads being composed of connective tissue including fibroblasts, adipocytes and degenerated epithelial structures without there being any differentiated germ cells detected. There were no differences in the body length and Fulton’s condition factor between 1 year old diploid and triploid grayling, however, the average body weight was markedly less in triploid than diploid specimens. Although, 1-yr-old triploid European female and male graylings did not have fully developed gonads, before these triploid specimens are deemed safe, as a result of being reproductively sterile for stocking in natural grayling habitats, there needs to be further examination of the 2- and 3-year-old triploid specimens."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060257731","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"237","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2022.106929","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6a1dfdbe831a3837ba25","name":"Stefan","lastName":"Dobosz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"96786f50-3055-4131-8501-cc92e9f79caf"},{"objectId":"677e6a1dfdbe831a3837ba24","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Grudniewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e02444dd-1c86-4f00-9a6f-d60868ff7f82"},{"objectId":"677e6a1dfdbe831a3837ba23","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Leonowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ccf2f68e-1e56-4aa0-93bf-0f1ea2068d35"},{"objectId":"677e6a1dfdbe831a3837ba22","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Rożyński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"90613770-3a09-4c41-b9a8-7fa7e3a1c445"},{"objectId":"677e6a1dfdbe831a3837ba21","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Ziomek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ba040da5-e8e0-43f0-8bb5-33cc4eeb3efa"},{"objectId":"677e6a1dfdbe831a3837ba20","name":"Ligia","lastName":"Panasiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1189f7f4-a382-46cb-a02c-63d428f4df11"},{"objectId":"677e6a1dfdbe831a3837ba1f","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Hliwa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f42a609c-edfc-498d-acf2-9064c211b1aa"},{"objectId":"5e70921c878c28a0473900b7","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Ocalewicz","uuid":"F13F759BB91417695FAF7EC21F8A80E6755D8461106C179130F5ABB7ED191875D4577CA8760AF3349F712D58287F3AD71C92B0A82D1C738C103BF9CA3DF4F16D","orcidId":"0000-0001-7122-7542","documentHash":"0c2abea5-ce81-4531-bbc6-dbed9fd46e78"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.anireprosci.2022.106929"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Legitymizacja","społeczeństwo autorytarne","społeczeństwo demokratyczne","społeczeństwo przejściowe","model konceptualny"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Legitimacy","authoritarian society","democratic society","transitional society","conceptual model"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6573133a4097071b8e6fc467","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-33724-6","title":"National security drivers of Ukraine:  information technology, strategic communication, and legitimacy","year":2023,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-3-031-33723-9","ismn":null,"issn":"2198-7289","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-33724-6","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"783e32a1-7c9b-4075-a8d8-8417676b38ff","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924f878c28a04739375b"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Comparative analysis of conceptual models of power legitimation in authoritarian, democratic and transitional societies","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6573133d4097071b8e6fc486","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924f878c28a04739375b","677e5ce8fdbe831a38376375","677e5ce8fdbe831a38376376","677e5ce8fdbe831a38376377","677e5ce8fdbe831a38376378"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Ukazano związek pomiędzy legitymizacją, efektywnością administracji publicznej i stabilnością systemu politycznego.

Hyperglycemia significantly inhibits cGMP-dependent pathway activity in the kidney, leading to glomerular damage and proteinuria. The enhancement of activity of this pathway that is associated with an elevation of cGMP levels may be achieved by inhibition of the cGMP specific phosphodiesterase 5A (PDE5A) using selective inhibitors, such as tadalafil. Hyperglycemia decreased the insulin responsiveness of podocytes and impaired podocyte function. These effects were associated with lower protein amounts and activity of the protein deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and a decrease in the phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (AMPK). We found that PDE5A protein levels increased in hyperglycemia, and PDE5A downregulation improved the insulin responsiveness of podocytes with reestablished SIRT1 expression and activity. PDE5A inhibitors potentiate nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP signaling, and NO modulates the activity and expression of SIRT1. Therefore, we investigated the effects of tadalafil on SIRT1 and AMPK in the context of improving the insulin sensitivity in podocytes and podocyte function in hyperglycemia. Our study revealed that tadalafil restored SIRT1 expression and activity and activated AMPK by increasing its phosphorylation. Tadalafil also restored stimulating effect of insulin on glucose transport in podocytes with high glucose-induced insulin resistance. Additionally, tadalafil improved the function of podocytes that were exposed to high glucose concentrations.

Gluten-free bread (GFB) is a staple food product; therefore, many recent studies have reported the nutritional properties of GFB. However, an overview of the current ingredients and nutritional labeling of GFB worldwide has not yet been provided. This review aimed to gather the latest information regarding the most used ingredients in GFB formulations and the nutritional quality of these products from different countries, based on studies published in the last decade (2010–2020). Our analysis showed that GFB had a lower protein and a higher fat content than gluten-containing bread, and the dietary fiber content was highly variable between countries. Some studies have revealed a high glycaemic index in most products, which is associated with the extensive use of rice flour and starch as the main ingredients in GFB formulation. Label information presented significant differences from the data obtained through the chemical analysis of fiber and other nutritional components. Micronutrient fortification is not common in the GFB. The nutritional quality of commercial GFB is a crucial issue that needs to be addressed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060257779","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"63","pagesFromTo":"693-705","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2021.1952403","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61d49f9b2467f0627d259ef6","name":"Vanessa D.","lastName":"Capriles","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ee46dbda-f09e-4ceb-9185-84ad51056b23"},{"objectId":"61d49f9b2467f0627d259ef4","name":"Fernarda G.","lastName":"Santos","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c3a5e12c-006d-48df-9f56-5ac1fb4d8202"},{"objectId":"61d49f9b2467f0627d259ef3","name":"Etiene V.","lastName":"Aguiar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c2d3d2f5-2cb7-4bdd-ac55-a3cf41be9d95"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b590c","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Krupa-Kozak","uuid":"824046190EE24412796A8810E9411D9CE05BF23BC9D270DAA5BCB208C989366F8E808ACA30C1F7DF5E6D86B3E899878705B2F6E7827CB1232D8102AD21736584","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5eb3692a-f31e-4173-b6e9-435b4fba6984"}],"doi":"10.1080/10408398.2021.1952403"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["wywiad","CIA","NATO","Rosja","Internet","OSINT","Ukraina"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Ukraine","CIA","NATO","Internet","OSINT","Russia","intelligence"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709211878c28a04738f73c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Zainteresowanie CIA krajami postradzieckimi z perspektywy zasobów globalnego Internetu","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a36d","mniswId":"486024","title":"Geopolitical Review","doi":null,"issn":"2080-8836","eissn":"2392-067X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"04bb0d00-5cc9-4d7d-b07f-bf1eed559411"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-10-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6576c76b4097071b8ef77271","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709211878c28a04738f73c"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Działania służb specjalnych stanowią trudny przedmiot badań ze względu na\r\nutajnienie informacji.

Due to their short generation times and high sensitivity to changes in physicochemical conditions, diatoms are considered good environmental indicators. The main goal of our study was to find and explain the relationships between changes in meteorological conditions and diatom fluxes and taxonomic composition based on the example of two small lakes: Łazduny and Rzęśniki. Using meteorological data, sediment traps, and regular measurements of limnological and hydrochemical properties of the water column, we collected a three-year-long, high-resolution series of observations. The results show that total diatom fluxes are indirectly influenced by changes in meteorological conditions, acting through changes in the mixing regimes that determine the nutrient and light availability in lakes. Statistical analyses showed that the variability of the diatom data is correlated with air temperature and wind speed. Nevertheless, their influence on diatom assemblages is most likely the surrogate for the complex changes in the physical structure of the investigated lakes. Despite many similarities between the studied lakes such as mixing regime patterns, dominant diatom taxa, and seasonal dynamics of diatom fluxes, we recorded differences in both the seasonal succession of specific diatom taxa and the occurrence of the peaks of total fluxes, and differences in taxonomic composition referring to less dominant taxa. We attribute these dissimilarities to the local conditions, such as the hydrological types of the lakes, the extent of the littoral zone, and exposure to the sunlight connected to the position in the catchment."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060257802","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"147","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677e69d3fdbe831a3837ac3a","name":"Monika","lastName":"Rzodkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"89e2350f-919c-472f-a1cb-98cb4808d95e"},{"objectId":"677e69d3fdbe831a3837ac39","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Szczerba","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"59ce4831-0b90-441e-8622-99b1aaa88605"},{"objectId":"5e709249878c28a047393166","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Tylmann","uuid":"CC04ABCA899331D083D8F78B666C48FC2CBED051874C6F470313FDD7852977E891365CCE0A51A808EE143FBA1B7776B147650AFC44C777A9E6F9590EA2B455A7","orcidId":"0000-0003-1749-5882","documentHash":"d6781d37-ff0f-40c6-a61d-8f3b2675b2b4"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.110028"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fast ice","warming","Svalbard","random forest","machine learning"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924f878c28a047393755"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The decline of Svalbard land-fast sea ice extent as a result of climate change","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790c9","mniswId":"15353","title":"Oceanologia","doi":null,"issn":"0078-3234","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"21cd6d5e-391e-4879-83bd-3b75e5a7ac2d"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-04-08","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"633bfae34097074f734f4238","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924f878c28a047393755","677e6a4ffdbe831a3837c14a"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Svalbard Archipelago has experienced some of the most severe temperature increases in the Arctic in the last three decades. This temperature rise has accelerated sea-ice melting along the coast of the archipelago, thus bringing changes to the local environment. In view of the importance of the near-future distribution of land-fast sea ice along the Svalbard coast, the available observation data on the ice extent between 1973 and 2018 are used herein to create a random forest (RF) model for predicting the daily ice extent and its spatial distribution according to the cumulative number of freezing and thawing degree days and the duration of the ice season. Two RF models are constructed by using either regression or classification algorithms. The regression model makes it possible to estimate the extent of land-fast ice with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 800 km2, while the classification model creates a cluster of submodels in order to forecast the spatial distribution of land-fast ice with less than 10% error. The models also enable the reconstruction of the past ice extent, and the prediction of the near-future extent, from standard meteorological data, and can even analyze the real-time spatial variability of land-fast ice. On average, the minimum two-monthly extent of land-fast sea ice along the Svalbard coast was about 12,000 km2 between 1973 and 2000. In 2005–2019, however, the ice extent declined to about 6,000 km2. A further increase in mean winter air temperatures by two degrees, which is forecast in 10 to 20 years, will result in a minimum two-monthly land-fast ice extent of about 1,500 km2, thus indicating a trend of declining land-fast ice extent in this area."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060257804","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"64","pagesFromTo":"535-545","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oceano.2022.03.008","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6a4ffdbe831a3837c14a","name":"Dagmara","lastName":"Litwicka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"981af6dc-584e-48c6-b820-651b938977e9"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a047393755","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Urbański","uuid":"5AAE6B09F2463205522CC18C08EA4198075E5D7BA9E68C218E43EF94D8D34A63DFA4912E265E11ADC5B9AD298BF0B1A0D3780326687865C939F514BD1629B10C","orcidId":"0000-0003-3842-4143","documentHash":"99854f94-07ea-4c77-a025-17ba9cd32ef4"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.oceano.2022.03.008"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924f878c28a047393766","5e70924f878c28a04739375e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Spatial characteristics of frazil streaks in the Terra Nova Bay Polynya from high-resolution visible satellite imagery","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477849","mniswId":"4565","title":"Cryosphere","doi":null,"issn":"1994-0416","eissn":"1994-0424","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b3eaeb1b-4cd1-4827-a8bd-35e8822e76d8"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-17","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"652fb9af4097077f8aa830f5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924f878c28a04739375e","5e70924f878c28a047393766"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Coastal polynyas around the Antarctic continent are regions of very strong ocean–atmosphere heat and moisture exchange that are important for local and regional weather, sea ice production, and water mass formation. Due to extreme atmospheric conditions (very strong offshore winds, low air temperature, as well as humidity) the surface ocean layer in polynyas is highly turbulent, with mixing due to combined Langmuir, wind-induced, and buoyancy-driven turbulence. One of the visible signs of complex interactions between the mixed-layer dynamics and the forming sea ice are frazil streaks, elongated patches of high ice concentration separated by areas of open water. In spite of their ubiquity, observational and modelling analyses of frazil streaks have been very limited largely due to the fact that their significance for heat flux and ice production is only just becoming apparent. In this study, the first comprehensive analysis of the spatial variability of surface frazil concentration is performed for the Terra Nova Bay Polynya (TNBP). Frazil streaks are identified in high-resolution (pixel size 10–15 m) visible satellite imagery, and their properties (surface area, width, spacing, and orientation) are linked to the meteorological forcing (wind speed and air temperature). This provides a simple statistical tool for estimating the extent and ice coverage of the region of high ice production under given meteorological conditions. It is also shown that the orientation of narrow streaks tends to agree with the wind direction, suggesting the dominating role of the local wind forcing in their formation. Very wide streaks, in turn, deviate from that pattern, as they are presumably influenced by several additional factors, including local water circulation and the associated convergence zones. An analysis of peak wavelengths and directions determined from the images, compared to analogous open-water wavelengths computed with a spectral wave model, demonstrates a significant slow-down in the observed wave growth in TNBP. This suggests an important role of frazil streaks in modifying wind-wave growth and/or dissipation in polynyas."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060257810","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"2073-2094","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/17/2073/2023/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a047393766","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Herman","uuid":"44B5293D87B2EFB8CF355798E377F5251631920D04E7A3E09EDA286CBD683C0530A7B5ED2F5BD7717F072D01EA9C58EA8281064069FF24ECECBD141524BB57A2","orcidId":"0000-0001-5112-7165","documentHash":"d2114a83-e13a-4055-b93a-e52ed09a78ec"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a04739375e","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Bradtke","uuid":"5D7F0E97E4051924BF632F540B405544DC86D9C13D47A5B39EAE8AD4EB182CC233EE2CF633AEB01DDEFF1E55EE144ED62AC43DBDCDBF9B95BA98C683495819B0","orcidId":"0000-0002-9305-8193","documentHash":"a701baf3-d918-4b69-909c-fcee70f9799e"}],"doi":"10.5194/tc-17-2073-2023"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cyanopeptolin","proteases inhibition","cyanobacteria","anticancer activity"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["677e69aefdbe831a3837a6d4","5e7092b3878c28a04739aee3","5e70924f878c28a04739376e","602f967f9543c7410626f647"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Structural diversity and biological activity of cyanopeptolins produced by Nostoc edaphicum CCNP1411","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d67","mniswId":"13910","title":"Marine Drugs","doi":null,"issn":"1660-3397","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"d344c631-ab0f-4cf6-bd9a-cea727af08a9"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-26","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65786e094097076c149798f3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b3878c28a04739aee3","5e70924f878c28a04739376e","602f967f9543c7410626f647","677e69aefdbe831a3837a6d3","677e69aefdbe831a3837a6d4","677e69aefdbe831a3837a6d5","677e69aefdbe831a3837a6d6"]},"issue":"10","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cyanopeptolins (CPs) are one of the most commonly occurring class of cyanobacterial nonribosomal peptides.

Urban sprawl, congestion and external effects of transport influence the perceived quality of life in urban and suburban areas. Therefore, it is essential to examine the reasons for choosing transport modes and willingness to change the mobility choices for sustainable ones. Using the Theory of Planned Behaviour within a structural equation modelling (SEM) approach, the goal was to comprehensively explain the perceived quality of life, transport behaviour and the underlying psychological processes, norms and beliefs, and to show the interdependencies between them. The main research method was the survey. Then, SEM models have been estimated to verify which values have the strongest effect on the transport behaviour and which variables significantly mediate this relation. The models were estimated based on a randomly-selected sample of Polish citizens, urban, suburban and rural residents (n = 1700) in October 2020 and October 2021. The results for residents of cities and suburban areas were compared with those for rural dwellers to refine the results significant for creating the urban policies.

A survey conducted among Polish airports showed that the assessment of the factor's significance depended not only on air traffic volume but also on the degree of airports' commitment to green practices. For airports with a high level of commitment, the most important barrier was the cost. In the case of airports with a medium level of commitment, the most significant barriers were unawareness of the potential benefits, and a low priority assigned to green practices in the airport's strategic goals. For airports with a low degree of commitment, in addition to the costs, the most important barrier was the conviction that their impact on the environment was low. The most important stimulants were the same for airports with medium and high levels of pro-environmental commitment: good financial condition, pro-environmental orientation of airport authorities, and political pressure. For the airports with a low degree of commitment, growth rates of passenger traffic were the most important stimulant. All the analyzed Polish airports saw benefits primarily in the possibility of identifying, monitoring, and reducing their negative impacts on the environment (meeting the legal and political requirements), and increasing the environmental awareness of the airport authorities and employees. In terms of managerial implications, our research has demonstrated that there is a strong need to provide expert assistance to airport authorities in the field of environmental management. The objectives of European Union policy are among the most ambitious and rigorous in the world. European airports committed to net zero carbon emissions under their control by 2050 or even earlier, and a few of them have already achieved Net Zero. Nevertheless, Polish airports undertake pro-environmental measures to a very limited extent, despite the dynamic high growth of passenger traffic, and despite being subjected to the pressure of the same European policy. In this context, support from the EU policy and domestic policy is of key importance."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060257831","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"111","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6ce0fdbe831a3837daa0","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Bulczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ecfec2f8-71d5-4469-bf3a-dbccfec92901"},{"objectId":"677e6ce0fdbe831a3837da9f","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Wach-Kloskowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1fc4425d-2da1-4a9e-ba50-93c3f8c5552b"},{"objectId":"677e6ce0fdbe831a3837da9e","name":"Marta","lastName":"Mańkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"425f2268-fde8-4d3c-a3d5-9a0151ca8035"},{"objectId":"5e709251878c28a0473939c3","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Tłoczyński","uuid":"75E2C60DB9403FAD6B5F362C71C35D6F0D3C1AF1C8362887D5295D95132B89C9FF7E27699CBEC53212CC2B831164ABE05B81DA393714FEDA3B68DF3A34397951","orcidId":"0000-0001-6262-1062","documentHash":"7349c238-9d31-4e2e-9a26-3d6330b9ee76"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jairtraman.2023.102438"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["wczesny neolit","KCWR","kultura malicka","krzemieniarstwo","zmiana kulturowa"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Early Neolithic","Linear Pottery culture (LBK)","Malice culture (MC)","SE Poland","culture change","continuation","heterogenization"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709281878c28a047396dbe"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de95","uid":"bJjSI9Xh5XWd377BL7x5oLA","uuid":"d1b51967-3814-49e3-a522-d20d8eb32d9a","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de95","parentUuid":"d1b51967-3814-49e3-a522-d20d8eb32d9a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de95","rootUuid":"d1b51967-3814-49e3-a522-d20d8eb32d9a","name":"Instytut Archeologii i Etnologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094e0878c28a0473c5df8"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The early Neolithic cultural transformation in the Targowisko settlement region, SE Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479357","mniswId":"16437","title":"Prähistorische Zeitschrift","doi":null,"issn":"0079-4848","eissn":"1613-0804","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"fa101581-1093-4978-bae5-52d0e7de9ed6"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6391df6c4097077716b64bd3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709281878c28a047396dbe","677cff34fdbe831a382bf3bf","677cff34fdbe831a382bf3c0","677cff34fdbe831a382bf3c1","677cff34fdbe831a382bf3c2","677cff34fdbe831a382bf3c3","5e7094e0878c28a0473c5df8","677cff34fdbe831a382bf3c5","677cff34fdbe831a382bf3c6","677cff34fdbe831a382bf3c7"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the article is to characterize the early Neolithic settlement region of Targowisko in SE Poland. It is located on the northern edge of the Western Carpathians, 30 km east of Krakow. It functioned during the development of the entire Linear Pottery culture (LBK) and the subsequent Malice culture (MC), in the period from 5300 to 4500 BC. The focus was on the cultural transformation at the turn of the 6th to the 5th millennium BC. Cases of decisive cultural change (e.g. forms and ornamentation of ceramics, dwellings construction, directions of the supply of stone materials, the organization of inhabited space) and cases of continuity (elements of ceramics technology and flint production, continuation of settlement processes and subsistence strategy) were recorded. Cultural change is best represented by the symbolic realm and continuity in the utilitarian realm.

The research also aimed to determine how the financial performance is influenced by firm-specific and country-specific factors. We analyzed a unique panel dataset of 328 energy producers, most of which were private limited companies, in the period ranging from 2011 to 2019. Using random effects and fixed effects models, we found that private limited companies had a better financial performance than public limited companies. The size of the company’s assets had an ambiguous effect on its financial performance. Moreover, the difference in the performance of various type of energy producers was small. However, since the Paris Agreement, the impact of electricity prices on both ROA and ROE of the producers has been increasing."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060257848","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"8","pagesFromTo":"11492-11503","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6d2efdbe831a3837e552","name":"Daria","lastName":"Ilczuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bd0e9157-7130-4637-90ff-d3988126f69d"},{"objectId":"602e161c9543c7410626ec1a","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Laskowicz","uuid":"443C2B85475438CADD59E22B409BFC39F5C420DC45DBF854D952F1B0CA0FE5CC4D972B183287BD09FF4D7239AF6F9D8977964FB5B942C03D82D721F785EAF98D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"671efe2b-e4a4-4989-864a-e93cbbd61fd7"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398f7b","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Dopierała ","uuid":"627F551CBA5F1263D169EAF31A60871E60D750AADC0616AF882F0A8B4080A9A1560A169BD24E360FDF6BECEFE32FB5891CEB4739EC0C6B4C390E4D2BBFB76D45","orcidId":"0000-0002-8515-7642","documentHash":"70480545-9ff3-427a-b0bd-a325d16a0b37"},{"objectId":"5e70925b878c28a0473944cb","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Mosionek-Schweda","uuid":"541428328CAF5378D03F03BB6FCE79C7B2AFF1EE0C9F208D4ED9E4B89561F84E78DDD29320F62D7F52D71F16234880F51E5E4ACBA0DCD5587266EC725DAD630A","orcidId":"0000-0003-0450-6087","documentHash":"6754311b-2417-457e-9ada-c5c5cb540b01"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.egyr.2022.09.009"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928b878c28a0473978d0"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"On retroactive instrumentality","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d54878c28514547abb0","mniswId":"5477","title":"Educational Theory","doi":null,"issn":"0013-2004","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"7fa383a8-b19b-4e8c-8f41-2aa34eb3928c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6574a4a54097071b8ee95862","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928b878c28a0473978d0"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The topic of instrumentalism has engaged many scholars of contemporary educational thought. One can distinguish the positions of anti-instrumentalism from those that stress noninstrumental values of education, both conceived in the context of neoliberal/neoconservative and consumption-driven reality. In this text, Maria Mendel enters into this engagement from the perspective of the current political consumption of memory. While taking up the problem of the role public pedagogy plays in contemporary nation-states — especially in the current turn toward the past — Mendel focuses on both educational and sociopolitical issues in the context of what she calls “retroactive instrumentalism.” When return to the past is the “principle of the contemporary,” she argues, instrumentalism does not necessarily result from intentional planning ex ante. If education is broadly understood as a practice of public space formation, it may be composed of experiences that do not have to be “traditionally” purposeful and oriented toward the future. They may gain their instrumental character ex post. To illustrate this possibility, Mendel analyzes snippets of Polish reality concerning the construction of “the good nation.” Many of the elements of public pedagogy in this case contain unifications that pertain directly to the instrumental character of the learning experiences employed by a society as it transforms into a nation. The instrumentalism of those elements is discovered post factum. In its ontological dimension, then, education may gain or solidify its instrumental character ex post. Based on the analysis proposed in this text, one could say that when instrumentality is retroactive, it becomes displaced intentionality — that is, it provides an instrumental story that disguises the intentions of the one writing the narrative. Mendel concludes by using the Aristotelian notion of phantasia, which regards “being without a matter,” to encourage productive thought about how to create public narratives that are free of instrumentalism. This grounds a version of public pedagogy that is oriented toward the animation of people's active imagining and thus becoming public. By epistemologically shifting learning into a public space, such public pedagogy serves to recultivate society and humanity as plurality, diversity, and coproduction of the public."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060257855","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"72","pagesFromTo":"369-382","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a0473978d0","name":"Maria","lastName":"Mendel","uuid":"1B8389E04F79315ABA170CFF3E9478B16E764B0B83398238BB3D7395C7C21CD8AACED72A77841353FCE90439EC9BF5F959906008980A4879A7D44DD1642DD8AB","orcidId":"0000-0002-4022-5402","documentHash":"324895b8-a9ad-4ddf-8feb-32830ce3844b"}],"doi":"10.1111/edth.12536"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["PROMETHEE","multiple criteria ranking","binary linear programming","stochastic acceptability index","robustness analysis","rank aggregation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"618189fd2467f038351e3599","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-84997-9","title":"Collective Decisions: Theory, Algorithms And Decision Support Systems","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-3-030-84996-2","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-84997-9#about","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"7b5f1405-a230-449a-b49b-8fc1bca0cca0","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f1655427523405869ccc2e9","5e7093a9878c28a0473aea7f"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Aggregation of Stochastic Rankings in Group Decision Making","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"630c90574097076f71693b67","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093a9878c28a0473aea7f","5f1655427523405869ccc2e9","5e709281878c28a047396da0","616e2da875234017e055d026"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We propose a novel method for group decision making. It is applicable in the context of multiple criteria ranking problems, where alternatives need to be ordered from the best to the worst by multiple Decision Makers (DMs). In the first stage, incomplete preference information of each DM is analyzed within the framework of stochastic analysis. Specifically, the Monte Carlo simulation is applied for exploiting the space of preference model parameters compatible with each DM’s preferences. In this way, we estimate the values of stochastic acceptability indices that quantify the support given to the preference, indifference, and incomparability relations for each pair of alternatives. In the second stage, such stochastic rankings are aggregated into a group compromise recommendation that minimizes either an average or a maximal distance from each DM’s input. Apart from accounting for the utilitarian and egalitarian perspectives, the dedicated mathematical programming models deal with the processing and constructing of complete or partial rankings. The proposed method is coupled with the robust variants of PROMETHEE I and II methods, however, it can be combined with any method from the broad family of Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis (SMAA) techniques. Its applicability for supporting real-world group decision making is demonstrated in an illustrative case study concerning the ranking of project proposals by a research funding agency."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060257861","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"83 - 101","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-84997-9_4","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"616e2da875234017e055d026","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Grynia","uuid":"8347DCE39BDD497565620AA79A9EFCC67A7F5F3491151808C58841CCA499C88E9189B7FCBC12FF1747B0F35EF4028697AB7C1E2118852459ECA5921AEA1EF456","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"97283caa-82e4-4d77-97a7-aa0e000ac46a"},{"objectId":"5f1655427523405869ccc2e9","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Miebs","uuid":"5350DEC007E81AACE1B889E6355788CF21C906C427340AA0B3CA886FAF07E8257FAA3F3CA88CD439EDD8C1C354904EB66C2A4004ABDB76D28C1E011A805AF3F4","orcidId":"0000-0002-0628-6949","documentHash":"a43b35f5-cbc7-4235-abcd-f21bd0e3698f"},{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473aea7f","name":"Miłosz","lastName":"Kadziński","uuid":"0524DF351F74037796D121D8BF7C1CCA9249345518F29DDEB1C65535048C6204A5AB8E4891A0339577E7CFC30BE45B0CC495E2F95ABE4BDB1176AA365686E5F0","orcidId":"0000-0003-1806-3715","documentHash":"1bcbca85-e703-4477-a88a-b45166e29063"},{"objectId":"5e709281878c28a047396da0","name":"Roman","lastName":"Słowiński","uuid":"AB1926BA4A9DED93AC177661DD774526EC689F9DEA2576B69B9B01761B4609D2F2C87038A8C688867E5CD6EEB89BA0B69AD7A7B241DEE418C47FC2A66DD1E1ED","orcidId":"0000-0002-5200-7795","documentHash":"cc5ad471-bd5b-46b0-bade-7f464a803b0c"}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-84997-9_4"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Montessori","herezja","ortodoksja"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Montessori","heresy","orthodoxy"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092cb878c28a04739cca2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Invitation to heretical reading of Montessori pedagogy","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a349","mniswId":"200255","title":"PROBLEMY WCZESNEJ EDUKACJI","doi":null,"issn":"1734-1582","eissn":"2451-2230","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WCN","editor":null,"documentHash":"8bd2e5e7-79b0-453c-921c-83f4ce65c733"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2022-12-12","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6576d1174097071b8efb1ce5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092cb878c28a04739cca2"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the article the author invites readers to initiate a certain mode of reading that - inspired by Agamben and Holmes - is called heretical reading.

It was constructed on the concept of key competences as proposed by the Council of the European Union. This model of competences is inscribed in the concept of lifelong learning and does not concentrate on the compensatory functions of the competences but merely promotes the insight of educators into their self-development. This article presents the construction process and psychometrical properties of AENI.\r\n\r\nMaterials and methods: The reliability of the test is confirmed by the inter-correlated results. The accuracy of the questionnaire was confirmed through principal component analysis (PCA). Apart from this, the accuracy of the theory was verified by a correlation between AENI and the Social Skills Profile (PROKOS), which measures the level of such social skills as assertiveness, cooperativeness, sociability, social resourcefulness, and social activeness. To check the accuracy of the theory, hypotheses were formulated which were related to both the correlated overall results (AENI and PROKOS) and the chosen scales.\r\n\r\nResults: Six areas of need in development were distinguished: communication skills, multilingual and multicultural skills, digital skills, entrepreneurial skills, openness to science and culture, and social and civic skills. A low result on the scale indicates a need to develop a given skill because the respondent's skills are weak. Such information is vital for employers and educators who wish to diagnose the areas that need improvement. The measures of reliability and accuracy allow us to state that the questionnaire possesses acceptable psychometrical factors. This study contains propositions for further improvement of the questionnaire and a key to interpreting the research results.\r\n\r\nConclusion: Adult education needs inventory questionnaire is a reliable research tool that can be used to assess the competences of adult educators.

Citrus aurantium EO is traditionally used for therapeutic benefits due to its high content of bioactive compounds. Therefore, this study focuses on its potential use as a food preservative by investigating the combined antibacterial properties of EOs from leaves (EO1), flowers (EO2), and small branches (EO3) of Citrus aurantium against six bacterial strains by the agar disk diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) methods. The chemical compositions of the EOs were analysed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and revealed the presence of numerous compounds responsible for their antimicrobial properties. The MIC values for the EOs were 3.12 mg/mL, 4.23 mg/mL, and 1.89 mg/mL, for EO1, EO2 and EO3, respectively, while the MBC values were 12.5 mg/mL, 6.25 mg/mL, and 6.25 mg/mL, respectively. A simplex centroid design was created to analyse the effect of the individual and combined EOs against E. coli. The combined EOs showed enhanced antibacterial activity compared to the individual oils, suggesting a synergistic effect (e.g., trial 9 with an MIC of 0.21 mg/mL), allowing the use of lower EO concentrations and reducing potential negative effects on food flavour and aroma. Additionally, the practical application of investigated EOs (at concentrations twice the MIC) was investigated in raw chicken meat stored at 4 °C for 21 days. The EOs, individually and in combination, effectively extended the shelf life of the meat by inhibiting bacterial growth (total bacterial count of less than 1 × 104 CFU/g in the treated samples compared to 7 × 107 CFU/g in the control on day 21 of storage). The study underlines the potential of C. aurantium EOs as natural preservatives that represent a sustainable and effective alternative to synthetic chemicals in food preservation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060257877","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66f68d6dfdbe8327373e1129","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"13","number":"19","doi":null,"documentHash":"678003da-8984-4dbe-8cf7-734db109a5aa"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"3093","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/13/19/3093/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677d38b2fdbe833088b0c7e5","name":"Anis","lastName":"Ben Hsouna","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"db52e495-a2be-4244-ab0b-4a869157f7fb"},{"objectId":"677d38b2fdbe833088b0c7e4","name":"Stefania","lastName":"Garzoli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"71b035f4-25c1-4cef-b75f-3fb61c9dab93"},{"objectId":"677d38b2fdbe833088b0c7e3","name":"Wissem","lastName":"Mnif","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ae5f54a6-e6cc-4d36-a084-8d3a2638db0c"},{"objectId":"677d38b2fdbe833088b0c7e2","name":"Rania","lastName":"Ben Saad","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"608ad1b1-fc10-41aa-ad5d-173ba4c0ff3e"},{"objectId":"677d38b2fdbe833088b0c7e1","name":"Ivana Generalić","lastName":"Mekinić","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"886461c3-4417-4c67-be9f-6504d4561fa7"},{"objectId":"677d38b2fdbe833088b0c7e0","name":"Boutheina","lastName":"Ben Akacha","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"74a2cd1e-41a0-41f1-ac2f-b1a391428f01"},{"objectId":"677d38b2fdbe833088b0c7df","name":"Ines","lastName":"Ellouze","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"21f4e9d2-ec97-4349-aa35-3b08756ff3b1"},{"objectId":"6541c63a40e3ff4ef3f3052b","name":"MIROSLAVA","lastName":"KACANIOVA","uuid":"7794EBC5CA95977C883BEFE7C9CD79995D8EE73A86FAEB38507514423B60B06B8E1B060262A643054A0E2C03DBB79DF0ACE33D858E610940C085A81872D0003D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c70a17b2-e3f6-4d18-bb17-a31435aeac8d"},{"objectId":"5e709229878c28a047390e18","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Kluz","uuid":"568627EE9B69C4057DA8CBEEBED11223B1712B5835BBCFCABBC028C8A8D9B2C39ADD6EAD81DD88F6808E502425A579A2DB257DA6A7EDF96B70050AF953F589ED","orcidId":"0000-0003-1627-6186","documentHash":"f06df08f-e54a-4f61-b79b-d7b7ae2e108f"}],"doi":"10.3390/foods13193093"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hybrid heat pump system","energy saving","social housing retrofit","comfort temperature"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Energy retrofit optimization for social building in temperate climate zone","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aae","mniswId":"5678","title":"Energy and Buildings","doi":null,"issn":"0378-7788","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"18de315f-c2aa-472d-99dd-3b9c97d40f9e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64a69b19409707138654dac5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709398878c28a0473ad799","5e709396878c28a0473ad652","677e681ffdbe831a38378ad6","677e681ffdbe831a38378ad7","677e681ffdbe831a38378ad8","677e681ffdbe831a38378ad9"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study analyses the energy consumption of a social housing built in the 800 s. This typology is widely diffused in the building stock of Rome and of the city’s suburbs and for this its improvement represents a dutiful effort for the Italian national scene, where the energy efficiency of public social housing is a major concern. Public funding is significantly reduced compared to the past and the conditions of the buildings are deteriorating over time, resulting in an increase in energy consumption for air conditioning and in indoor comfort conditions very far from the standards. Often it is also very difficult to act on the passive system, with the insertion of a thermal insulation, as well as inside the apartments, with the replacement of terminal units. For this reason a good way is to evaluate the possibility of modifying the thermal energy generation system, preserving as much as possible the distribution and supply system inside the apartments. In general, where the boiler is not obsolescent, the idea is to propose a hybrid generation system with the inclusion of a heat pump (HHP), which could be implemented with renewable energy equipment, properly installed in the building. The results show that a hybrid system can lower the primary energy consumption up to 28%, thus allowing the employment of renewable energies within the social housing building stock."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060257881","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"282","pagesFromTo":"[1-19]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778823000014","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677e681ffdbe831a38378ad9","name":"M.","lastName":"Di Matteo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6d628e7d-b48d-4b2a-8bb9-e130ccf3033e"},{"objectId":"677e681ffdbe831a38378ad8","name":"S.","lastName":"Grignaffini","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2826d434-3f1c-4ec0-a5d0-af0bdc7ee5e3"},{"objectId":"677e681ffdbe831a38378ad7","name":"C.V.","lastName":"Fiorini","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eb75ad87-e0fa-49a6-9119-82c15c545a0f"},{"objectId":"677e681ffdbe831a38378ad6","name":"A.","lastName":"Vallati","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8b5a320f-ac19-42c0-a171-c2139ad7e382"},{"objectId":"5e709398878c28a0473ad799","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Ocłoń","uuid":"0B8FB310E7C1E202D2A7882C96A55804DA7E5821E241210BFADF32025E1208870A5B81494C7E3E16A47AF2E94385FDE4E8F092598130E5537EDD37376AFCCB51","orcidId":"0000-0002-3361-6296","documentHash":"a84fe514-74e0-45ab-b7ad-48ddd8200641"},{"objectId":"5e709396878c28a0473ad652","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Kobylarczyk","uuid":"D396B8EAF456F3DCFCA35E5D98A279EED65AA0ED70BFE1F11294EA3D16D0C9AC1ADD05F91989617E2190993618FBCACC70584ADC60356CF2185BD4CC80CA7426","orcidId":"0000-0002-3358-3762","documentHash":"ba28b3d0-7424-440f-9406-94b8883ee63e"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.enbuild.2023.112771"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-66946-32-3","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Choroby autoimmunizacyjne u dzieci","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"658d589b4097076c1457f3e0","editors":[{"objectId":"67727e7efdbe831a388132b0","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Szypowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fee3e76d-f19a-4bd3-990c-aa0251931c40"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["67727e7efdbe831a388132b0"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060257895","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d42ecc9878c286b5030d56d","mniswId":"41400","name":"Medical Tribune Polska","documentHash":"0799e0c3-2824-4c5a-a651-b85b7b476b8f"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://katalog.nukat.edu.pl/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["radio","Polskie Radio","audycja radiowa","Korczak"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":"978-83-66597-81-5","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709284878c28a047397169"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70925e878c28a04739484b"]}],"type":"BOOK","title":"Radio zmieni ciężar gatunkowy człowieka: o audycjach radiowych Starego Doktora -

Włodzimierz Kucharek a trimis sau a adus el însuși în Bucovina cărți și reviste, obiecte de devoțiune, fonduri pentru activități religioase și educaționale, a ajutat tinerii să meargă în Polonia pentru studii și tabere de vară. Din când în când se confrunta cu neplăceri din partea autorităților române pentru acest lucru, sub forma interdicției de a intra în România. Activitățile părintălui Włodzimierz Kucharek au fost importante pentru menținerea sipiritului polonez în rândul multor polonezi din Bucovina în perioada comunistă, iar corespondența pe care a lăsat-o în urmă este o bună mărturie în acest sens."},{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Przez starsze pokolenia bukowińskich Polaków postać dominikanina, księdza, ojca Włodzimierza Kucharka (1913-1990) jest wspominana ze szczególnym namaszczeniem.

(Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3a) employing mixed cultures and cell-free filtrate assays. The response variables studied were population growth and content of photosynthetic pigments: chlorophyll a (Chl a), carotenoids (Car), phycocyanin (PC), phycoerythrin (PE), and allophycocyanin (APC). Temperature was shown to be the most significant abiotic factor impacting the allelopathy of Synechococcus sp. phenotypes, with the Type 2 most significantly impacted. Irradiance also had a significant effect, having the largest effect on allelopathy of Type 3a phenotype. Changes in salinity had the greatest effect on allelopathy of Type 1. Our study has shown the significant influence of temperature, irradiance, and salinity on the strength of allelopathic compounds secreted by Synechococcus sp. phenotypes, with temperature the most significantly affecting allelopathic properties. Moreover, we discovered that the allelopathic response to changing environmental factors is highly phenotype-specific. This differential response of allelopathy could help different phenotypes of Synechococcus sp. to coexist in the water column."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060257909","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"179","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6a24fdbe831a3837bb1b","name":"Aldo","lastName":"Barreiro Felpeto","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"993940c4-a65a-449f-9f6b-7f2f2412880d"},{"objectId":"677e6a24fdbe831a3837bb1a","name":"Zofia","lastName":"Konarzewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5aaead17-ba98-4fae-af1a-ea41b1224341"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b59ad","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Śliwińska-Wilczewska","uuid":"A77991D461A5E7A6AA9B0AD0A5E43595074E96450913A0D33EE65327BB5591F2EFFEC4B8B57EB7A78138189B34C5047117C62D7D5B0953B969BD035684DD95D3","orcidId":"0000-0002-3147-6605","documentHash":"a3fd2811-c7b3-4285-8c0e-c5ef97db623e"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a04739376b","name":"Adam","lastName":"Latała","uuid":"BA32046523546DA6F898F3BFCAD25E97ABFFA8C26CC2B069EF51AB4E018262CBFCD7228B4FE921F6DDD96C01C82167544B35E113E2DBE7873655D66DE5B618C4","orcidId":"0000-0001-7241-2213","documentHash":"1429e963-11e3-49f4-a0f5-2aaa747cae53"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.marenvres.2022.105671"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["population genetics","genetic diversity","SNP","Platichthys flesus","genetic structure","microsatellite DNA"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d6878c28a04739dbac","5e70921c878c28a0473900b7"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Population genetic study on the European flounder (Platichthys flesus) from the Southern Baltic Sea using SNPs and microsatellite markers","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d57878c28514547b978","mniswId":"1154","title":"Animals","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-2615","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"cf012089-3ed8-4dde-a05c-d5b280240cb4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-24","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64b92a86409707035771ab9c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d6878c28a04739dbac","5e70921c878c28a0473900b7","677e69b1fdbe831a3837a755","677e69b1fdbe831a3837a756","677e69b1fdbe831a3837a757","677e69b1fdbe831a3837a758","677e69b1fdbe831a3837a759"]},"issue":"9","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The European flounder (Platichthys flesus), which is closely related to the recently discovered Baltic flounder (Platichthys solemdali), is currently the third most commercially fished species in the Baltic Sea. According to the available data from the Polish Fisheries Monitoring Center and fishermen’s observations, the body condition indices of the species in the Baltic Sea have declined in recent years. The aim of the present study was to obtain information on the current patterns of genetic variability and the population structure of the European flounder and to verify whether the Baltic flounder is present in the southern Baltic Sea. Moreover, we aimed to verify whether the observed decline in the body condition indices of the species in the Baltic Sea might be associated with adaptive alterations in its gene pool due to increased fishing pressure. For this purpose, 190 fish were collected from four locations along the central coastline of Poland, i.e., Mechelinki, Władysławowo, the Vistula Lagoon in 2018, and the Słupsk Bank in 2020. The fish were morphologically analyzed and then genetically screened by the application of nineteen microsatellite DNA and two diagnostic SNP markers. The examined European flounder specimens displayed a high level of genetic diversity (PIC = 0.832–0.903, I = 2.579–2.768). A lack of significant genetic differentiation (Fst = 0.004, p > 0.05) was observed in all the examined fish, indicating that the European flounder in the sampled area constitutes a single genetic cluster. A significant deficiency in heterozygotes (Fis = 0.093, p < 0.05) and overall deviations from Hardy–Weinberg expectations (H-WE) were only detected in fish sampled from the Słupsk Bank. The estimated effective population size (Ne) among the sampled fish groups varied from 712 (Słupsk Bank) to 10,115 (Władysławowo and Mechelinki). However, the recorded values of the Garza–Williamson indicator (M = 0.574–0.600) and the lack of significant (p > 0.05) differences in Heq > He under the SMM model did not support the species’ population size changes in the past. The applied SNP markers did not detect the presence of the Baltic flounder among the fish sampled from the studied area. The analysis of an association between biological traits and patterns of genetic diversity did not detect any signs of directional selection or density-dependent adaptive changes in the gene pool of the examined fish that might be caused by increased fishing pressure."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060257912","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677e69b1fdbe831a3837a759","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Szlinder-Richert","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e8bd0220-5574-4809-9807-56c57e0b7a0a"},{"objectId":"677e69b1fdbe831a3837a758","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Nadolna-Ałtyn","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c3ebaaf8-764d-4c44-9883-c93894f3f942"},{"objectId":"677e69b1fdbe831a3837a757","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Mirny","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7e376eba-7183-411f-a6f1-08e75b8bd90c"},{"objectId":"677e69b1fdbe831a3837a756","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Góra","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"36b678c4-fca8-412f-a6cd-a3aa81fc6873"},{"objectId":"677e69b1fdbe831a3837a755","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Jakubowska-Lehrmann","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6c171a31-6bac-4f70-87a3-d04b01331671"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dbac","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Kuciński","uuid":"8082BF12084EFA311EEAC3EDBC06B8A13DC07183475099C108B04FBA4F535BE0D69DA51F82BB9FD7E430BA28D20B536B2EAA7C38765EB6D1F72A7BBF6DB6B5F2","orcidId":"0000-0002-2977-7249","documentHash":"d9651377-5517-457d-8bbf-36b50a62e15e"},{"objectId":"5e70921c878c28a0473900b7","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Ocalewicz","uuid":"F13F759BB91417695FAF7EC21F8A80E6755D8461106C179130F5ABB7ED191875D4577CA8760AF3349F712D58287F3AD71C92B0A82D1C738C103BF9CA3DF4F16D","orcidId":"0000-0001-7122-7542","documentHash":"0c2abea5-ce81-4531-bbc6-dbed9fd46e78"}],"doi":"10.3390/ani13091448"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["polska giełda papierów wartościowych","warunki rynkowe","prognozy inwestycyjne"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["market conditions","Polish stock exchange","investment forecasts"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709375878c28a0473aa146"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Warunki rynkowe a krótkookresowe możliwości prognostyczne na polskiej giełdzie papierów wartościowych","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a23a","mniswId":"200416","title":"Optimum.

paper deals with modeling and solving a multi-stage stochastic inventory management problem for transport companies, including several different transport modes. This model aims to determine the amount of stored cargo and transport containers and trucks to the appropriate locations. Due to the uncertainty of environmental conditions, the demand and transfer costs parameters are considered uncertainly in different scenarios in the proposed model. Since the uncertain model is insoluble, a new robust-fuzzy-probabilistic method has been used to control the model’s parameters. As a result, the final model minimizes the total cost of maintaining cargo and transporting trucks and containers. Three genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization and gray wolf optimization have been employed to solve the proposed stochastic inventory management model. The results of the problem analysis show that the increase of uncertainty rate in different scenarios due to the increase in the amount of demand from cargo, transmission, and maintenance costs have increased. In return, the total network costs have also increased."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060257934","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"134-144","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6ce5fdbe831a3837db32","name":"Javid","lastName":"Ghahremani-Nahr","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2e5cda44-3ebd-4a9d-9c41-865dfabefd26"},{"objectId":"677e6ce5fdbe831a3837db31","name":"Hamed","lastName":"Nozari","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"770a51b6-f0ef-468e-8807-1f03420d5f7f"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398f78","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Szmelter-Jarosz","uuid":"03C7CC3328390F4AF0693E76D54A82AEF9C3617A4647273443DF20C71E5F81264A2CD5F23051DB0408C06787200C71683B27776E0DD2A2464D7603D01F14A652","orcidId":"0000-0002-6183-6114","documentHash":"d965fbfb-4980-4a86-9852-d00385844680"}],"doi":"10.1080/17509653.2022.2042747"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-8127-912-3","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092cd878c28a04739d0a4","5e7093be878c28a0473b01cb"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Warunki i czynniki rozwoju Pomorza - wybrane problemy","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":211,"publicationPlace":"Gdańsk ;

We combine unique survey data that incorporates a representative sample of Polish manufacturing companies with data on the state aid from the State Aid Data Sharing System (SUDOP). Our results confirm the positive role of R&D&I subsidies on the likelihood of applying for a patent, filing for intellectual property protection for utility models, industrial designs, trademark registrations, and the introduction of process innovations, consistent with the existing literature. However, the results also indicate an insignificant impact of the intervention on firms’ R&D expenditures and product innovations. The extension of the analysis with the moderating effects of internal factors that affect the firms’ innovative behavior indicates that the R&D&I subsidies for exporters lead to the crowding-out effect and for non-exporters generate additional R&D expenditures and increase the propensity for R&D cooperation. Furthermore, R&D&I support for enterprises with foreign ownership reduces their propensity for patent applications and product innovations. In contrast, for beneficiaries with a predominance of domestic capital, it positively impacts many output variables."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060257952","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"3792-3823","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093d8878c28a0473b1d0b","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Tomaszewski","uuid":"1D40880D6B25D7DB01E8F42DF4027380723965E19C322726921C4A88281E8A264BA65B70A9BDEDE04D3BA57CA04262E305FED06160A4E7C793294CA6EAD1FBF0","orcidId":"0000-0002-9952-5346","documentHash":"c47a5fb5-c788-48fc-ae41-678204f9e2d3"},{"objectId":"5e7092b3878c28a04739af1d","name":"Adriana","lastName":"Zabłocka-Abi

War is often described as an autonomous and inhuman force depriving man of subjectivity and agency. On the other hand, the literature analyzed in the article, mainly non-fictional, often focuses on saving individuality through the description of individual stories.

The results were then correlated with Greenland ice-core stratigraphic units\nreflecting global environmental changes in the Late Pleniglacial and Lateglacial interstadial, thus ranging\nfrom GS-2.1a, through the GI-1 complex (seven subunits), to GS-1. Studies revealed considerable\nsensitivity of fluvio-aeolian succession to climate changes and oscillations. Climate ameliorations are\nrecorded in fossil soil horizons developed beneath different types of vegetation cover. We detected that\nthe climate cooling GI-1d (the Older Dryas) was not the main phase of dune formation as had been\nclaimed earlier. It is postulated that dunes in the extraglacial zone were formed mainly in GI-1c2 (the\nEarly Allerød).

This paper aims to put a new perspective on the handheld gamma-ray spectrometry method, concentrated on application to the glaciogenic depositional systems in contemporary exposures. The study was held in northern and central Poland within the limit of successive Fennoscandian Ice Sheets (FIS) advances and retreats. Fifteen profiles comprising sediments deposited in typical Pleistocene environments were subjected to handheld GRS measurements. The study indicated vertical, lateral, and lithofacies variability of results and revealed the potential for determining particular sedimentary palaeoenvironments with handheld GRS. Aeolian deposits showed the lowest concentration of K, U, and Th radionuclides. Relatively low radioactivity was revealed for fluvioglacial and fluvial deposits. Notable radionuclide concentrations were indicated for glaciogenic and subaqueous fan deposits, while the highest radioactivity was found in lacustrine and loess successions. K, U, and Th concentrations also indicated weathering processes and soil profile development within glacial tills."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060257975","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"140","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2022.105679","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6a39fdbe831a3837be54","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Petera-Zganiacz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f9da8fa9-dbdb-4954-827a-09086c8c3b4b"},{"objectId":"677e6a39fdbe831a3837be53","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Mroczek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b62ef88d-097e-4996-8b80-4ea972575f84"},{"objectId":"677e6a39fdbe831a3837be52","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Elwirski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"598ad095-2ab2-4e0a-9cc8-f316b2c3b74e"},{"objectId":"677e6a39fdbe831a3837be51","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Dzieduszyńska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"83b867e9-f777-4f45-a036-321a21e28830"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7dc8","name":"Karol","lastName":"Tylmann","uuid":"87A718DD2A4C2C15FE1B57ED9D2EE3AB39CB6CFB099D60E88CFA18C1BCB545B68D89A40827CA1EF23AEC95D1C20CB68B83ACC9CCF1446FBE11DFF610F7A49EC1","orcidId":"0000-0002-0928-990X","documentHash":"f5d7a91a-e861-4656-bc7b-ea847347a851"},{"objectId":"5e709392878c28a0473ad1b3","name":"Damian","lastName":"Moskalewicz","uuid":"E5D5F8A4BB0A5F94B48DFF1D2279331FB26CE3F3F96B0F73AF095E2CA5AC3CBC89626F58F1EF0C19622841F3BE5A8410F1F29915C8391FD436EB7B63B67783F1","orcidId":"0000-0002-3248-1860","documentHash":"ae3c23cb-65de-41d2-a016-e18a6f77f017"},{"objectId":"5e7092cd878c28a04739d0a5","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Woźniak","uuid":"DCBC7EC633DC2F33BD4CD3B72E04AA1A52E7D35E2917BB483E520C50C40E263D33952AC4ADF6FA1E896D55D0E248CB96BD44061F30D3C7267651C20FF1AAE280","orcidId":"0000-0002-1316-7737","documentHash":"92f3b5e8-8245-49e0-9ae2-3e7d786eaf12"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2022.105679"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Bezpieczeństwo ludzkie","Młodzież","Internauci","Cyberbezpieczeństwo","Bezpieczeństwo osobiste","Bezpieczeństwo narodowe","Ochrona prawna","Sieć teleinformatyczna","Bezpieczeństwo systemów"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-83-8263-523-2","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","uid":"bABmAiyO82JgMB2LqzOepAg","uuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","parentUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","rootUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","name":"Akademia Sztuki Wojennej","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62b67329752340195a38cb6f","5e709481878c28a0473be9e2","5e709285878c28a0473973e3"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Działania z wykorzystaniem cyberprzestrzeni.

Excessive development can be problematic to human health as well as reduce the sustainability of natural resources. At present, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the whole world and adversely has impacted a broad range of human activities, including the economy, agriculture, tourism, and transportation. The excessive increase from globalization, unplanned urbanization, and the destruction of nature (i.e., due to ongoing human activity) have been partially to blame for the current state of the planet. The human population has tripled over the last 70 years. In addition, existing agricultural areas of the world yield lower rates-especially in underdeveloped or developing countries. Moreover, climate change has affected agricultural areas and caused a shrinkage in production patterns. As a result, an increasing population has decreased access to their cultural foods, leaving them with few options, and these unhealthy dietary options frame detrimental long-term concerns. As a result, the human-nature relationship must be considered and decisions made. In sensitive areas, especially in mountainous regions, tropical forests, deserts, and glaciers, human habitation and human and economic activity should be limited. In this chapter, natural and human dynamics are examined by analyzing current changes and future population trends in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A critical question that should be asked is what can be done regarding environmental sustainability during the crisis and what lessons will be learnt to best apply them in a post-COVID-19

This type of uncontrolled, unexpected, and multifaceted event: political (procedural and administrative), biological (coronavirus inflicted deaths) and cultural (normative), has never before been experienced by the contemporary generation of professionally active academic teachers. As we assume in the presented research findings, two years of a global lockdown and the implementation of regulations which have had a destabilizing effect, must have affected the dynamics of identity shifts experienced by this professional community.

Recent reports from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea and local fishermen, however, indicate a noticeable decline in the fitness of the species and catch volume in the Baltic Sea over the last decade. As the alimentary tract is one of the major entry routes for toxicants and parasites, and since any disturbances in its functioning are directly responsible for harmful changes in the health and welfare of the fish, a diachronic examination of the digestive tract of the European flounder sampled from the Slupsk Bank was carried out in order to determine possible factors behind the observed detrimental changes in its success in the Baltic Sea. The results obtained revealed a serious Glugea stephani infection and the presence of microsporidiosis in the fish studied (a prevalence of 41.9 % and a mean infection intensity of 9.15 xenomas per fish) considerably higher than those previously reported in less polluted regions studied across Atlantic and Pacific. This may suggest the influence of factors conducive to improving the success rate of the invading parasite, such as an increased level of environmental pollution and oxygen deficiency on the sea bottom, both of which contribute to a greater density of fish in a limited area. Our study indicates the need for comprehensive parasitological investigation of the European flounder in the Baltic Sea, in order to study microsporidiosis and the level of parasitic infection detected in histopathological and molecular analyses, including metacercariae of Zoogonoidae, nematodes of Cucullanidae, Anisakidaea and Parafilaroides normani. This study detected Parafilaroides normani, hitherto unknown in Europe, with a probability of 91.41

present paper reports the distribution of Epistylididae (Sessilida) epibiotic ciliates on the signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus in relation to specialized structures of the host's exoskeleton for the first time. This species is known to maintain a relatively clean carapace, but it is sometimes overgrown by other organisms. Epibionts cover different parts of the signal crayfish body, mainly antennae, antennules, maxillipedes III and pereiopods with inner edges of chelae; however, some parts of the signal crayfish are not fouled. e.g. dorsal surfaces of the carapace and dorsal surfaces of chelae. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), topographies of different parts of the crayfish's exoskeleton were examined. Our investigations revealed that the epibiosis in the signal crayfish was determined by morphology of body surfaces. No epibionts were found on smooth surfaces with regular single setae (a known design that prevents fouling in aquatic environments). The dimpled surfaces with regular single micro-papillae may be considered as a newly described example of self-cleaning surfaces. Bio-inspired surface patterning presents promising approaches to the design of novel functional surfaces that can prevent biofouling. The new self-cleaning design may be used in further technological applications."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060258034","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"316","pagesFromTo":"282-295","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1111/jzo.12953","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6a17fdbe831a3837b95e","name":"J.","lastName":"Karczewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3db8bcac-d4b1-44d3-982d-294fb61a5317"},{"objectId":"5e70949c878c28a0473c05f6","name":"Aldona","lastName":"Dobrzycka-Krahel","uuid":"F90E143BD8BDF4BCEBCA7C8C22BCB054B5ACCC1DBFB2E02575A336FED7C9495856E0BBFC37E261FD51408715ACCA49DBD9D4AB94EF52387C96D97CB064E57826","orcidId":"0000-0002-4252-895X","documentHash":"d4334891-fb7e-4da6-9ede-5af98be24bfe"},{"objectId":"5e70932e878c28a0473a4761","name":"Michał","lastName":"Skóra","uuid":"80DC404D6569B54E728A7977E258477060F74237D46CC319F2CB9FBFD1F167F8DDED41A82B2C17EAED1AA72CC089670663985AAC7DE24D452D18646AED8BE6D3","orcidId":"0000-0002-9121-1318","documentHash":"25b6d3b3-cfd8-45e7-ac47-9dbbc290660b"},{"objectId":"5e709262878c28a047394c73","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Rolbiecki","uuid":"00A8367BFCAC18C8C6A1994DF97A2153B7C7D3628DAF2E623B48906AB28173840506A70851A77CCE27F60BC3A27A0375AED781F6C439E36450C817FA35BB9EBF","orcidId":"0000-0002-0178-3452","documentHash":"cf935ca3-509c-4abf-a1d4-ec84206c6f23"}],"doi":"10.1111/jzo.12953"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["dyscyplina badawcza","administracja publiczna","nauki o polityce"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["political science","public administration","scientific discipline"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929f878c28a04739955d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Administracja publiczna jako przedmiot badań politologicznych","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a51e","mniswId":"496806","title":"Studia Iuridica","doi":null,"issn":"0137-4346","eissn":"2544-3135","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"d2eb9105-315f-4e95-891c-bb37bbe7b042"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-22","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"642b3169409707382b019305","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929f878c28a04739955d"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article discusses premises for distinguishing scientific disciplines and their relationship to their object of research. The main thesis is related to the claim that currently, the disciplinary status of public administration research is a result of political decision rather than of the subject matter specificity and methodological consistency of the research problems. This is primarily influenced by the fragmented and hybrid nature of public administration issues. Next, arguments are presented for the separation of public administration from the political science perspective. Arguments justifying the close relationship between the problems of administration and political science are also offered. The focus is on an attempt to answer the questions whether administration only implements policy or also creates its value and goals, and why administration can be considered an integral part of the political sphere of social life. In this context, the conditions for capturing administration as part of politics and politicization of public administration are presented."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060258037","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"92","pagesFromTo":"14-29","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a04739955d","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Nocoń","uuid":"1A2C5AE454A6FB9882230D8989F3DD21E50463E29F4F1CCEFF68780A8AB5D54CC55E4AAC2C4D91F2FFDAA4F75DD5EAC9E9743AC97BA442FF8E6EB39D5077D4E6","orcidId":"0000-0002-1202-7580","documentHash":"7c01aff6-b34c-490c-a1bd-7688fed5cef3"}],"doi":"10.31338/2544-3135.si.2022-92.1"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["dyspozytyw","profil dzieciństwa","liberalizm","konserwatyzm"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["liberalism","dispositive","conservatism","childhood profile"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924f878c28a047393820"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Konserwatywne i liberalne profilowanie dzieciństwa w perspektywie dyspozytywu praktyk edukacyjnych","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d51878c285145479d3d","mniswId":"200014","title":"Colloquium","doi":null,"issn":"2081-3813","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"7464a4cd-72dd-4f61-8c32-374249211564"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-11-15","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6576d1214097071b8efb1d41","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924f878c28a047393820"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Celem analizy jest zrekonstruowaniu konserwatywnego i liberalnego profilu dzieciństwa, by następnie przyjrzeć się im z perspektywy Foucaultowskiej kategorii dyspozytywu.

Wynika to z jego przydatności w rozwiązywaniu konfliktów przestrzennych i zapewniania sustensywnego użytkowania obszarów morskich. Ustawodawstwo, takie jak unijna dyrektywa MSP 2014/89/ czy brytyjska ustawa Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 wymaga ją aby sąsiadujące plany zagospodarowania przestrzennego obszarów morskich były spójne i skoordynowane w celu rozwiązania problemów transgranicznych. Jednak realizacja tego wymogu jest złożona i nie zawsze zadowalająca. Wynika to z różnych powodów takich jak skomplikowane procesy administracyjne, procedury fiskalne i legislacyjne po obu stronach granicy. Przedmiotowe badanie wskazuje, że transgraniczne morskie planowanie przestrzenne stanowi wyzwanie szczególnie w obszarach, które w toku ich rozwoju i w wyniku zaszłości historycznych zostały podzielone przez granice nie uznawane przez sąsiadujące ze sobą kraje. To z kolei skutecznie ogranicza realizację Celów Zrównoważonego Rozwoju ONZ. Dwa regiony z kwestionowanymi granicami morskimi stanowią studium przypadku i przedmiot analiz porównawczych w tym artykule. Są to obszary morskie Niemiec i Polska oraz wyspa Irlandia podzielona granicami morskimi i lądowymi. Do analizy problemów transgranicznych wykorzystano teoretyczne ramy ewaluacyjne, \"Koło integracji i Adaptacja\". Służą one do określenia wyzwań związanych z transgranicznymi morskim planowaniem przestrzennym. Badanie obejmowało przegląd dokumentów planistycznych, polityk i ustawodawstwa. Przeprowadzono też wywiady z ekspertami i decydentami. W toku badania zostały zidentyfikowane następujące wyzwania: m.in. syndrom peryferyjności, przeciążenie schematycznymi działaniami, ograniczona przejrzystość i sprawiedliwość przestrzenna, wymóg konsultacji dyplomatycznych i różnice w filozofii planowania.

Legislation such as the EU MSP Directive 2014/89/EU and the UK Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 requires that neighbouring marine spatial plans are coherent and coordinated to address cross-border issues. However, the implementation of MSP in cross-border areas is complex due to different administrative processes, fiscal and legislative procedures. This study argues that cross-border MSP is challenging in areas that are faced with historically contested borders which limit effective delivery of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Two contested case study regions: Germany, Poland and the island of Ireland are compared. To help understand contemporary issues, a bespoke theoretical evaluative framework, the 'Wheel of Integration and Adaptation' is used to identify the challenges of cross-border MSP. An in-depth review of planning documents, policies, legislation was undertaken alongside interviews. This demonstrated that in contested areas, cross-border MSP must contend with the following challenges: 'inter alia' geographical peripheries syndrome, schema overload, limited transparency and blue justice, diplomatic consultation processes and differences in planning philosophies. This paper concludes by presenting five interventions as steps toward advancing cross-border MSP."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060258050","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"31","pagesFromTo":"2446-2469","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6cb9fdbe831a3837d653","name":"Linda","lastName":"McElduff","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b0c3d015-5bd5-4050-8cd2-a1a5c0d8eb46"},{"objectId":"677e6cb9fdbe831a3837d652","name":"Kira","lastName":"Gee","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6236ed1e-0223-41a6-9927-ef1289fcee54"},{"objectId":"677e6cb9fdbe831a3837d651","name":"Heather","lastName":"Ritchie","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"35253ff0-0fc6-48dd-8baa-01dabaf28247"},{"objectId":"677e6cb9fdbe831a3837d650","name":"Joseph Onwona","lastName":"Ansong","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e7b7e86b-e56e-4b65-a1db-64397f7b8830"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a0473939ec","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Zaucha","uuid":"35D939D0FA2B007136D445D70622F8697AFE2E761745DE4527067C10759891801002A85D3E57A0F30568FB3D4E197FB0CE8415E721BA1E666AA2B50C2BA286A5","orcidId":"0000-0002-3280-3241","documentHash":"f9900cfb-1cb8-48f3-9380-2c91d89dcabf"}],"doi":"10.1080/09654313.2022.2154597"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["optimism","openness","cultural differences","isolation","quarantine","pandemic"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942f878c28a0473b7c02","5e70924f878c28a04739375b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Self-assessed personality traits and adherence to the COVID-19 lockdown","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","doi":null,"issn":"1661-7827","eissn":"1660-4601","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e236e16e-7430-4ac3-800c-033637860e22"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63b2b1f64097074fedfe66fe","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5ebedefc752340254fc42ce7","5e70942f878c28a0473b7c02","5e70924f878c28a04739375b","677e5d09fdbe831a38376607","677e5d09fdbe831a38376608","677e5d09fdbe831a38376609","677e5d09fdbe831a3837660a","677e5d09fdbe831a3837660b","677e5d09fdbe831a3837660c","677e5d09fdbe831a3837660d","677e5d09fdbe831a3837660e"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, has forced all countries affected by it to introduce quarantine and isolation to prevent the spread of the virus, as well as masking and distancing. Not everyone is equally willing to follow the rules related to limit the extent of the coronavirus epidemic. This might be connected with personality traits, especially openness, positive attitude, and optimism. Materials and Methods: An online survey was created and completed by participants in April–May 2020. Self-assessment of personality traits and adherence to lockdown recommendations were assessed. A total of 7404 participants took part in the study, mainly from Poland (83.6%) and Italy (12.7%). Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was performed. Results: The participants were divided into groups depending on the degree of compliance with the lockdown rules. In the multivariate analysis, variables that increased the odds for stricter lockdown compliance were temporary work suspension OR 1.27 (95% CI 1.10–1.48), income level “we can’t handle this situation” OR 1.67 (95%CI 1.20–2.33), and junior high school education OR 1.68 (95% CI 1.13–2.50). Other significant factors included age and place of residence. Each point of self-assessed sociability OR 1.07 (95% CI 1.00–1.13) also increased the likelihood of adhering to lockdown rules. Conclusions: Taking the basic demographic characteristics as well as working and health environment conditions traits into account may be helpful when forecasting epidemiological compliance during a pandemic, as well as in other public health tasks.

This is also cvident in the sejmiks and in the relations of provincial elites with the magnates. The position of the magnate families after the Bar Confederation and the First Partition weakened, which Stanisław Augustus took good advantage of to build his party, at the expense of the magnates themselves. Tois mechanism can be seen in the Minsk province, although init the influence of the Radziwills was strong all the time, except that the most important of them, Karol Stanisław, after his return from the \"post-Bar confederacy\" emigration, began to cooperate with the king. As a result, most of the elections of officials and the election of deputies and deputies in Minsk were carried out in agreement between K.S. Radziwill, Antoni Tyzenhauz, Joachim Chreptowicz and the ]ocal elite represented by the Bykowskis, the Chmars, the Proszynskis, the Świętorzeckis, the Wolodkowiczes or the Zawiszas. With regard to them, K.S. Radziwill behaved with detachment, adequately supporting mem bers of these families in applying for functions or offices, bowever he was flexible in this, able to give up hiscandidate. In any case, he did not risk much, as kindness was shown to him by almost everyone. Supported himself by Jozef Mikolaj Radziwill, Voivode of Minsk, and Hieronim Wincenty Radziwill, Starost of Minsk, he maintained a balance among the ambitious families of Minsk. Attempts to involve representatives of other wealthy families: the Sapiehas, the Przezdzieckis or the Brzostowskis, werc limited to isolated actions related to putting forward their candidates for parliamentary, deputy or electoral offices. The power of the middle nobility is also evident in Minsk. It was, nex t to the Radziwills and the royal party, the third force, increasingly independent, although most of the local elitc accepted the direction of reforms proposed by Stanisław Augustus, which also did not mean that they bad their particular interests in mind all the time, and the Minsk sejmiks were usually very rational in their decisions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060258066","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"421-456","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://opus.us.edu.pl/info/article/USL26838684a1f041f7a7ee92cc039a50f0/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092eb878c28a04739f38b","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Rolnik","uuid":"78FB7A2A0B953D0954743B4CFA0C5314F52FD3856C1C2C6930480C380A2DD11A70B1A3D36F052641BCE77B2B7BA3FD829926A640D616AE54327707A0B458DE41","orcidId":"0000-0002-7649-3142","documentHash":"8b18eff3-bc29-4132-8f77-c0b5048f7a10"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["old-growth forest","ancient agriculture","field systems","soil erosion and transformation","geoarchaeology","multi-proxy soil studies"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709373878c28a0473aa006"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de95","uid":"bJjSI9Xh5XWd377BL7x5oLA","uuid":"d1b51967-3814-49e3-a522-d20d8eb32d9a","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de95","parentUuid":"d1b51967-3814-49e3-a522-d20d8eb32d9a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de95","rootUuid":"d1b51967-3814-49e3-a522-d20d8eb32d9a","name":"Instytut Archeologii i Etnologii Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ac878c28a0473aee1a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Evidence of prehistoric and early medieval agriculture and its impact on soil and land relief transformation in the Białowieża  natural forest (NE Poland)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477df1","mniswId":"7069","title":"Geoderma","doi":null,"issn":"0016-7061","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"87eb10d2-59ff-4599-ade6-7b84c90f71fd"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61d2daea2467f0718b094a9d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709373878c28a0473aa006","677cff35fdbe831a382bf3d6","677cff35fdbe831a382bf3d7","677cff35fdbe831a382bf3d8","5e7093ac878c28a0473aee1a","677cff35fdbe831a382bf3da","677cff35fdbe831a382bf3db","677cff35fdbe831a382bf3dc"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Białowieza ˙ Forest is one of the few relics of temperate, old-growth woodlands in Europe considered “natural”. Recent research revealed there the presence of numerous anthropogenic landforms associated with prehistoric, medieval and modern-era human activities. They include systems of rectangular plots separated by\r\nembankments – linear forms up to several dozen centimetres high, well distinctive in airborne laser scanning\r\nvisualizations but relatively poorly visible in the landscape. The field system at the archaeological site of Postołowo, located on a gentle slope currently entirely covered by a mixed forest (Carpinion betuli dominant), was\r\nselected for detailed study. The soils of the former arable fields and field boundary embankments were investigated using a multi-proxy approach, including analyses of soil micromorphology, soil physical and chemical\r\nproperties, as well as sedimentological, archaeological, plant macro-remains and phytolith studies and radiocarbon dating. The objectives were to assess the impact of suspected past agriculture on soils and land relief and\r\nto establish a chronology of land use. Evidence of ancient vegetation clearance by burning was confirmed and\r\ntwo distinct episodes of cereal cultivation (including rye), without intensive manuring were dated in the Roman\r\nPeriod (ca 2nd century AD) and in the Early Middle Ages (ca 10th century AD). In the latter case, agriculture\r\ntriggered soil erosion that led to accumulation of slope deposits; at least some of the field banks accumulated\r\nand/or were constructed during this period. Altogether, past agriculture resulted in spatial differentiation of soil\r\nmorphology: with Brunic Arenosols in the upper parts of the slope and Brunic Umbrisols downslope. It is hypothesized that ancient cultivation in the Białowieza ˙ Forest evidenced by the remains of field systems, was\r\nlimited to relatively short chronological periods and was restricted to certain land patches (microregions) surrounded by unused, forested terrain."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060258068","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"410","pagesFromTo":"1-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677cff35fdbe831a382bf3dc","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Urbańczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"95bc9197-f8f9-4f8a-963b-7fc4448a6c01"},{"objectId":"677cff35fdbe831a382bf3db","name":"Alexandra","lastName":"Golyeva","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c1fa7e7-372b-4799-8026-f47f5b808991"},{"objectId":"677cff35fdbe831a382bf3da","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Skrzyński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"06b27438-569a-417b-aa0a-72b703c90c08"},{"objectId":"677cff35fdbe831a382bf3d8","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kittel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9559ff31-1303-4aa9-8f8a-607bc8c9d9bc"},{"objectId":"677cff35fdbe831a382bf3d7","name":"Bogusława","lastName":"Kruczkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c9971cab-3968-412c-ab8a-6e9d38727357"},{"objectId":"677cff35fdbe831a382bf3d6","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Krupski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"61abde3d-e79c-43b3-a206-0bbc8a506476"},{"objectId":"5e7093ac878c28a0473aee1a","name":"Michał","lastName":"Jakubczak","uuid":"958150EDFB77D0426518731D50C5709D261A83C7A7F900B48A36CD254DD1A6EED08F0DD8841DC254668F837ABA05344CAF7070880AF5F40C2B69BE0AC8A4FD3F","orcidId":"0000-0002-1655-7124","documentHash":"36c699e4-e710-4c6c-9c61-ecd92cb6e0f7"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473aa006","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Niedziółka","uuid":"692EBF7F4C449183A1BF95D5BB09DBEA8BD1CE364A5B64B647D284FDAAFCEDEE5E9A0F9925204D54BCA0C8A4464302263826CF79ECE67495B463468D3569DD72","orcidId":"0000-0001-7368-1167","documentHash":"f6e7b3f5-7a55-4c5e-8186-1689adc3c5cc"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115668"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Dyslipidemia","Cardiovascular prevention","Cardiovascular diseases","Statins","Statin intolerance"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"677d44a6fdbe831a382ee279","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-26681-2","title":"Lipoproteins in Diabetes Mellitus","year":2023,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-3-031-26681-2","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-26681-2","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"409529ac-2616-4e6b-967a-ad8e4dd59718","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Statin Intolerance: An Overview for Clinicians","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"677d461ffdbe831a382ee35f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["677d461ffdbe831a382ee360","5e709466878c28a0473bc4b1","677d461ffdbe831a382ee361","677d461ffdbe831a382ee362"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Lipid disorders are the most common risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

Some patients may also suffer statin-associated side effects, in most of the cases statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMSs). The recent data show that the statin intolerance (SI) affects 9.1% of statin users, and, when defined with the approved definitions, even less than 7%. The International Lipid Expert Panel (ILEP) 2015 and 2022 recommendations can be very useful in the management of SI patients. The management of statin intolerance has also been carefully discussed in the Polish guidelines 2021 on diagnosis and management of lipid disorders. Additionally, in the management of statin intolerance, the ILEP position paper on the statin therapy in athletes and patients performing regular exercises can be used. Every effort should be made to disseminate truthful information about statins and to increase patients’ awareness of the benefits of compliance with medical recommendations.

Jednym z problemów jest rozwój systemów telemedycznych. Celem badawczym artykułu jest identyfikacja (na podstawie przytoczonych przypadków) behawioralnych czynników warunkujących wdrożenie tych systemów i mających swoje źródło w postawach interesariuszy.\r\nMetodologia: Badanie opiera się na przeglądzie literatury na temat telemedycyny, a przede wszystkim wdrażania tych rozwiązań w praktyce podmiotów ochrony zdrowia. Ważnym elementem opracowania jest przedstawienie konkretnych przypadków, w których pojawiły się problemy z wdrażaniem rozwiązań telemedycznych.\r\nWynik: W procesie wdrażania rozwiązań telemedycznych w placówkach ochrony zdrowia można zauważyć wiele różnych problemów, które są spowodowane czynnikami behawioralnymi. Te czynniki są związane z praktycznie wszystkimi rodzajami interesariuszy skupionych wokół systemu opieki zdrowotnej. Czynniki behawioralne nie są jedynymi, które wpływają na ostateczny sukces wprowadzenia\r\nrozwiązań telemedycznych o różnym stopniu zaawansowania technicznego w systemie opieki zdrowotnej, ale są na tyle istotne, że powinny być brane pod uwagę w procesach decyzyjnych podmiotów działających w ochronie zdrowia.\r\nImplikacje społeczne: Skutki społeczne rozważań zawartych w tym artykule mogą przejawiać się w poprawie jakości świadczeń zdrowotnych poprzez uwzględnienie czynników behawioralnych stanowiących bariery, ale także stymulatory rozwoju.\r\nOkazują się one bowiem istotne dla poszczególnych interesariuszy systemu ochrony zdrowia.\r\nOryginalność/wartość: Znaczenie tego artykułu opiera się na fakcie, że istnieje stosunkowo niewiele badań poruszających kwestie behawioralne w literaturze dotyczącej telemedycyny.

One of the problems is the development of telemedicine systems. The research objective of the article is to identify (on the basis of the cited cases) behavioural factors that are a condition the implementation of these systems and have their source in the attitudes of stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on a review of the literature on telemedicine, and mainly the implementation of these solutions in the practise of healthcare entities. An important element of the study is the presentation of specific cases in which problems with the implementation of telemedicine solutions have emerged.\r\nFindings: In the process of implementing telemedicine solutions in healthcare facilities, many different problems can be noticed, which are caused by behavioural factors. These factors are associated with virtually all types of stakeholders focused around the healthcare system.\r\nThe behavioural factors are not the only ones that weight on the final success of introducing telemedicine solutions of varying technical advancement to the healthcare system, but they are so important that they should be taken into account in the decision-making processes of entities operating in healthcare. Social implications: The social impact of the considerations made in this article may be manifested in improving the quality of healthcare services and, by taking into account behavioural factors that constitute barriers to development, but also stimulants of development, turn out to be important for individual stakeholders of the healthcare system. Originality/value: The importance of this article is based on the fact that there are relatively few studies raising behavioural issues in the literature on telemedicine. The recipients of this type of article are decision-makers who should take into account behavioural factors in their\r\nstrategies for the development of healthcare facilities and practical activities."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060258082","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"263-275","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://managementpapers.polsl.pl/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/167-Majecka.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709251878c28a0473939b2","name":"Beata","lastName":"Majecka","uuid":"73DBD2A28B252C30DC5E7BAC269C636157FE2C2A435C9DA2DF8F21A084D6B958EEA4A9E11AE1DF6D52C931C0A2D1DE1DCE64E72553D4B61E078A7607287218DE","orcidId":"0000-0003-4978-9244","documentHash":"a6f439a9-54cf-436b-b27c-74fe6effd08c"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["security","system","Poland","threats","state"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709211878c28a04738f73c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Critical assessment of the operation of the state security systems in Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e712b0946e0fb0001c28e80","mniswId":null,"title":"Revista Română de Geografie Politică / Universitatea din Oradea.

To carry out the research, monographic methods, qualitative content analysis and comparative analysis were used. The work indicates that a number of security threats occurring in the country were analyzed. Among those causing the greatest problems, and at the same time neglected, are social threats related to demographic problems. Economic threats related to the current financial situation and threats resulting from poor protection of cyberspace. It was pointed out that, despite the existence of appropriate systems to counteract the threat, there is a lack of it. The repeatability of events constituting a threat and the lack of implementation of real actions that prevent threats were emphasized."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060258097","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"74-81","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.30892/rrgp.242105-360","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709211878c28a04738f73c","name":"Jan","lastName":"Wentd","uuid":"41511C21B34DA7EEB4AAB21095F3D824F56F4C0A9B53313D2D2E404C7B955274C07BA5BAE41084F83749B2795471FAE7C989D46C4B2D2CF7F2CC96BB57956F33","orcidId":"0000-0003-1712-4926","documentHash":"42c45231-7e44-44d2-a98e-1ac59ba5037b"}],"doi":"10.30892/rrgp.242105-360"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bioaccumulation","depuration","ecotoxicology of mussels","norfluoxetine"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["677e69a7fdbe831a3837a5ee","5e70924f878c28a047393774","602dfd9f9543c7410626e9cb","5e70924f878c28a047393773","5e7093d1878c28a0473b1443"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Persistence of norfluoxetine in marine mussels","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d73","mniswId":"13923","title":"Marine Pollution Bulletin","doi":null,"issn":"0025-326X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"4da78be2-a8fc-4c7c-8770-04b5572174f2"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-05-21","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65749e2d4097071b8ee9456d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70924f878c28a047393773","5e70924f878c28a047393774","602dfd9f9543c7410626e9cb","5e7093d1878c28a0473b1443","677e69a7fdbe831a3837a5ec","677e69a7fdbe831a3837a5ed","677e69a7fdbe831a3837a5ee"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The concentration of pharmaceuticals in coastal waters is tending towards increasing due to a shift of the human population into coastal zones. In parallel, the number of prescriptions of antidepressants, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), is constantly growing. Most of the SSRI is metabolised into active compounds; for instance, norfluoxetine (NFLU) is the main active metabolite of fluoxetine. In this study, we tested the bioaccumulation and depuration of NFLU in Mytilus trossulus at two environmentally relevant concentrations (100 and 500 ng/L, after six days of exposure and five days of depuration at 10 °C). The concentration of NFLU in the mussels' tissue seems not to be directly proportional to the exposure concentration. The levels of NFLU in the mussels' tissues after the depuration period were comparable to the levels detected at the end of exposure. This indicates that NFLU is not efficiently removed by the mussels and points to a potential risk for consumers of such marine organisms."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060258099","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"197","pagesFromTo":"1-7","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677e69a7fdbe831a3837a5ee","name":"Neil","lastName":"Dube","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2120f2a9-8bd1-4927-9664-3317d075fc2e"},{"objectId":"677e69a7fdbe831a3837a5ed","name":"Anna","lastName":"Roszkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"148664de-303f-489d-ada2-c62d9ed345b6"},{"objectId":"677e69a7fdbe831a3837a5ec","name":"Anna","lastName":"Hallmann","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5023ef7d-cc65-42ab-8290-649e1d372526"},{"objectId":"602dfd9f9543c7410626e9cb","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Świeżak ","uuid":"83B5D696F3567972EE2D94E9203F73786C29135AAE9496F6D239250DB57F9BBD4D6BCCC6CCEF70AC1C6C1CDBB39848AE398BE0AD851A4527F313F17265BD613A","orcidId":"0000-0003-3440-9712","documentHash":"9fb7d29f-4e80-4cf2-9d94-9fe3d38c13cb"},{"objectId":"5e7093d1878c28a0473b1443","name":"Magda","lastName":"Caban","uuid":"3A4AA2A083920B5A2B0B1ADA5F526E06D289257CFBF3DB65EB5F3402846AA1FB23F52D1FCB67013DA7696139A79349244CAAA9984E81DD447145F3B9D20E53BA","orcidId":"0000-0002-8040-5862","documentHash":"4b533442-142a-47f7-ba96-547e1c3f7fff"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a047393774","name":"Adam","lastName":"Sokołowski","uuid":"A8DF78223D6931F3A1488AD4CA2DD71EB576109EF1E4A6E28D46AD9FD41D849B6AE4A66B0A063CE1E11FB58DE256E50829B83C64559A5AE53AFFAE38111120B3","orcidId":"0000-0002-7551-3199","documentHash":"f352609d-eee6-479b-b503-7e977d3e76e8"},{"objectId":"5e70924f878c28a047393773","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Smolarz","uuid":"FAFBE1DB3E550BCFCD28B9112F3A5A8A7A096960903BD9E70545D3A08E960F4158D55DF9D658547E01DC6860584193F9391DDEC6C30F867D8744499264FCD5C0","orcidId":"0000-0002-0205-7268","documentHash":"89db49f3-eb06-4800-91c7-309dd5dc91c4"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.marpolbul.2023.115763"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["district heating network","heat losses","heat transfer"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Mathematical modelling and model validation of the heat losses in district heating networks","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aaa","mniswId":"5674","title":"Energy","doi":null,"issn":"0360-5442","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"5efe7279-fbec-44a7-b198-81752a315a50"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63df81df4097075f568bc1be","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709425878c28a0473b71ab","5e70939a878c28a0473ad8ac","677e6d74fdbe831a3837ec9f","5e709398878c28a0473ad799","677e6d74fdbe831a3837eca0","677e6d74fdbe831a3837eca1"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Today the most popular system of district heating systems is based on pre-insulated pipes arranged in parallel or twin-pipe configuration. One of the greatest difficulties with heat distribution through pipelines is thermal loss from the distribution. The most efficient solution to that problem is optimizing the insulation wall thickness layer according to the pipe diameter. Heat losses should be minimized at a relatively low investment cost to find the most suitable insulation thickness economically. Numerous studies focus on analytical (1D model) calculations and numerical simulations. However, there is a research gap related to laboratory devices that allow measuring the operation parameters (fluid flow, the temperature of the fluid in the supply pipe and the return pipe). This paper presents an analysis of the heat losses from pre-insulated pipes and twin pipes in the heating system network. This study compares the heat losses in the ground calculated by analytical solution (1D model) with the measurements on the dedicated experimental setup. The calculations have been made for several heating network pipe variants: twin pipes: DN40, DN50, DN65, and their counterparts in a single parallel pre-insulated system. The insulation thickness used in all cases is 30.85 mm for DN40 and 32.00 mm for DN50 and DN65. The insulation is made of rigid polyurethane foam that meets the requirements of the PN-EN 253 standard. During the investigation, the thermal conductivity of insulation material is examined. The obtained thermal conductivity results are used in the calculations. The results from laboratory devices and analytical models have been compared, demonstrating good agreement – with a low error level in the range of approximately 8%, depending on the type of district heating pipe. The validated mathematical model of the heating network is then used to calculate the heat losses in a heating network connecting an underground storage tank with a ground source heat pump. The economic analysis shows that after 5 y, a return on investment is expected when comparing twin-pipe systems and single-pipe pre-insulated heating networks."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060258101","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"267","pagesFromTo":"[1-14]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544222033461","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677e6d74fdbe831a3837eca1","name":"Jiří Jaromír","lastName":"Klemeš","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cf893f99-4a4c-4f12-a2b8-3fb10323148b"},{"objectId":"677e6d74fdbe831a3837eca0","name":"Petar Sabev","lastName":"Varbanov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"011af60d-af92-4100-866f-204e0ab53426"},{"objectId":"677e6d74fdbe831a3837ec9f","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Jakubek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8ca406ca-aa5b-47e0-853c-1027ce93bcc6"},{"objectId":"5e709425878c28a0473b71ab","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Nowak-Ocłoń","uuid":"FCD33A91F54913BD0937EC1B684A86AFD9B2FA402585C91D20C9B2C2CDA4390ECC7B2E912870E3E7A493D5566A345BADAC167DB4B2AC9A9CFEC7592BC8AA3D1D","orcidId":"0000-0002-6877-3742","documentHash":"fdffb9bd-2dfe-4d5b-9954-ba8e8e46a4f7"},{"objectId":"5e70939a878c28a0473ad8ac","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Sułowicz","uuid":"9FAE6417020926A36B844251CAFDF25CE56D5E5C073F5B7EF468F46DE4C29DF7338BB23021F9199B0FBED536FE97773C32F7375B558BA159B32F4AFDFDBC9791","orcidId":"0000-0001-6436-1110","documentHash":"e3e61a98-3c6d-4d7c-85cd-93148d920adb"},{"objectId":"5e709398878c28a0473ad799","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Ocłoń","uuid":"0B8FB310E7C1E202D2A7882C96A55804DA7E5821E241210BFADF32025E1208870A5B81494C7E3E16A47AF2E94385FDE4E8F092598130E5537EDD37376AFCCB51","orcidId":"0000-0002-3361-6296","documentHash":"a84fe514-74e0-45ab-b7ad-48ddd8200641"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.energy.2022.126460"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["urban logistics","logistics definition","logistics system","stakeholders","city logistics"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","uid":"bw-g9IX4k6ydcOqHISTtCqA","uuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","parentUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de16","rootUuid":"f3afb96b-3be4-453c-bf67-d5dccba3d1cc","name":"Uniwersytet Gdański","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709251878c28a0473939ba","5e7093da878c28a0473b1e75","5e70929a878c28a047398f78","5e709344878c28a0473a60f6"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Debate on the definition of urban logistics: a systematic literature review","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547eb49","mniswId":"26800","title":"Theoretical and Empirical Researches in Urban Management","doi":null,"issn":"2065-3913","eissn":"2065-3921","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"35957af4-e72c-456b-bbac-a7a5d32c5451"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-05-09","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6576c6004097071b8ef769e0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929a878c28a047398f78","5e709344878c28a0473a60f6","5e7093da878c28a0473b1e75","5e709251878c28a0473939ba","677e6cf4fdbe831a3837dcd2"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper addresses the problem of chaos in defining the essential elements of the urban logistics system.

Many regions that have the potential for hypoxic conditions are being fished by mobile bottom-contacting fishing gears. The combined effects of trawling and hypoxia may be synergistic and disproportionally impact benthic fauna, or they may act antagonistically, leading to smaller trawl impacts in hypoxic areas. Yet, few studies have quantified how bottom trawling and hypoxia interact to affect benthic communities. Here we examine these combined effects on benthic community biomass and abundance, the number of large organisms, the longevity distribution of the community and the vertical position of fauna in the sediment in the southern Baltic Sea. We find large declines in benthic biomass and abundance that co-occur with declines in near-bed oxygen concentrations from 5.8 to 0.8 ml O2 l-1. Conversely, no relationships and weak positive relationships are found between bottom trawl disturbance and benthic community biomass and abundance. No interacting effects between hypoxia and trawling are detected.

The purpose of this research is to evaluate the existing industrial parks and identify potential areas for appropriate development. An industrial land capability assessment utilized 14 main criteria and 10 constraint parameters of socioeconomic, infrastructural, biological, and physical aspects using a geographic information system-based analytical network process model. Results show that Markazi province has 14.27% of highly suitable and 11.32% of extremely suitable area for industrial development; contrariwise, 60.14% of the province has no potential or is classified as an exclusion zone. Moreover, 44.4% (i.e., 8 parks) of the province’s industrial parks are located in unsuitable zones. According to the land capability of Markazi province, the need to organize existing industrial parks and integrate industrial units alongside existing centers and potential areas should be considered in the industrial development policies of the province.

Successful induction of gynogenesis in the European grayling (Thymallus thymallus) (Salmonidae) included egg activation with UV-irradiated homologous (996 J/m2) and heterologous (rainbow trout) sperm (1370 J/m2) followed by exposure of the inseminated eggs to a high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) shock (9000 psi for 5 min) 20 min after their activation. The survival rates of the gynogenotic larvae at the swim-up stage exhibited a huge inter-clutch variability that ranged from 1.12 ± 0.53% to 14.15 ± 1.27% and from 0.96 ± 0.33% to 60.57 ± 1.85% when the eggs were activated by UV-irradiated homologous and heterologous sperm, respectively. Maternal inheritance was only confirmed in the gynogenotes that hatched from eggs inseminated by inactivated heterologous sperm, whereas an admixture of the paternal DNA was detected among screened individuals that originated from eggs activated by homologous sperm. All the examined gynogenotes produced using heterologous sperm were confirmed to be genetically females. In the case of fish with an admixture of the paternal DNA, male genotypes and phenotypes were observed. One of the genetic males had well developed testes. Differences in the ratio of deformed larvae that hatched from eggs activated by UV-irradiated homologous and heterologous sperm were nonsignificant. Based on the obtained results, it has to be stated that the activation of grayling eggs with UV-irradiated rainbow trout sperm followed by HHP shock is a reliable and fast method for the production of all-female grayling stocks."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060260921","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"574","pagesFromTo":"1-7","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739720","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"677e69cbfdbe831a3837ab05","name":"Stefan","lastName":"Dobosz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f8a97973-13cd-453a-9a4d-ce52c1c416c2"},{"objectId":"677e69cbfdbe831a3837ab04","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Rożyński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"050e8459-3ec5-4837-a1b8-d7cd0741e6b5"},{"objectId":"5e7092d6878c28a04739dbac","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Kuciński","uuid":"8082BF12084EFA311EEAC3EDBC06B8A13DC07183475099C108B04FBA4F535BE0D69DA51F82BB9FD7E430BA28D20B536B2EAA7C38765EB6D1F72A7BBF6DB6B5F2","orcidId":"0000-0002-2977-7249","documentHash":"d9651377-5517-457d-8bbf-36b50a62e15e"},{"objectId":"5e70921c878c28a0473900b7","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Ocalewicz","uuid":"F13F759BB91417695FAF7EC21F8A80E6755D8461106C179130F5ABB7ED191875D4577CA8760AF3349F712D58287F3AD71C92B0A82D1C738C103BF9CA3DF4F16D","orcidId":"0000-0001-7122-7542","documentHash":"0c2abea5-ce81-4531-bbc6-dbed9fd46e78"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.aquaculture.2023.739720"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["TILs","miary przestrzenne","prognoza nowotworowa","przeżycie","obraz histopatologiczny"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["spatial measures","histopathological image","survival","TILs","cancer prognosis"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","uid":"bbxwrSRM8NQfCpzo5dco3lg","uuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","parentUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de29","rootUuid":"d2b78be5-640c-4efd-870a-a0e84067d609","name":"Politechnika Śląska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709204878c28a04738eb73","5e709419878c28a0473b6391","67727cacfdbe831a387fd72c","5ebee1aa752340254fc43923"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Quantifying spatial heterogeneity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to predict survival of individual cancer patients","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547e309","mniswId":"24289","title":"Journal of Personalized Medicine","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2075-4426","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"0934c293-0199-48ae-83cc-d9ae60aa7a6a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-07","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65b0efdf40970719778e8dfd","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5ebee1aa752340254fc43923","5e709204878c28a04738eb73","5e709419878c28a0473b6391","67727cacfdbe831a387fd72c"]},"issue":"7","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), identified on HE-stained histopathological images in the cancer area, are indicators of the adaptive immune response against cancers and play a major role in personalized cancer immunotherapy. Recent works indicate that the spatial organization of TILs may be prognostic of disease-specific survival and recurrence. However, there are a limited number of methods that were proposed and tested in analyses of the spatial structure of TILs. In this work, we evaluated 14 different spatial measures, including the one developed for other omics data, on 10,532 TIL maps from 23 cancer types in terms of reproducibility, uniqueness, and impact on patient survival. For each spatial measure, 16 different scenarios for the definition of prognostic factor were tested. We found no difference in survival prediction when TIL maps were stored as binary images or continuous TIL probability scores. When spatial measures were discretized into a low and high category, a higher correlation with survival was observed. Three measures with the highest cancer prognosis capability were spatial autocorrelation, GLCM M1, and closeness centrality.
