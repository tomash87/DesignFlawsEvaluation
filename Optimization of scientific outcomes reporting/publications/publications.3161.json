Design/Methodology/Approach: Achieving the goal required the use of the direct method – questionnaire. We presented the results of empirical research from 2011-2024. Findings: The paper describes the essence and scope of the grey economy, as well as the concept of tax optimization. Fragments of own survey research from 2011-2024 on the examined issue were also presented. The obtained results of own research and data taken from the literature do not provide a clear answer to the question of whether tax optimization is identical with tax fraud as a manifestation of the grey economy. In the future, it is necessary to continue research in the designated area. Practical Implications: In the paper we presented the essence of tax optimization in the context of the grey ares, which has had a permanent place in tax practice for years. It is also an important and still relevant issue as the results of previous experience indicate the debatability of many issues, but also raise new questions. Originality value: The publication uses original, multi-year research on the grey area in relation to tax optimization."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945778","journalIssue":{"objectId":"672de13cfdbe83502228ec5b","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"XXVII","number":"4","doi":"","documentHash":"2cc8ad97-9dda-46f9-9664-7bac7b9e9eec"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1150-1164","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ersj.eu/journal/3562","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395247","name":"Monika","lastName":"Pasternak-Malicka","uuid":"458E79F1BE103934A3616C3AEF775F21DB344F1D92BD9F209A89D855A5708E8BD6CA4206B432916C57E4B6C15FFEDF208B02A21F7B020D4D6F3E618388207307","orcidId":"0000-0002-0011-7626","documentHash":"9a9ee063-100a-4029-a215-678fc7992e69"}],"doi":"10.35808/ersj/3562"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["contaminants","water quality indicators","water monitoring","safe water","right to water"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Many of these contaminants can cause serious health problems, so it is extremely important to ensure that water quality meets current standards. The main objective of this study was to analyze and evaluate the variability of drinking water quality in a selected water supply system located in the southern part of Poland. The results of the research and analysis presented in the study were prepared on the basis of test reports carried out by the water supply company during the operating years 2018–2022. A total of 28 indicators from the group of physicochemical and microbiological parameters were analyzed: color, turbidity, pH, electrical conductivity, nitrates, nitrites, chlorides, chromium, aluminum, cadmium, magnesium, manganese, copper, nickel, lead, mercury, sulfates, total iron, oxidizability, chloroform, total THM (Trihalomethanes), total organic carbon, chlorites and chlorates, Escherichia coli, Enterococci, Coliform Bacteria, Clostridium perfringens (with spores), and total hardness. The results obtained were compared with national and European standards. The analyzed tap water was characterized by a stable physicochemical composition and did not exceed microbiological parameters. The only parameter that would not meet the acceptable value is chromium. Its value in each of the analyzed months was <3.0 μg/L, while the new directive tightens the requirements to 0.25 μg/L. The water supply network operator should take action to reduce the amount of chromium in tap water so that it follows the introduction of new regulations on the quality of drinking water."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945780","journalIssue":{"objectId":"674da0a2fdbe8324c669fea8","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"16","number":"23","doi":null,"documentHash":"ade8b6db-e992-4f7e-ad43-8e9f020131be"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/16/23/3355","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b0888","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Piegdoń","uuid":"8155CEB54BD14A3E934D27C0B72BA239F20D94567886BEEB167089E97FD89B319326CF21B08F13453E8C739CDCBF99E146E42141ADE760AB88B099A23D4A14B5","orcidId":"0000-0003-1094-4569","documentHash":"ece925bf-f4b9-4e88-89a4-fbe1bef2a1a2"}],"doi":"10.3390/w16233355"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-83-61802-58-7","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Niskoemisyjny transport - droga do czystej przyszłości","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":102,"publicationPlace":"Sanok","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6839ff1afdbe8331742650a6","editors":[{"objectId":"6839ff1afdbe8331742650a7","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Tomczewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"487388d3-609b-427a-b975-3a2932fdfd4a"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["6839ff1afdbe8331742650a7"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1748646945782","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"63cfdcfc4097075010fab3ea","mniswId":null,"name":"Uczelnia Państwowa im.

These components are modeled to reflect significant variations in their performance based on changing operational conditions, including rotor speed and environmental factors. To validate the model’s assumptions, data from the PZL-3W engine were used. The model was created by meticulously incorporating the engine’s specific design characteristics, allowing for an in-depth examination of how performance characteristics shift with adjustments to high-pressure rotor settings or changes in ambient conditions. The resulting calculations demonstrated a high level of agreement between the model’s output and empirical data available for the PZL-3W engine, as well as with data found in the relevant scientific literature. This alignment underscores the model’s robustness and reliability in simulating engine performance across a range of operating scenarios, making it a valuable tool for further engineering analyses and optimization of free power turbine engines and their possible application."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945788","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6744309afdbe832d85de024f","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"14","number":"23","doi":null,"documentHash":"33db2ac7-0df2-4425-9b1c-3b110b55eda8"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/23/11373","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bdb6fdbe833174263447","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Jakliński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7ee92c32-01bc-4081-854b-6f994904f674"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395212","name":"Robert","lastName":"Jakubowski","uuid":"08C9FA5793F38F8DD1A72593C4AF08A6D0F6002A0B4018636794AB6FF9DF22899E127F81825FA837FED6B93C9393D479780F05E8C63334E2012E67F83C3BC329","orcidId":"0000-0002-1886-2966","documentHash":"414101b7-c747-4414-baa2-cdc4ac4bb09b"}],"doi":"10.3390/app142311373"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["railway car","roughness","center plate","working surface","cold plasma"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The use of cold plasma is a promising method of surface treatment which allows for a significant reduction in roughness without changing the mechanical and chemical properties of the material. As part of the study, experiments were conducted on the treatment of center plates with cold plasma, the surface roughness was measured before and after the treatment, and the microhardness, microstructure, and chemical composition of the material were analyzed. The results of our experimental studies show that the use of cold plasma can reduce roughness by 1.4–1.6 times. At the same time, the roughness parameters \uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC4E  are reduced by 29.1–37.4%, and \uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC67  by 29.3–39.6%. A slight increase of 2.81–3.31% in the roughness parameter \uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC4E  is also obtained after cold plasma treatment compared to the base samples. Thus, the use of cold plasma for the treatment of center plates of railway cars can significantly increase their durability and reduce the costs of manufacture or repair, making this method promising for use in the railway industry."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945790","journalIssue":{"objectId":"672a1170fdbe8307b09b8e19","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"22","doi":null,"documentHash":"b967695c-1533-49f9-a0f8-f49aaa9f4dc0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/22/5437","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"618b3cb97523400e636ef11d","name":"Maryna","lastName":"Bulakh","uuid":"3B867DE27B63FFC7D27BEA718A673CE67F49423294BD6C0CBDC747AF650E6FEA1DDDDAB9F26F3C528154C064F0985C04A61E5995EC0A83F00ACBB9DF1C846087","orcidId":"0000-0003-4264-2303","documentHash":"7c7031d8-3918-434d-b326-51d823d945f1"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17225437"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

They were derived based on numerical simulations performed with the nonequilibrium Green’s function method applied to the multiband k · p Hamiltonian of bulk material. The influence of static and dynamic disorders on the band tailing process was examined in relation to the scatterings of free carriers with longitudinal-optical (LO) phonons and ionized impurities. In this case, the disorder potentials just add to the unperturbed potential, which results in a perturbed density of states (DOS). The latter takes on exponential shape as a result of the superposition of sidebands, produced by the potential of the LO phonons. The Urbach parameter, which is the exponent of the perturbed DOS, is then proportional to the logarithm of the perturbation. This results in a modest temperature dependence of this parameter, which was observed for various III-V compounds. Moreover, the absolute values of the Urbach parameter, predicted by the present “scattering” approach, remain in reasonable agreement with experimental data reported in the literature. The range of doping densities studied extends to heavy ones; therefore, the results of this paper are crucial for addressing a current challenge in the semiconductor industry, namely the reduction of the subthreshold swing in tunneling field-effect transistors, which are considered potential future solutions for efficient, low-power logic switches."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945792","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bccffdbe833174262cec","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"22","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"dda03c15-eb80-4065-92cb-b77c81908e48"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.22.044053","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"633e3da97523402e340f9cad","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Makowiec","uuid":"A69BFA25E64F35D772C0918F5193239E50F4A7646494D5E98EE3C7144D433ABDCFB3C7D7397259B4F37A6A3AECD98F4AF142CAA016172B1360919AE9C269A65A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e8b7fee0-c4de-432b-8ac5-be3190791dd3"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951cd","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kolek","uuid":"C3BCC19393DA3227B4FA38CB16EE77609BA722DCDB1CA11567D6C460C5997A8D86AE38829FE5B56B6DD5361E290533FA67D54077D746F3DA3C83DD87169B34DC","orcidId":"0000-0001-8609-0446","documentHash":"1c85e967-67b3-4dec-9cab-0d8cb0644f78"}],"doi":"10.1103/physrevapplied.22.044053"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["blackout","crisis","management","water supply","diversification"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Despite advances in crisis management, significant gaps persist in the preparedness of many cities to maintain water access during emergencies such as blackouts. The aim of this work was to develop a concept of crisis water supply for the city of Lubaczow. The theoretical part presents legal aspects related to crisis management, a description of the blackout, the characteristics of the city and issues related to the water supply system in Lubaczow.

The gallium nitride (GaN) material family, widely used in constructing light-emitting diodes for general lighting, is an obvious choice for this purpose, but the highest quality devices need to be obtained on native substrates. In this study, we demonstrate the fabrication of LEDs on bulk GaN substrates, which are compatible with microtransfer printing (μTP) technology, enabling integration onto foreign wafers. The structures are grown on a heavily doped n-type sacrificial underlayer realized through plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. Fully processed LEDs are undercut by using electrochemical etching to selectively remove the underlayer, resulting in a thin-film structure with a smooth bottom surface. This smooth surface facilitates the easy integration with foreign wafers. A successful transfer using a micromanipulator and μTP setup was conducted, showing an electrical performance similar to that of the original devices. This work underscores the potential of GaN-based light emitters for advanced optoelectronic applications in integrated circuits and highlights the role that μTP plays in achieving heterogeneous integration."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945795","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67ea24d3fdbe8330548263ad","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"12d0276a-ce14-4204-8f96-a867bf0211a6"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsaelm.5c00259","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839ec4cfdbe8368347ece9e","name":"Bart","lastName":"Kuyken","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0aca4e5b-4138-4d0c-9036-a3a6340fe0bd"},{"objectId":"6839ec4cfdbe8368347ece9d","name":"Pol","lastName":"Van Dorpe","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"90949ce2-985f-48c8-96d1-2607b7666509"},{"objectId":"6839ec4cfdbe8368347ece9c","name":"Maximilien","lastName":"Billet","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a9a67709-e96b-47b1-b92f-0ed7f9fdb72a"},{"objectId":"6839ec4cfdbe8368347ece9b","name":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Akritidis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8010012f-4679-4400-ab89-c8d402f10a33"},{"objectId":"671319a8ece398399713a197","name":"Tara","lastName":"Brstilo","uuid":"1EBFF23072E2088D50B0C7949961B324E0933492F086F24E42F53CD1D775109FCB48F594A18F5DD89206F09841650C08C9D4606227E67F54621DC18E5581D20C","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"96d42a88-29d8-4e73-b0d0-5058aa48a81d"},{"objectId":"60c2fdd19543c7233654375a","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Fiuczek","uuid":"6A3046AC28C3C14A3E6D511A9C3B5D762F17DFDEB48CE701ED3C93BF4E8AE1F1B447C379AE334FD952A5D6A74F978B0E9F6D9FF64D10A9F12EA5A94B2624B7A7","orcidId":"0000-0002-6343-0281","documentHash":"60c7a3e1-0f21-415f-bf17-6cc99e356aac"},{"objectId":"5f0e79427523405869ccc28e","name":"Mikołaj","lastName":"Chlipała","uuid":"365336A2AE98E4AEF1354789E45E4E708359729797C41218A73F20B69BB276230FC9BB2E1ACDE559D9DB16F1B8449F0141E776D71CFAB8A1D6C758D7881E027F","orcidId":"0000-0001-9922-0174","documentHash":"613b9863-9819-42be-a3af-62cdddfff19f"},{"objectId":"5e7094e7878c28a0473c6780","name":"Iryna","lastName":"Levchenko","uuid":"8A91DDB4930969560B40DF5368060CAE399DE5E10C766D74E919691A01E5F46C718343C7C8A9023C108A952B70A8AA7D0D51CA590011F4CCA87D2F84F72597F3","orcidId":"0000-0002-6381-9537","documentHash":"f2f08112-1df0-456c-9e2d-2e4be004e88e"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bdff8","name":"Marta","lastName":"Sawicka","uuid":"2378FAD38382F931ADF0FF61216795500D2AC5BC29DAE432B63713E1F8DD07723B44FA5E26B2F531E4A8E4D1919FB5D633BEED48F0EB1A53045D62B9C2BCA0BA","orcidId":"0000-0002-8039-8084","documentHash":"afda4d68-8e80-4da1-a746-f6c1e13024c8"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5987","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Turski","uuid":"7CE69DD3977ED2B76FCE39B9880E3B299133EA2C48F94CB54BE2A56A7B785B628541A0E521C4A740DDE2E819C7216706A758885A4781007CFF94888596F34E7D","orcidId":"0000-0002-2686-9842","documentHash":"aa79756c-fa45-4184-8482-2eb7ea861763"},{"objectId":"5e709386878c28a0473abd73","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Gibasiewicz","uuid":"E4D535CEAC4D1DF2231C0C9E0508A4238EBBD3C5AAED199B9831DB2F66593087DAEEC3681D758A0B79AAC18EE4FA339E22D29449BDB7CD967EA41DD232D03B44","orcidId":"0000-0001-8618-061X","documentHash":"bdf9b3b6-160f-43d6-a89a-5a2e92c8e345"}],"doi":"10.1021/acsaelm.5c00259"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["włókna z odpadów","włókna dywanowe","fibrobeton","zbrojenie rozproszone w betonie","włókna bazaltowe"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The continuous increase in quality control and process automation requirements is leading companies to increasingly experiment with artificial intelligence methods to boost efficiency. One potential application area for AI is visual inspection, which is an essential element of almost every quality control process. In this article, we propose the use of neural networks for the visual inspection of rotationally symmetric components. The presented method leverages the existence of symmetry to represent images in a polar coordinate system and to implement the learning process on data modified in this way. An undeniable advantage of the proposed algorithm is also the transition from a two- dimensional to a one-dimensional representation, which significantly reduces the demand for memory resources and the required computational power. This is particularly important in mass production processes, where the time for data analysis is relatively short. The high repeatability of images due to the mass production nature makes this model exceptionally effective, allowing not only to confirm the presence of defects but even to locate them. The obtained results are compared with the results achieved using a convolutional neural network operating on two-dimensional images."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945799","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6763dc73fdbe837ab135d81d","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"18","number":"8","doi":null,"documentHash":"a17fe703-0c04-4653-901a-fc4a7da65f0f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"403-415","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.astrj.com/Application-of-Neural-Networks-for-Defect-Detection-in-Rotationally-Symmetric-Components,194891,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"633e3da97523402e340f9cf2","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Żurawski","uuid":"8908CE78BE7FC0B08F042F1505D1D407D6665094DE4C57BA7CEF17ACC3A1BA777D6F41D801B6FB53C124A7E526921CCCC364733D685D1833CD8D50D4E86A02CF","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d267283a-f931-451e-9f82-85120603b5d7"},{"objectId":"633b9aaa7523402e340ef592","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Organiściak","uuid":"E4A1789302696CDEAFA93427B7B0D0E29E18D959414D2BC17A4B860A6BC3007A6B95AD64F4D451713660884B12D87FA52E675A61641A08381D5AD8991C19A785","orcidId":"0000-0002-5277-4038","documentHash":"6c96641e-781d-475c-9a5c-4fe9fadfa725"},{"objectId":"5f78278c085dcb410a25e92f","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Klich","uuid":"4FED24F40013600F048CC4D283840E59FE1278E272BE5168F7F18D7D51798BDE4D72D2DC3C9C36646910BFAD88B9A9908A84DDE51A17A275483A15D172B41157","orcidId":"0000-0001-6099-2417","documentHash":"6e5605a6-9cff-4063-ad04-025b13921436"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8c50","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Sikorska-Czupryna","uuid":"F5F5B8EE411A68E42BAFE254FD8883B1CE59A0A123C2486F0F475231EBAA3D3A4E6AEB7AD88FFCCA18AD217C5695B3E00AE2FDA5CAEB94BE7611E815BD24451B","orcidId":"0000-0002-0063-085X","documentHash":"518306a3-3c23-4008-b798-91d6cc417641"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2ca3","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Chmielowiec","uuid":"E2C5BDCD9C90019077560C8BCF76A19EB0E3D5C0268EDA945E2EC03C936F45A3F4F3AA97DEB29A9E14E9BFA09BA40FC848429CCF55ADC95E624260F49B1FD39B","orcidId":"0000-0001-6629-0029","documentHash":"9e4f8dca-4ead-4b45-ace8-a15c10f7e7ef"}],"doi":"10.12913/22998624/194891"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"979-8-3503-9491-7","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Proceedings of the 2024 21st International Conference on Mechatronics - Mechatronika (ME) : Brno, Czech Republic, December 4–6, 2024","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":404,"publicationPlace":"Brno","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6839ff22fdbe833174265108","editors":[{"objectId":"6839ff22fdbe83317426510a","name":"Dusan","lastName":"Maga","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"32837818-d8b4-4fa7-9872-99e1dc2c6116"},{"objectId":"6839ff22fdbe833174265109","name":"Jiri","lastName":"Hajek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"28d99e84-3de3-4fae-a556-ef04a46b3e27"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["6839ff22fdbe833174265109","6839ff22fdbe83317426510a"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1748646945801","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb7fc","mniswId":"26900","name":"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)","documentHash":"b80f2dd5-e346-440a-b828-4712b50be331"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/conhome/10789283/proceeding","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":"10.1109/me61309.2024"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Electromagnetic water purification system","Impurities","Focusing impurities","Electromagnetic field","Liquid purification"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6839fea9fdbe8331742649d4","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-44351-0","title":"Modern Technologies in Energy and Transport","year":2024,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-3-031-44350-3","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-44351-0","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"84c25ab5-7145-4d20-9b43-51cdcef4af0d","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

It has been proved theoretically and confirmed experimentally that due to the simultaneous action of Lorentz and Larmor forces, the trajectory of impurities changes to a conical-helical one and corresponds to the paraboloid of rotation according to the Ulysses Dini equation. Thanks to this, it became possible to effectively remove the volume of focused impurities from the main stream of purified liquid. It was found experimentally that with an increase in the current in the inductor from 1 to 2 A, the radius of the focusing trajectory of ions (such as chlorine) decreases from 0.022 to 0.012 m, and the diameter of the focusing paraboloid decreases from 0.057 to 0.032 m. The mathematical model and the conducted experiments allow to calculate the parameters and control modes of the process of focusing polluting impurities and removing them from the purified volume of liquid.

Moreover, most of the synthetic polymers used are made from petrochemical feedstocks from non-renewable resources. The use of petrochemical raw materials also causes degradation of the natural environment. A potential solution to these problems is the use of biopolymers. Biopolymers include biodegradable or biosynthesizable polymers, i.e., obtained from renewable sources or produced synthetically but from raw materials of natural origin. One of them is the poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB) biopolymer, whose properties are comparable to PP. Unfortunately, it is necessary to modify its properties to improve its processing and operational properties. In the work, hybrid polymer nanobiocomposites based on P3HB, with the addition of chain, uncross-linked polyurethane (PU) and layered aluminosilicate modified with organic salts (Cloisite®30B) were produced by extrusion process. The introduction of PU and Cloisite®30B to the polymer matrix (P3HB) influenced the processing parameters beneficially and resulted in a decrease in the extrusion temperature of more than 10 °C. The influence of the simultaneous addition of a constant amount of PU (10 m/m%) and the different amounts of nanoadditives (1, 2 and 3 m/m%) on the compatibility, morphology and static mechanical properties of the resulted nanobiocomposites were examined. The component interactions by Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis, nano- and microscale structure studies using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and morphology by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were carried out, and the hardness and tensile strength of the obtained polymer nanobiocomposites were determined. FTIR analysis identified the compatibility of the polyester matrix, PU, and organomodified montmorillonite, the greatest being 3 m/m% Cloisite30B content. The addition of PU to the polyester elasticizes the material and decreases the material’s strength and ductility. The presence of nanoclay enhanced the mechanical properties of nanobiocomposites. The resulting nanobiocomposites can be used in the production of short-life materials applied in gardening or agriculture."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945806","journalIssue":{"objectId":"672a1170fdbe8307b09b8e19","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"22","doi":null,"documentHash":"b967695c-1533-49f9-a0f8-f49aaa9f4dc0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/22/5542","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bd55fdbe8331742630ed","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Tor-Świątek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9c722c6d-f344-4d7d-8fb2-e37a5715fca1"},{"objectId":"6839bd55fdbe8331742630ec","name":"Adam","lastName":"Tomczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"627cd189-2b59-4e44-a175-165b23b08a96"},{"objectId":"6839bd55fdbe8331742630eb","name":"Magda","lastName":"Droździel-Jurkiewic","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4dd4fa4c-0922-4970-833d-9936e9aa5aae"},{"objectId":"6839bd55fdbe8331742630ea","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Bieniaś","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b4a4c958-3f44-4a4b-af7e-765756145e11"},{"objectId":"6839bd55fdbe8331742630e9","name":"Anna","lastName":"Falkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"97370692-9d9c-4a34-88bc-7dd6f73428ad"},{"objectId":"6839bd55fdbe8331742630e8","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kuciej","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6429bd3e-7879-4c6c-b4b1-4f6493374b79"},{"objectId":"6839bd55fdbe8331742630e7","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Klepka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aab5441d-807a-430e-8087-f06209c90c93"},{"objectId":"6839bd55fdbe8331742630e6","name":"Monika","lastName":"Ostapiuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"da11ff33-af26-4d86-ad46-1cf5f3c12a07"},{"objectId":"6839bd55fdbe8331742630e5","name":"Beata","lastName":"Krzykowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e1ae6b84-147b-43f2-b380-e3e9d1acae1b"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d554","name":"Karol","lastName":"Hęclik","uuid":"3B084328A6C882577344899C8119737E693F5766D3CE14F37073F262DA72B979016B0D3A7B41A34B22FDAB14762AB12342C417E02640E957B11B4742FDC1E222","orcidId":"0000-0003-4304-8162","documentHash":"e2f9beef-3855-405e-9695-515c8cf0125b"},{"objectId":"5e7092c5878c28a04739c5a2","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Janowski","uuid":"C91A5294B62067B92F5597F01629ACBE5DAE79FB0A78F75EF14DAAF61866D8CF9F70E56076BD9F459758BFA7E215CDE9555E6C8506F90BDBFEFBB405C8F566AB","orcidId":"0000-0001-9765-637X","documentHash":"50ba8ef4-394d-4958-8c16-d4ddb222fa8b"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c448","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Bąk","uuid":"EB5F84BFD3D3723D5BF11F34CEA4F64CC6D72908B86519720FB025B682332A9552F8899BCB664DAFF8FE6C71F5331608A9C352084CDB1C9E1D019D1F196BDD60","orcidId":"0000-0001-8164-3160","documentHash":"2f5471e2-3e3b-47e9-9f19-968cbed38120"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a04739521d","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Frącz","uuid":"A12F4710061BE1A084076A586D6D9F2482CEE0FDB43CB0E118BA549A57C266F7C259F169A8F8E6B82A41DADA81F73D1E6B4F31B783A892E4AFF0492A732281FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-2079-359X","documentHash":"c14600ef-2c7b-4dea-8336-c2e702e0ed90"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395192","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Zarzyka","uuid":"00E93C3E3C87829D90B7D04FFCCF53756D045F3D916CAB85D734F23B5DDADB5106CC091D80CB60BDF384731C1E20C333373CAAB202BD3155A208387020A1AAFE","orcidId":"0000-0001-6780-3308","documentHash":"ac92138d-c15f-4f82-a0ed-c35b77cb3c17"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17225542"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["wind turbine","doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)","optimal control of systems with exogenous inputs"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) system of a wind energy power plant that improves grid symmetrization was applied. The issue of optimal control was treated as an extended linear quadratic regulator (ELQR) having an extra set of exogenous inputs, which are source voltages of the electric grid. No additional knowledge of equations modelling the exogenous inputs was assumed. The proposed method is much more efficient than the currently available linear quadratic control methods. The control objective for a weak grid was to maintain the given value of the voltage module on load terminals and the given value of active power transferred from the stator’s winding. First harmonic components of relevant waveforms were used for this purpose. This task also required the DFIG system to provide reactive power to the grid. In the case of a rigid grid, this reactive power would be too high. Therefore, in this case, it was assumed that the system would supply only part of the required active and reactive power, based on its capabilities. It was required that the voltage and current ratings of the system, mainly the DFIG, were not exceeded. Therefore, the parameters of the network in these difficult failure cases were corrected only partially. The behaviour of the grid in the conditions of failure, as well as the return to the steady state after failure disappearance, were studied."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945808","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bc84fdbe833174262aad","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"73","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"76b29a61-6c77-47bb-a3a6-790863c36563"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"681-701","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/dlibra/publication/150890/edition/132629/content","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5e7","name":"Marek","lastName":"Gołębiowski","uuid":"F1C9483492AEA8F85A549D8C471DC669F71ABE8820C9BAD7172A69D770DD3D0B58633C00C93E7B2258B5E311B63051303D0B6727CCB4CCA28FB008FAF418FBD0","orcidId":"0000-0002-1924-254X","documentHash":"d4cc6a2e-8f92-4797-a5aa-6bc38bd8cb69"}],"doi":"10.24425/aee.2024.150890"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mechanical engineering","QLCA","life cycle assessment","customer expectations","production engineering","quality"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Design/methodology/approach: The framework was developed based on the results of previous studies, within which the Quality Life Cycle Assessment (QLCA) method was developed, dedicated to the sustainable development of products, taking into account the aspects of quality (customer satisfaction) and the environment (the impact of the product on the environment in the life cycle). During the development of the framework, a five-step methodology was used, i.e.: i) collecting data from previous studies, ii) computational simulation including verification of the proportions of the participation of aspects, iii) analysis and interpretation of results, and iv) development of a framework for the selection of aspects. The simulation was supported by the analysis of statistically significant differences in the Statistica 13.3 program with the ANOVA test. Findings: If the quality indicator has a weight in the range of 0.70 to 0.35 and the environmental indicator of 0.30 to 0.65, then the quality and environmental aspects have a similar impact on the ranking. Then, it is possible to direct improvement activities to meet customer expectations regarding the quality of the product while limiting the negative impact on the environment of the product. Research limitations/implications: The framework is primarily designed for use within the QLCA method. Additionally, it does not consider the proportion of other sustainability aspects, such as costs, which may affect product development decisions at later stages. Practical implications: The framework is tailored to support designers' decisions in the early stages of product design and development. It can be used by manufacturing companies for sustainable product development as a tool to help predict product rankings depending on the adopted share of quality and environmental aspects. Originality/value: To define new assumptions and concepts for product development in the form of a research framework that will support decision-making in guiding sustainable product development while taking into account quality (customer satisfaction) and environmental impact (LCA)."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945809","journalIssue":{"objectId":"678f7dfdfdbe835856b661f0","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"207","doi":null,"documentHash":"f2e7f2df-61a3-4ed5-8fd9-115504731d45"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"487-501","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://managementpapers.polsl.pl/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/207-Siwiec-Pacana-Ostasz.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c52","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Siwiec","uuid":"0D25573CF2F6189D6F2E868D46D1426725A137590D7F6EF0F5389766898882ED218F890F47C98AC469E938565A92A4B7C2056615A8944A96F515AAA25FEE2128","orcidId":"0000-0002-6663-6621","documentHash":"6d5070e6-7a6e-444d-bae6-f7a4f58e8a5a"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a04739524f","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Ostasz","uuid":"7915E29D1F1A80B6F46B5704EC7119679D77E15B639C47AC3E0501DD3BE9599E88B16CB97C23889E3DA5A14126719F3CF940B13B64F8482F9ECBE0150B79DAB9","orcidId":"0000-0002-7785-9302","documentHash":"9caa7747-a1e7-4151-a536-13771cd0ece7"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395225","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pacana","uuid":"35D510AA8256DE5E4DEFDF38BF16202BA667F52A940F41C64492BE30097E6AB925BC3352AC6B374350D9E16190A5FD0052B2F59362CFC99AC0345A7CA51144BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1121-6352","documentHash":"bc6c1d9b-8450-4a34-8498-0e87c14cd6d6"}],"doi":"10.29119/1641-3466.2024.207.27"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["management","Employees","organisation","prosumption","company","active engagement"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The study aims to understand and explain the extent to which employees in the SME sector are involved in production and decision-making processes and the implications of this for their role and satisfaction at work. Design/Methodology/Approach: The study is based on a literature analysis and empirical research among employees of Polish SMEs. It uses a methodology at the intersection of qualitative and quantitative research, allowing for a deeper understanding of employee behaviours. Findings: The research shows that consumer behaviour has a significant impact on employees' engagement with their duties, staff turnover within the company, and the quality and efficiency of their work. Respondents clearly recognised the benefits of consumer activities, such as an increased commitment or reduced turnover. Practical Implications: The practical implementation of the right approach towards the workforce in the management of organisations can significantly contribute to their competitiveness and innovation. Organisations should focus on supporting employees in their prosumptive activities and encouraging them to become more involved in the company by supporting the development of employees' competencies and valuing their efforts. Originality/Value: By concentrating on the function of prosumption activities in the management of small and medium-sized enterprises, the paper significantly adds to the literature focusing on prosumption. Its uniqueness is based on theoretical concepts and actual research findings, which have been combined to provide readers with a better understanding of how the proactive behaviour of employees can influence organisational management in an ever-changing environment."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945811","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bb79fdbe83317426227c","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"XXVIΙ","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"2889c229-b290-49bc-9e0f-4058ddad32fb"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"810-827","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ersj.eu/journal/3466","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bd04fdbe833174262e6f","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Maciaszczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"90f5d1ae-f8ea-4725-9143-0bc6de7586a7"},{"objectId":"6839bd04fdbe833174262e6e","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Wilczewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"23c54251-6c8d-42a1-8f31-ea4616a77c97"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d61d","name":"Krystyna","lastName":"Khorrami","uuid":"B4967DB393A398B28C61FF3B976B0E9149A652C2D7A2268004DFC1DEFF834161DCA9E1E9969A046D1DDE0CC02BCC32DB5F27AA5623E2F5F90B170C56E2CA868D","orcidId":"0000-0002-0760-8380","documentHash":"5c2556a1-ebfa-4a38-bd63-ecadeb682515"}],"doi":"10.35808/ersj/3466"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","uid":"bLoLgWizTVEIn0ZQBwSDx-Q","uuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","parentUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3e","rootUuid":"1c5fb903-cc43-44b8-8331-af6cb635dea0","name":"Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67493538ece3984d1d48735a"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0c","uid":"bnXIe5Gp0q3Tkxqm6btR47Q","uuid":"3059e2c4-d76b-416b-8360-76fc2ced654d","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0c","parentUuid":"3059e2c4-d76b-416b-8360-76fc2ced654d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0c","rootUuid":"3059e2c4-d76b-416b-8360-76fc2ced654d","name":"Instytut Wysokich Ciśnień Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c5878c28a0473c3650"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Verhulst-type equation and the universal pattern for global population growth","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792e9","mniswId":"16243","title":"PLoS ONE","doi":null,"issn":"1932-6203","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"45cf93d6-1d2d-4b95-93ed-f1e3f136e1c7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-05-19","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6839cd6cfdbe8368347d7809","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67493538ece3984d1d48735a","5e7094c5878c28a0473c3650"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The global population P(t) (growth from 10,000 BCE to 2023) is discussed in frames of the Verhulst-type scaling, recalling the sustainable development concept. The analysis focuses on the per capita global population growth rate, for which the analytic counterpart is considered:GP(P)=(dP(t)P(t))dt=dlnP(t)dt. The focused insight reveals two near- linear domains for GP(P) changes: from ~ 700 CE till ~1968 and from ~1968 till 2023. It can be considered a reference pattern for long-term global population changes. For models recalling the Verhulst-type scaling, such analysis indicates that a single pair of growth rate and system resource coefficients (r,s) should describe the rise in the global population. However, the Verhulst relation with such effective parameters does not describe P(t) changes, which raises the question of whether it is adequate to describe global population changes. Notably is the new way of data preparation, based on their collections from various sources and numerical filtering to obtain a ‘smooth’ optimal set. The changes of P(t) were analyzed via the ‘reversed protocol’ analysis, in comparison to the standard pattern, namely: (i) first, the linearized, distortions-sensitive transformation of P(t) data is carried out; it indicates domains where the validated application of a given scaling equation is possible and yields optimal values of relevant parameters, (ii) the final fitting via the selected scaling equation is carried out for identified domains, and using obtained optimal values of parameters. The analysis reveals links between GP(P) local ‘disturbations’ and some historical and prehistorical reference events, showing their global scale impacts."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945813","journalIssue":{"objectId":"68340967fdbe8360ebbff61e","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"20","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"1d022654-aac6-4618-b7fe-d0978cdebea9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"20","pagesFromTo":"e0323165","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0323165","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67493538ece3984d1d48735a","name":"Agata","lastName":"Sojecka","uuid":"F1F431E37A8C70B92A404CD88E77A347CC00FF324B7BC2BBA1584C344584110CAC4ADBD83FFDD5AE72EEE79DEE87E87E9A777DB7F971E1A50FD0B55138464ABE","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4732a775-0698-4eeb-8bab-c5c929d7905e"},{"objectId":"5e7094c5878c28a0473c3650","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Drozd-Rzoska","uuid":"7E7E9E065A90409AD919AD342EB5838010CFDD846E3692C5BC69C9147E421B0C681A45364FEC046604E3743F1BD3AAB190C0C8B33103A53B77AC78FBE42C94F7","orcidId":"0000-0001-8510-2388","documentHash":"577e1a27-a469-4654-8081-da1219925f0e"}],"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0323165"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"66599a564097072ea48c023c","doi":null,"title":"Zagrożenia i wyzwania bezpieczeństwa w cyberprzestrzeni","year":2024,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-7934-711-7","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1435744621","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"e5b6679e-6124-405a-b733-51be2fa7bbe0","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb89a","mniswId":"48500","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

In addition, it is necessary to create and manage a database, process data and adjust processing parameters in real time. The article proposes methods for identifying the material in the drilling process in order to automatically adjust cutting parameters during machining based on force signals, cutting torque and acceleration signals. The results obtained during the tests showed that the selected signal measures in the time and frequency domain are constant for a given workpiece material and do not depend on the cutting parameters."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945816","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839f4f8fdbe8331742644bd","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"14","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"53718c99-ce4b-4d76-a607-e92767b6a0f0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"187-192","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://kod.tuzvo.sk/sites/default/files/full_scientific_journal_2024_1.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5bbb","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Zielińska-Szwajka","uuid":"49AD64364D21A828314C0596FD75085DA570E9446C8DB6631BBC544A1FCA28170DE898DB3DAEF447357C9276D0DC7A91DE17660699291FC8E8ED11D39DEBF0D8","orcidId":"0000-0002-6212-2666","documentHash":"9b674641-c845-42e0-9500-b0b5233cddde"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923d1","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Szwajka","uuid":"BE3DBEF640820E864475437AEC4DB8978AE4FC0B4B3B99093CD4857E27DEEA7E923758AFBB9E791E11BF13C3EA626287D3C4FCE7C77FBDA928B5DCDAAE66EFFE","orcidId":"0000-0002-1038-1148","documentHash":"60c70249-8eb8-40a1-ae88-4991b4235bad"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"66599a564097072ea48c023c","doi":null,"title":"Zagrożenia i wyzwania bezpieczeństwa w cyberprzestrzeni","year":2024,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-7934-711-7","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1435744621","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"e5b6679e-6124-405a-b733-51be2fa7bbe0","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb89a","mniswId":"48500","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Methods: Using one of such trifunctional organocatalysts, epichlorohydrin could be selectively converted to the target cyclic carbonate under 2 bar of CO2 at 120 °C. Results: Over 80% conversion of E3 was then observed when organocatalyst S3 was used in the amount of 0.5 mol% (TON = 156) and even the use of 0.05 mol% S3 guaranteed almost 50% conversion of E3 to C3 (TON = 893). Conclusions: The presence of tertiary amine units in the molecules of these homogeneous organocatalysts proved to be crucial for the catalytic activity of developed organocatalysts. However, their catalytic activity was also supported by the presence of acidic phenolic units and halide ions as Lewis bases. Some closely related compounds were found to be clearly less active or inactive catalytically under the applied reaction conditions."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945823","journalIssue":{"objectId":"670d039dfdbe831eaba70628","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"14","number":"10","doi":null,"documentHash":"4a15e62d-cc71-4be0-96d8-499250751d69"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4344/14/10/658","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f8564c9085dcb410a25ed9e","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Kawka","uuid":"21684D5FFF04728805AD7DCD7CC2223531EE37D31441A2D370937E6F6D6DFDC9BD36E3F25282B6214FDC3434670773B03A5304EDA0AC6F270A33164E9C7DBD25","orcidId":"0000-0001-7083-3997","documentHash":"a1c3e1bb-6897-4e7f-81be-d51d4f59184e"},{"objectId":"5e70941b878c28a0473b654b","name":"Karol","lastName":"Bester","uuid":"E051D550F438E789A8831EE232B98A4A595A2AF0485457EB7E727D5DDE2C8B088F14D66059F2AB9C28C4FB56C08F8C7D8278161CEEBF8EF20EEEFA345F499FB4","orcidId":"0000-0002-8498-9463","documentHash":"7b68a97a-c1a5-4bf1-ba7a-1e595bbcfa63"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951a0","name":"Wiktor","lastName":"Bukowski","uuid":"A9DAD78C1A87A4D7E9BB8A016D04B621FECF68FC4E3E8CE5F866566DCECD5C4C69EC0147BADBF89313E62FF8FA899C338392031AFC2772EC829819D92D8AFDEE","orcidId":"0000-0001-7907-9871","documentHash":"10a3d801-50ca-4c19-8af9-65e099f2c054"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a04739519f","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Bukowska","uuid":"D5293EB01C93E2AC8A8E4D8BDE109E28FCCF0E48E4ACCF0BF7E4FC898ABE9C2EA8291E1566CFF074B5A13D8C1BEA46DED1F1DA26841608148EDAD62078317CB9","orcidId":"0000-0001-8167-4215","documentHash":"d8fb4d73-a12d-49c8-aa51-de1c1be28c73"}],"doi":"10.3390/catal14100658"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sustainable development","Inclusion","lean thinking","disability","Lean Tools"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Електромагнітне випромінювання – це поєднання електричного та магнітного випромінювання, енергія якого, впливаючи на дане матеріальне тіло, не викликає в ньому процесу іонізації. Природне електромагнітне випромінювання не тільки гарантує правильний розвиток кожного живого організму, а й впливає на зміну пори року та погоду. Людина порушила природне електромагнітне середовище Землі, включивши в це середовище пристрої, які випромінюють електромагнітну енергію в широкому діапазоні частот. Штучні електромагнітні поля супроводжують нас скрізь: і вдома, і на роботі, і в дорозі, і під час відпочинку. Велике гігієнічне значення для забезпечення належних умов життєдіяльності населення має санітарно-гігієнічний стан навколишнього середовища, в тому числі санітарно-гігієнічний стан електромагнітного становища населених міст. Електромагнітне становище в містах та інших населених пунктах створюється великою кількістю радіотехнічних та електротехнічних засобів господарського, оборонного та іншого призначення. Мета – проведення системного аналізу впливу електромагнітного випромінювання від різного роду електричного обладнання на навколишнє середовище. Показано, що електромагнітне випромінювання небезпечне як для населення в цілому, особливо для дітей, так і для персоналу, який обслуговує потужне обладнання – джерела електромагнітного випромінювання. Висновок. Дослідження електромагнітних випромінювань у навколишньому середовищі показують, що тривалий вплив потужних електромагнітних полів може стати причиною захворювань і навіть смерті людей. Тому слід дотримуватись правил використання штучних джерел електромагнітного випромінювання задля мінімізації шкоди як здоров’ю людей, так і всьому навколишньому середовищу. Ці правила не настільки складні для їх виконання, але досить ефективні. А для фахівців з охорони праці та цивільної безпеки ці знання дадуть можливість створити безпечні умови на робочих місцях."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945828","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839ef83fdbe833174264211","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":null,"number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"bb6e2d8a-f172-48eb-92fb-79c96f99c0f7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"75-81","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://uajcea.pgasa.dp.ua/article/view/302450/294450","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839ef83fdbe833174264213","name":"K","lastName":"Rybalka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"61d10da4-59f7-4401-b0b3-e3d6f66b5161"},{"objectId":"6839ef83fdbe833174264212","name":"Valeriy","lastName":"Shevelya","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3ae3855e-d848-4992-970b-6c6c267c409c"},{"objectId":"5e7094ad878c28a0473c16e3","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Stręk","uuid":"9A284546AA15EB6EDF2307C6E20034F7C75174C57919045F3ACCBF4B8A7E83372D341401E06434259E780F19B005537F3794E2E432D4475BB33AD0E6054EC88A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"765cdd9a-da8f-4c0e-9262-71d719b95b43"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a04739517e","name":"Galyna","lastName":"Kalda","uuid":"90DDBEF6AE8ABFA57674435F9D94C71669AF5E522B3EA03660824A440606BEC5254B2FC0AAAF750AC027A05342E6D03B5A0612BE786ACBA41765EDF93B81A7EA","orcidId":"0000-0002-5142-0473","documentHash":"3a6aa1d9-b25b-44ee-a772-940e51703e23"}],"doi":"10.30838/j.bpsacea.2312.270224.75.1026"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["infrastruktura","bezpieczeństwo","integracja","Europa","wodór"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

For high barriers, it may require changing the computational scheme. In view of the strong influence of stress barriers on the final footprint and opening of a hydraulic fracture, for decades, their modeling has been the subject of special investigations. Actually, classical models of propagation within a pay layer with impenetrable boundaries referred to the case of extremely high-stress contrast in neighbor layers. Further improvements tended to account for the fracture growth in these layers by including stress contrasts as input parameters of a model. This tendency resulted in the suggestion and successive enhancements of pseudo-three-dimensional models. All of them have used stress intensity factors (SIFs) to characterize the combined resistance caused by stress contrasts, material strength, and fluid viscosity. Specifically, the SIFs served to formulate the conditions that control the front penetration into a neighbor layer. This key concept presents the background of our research. Despite examples of modeling propagation through barriers, there is no general theory clarifying when and why conventional schemes may become inefficient and how to overcome computational difficulties. This paper presents the theory and practical recommendations following it. We start with the definition of the barrier intensity, which exposes that the barrier strength may change from zero for contrast-free propagation to infinity for channelized propagation. The analysis reveals two types of computational difficulties caused by spatial discretization as follows: (i) general, arising for fine grids and aggravated by a barrier, and (ii) specific, caused entirely by a strong barrier. The asymptotic approach, which avoids spatial discretization, is suggested. It is illustrated by solving benchmark problems for barriers of arbitrary intensity. The analysis distinguishes three typical stages of the fracture penetration into a barrier and provides theoretical values of the Nolte–Smith slope parameter and arrest time as functions of the barrier intensity. Special analysis establishes the accuracy and bounds of the asymptotic approach. It appears that the approach provides physically significant and accurate results for fracture penetration into high, intermediate, and even weak stress barriers.

The relationship between drivers and pedestrians is important for the sustainable development of road transport, where more and more emphasis is being placed on the privileged position of pedestrians and cyclists. Design/Methodology/Approach: The paper is empirical in nature and its main part is the analysis of data on road accidents with the separation of the pedestrian group, including incidents at pedestrian crossings. The analysis consisted of tabular and graphical presentation of the dynamics of the number of accidents and victims of accidents in general, among pedestrians and at pedestrian crossings for the period before and after the introduction of new regulations. The chi-square test of independence was used to assess the significance of changes in the severity of accidents before and after the introduction of the regulations. Findings: The improvement in road safety over the last two decades has been significant as the number of road accident victims in Poland has decreased almost threefold. The safety of pedestrians, as vulnerable road users, has improved to a greater extent than that of other road users. In relation to the general road situation, safety at pedestrian crossings has deteriorated. The analyzes show that the change in regulations did not significantly reduce the number of accidents at pedestrian crossings. It turned out that the introduced legal regulations had a certain effect in large cities. Moreover, the paper examines the impact of improving road infrastructure (construction of expressways) on the number of pedestrian victims. The results of this analysis indicate a faster decline in the number of pedestrian victims in counties where modern road solutions are being developed. Practical Implications: Road safety as one of the key goals to achieve sustainable development. One of the goals of transport policy is still to reduce the number of accident victims and people with serious injuries. Assessment of the impact of changing regulations on pedestrian safety in one country may be helpful in taking similar actions in the others. Originality/Value: The analysis concerns the socially important issue of road safety and is based on current data."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945835","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bec2fdbe833174263d03","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"XXVII","number":"Special Issue 3","doi":null,"documentHash":"37e1f4dc-828d-4189-bdb2-6a9c0820b648"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1110-1127","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ersj.eu/journal/3874#","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c40f","name":"Mariola","lastName":"Nycz","uuid":"FCEA1E4A6AFB00E7312FA455F44D2939E5DCC27F0D928D70C5D05CBB695B37CAA52C228266BF6FE5C6D9DDBAF6EFE9059FA2C5D61D22D43BF7DE0883C784B885","orcidId":"0000-0001-5828-1085","documentHash":"3b83e48e-03d3-47ea-bff8-424452e82c84"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395254","name":"Marek","lastName":"Sobolewski","uuid":"D2DA90733D3521960960080A6C956608ECE28E733E9C9AF307AF121B87C077F66C69EEA930CEC1FD7A6DCFE38DE7C42DB4F0AFCCF93D199A189E3ADACA283915","orcidId":"0000-0001-6564-8877","documentHash":"12da6aed-9181-48af-ad04-31cc6a2d0074"}],"doi":"10.35808/ersj/3874"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6839feb0fdbe833174264a1d","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-33222-7","title":"Conservation of Architectural Heritage (CAH):  developing sustainable practices","year":2024,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-3-031-33221-0","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-33222-7","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"7ab49f7b-26cf-4f06-b8fb-1e67a59c843f","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The analysis of studies on strength tests of parts manufactured using additive techniques from model materials and hybrid composites usually includes tests of material and strength parameters based on uniaxial tension, bending, and compression tests. For elements manufactured from polymeric materials using traditional methods (e.g. injection moulding), data obtained from these tests are sufficient to determine the strength of the material and to apply the results in the product design process. In the case of the layered extrusion method, due to the model construction process, strength data based on standard samples do not have a direct transposition on the strength of machine parts operating under various load ranges, especially torsional loads. The publication presents the results of tests on the torsional strength of cylindrical samples with splines produced by layered extrusion, vacuum casting technology, and hybrid technology, which combines both technologies. The test samples were made using a Prusa i3 MK3 3D printer and the plasticised plastic modelling (fused filament fabrication, FFF) method, while PolyJet technology was used to create a reference model. The findings indicate that hybrid technology, in which a thin-walled mould is filled with a chemically hardened polymer, achieves the desired strength for the manufactured parts while maintaining dimensional accuracy and shape. The research results show that producing rotating elements using the hybrid technology reduces the sample core’s ability to undergo plastic deformation due to the adhesion between the materials and the occurrence of notches resulting from the model production process using the layered extrusion method."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945838","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bdf9fdbe833174263644","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"15","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"0a186d84-6d8b-497f-9770-e1b4438edde0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"63-72","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://promechjournal.pl/article/547508/en","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d5fa","name":"Jadwiga","lastName":"Pisula","uuid":"1B6BDB6FB97FDC8E7A47381CC12CCE9280B58CE98D10488754CDBCFF789D8C73B77C02FFF1F12FA7F1E9D05A9BE5F4E6969C8A14141CC638BA8C20902BC90F72","orcidId":"0000-0002-3197-9528","documentHash":"08ab3893-fc83-4165-aeb4-4d889442259b"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c44a","name":"MARIUSZ","lastName":"DĘBSKI","uuid":"8A208B00C5662A5BF70FD839A2C59D197DBB28952EAC7EFC47C78F35FA811B98C67F7436978A89AA0747E2D8CF4C420F7E8C2F920321EC6BA10AA8AD2A15BE93","orcidId":"0000-0002-4889-7633","documentHash":"90ae3282-ad29-4e61-aaa2-a324cbcb9942"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c42f","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Przeszłowski","uuid":"AD5B037B0C1E89F2F72DE0742DE9DAB4BD07008E377A6405E0BA9DAD301EAA43D78D802CB03E686B07BB690CE8BD4F1D87549E9070E3EB49BDAB6807B65193A9","orcidId":"0000-0002-1212-9069","documentHash":"36c4d08a-2442-49e6-b4d4-a6ca21a703bb"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395209","name":"Bogdan","lastName":"Kozik","uuid":"5D82D3E2F22FAD9F404A2B0E20990B7A7DDE34F75D45A2FF39C9B1B7A8C7CFE0FD16242045042F319FBAF3D23579D28FE1C75B70A2E8B16816DBB2F31F691A03","orcidId":"0000-0002-8111-6456","documentHash":"85087bc1-0344-402e-bf58-2c3ae00c5432"}],"doi":"10.5604/01.3001.0054.7508"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Inclusion","Workers with disabilities","manufacturing","Cognitive Maps"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6620b57440970762636d258c","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-56456-7","title":"Advances in Manufacturing IV: Volume 5 - Biomedical Engineering: Digitalization, Sustainability and Industry Applications","year":2024,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-3-031-56458-1","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-56456-7","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"b48d68a2-40c3-40b7-a4b5-233aca42f620","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Design/Methodology/Approach: The theoretical part of the study presents the results of previous desk-research regarding the EMAS system, indicating a gap in the knowledge concerning particular activities implemented by the analysed companies in order to improve their environmental performance. The empirical part contains the results of individual research conducted in Polish manufacturing enterprises participating in the EMAS scheme. The grounds for the assumed research method was the analysis of secondary sources in form of environmental statements. The selection of sample was targeted, the research involved a complete analysis among 12 manufacturing companies from Poland, participating in the EMAS scheme. It should be noted that the analysis of environmental statements had been used as the grounds for the research in previous studies concerning the EMAS scheme, among others, describing the effects of EMAS implementation on the improvement of environmental performance. Findings: The conducted analysis allowed to identify most common initiatives aimed at energy efficiency improvement and indicate examples of specific solutions in that area. The most common undertakings included, improvement of manufacturing processes, modernisation or replacement of lighting systems, energy recovery, using renewable sources of energy and rebuilding or retrofitting of buildings along with process installations and equipment. Practical Implications: Specific solutions identified in the course of the analysis included both cheap and simple ones, as well as more expensive and time-consuming procedures, but all of them could inspire organisations of different size, with a large spectrum of activity profiles. This paper may be also important in the aspect of life quality, as it describes solutions aimed at reaching optimum energy efficiency. Originality/Value: This study supplements previous research concerning the EMAS system, providing specific examples of activities undertaken by Polish manufacturing companies in order to improve their energy efficiency."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945843","journalIssue":{"objectId":"672de13cfdbe83502228ec5b","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"XXVII","number":"4","doi":"","documentHash":"2cc8ad97-9dda-46f9-9664-7bac7b9e9eec"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"953-972","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ersj.eu/journal/3639#","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d59a","name":"Jadwiga","lastName":"Nycz-Wróbel","uuid":"C42BC809597A4CC0F60CDB8C9E1BA0E9014A8ABD0E0105B4E265A3489909E2C2CF612FAFF1EDBEFABC3D6D6007D28E573DC5646EBAD0546A67A39D1096216FFB","orcidId":"0000-0002-2100-6765","documentHash":"9535e653-8c9a-47be-a199-da96d847f6fb"}],"doi":"10.35808/ersj/3639"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hyperbolic paraboloid","optimization","innovative structures","steel bar structures","modular roofs","genetic algorithms","sustainability","parametric design","FEM","generative design"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

In addition, the building industry is one of the global economy’s largest sectors, responsible for one-third of the energy consumption and significant CO2 emissions. For this reason, there is a need to design effective structures that are characterized by the lowest possible steel consumption. This article presents an approach to sustainability considerations in steel structures, namely the approach of shaping efficient steel canopies with modular roofs using genetic algorithms. The shed structures, which were designed based on a regular polygonal plan, were constructed from grid modules that were formed on the basis of the hyperbolic paraboloid (HP) units arranged radially, supported by the columns, and covered by metal sheets. The algorithmic definitions allowed for the creation of numerous variants of the structures with the adopted preliminary criteria and for the performance of genetic optimization in order to select the best results. Twenty-four kinds of structures were analyzed and compared, differing in the quantity of modules, module shapes, arrangements, and dimensions. This made it possible to observe changes in the efficiency of the structures depending on the form of the roof applied. As a measure of structural efficiency, the coefficient representing the mass of the shed structure per square meter of the covered area was utilized. The presented design approach and optimal solutions can be helpful in shaping more complex sustainable structures, for which the analyzed sheds constitute modules."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945845","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67627668fdbe83713fee0801","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"16","number":"24","doi":"","documentHash":"8ca44ba1-324d-4327-ade5-afd4d3e4ac73"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/24/10980","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"615bb8a875234017e04eda7e","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Lechwar","uuid":"DBFD147AB3C6BF42D05B5183CBE06750EF381F5FEFDECE6769666F32827E13603B72F6B3456570E6FB71FB5398C7019A86E68F95927292E44BF91210829E1E3F","orcidId":"0000-0001-7202-6312","documentHash":"c7a1257d-5b49-4d93-a097-bf21befeaa19"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395189","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Dźwierzyńska","uuid":"1F78EE5F317A44AFC30131E7528DAFC8FF7918330A7A8417BBE84F44CBEE6E2D1A4A58AA84F6929EACD6747054D39E4D15905CBF56679DD0E065486C629D61EA","orcidId":"0000-0003-0634-5328","documentHash":"ae72d02b-d60d-4d89-bfe4-8bffb63cf7f6"}],"doi":"10.3390/su162410980"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"659bc0da4097076e59fceeeb","doi":null,"title":"Prawo karne procesowe dla sędziów, prokuratorów, obrońców i pełnomocników","year":2024,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-8291-264-7","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://search.worldcat.org/title/1416181026?oclcNum=1416181026","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"ab3fca3b-7e2c-4e6a-a4f1-478c2237d5ca","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb92f","mniswId":"66800","name":"Wydawnictwo C.H.

Design/methodology/approach: An analysis of the literature on the subject was performed, and interviews and observations were conducted at foundry companies located in southeastern Poland. Findings: Key objectives of the development strategies of foundry companies were identified in relation to which a set of KPIs was proposed to evaluate production activities. Within the framework of strategic development, the following key areas were highlighted: optimizing energy and water consumption, increasing customer satisfaction, increasing production flexibility, increasing productivity, and reducing waste and related costs. Research limitations/implications: Future research directions will include the development of a universal set of KPIs for other key areas of foundry companies and the development of software that will allow monitoring and control of the indicators in real time. Practical implications: The developed set can be successfully implemented in foundry companies that plan to imply a strategic scorecard, which is a tool for advanced strategic analysis, as part of management improvement. The proposed set of KPIs provides an excellent foundation for the construction of a strategic charter in foundries as part of the concern to raise their level of competitiveness. Originality/value: Filling the research gap on how to conduct effective monitoring, control and analysis of the implementation of the objectives of key development strategies (production area) of foundry enterprises through the use of KPIs.

In addition, it is important to include the environmental aspect so that the customer is satisfied with the landscape of the product. Therefore, the purpose was to develop a concept for product quality assessment that considers criteria relations. This concept will be created based on qualitativeecological interactions and will also include the weights of product criteria. The proposed conception relies on combined instruments, for instance, the SMART(-ER) method, a questionnaire with comparison in pair method, AHP method, DAMATEL method, Likert scale, WPM method, and relative state scale. The idea is to support an expert in assessing any product that will be selected by an individual customer.

What’s more, suspended sediment (SS) have so far not been taken into account as a potential factor amplifying the degrading effects of nutrients on the functioning of reservoirs. In the experiment described here, the variability of SS concentrations and the content of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total organic carbon (TOC) and organic matter (OM) were investigated to determine the potential and determinants of SS in the process of migration of these substances at the water-sediment interface in retention reservoirs. The results showed that SS significantly manipulate the distribution of values of total phosphorus and total organic carbon contained in bottom sediment. It was confirmed that the circulation and distribution of selected nutrients in reservoirs is closely related to suspended sediment. Thus, it was proven that SS significantly affect the quality of deposited sediment. Finally, it was concluded that suspended sediment in the water of reservoirs forms a kind of micro-ecosystem, in which it plays a hitherto undiscovered role of a catenary (hub) consolidating a number of phenomena and processes occurring between individual components in the water-bottom sediment system"}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945862","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6597d34e40970755be5e2b9e","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"7b2bf3c4-186e-4bd9-8908-044ad024e285"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-76556-x","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094ab878c28a0473c1528","name":"Maksymilian","lastName":"Cieśla","uuid":"6A5BE66730F42BEAEB840ADDE3B41F6D67F7827DD071D3F767AE6E3B598B6A6A8F3AF73C697DF3799ADB7E26FEA6426A7CCD4FCE2CD61A24FA11F15724F0FCC1","orcidId":"0000-0001-5533-9560","documentHash":"fc6076ec-7d82-4d22-bdcc-f4519dfd13e9"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395187","name":"Renata","lastName":"Gruca-Rokosz","uuid":"CBD87A0CB06465C9BE56E9692CB7183ED6AC59E7094EBA7D93446DB9402648696E533AF8988289C773446DBFC18BFBD03D72F6B4F7C3CCD4A0AC809E18C67D6A","orcidId":"0000-0001-8222-2480","documentHash":"56db2117-f184-43b2-82c2-6e6aa66e11aa"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-024-76556-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-83-7934-722-3","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Design/methodology/approach: The studies encompassed communes from six voivodeships displaying significant differences in the conditions and traditions of cooperative banking development (annexations) and population density. A total of 1,116 communes were analyzed. The main data sources for the analysis and inference were the official websites of the analyzed units, Statistics Poland’s Local Data Bank, and the online map platform Google Maps. Structure indicators, descriptive statistics methods, and the Classification and Regression Tree (C&RT) method were used to analyze the empirical material. Findings: The analyses enabled the identification of the characteristics of the communes served by the cooperative banking sector. The findings confirmed the dominant role of the cooperative sector in communes with the smallest populations and local budgets. A significant determinant of communes’ reliance on cooperative banking services was the percentage of inhabitants employed in agriculture. Communes with a higher proportion of agricultural workers more frequently had their budgets serviced by cooperative banks. Research limitations/implications: The conducted research allowed for a deeper understanding of the analysed research problem relating to the factors that determine the choice of the organisational form of a bank serving a commune. Practical implications: The results obtained are important for the management staff of cooperative banks. Having information about the factors that determine the choice of a bank serving the municipal budget, they can design financial products that meet the expectations of this customer segment. Social implications: Socially, they contribute to strengthening the positive image of the cooperative banking sector among various stakeholders (consumers, agricultural producers, municipal authorities). Originality/value: The results obtained in the conducted research enrich the existing scientific achievements of management and quality sciences as well as economics concerning the identification of the current features of communes that determine the choice of the type of bank (cooperative bank/commercial bank) by the commune."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945865","journalIssue":{"objectId":"678f7dfdfdbe835856b661f0","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"207","doi":null,"documentHash":"f2e7f2df-61a3-4ed5-8fd9-115504731d45"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"683-705","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://managementpapers.polsl.pl/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/207-Wojewodzic-Sato%C5%82a-Szafra%C5%84ska-So%C5%82tysiak.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839be0afdbe8331742636d5","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Satoła","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"af803e44-bdf6-4da1-86c5-2e4cf47e426e"},{"objectId":"6839be0afdbe8331742636d4","name":"Monika","lastName":"Szafrańska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9f787a09-e87d-4cda-993f-a437be2cfae1"},{"objectId":"6839be0afdbe8331742636d3","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Wojewodzic","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dea0075f-e62a-4921-ae87-d737a5efcc7e"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a04739524a","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Sołtysiak","uuid":"CAAB6BEF1942CB319F9BEB89B0DF8E2AC3D32F09BC409BAFB7184D00AFCFED8625A6491F8F7AFA978163151EDECFD01ADD66B9A8A2A6E086CAF916776436F2E5","orcidId":"0000-0003-3366-1537","documentHash":"2cc61158-136d-413f-81b4-e7921074b9ac"}],"doi":"10.29119/1641-3466.2024.207.39"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fuzzy sets","Ready-mix concrete","Copulas functions","Risk","MC simulations"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Using the proposed model based on simulation methods and Gauss or Clayton copulas, it is possible to calculate the value of risk in the production of ready-mixed concrete with underestimated quality. Exposure to risk in assessing the quality of concrete can be measured as the product of the level of risk and the consequences of embedding under-quality concrete in a structure, and the developed matrix makes it possible to determine the level of risk and contribute not only to its quantification during the various phases of its production, but can affect the final quality of the concrete produced.

For this reason, we pay attention to the role of communities in geothermal development. We derive it from the integral characteristics of geothermal energy next to the shift in the energy transition policies to focus on managing green resources locally. This study presents arguments for a framework that approaches geothermal resources as an endogenous factor of community development. To analyse it, we create a model that explains the local economic characteristics of geothermal exploitation beyond its geological conditions. It aims to conceptualise a community-based geothermal development standard referring to the endogeneity principle. Geothermal energy is given attention since the characteristics of this resource determine its use locally. This induces the internalisation of labour and technology in the local economic system, a specific condition for local geothermal projects where a community remains a prime beneficiary. We argue that the role of communities in geothermal exploitation is pivotal in the process of green growth for further expansion of geothermal energy use."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945869","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6641ba0b40970755576bdf0b","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"10","doi":null,"documentHash":"b8fdd27c-e1e6-4db5-808b-c0c0c24bbd32"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-23","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/10/2299","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bcc4fdbe833174262c98","name":"Johan","lastName":"Van Ophem","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"17ec7288-2170-404a-9173-a0ad6a782e88"},{"objectId":"6839bcc4fdbe833174262c97","name":"Katarzyna A.","lastName":"Kurek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"719cccbf-f9d9-4505-97bd-323e14b043d2"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395273","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Strojny","uuid":"169D2EA10CCB5E077B551C8DA0CD977CDA69353A8C800C651060BD6C033625E8C064D9BDB28C561D6229CE90A9884DDD6B799AC4523B57AC161C871EDEEA79CE","orcidId":"0000-0003-4632-8645","documentHash":"fa46382d-3b85-4193-8459-caf8f0cab290"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17102299"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6656e614409707281753e6e6","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-44955-0","title":"Proceedings of CEE 2023: Civil and Environmental Engineering and Architecture","year":2024,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-3-031-44954-3","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-44955-0","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"9602de13-200e-40bb-85d4-63f311d8503e","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

In the third stage the logistic regression to develop the predictive model of product quality in production company was used. The developed model explain the impact of the production parameters on product quality. In addition, this decision tool will help the managers in the company identification the improvement actions."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945874","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"425-432","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-38165-2_50","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d612","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Antosz","uuid":"9227B894B819EC4FDA2000BA79F84317ABB82DB4451CE7BB5D6C607B3A89F9108D5AB04E8550B5275998C42D6B3E39C9BD4C243E6305197D3E17B6F65BF30493","orcidId":"0000-0001-6048-5220","documentHash":"169c335d-2e8d-4a05-8762-4ffd1a8b65e3"}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-38165-2_50"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["tool path strategy","deburring","brushing","lead angle","five-axis milling"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

A set of EN-AW 7075 aluminum alloy specimens with curvilinear edges requiring multi-axis machining was prepared. The change of edge condition after the milling process was realized using Xebec tools with flexible ceramic fibers. The effects of brush fiber type and parameters related to tool design were analyzed. Different brushing strategies were employed on the five-axis machining center. It was shown that, for curvilinear edges, there were different effects for concave and convex edges depending on the employed tool strategy, including the type of tool, its configuration, and its orientation towards the workpiece. For a lead angle of β = 0°, the machined edge was characterized by variable chamfer widths, in spite of maintaining other machining parameters constant. The use of a lead angle β > 0 produced a stable edge with repeatable characteristics. The range of fiber interaction increased with increasing the lead angle and fiber working length."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945875","journalIssue":{"objectId":"675be9f4fdbe834a822912d9","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"24","doi":null,"documentHash":"36be91ce-e6db-46b9-af58-d1d492d4b92b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/24/6267","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839be37fdbe833174263839","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Matuszak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ae92b223-4a88-4126-bb75-5882c6c1cfb6"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c47b","name":"Michał","lastName":"Gdula","uuid":"7406C4D0F6E5F97773AE0E4ADBED426E40DEAE8E74CB4935A2E97582C96F86B24B419CDAFCC6D7F59540E0DB06889B65A028FDD3A332F89F222CF72233A4D179","orcidId":"0000-0001-7760-4986","documentHash":"22e8073b-3839-4854-a473-83d207cab3e0"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395219","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kawalec","uuid":"CCAD08EAD59F4AF784EF566E5708BABA35FCA59FF1EB6C8F8BB5EC47226C25C903475A8D803B27D2D6AE068EE9E9693549F818B11FDE75E608AD45A26ADD22B5","orcidId":"0000-0002-2120-8535","documentHash":"ef5af63a-759d-4b4e-aa3c-db332bf4d298"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17246267"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-0-85466-697-3","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Globalization and Sustainability - Ecological, Social and Cultural Perspectives","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":502,"publicationPlace":"Rijeka","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"PUBLISHER_WEBSITE","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"OCTOBER","releaseDateYear":2024,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6839ff0dfdbe83317426500d","editors":[{"objectId":"6839ff0dfdbe83317426500e","name":"Levente","lastName":"Hufnagel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"06e322e9-ab23-4442-b982-191781db7a43"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["6839ff0dfdbe83317426500e"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1748646945877","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5ebff8bfad49b31ccec5fd81","mniswId":null,"name":" IntechOpen","documentHash":"4391a0af-ef55-40f9-821b-0267319a2a80"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.intechopen.com/books/1003590","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":"10.5772/intechopen.1001808"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["fault tolerance","open circuit","switched reluctance motor","parallel path","short-circuit"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Depending on the type of motor, there are generally three ways to achieve an increased resistance of the drive system to tolerate resulting faults. The simplest way is to select the right motor and design it appropriately. Switched reluctance motors (SRMs) have a high tolerance for internal faults (in the motor windings). Failure tolerance can be improved by using parallel paths. The SRM 24/16 solution has been proposed, which allows for operation with four parallel paths. In this paper, a mathematical model designed to analyse the problem under consideration is provided. Based on numerical calculations, the influence of typical faults (open and partial short circuit in one of the paths) on the electromagnetic torque generated as well as its ripple and (source and phase) currents were determined. The higher harmonics of the source current (diagnostic signal) were determined. Laboratory tests were performed to verify the various configurations for the symmetric and emergency operating states. The feasibility of SRM correct operation monitoring was determined from an FFT analysis of the source current."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945879","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67349c4ffdbe8361a57b2b88","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"22","doi":null,"documentHash":"e1cf7aa4-f80c-4b46-8161-714238773663"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/22/5701","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5e5","name":"Jan","lastName":"Prokop","uuid":"15B4400A55C8D4CA2BE6138DF9F1F4FBF4B8288D564D9DC5502635327FC716A334C671A2D2D09A9DB97DC6ED257F16A9780B35338A1D6E055EDC308FE9B7DF3C","orcidId":"0000-0003-1640-0642","documentHash":"6fb00717-f611-49a9-805f-43a44c40ec22"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951b8","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Korkosz","uuid":"9E80CD6353410A4C18BEE27ABE966C74598045040E60A6DE58C3B663F16DD2578762DB39A77D00A0C78791778196173C65CFDB1364B080C196E64282A0C181EA","orcidId":"0000-0002-9097-0988","documentHash":"2724a219-510f-4868-9615-aae7e7e1b827"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951b7","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Bogusz","uuid":"B525851DE99BBC64304018F8E76CFDA12483E14F57C71E9B55D344B2A98170217CB2A9BBA854D9E39775BD934237DB18534F33AAE1F670D5CCA5896FECDAEF49","orcidId":"0000-0001-8726-5172","documentHash":"f90e4f6c-edad-44ef-b3f1-1c39add78082"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17225701"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-83-7934-703-2","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

In the analytical part, using, among other things, matrix calculus and trigonometric relationships, mathematical models were developed to describe the relationships between the tool axis orientation and the geometric parameters of the cutting layer at the contact point. On this basis, mathematical relationships for contact diameter and effective diameter were derived. The basis for these considerations is the very rarely considered working angle of the cutter blade. In part of the experimental study, machining tests were carried out for selected kinematic variants of multi-axis cutting. Based on the results obtained, it was found that as the tool axis inclination angle increases, the contact diameter increases. The effective diameter at the upper characteristic point of the cutting layer increases up to a certain angle of inclination, after which it begins to decrease. The rotational angle of the tool axis does not affect any of the diameters, but it does affect the displacement of the contact point, the values of the working angle of the tool blade and the feed-related component decrease. The result of this displacement is a change from climb milling to conventional milling, which has significantly degraded surface quality and tool life. The best results of the machining test were obtained when only the angle of inclination of the tool axis was used. It was concluded that the parameter tool blade working angle can be a control variable in a multi-axis milling process and has a major impact on the physical aspects of the cutting process."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945894","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bcc1fdbe833174262c86","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"13","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"b6c5aa28-d65c-457d-9d78-be9547d574d8"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"535-547","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.ijmerr.com/show-250-1971-1.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c47b","name":"Michał","lastName":"Gdula","uuid":"7406C4D0F6E5F97773AE0E4ADBED426E40DEAE8E74CB4935A2E97582C96F86B24B419CDAFCC6D7F59540E0DB06889B65A028FDD3A332F89F222CF72233A4D179","orcidId":"0000-0001-7760-4986","documentHash":"22e8073b-3839-4854-a473-83d207cab3e0"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-1-64490-336-0","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

This study examines the use of polypropylene (PPO) and polystyrene (PSO) pyrolysis oils as diesel fuel (DF) blending components. Single-cylinder engine tests were conducted on PPO and PSO, each blended with DF in mass proportions of 20 %, 40 % and 60 %. The engine featured a state-of-the-art compression ignition combustion system, including an 8-hole high-pressure injector and precisely controlled air and exhaust gas recirculation paths. Results proved that both PPO and PSO could be efficiently combusted in modern compression ignition systems, provided their admixture with reference DF did not exceed 60 %. For optimal performance, the engine control map needed to be re-calibrated to prevent over-homogenization of the pilot spray, caused by higher volatility and reduced fuel reactivity. When maximising waste-derived components, PPO provided optimal emission results (1.37 g/kWh NOX and 0.04 g/kWh PM) when combined with heavy EGR and advanced injection timing. In this case, the total emissions overlimit value was 3.7, compared to 7.3 in the best-case DF scenario (a 50 % reduction in cumulative emissions). For minimizing emissions, small additions (20 %) of highly volatile PSO were found to offer the greatest potential for co-optimization. Compared to the optimal DF configuration, a cumulative emissions reduction of 81 % was achieved in the same calibration map region as for PPO."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945900","journalIssue":{"objectId":"676147e1fdbe837ab11e8f91","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"313","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"c4793136-aa9b-4556-bba2-2f6da65b91ad"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360544224038714","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bdc1fdbe8331742634a6","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Szpica","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3328f625-7735-41fd-abb6-b7dd5168aed6"},{"objectId":"6839bdc1fdbe8331742634a5","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Hunicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ea5e1eb8-9a70-4bcc-ab61-4f066309374c"},{"objectId":"6839bdc1fdbe8331742634a4","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Rybak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ba0ad690-eb22-4783-b056-087ec4791aaf"},{"objectId":"6839bdc1fdbe8331742634a3","name":"Liping","lastName":"Yang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"12a28c9c-f8ac-42b5-a250-8c33929aaa89"},{"objectId":"6839bdc1fdbe8331742634a2","name":"Michał S.","lastName":"Gęca","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bbee58d7-eccd-464c-a874-f4ea9d9c977e"},{"objectId":"6839bdc1fdbe8331742634a1","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Mikulski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7ea2c6f0-370a-417e-808f-fa9f3438004c"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951f9","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Woś","uuid":"0C936B93580B831338DC610A6F51E8AEECA67D863358D9D61BFF2AA60AEC03973F5A7C55D174A8C9D012D7086B7BE56E2664C7D4F9E3634DB5D24BA2F3ADD6E1","orcidId":"0000-0003-2730-3258","documentHash":"72c6bfaa-b977-4c69-bb88-fc493beb9ba0"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.energy.2024.134093"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-83-969601-9-1","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

It was hypothesized that organizational conditions influence the use of controlling in enterprises distributing liquid fuels. Design/Methodology/Approach: The research group included all companies distributing liquid fuels that operate in Poland on the basis of a license to trade in liquid fuels (TLF), i.e., 5,689 energy entities (general, statistical population). Completed surveys were collected from 235 enterprises. The research procedure used includes: literature review, survey research, analysis of legal acts related to the subject of research, statistical methods, indepth interviews with decision-makers in companies distributing liquid fuels, logical inference methods (induction, deduction), methods of analysis and synthesis. Findings: The research diagnosis allowed to accept the hypothesis and state that organizational conditions influence the use of controlling in enterprises distributing liquid fuels. Detailed research analyzes have shown that: a) the larger the company distributing liquid fuels (measured by the number of employees), the greater the extent to which controlling is used; b) enterprises distributing liquid fuels with domestic (Polish) capital use controlling less often than others - it most often occurs in enterprises with foreign capital; c) controlling is used most often in global enterprises distributing liquid fuels, and least often in domestic enterprises; d) enterprises that use controlling conduct wholesale distribution of liquid fuels much more often than others. Practical Implications: Practical business implications focus primarily on indicating the benefits for enterprises resulting from the use of controlling as a modern management method. The results also indicate the following benefits from implementing controlling: increased efficiency of planning and control in the enterprise, as well as rationalization of its operating costs; making more accurate and rational decisions in the company by managers; having reliable information that allows making accurate decisions; integration of management activities belonging to different functional areas of the enterprise. Originality/Value: Based on the presented results, it can be concluded that organizational conditions influence the use of controlling in enterprises dealing with the distribution of liquid fuels. Moreover, the introduction of controlling in an enterprise has a significant positive impact on the management of this entity, and therefore controlling significantly supports the proper and effective functioning of this enterprise. The presented results fill the existing research gap in the field of using controlling as a modern method of enterprise management."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945904","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bd21fdbe833174262f51","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"XXVIΙ","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"65616434-9e84-4c6a-9f60-24f88c9af935"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"735-754","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ersj.eu/journal/3545","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094df878c28a0473c5c4c","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Bełch","uuid":"5A71D02F72D5E297246A053B26DE1747553AE3BF794ED790E1999777E82F6C18B0305629400D20390B3DC00BFBB39AB15D12AA1F52FE619A0120AAB9A24C0021","orcidId":"0000-0003-0818-5284","documentHash":"8bd8f780-7777-4f4b-b7bc-f4393a971411"}],"doi":"10.35808/ersj/3545"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["tire steering resistance torque","design parameters","steered-wheel tire","steering axle","operational factors"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

It was established that when steering in static state, the locked steered wheel is taken as a complex mechanism, and the tire contact patch is rotated about the kingpin axis–support surface intersection point. When turning the unlocked steered wheel, it was determined that the tire contact patch participates in transport and relative motions. The transport motion center is the projection onto the support surface of the center of rotation of the wheel about the kingpin axis. The relative motion center is within the contact patch and is determined experimentally. For both states of the steered wheel, analytical dependencies were obtained for determining the tire steering resistance torque. The results of the analytical studies were experimentally verified on a bench equipped by components and aggregates of a truck, and included an additional rigid false wheel and a special rim. The false wheel made it possible to experimentally determine the tire contact patch transport motion center, and the special rim—to change the knuckle length in the range of 0.22–0.82 m."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945905","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6744309afdbe832d85de024f","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"14","number":"23","doi":null,"documentHash":"33db2ac7-0df2-4425-9b1c-3b110b55eda8"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-27","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/23/10925","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bd88fdbe8331742632bf","name":"Eduard","lastName":"Klimov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"82d14ee4-a8a3-4fa1-9b35-4f5180b29bfa"},{"objectId":"6839bd88fdbe8331742632be","name":"Liudmyla","lastName":"Tarandushka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3d2041b0-92a1-4238-ba82-0bcae296c048"},{"objectId":"6839bd88fdbe8331742632bd","name":"Anatolii","lastName":"Soltus","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"20464109-2d74-4b2f-99f1-83e84eb5b26c"},{"objectId":"6839bd88fdbe8331742632bc","name":"Roman","lastName":"Marchuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cb42d82e-2af3-4d60-94c1-d35c9805b3dd"},{"objectId":"6839bd88fdbe8331742632bb","name":"Nataliia","lastName":"Kostian","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0ce00cc6-7ccf-4df7-b251-5c158a90d940"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a04739528b","name":"Vasyl","lastName":"Mateichyk","uuid":"D724A369E6FCB983609C3A811F5AEC97E4E7DD6B0BFA35DA348B4D1C607140E58B05608DD7023BFC5E0E233722BD8BA713F840AECF72ECDFE5486C20A6B1C75F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3683-7246","documentHash":"b9b29556-3ad0-4594-a1c4-4469ce048085"},{"objectId":"5e709257878c28a0473940f7","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Śmieszek","uuid":"0231A68749CC39C0140665B700B762F19B5AE85AAA87444811433F2B3864833FDD2567E56F84AB633EE605DC880709DC8E45A481A953F3707D3EF561EE1EAEBF","orcidId":"0000-0002-4508-6309","documentHash":"fe6f27e6-90af-42f9-90fa-15dd84fe759c"}],"doi":"10.3390/app142310925"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dimensional accuracy","magnesium alloys","precision milling","tool coating"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

With full self-consumption (SC), the reduction of consumption from the grid can be increased by 9.5%–30.7% for a year according to the rated PV power. Consumption should increase when PV generation exceeds a certain value. A discrete time control of the power of an electric storage boiler (ESB) is proposed based on the deviation of the storage battery (SB) state of charge from a given schedule with a heating concentration during hours of high PV generation. In the considered application, it is possible to increase SC by up to 21%. Reducing the load in the evening allows us to use SB energy to reduce consumption from the grid at night. The possibility of complete photovoltaic SC when the ESB is used with an air conditioner is substantiated. Limitations for air conditioner energy consumption according to PV generation are determined. The system’s 24h model of energy processes is supplemented with a thermal model. The standard use of ESB with water temperature maintenance was also considered for comparison. ESB power control allows you to reduce daily energy consumption from the grid by 1.7–2 times. When combining an adjustable ESB with an air conditioner, it is possible to reduce consumption from the grid by 1.466–1.558 times at minimum and increase consumption from the grid by 2–5% at maximum air conditioner consumption."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945909","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bc84fdbe833174262aad","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"73","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"76b29a61-6c77-47bb-a3a6-790863c36563"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"573-593","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/dlibra/publication/150884/edition/132555/content","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bc9cfdbe833174262b61","name":"Dusan","lastName":"Medved","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dc03cb45-1ae9-49d9-bf42-b02119b8daf0"},{"objectId":"6839bc9cfdbe833174262b60","name":"Olexandr","lastName":"Shavolkin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6dea86f2-b0ac-43a3-aca7-6663185312db"},{"objectId":"6839bc9cfdbe833174262b5f","name":"Iryna","lastName":"Shvedchykova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c2998ac6-4bf9-48a7-afd3-2cec99430648"},{"objectId":"6839bc9cfdbe833174262b5e","name":"Michal","lastName":"Kolcun","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"48c5c148-e93d-417f-bd30-349b6cc46c33"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d5ec","name":"Damian","lastName":"Mazur","uuid":"C5C27537D18191016B14D55E9E2D1896D662AE78E60D3836E675D56F9BE1819A7E873408D6A5CE8385FF5FA90E59DE1E9993A5DAF48BFDF0A01F35FA205DE9F1","orcidId":"0000-0002-3247-5903","documentHash":"4b2f5f74-734f-4132-9532-a901ae59718f"},{"objectId":"5e709228878c28a047390d29","name":"Bogdan","lastName":"Kwiatkowski","uuid":"9AFE9F63D445D994789A553DFE92FED175ABB1A5369C89017BF228D1FF8ACAAAD1498E7503F112ECDA454D06EFC46FD552DE8A05898B6ACB9B3B6E4B4663FB43","orcidId":"0000-0001-5287-2191","documentHash":"3c2d5d1f-a466-4e3c-8d2c-9cd6c56e8e01"}],"doi":"10.24425/aee.2024.150884"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Wind turbine blade","Repurposing","Material testing","Structural behavior","Bridge girder"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The latter was the main subject of the present research carried out by the authors in a research consortium with the leading Polish industry waste recycler. The main goal of the project was to develop, design, and demonstrate the first domestic footbridge made of decommissioned wind turbine blades, taking into account the review of existing ideas. This paper presents an experimental investigation to determine the material parameters and to evaluate the structural behavior of a decommissioned wind turbine blade to be adopted for a footbridge. Terrestrial laser scanning and comprehensive material testing were performed according to ASTM standards to determine the actual blade geometry, the stacking sequence, and the mechanical properties of the blade composite materials. The experimentally determined strengths, elastic moduli, and Poisson’s ratios of the composites extracted from the shell and the spar cap along the blade were very high and definitely sufficient for the fiber-reinforced polymer bridge girders. Then, a four-point edgewise bending test was performed on an 11 m section of the blade to evaluate its structural behavior: stiffness, ultimate strength, global safety factor, and fatigue life. The full-scale model of the blade bridge girder behaved linearly elastic in the full load range up to 1,250 kN of the total load, did not reach the ultimate carrying capacity, and exhibited only small local damages (laminate cracking). The results of these tests revealed that the LM 29.1-type wind turbine blades were suitable to be reutilized as main girders for a footbridge. Using the presented research results, the first bridge in the world made of decommissioned wind turbine blades was designed and installed in the late fall of 2021 in Poland."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945911","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bd0cfdbe833174262eb3","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"29","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"9d569beb-b6ba-47b1-b2e5-87ad07a225ae"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/JCCOF2.CCENG-4765","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d535","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Kulpa","uuid":"790D759C417F50A6620906E9A13EC3DFC8B19327848731DC4677A87F2585D690A7D8EF4F552C30710DEA51241C7D3588B2770060CD19C6E73838497AAA0C3B9A","orcidId":"0000-0002-8550-7382","documentHash":"eb8b0b8b-00f6-4656-b102-e3c2345c36b4"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b6ac","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Rajchel","uuid":"EE730FBDCEDC9A1F8120599A1277B211EAA195844B27D8FA7902BCC1B0E84438F816417C8D549AD106487C313949E5D0C10BA96E4ED0FA13321177BE593A2709","orcidId":"0000-0003-4930-3443","documentHash":"d16384c6-f94d-4c2a-944a-71d8146116dc"},{"objectId":"5e7092b8878c28a04739b69b","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Wiater","uuid":"D4F0F349E81477E00DE0DE97418DE33024B64E7F4F33FEF1A9AC8A52B3C227455513CB8C0CCB6A98C4CFE71DD22F9B949AF30178C6EC1A9428A715C0A797CFE5","orcidId":"0000-0001-5559-3841","documentHash":"79de45d2-5f93-4e42-8213-0b705e18606c"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395160","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Siwowski","uuid":"60E8AE045DE688D769347355C56C8ACF612FC404CCB43774DF91B6FB20CB70B23B67D3647BC155D695119572CBE4E944782E8D58B9D096B9ABC47EF17FDFF467","orcidId":"0000-0002-2003-000X","documentHash":"ce87cefc-d930-4bec-971d-b5a30ea41ab0"}],"doi":"10.1061/jccof2.cceng-4765"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mechanical strength","polyethylene waste","shrinkage","rubber waste","epoxy mortars"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The detection of a single inter-turn short circuit is a difficult issue. The authors of this article tested the sensitivity of the tested powertrain damage detection method. The diagnostic method developed for BLPMM allows for any configuration of the motor winding. A number of analysed configurations have been applied for the combined star–delta connection (YΔ). For the combined star–delta connection Y/Δ, the problem of partial short circuit at two locations was analysed. In the first case, this was the short-circuit winding phenomena in the star part (SC1). In the second case, the short circuit was connected in part to the delta (SC2). A mathematical model has been developed that takes into account both the type of connection and the chance of a partial short circuit of the coil. Based on numerical calculations, the sensitivity of diagnostic methods is designated for both cases. Furthermore, the impact of partial short circuits on motor performance was also examined. The effect of a partial inter-turn short-circuit fault on motor parameters was also determined.

The research activities included: development of design assumptions, adoption of target geometry, creation of a 3D-CAD model, preliminary strength analysis in the FEM environment, prototype manufacturing using FFF method with thermoplastic material (pet-g), and conducting tests under conditions similar to real ones. The hinge geometry was based on typical market-available design solutions, while considering the specifics of the adopted manufacturing method. Strength analysis via FEM was conducted on the 3D-CAD model, allowing estimation of stress values and determination of the suitability of the developed geometry for testing on a real model. Subsequently, research models were produced using FFF technology with various infill patterns: linear 30%, hexagonal 30%, linear 60%, hexagonal 60%, and solid 100%. Bench tests were conducted to determine the maximum load-bearing capacity of the hinge under perpendicular loading to the axis and to assess hinge wear under conditions simulating real-life door usage. The results revealed that the hinge with solid infill safely carried a load of 160 kg without damage, while the hinge with hexagonal 30% infill exhibited the lowest load-bearing capacity, failing at 85 kg. To determine the hinge's durability, the clearance at two reference points on the doors was measured."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945923","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bd6dfdbe8331742631b2","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":null,"number":"November 2024","doi":null,"documentHash":"05262aad-c7fa-4654-987a-077685cba4ca"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"7641-7647","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mmscience.eu/journal/issues/november-2024/articles/analysis-of-the-possibilities-of-manufacturing-functional-elements-using-the-fff-method","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bd6dfdbe8331742631b3","name":"K.","lastName":"Łopacinski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f3f0d4bb-c0cf-4d5d-8215-aaf9204bff83"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d5fa","name":"Jadwiga","lastName":"Pisula","uuid":"1B6BDB6FB97FDC8E7A47381CC12CCE9280B58CE98D10488754CDBCFF789D8C73B77C02FFF1F12FA7F1E9D05A9BE5F4E6969C8A14141CC638BA8C20902BC90F72","orcidId":"0000-0002-3197-9528","documentHash":"08ab3893-fc83-4165-aeb4-4d889442259b"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d583","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Dziubek","uuid":"9EE65B96DD5A4CE806A5E02CFC833F99B4F46D85FB2276DC055BAA7D072726694D5DF00D8CB754CE17B9BF3DE6DFB9FD38733F476453613D23CC90CDB29BA67A","orcidId":"0000-0002-3259-446X","documentHash":"436651ec-5a02-4cf7-a1b9-11be7002310e"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d576","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Sobolewski","uuid":"57284EC17919C1C825A58DD8B6CA65117BE62F602715B14052FB64C4B94C3CC3360FE44E7E05298827A719B305BF65819ED53DF496F6EC43BD31CBD0783F0D0E","orcidId":"0000-0003-3824-6228","documentHash":"a2aa4693-a647-415e-adef-0146f479f62e"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395207","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Budzik","uuid":"FFAACEF281085020398E4E1801C3867CBABF71F7832126DBB6AE9DA2045443729E5927B3BF31EE87A652AB7BCA696A655559B046B72FF1A100160DD4C9BA1FD7","orcidId":"0000-0003-3598-2860","documentHash":"9f7f0516-7a6d-4a6c-b589-b2d5bd925e62"}],"doi":"10.17973/mmsj.2024_11_2024093"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["innovative activity of an enterprise","innovativeness of enterprises","innovation profiles of enterprises"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

It serves as a foundation for further research among companies, the results of which will be presented in a subsequent publication. The primary goal was to identify the basic innovation profiles of European enterprises and the use of the main sources of information on innovation by companies, which may be important in the context of further identification of the models of innovation processes used. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on a review of the literature on innovation models and the reasons for their implementation and uses statistical data on the innovativeness of enterprises in the European Union countries provided by Eurostat. The research results on the profiles of innovative enterprises in the European Union were analysed, with particular emphasis on Polish companies due to the planned further research. Findings: The study made it possible to determine the differences occurring in the European countries covered by Eurostat research in terms of the innovation profiles of enterprises and revealed relatively low innovation activity among Polish companies. It was also found that enterprises use various sources of information in their innovation processes. Differences in the approach of companies from different European countries were also identified in this area. It is particularly apparent that innovative entities from Poland relatively rarely use external sources of information for their innovation activities. Originality/value: The results highlight different approaches to innovation in the surveyed countries and will enable better planning of further research aimed at determining the impact of numerous factors on the innovation activity of Polish enterprises, with particular emphasis on subsidies from EU and national public funds."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945925","journalIssue":{"objectId":"677f883cfdbe831a91cefbed","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"209","doi":null,"documentHash":"82bab52e-270f-4b1e-9a77-f67e47f34209"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"531-540","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://managementpapers.polsl.pl/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/209-Wyrwa.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395260","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Wyrwa","uuid":"81E176BD0FDE361563F193CBFFCD1C146BA8608B082082653F3D8F85B857B1A34CB7766E1EF5970FFCA350178039E1D632811A77FAC24448AEEBA6F9087BFEE2","orcidId":"0000-0003-1327-795X","documentHash":"05490b69-2bd2-46f4-ad1b-749fa02f443f"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["natural fillers","reprocessing","recycling","injection molding","buckwheat hulls","biocomposites"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The changes in the material after repeated reprocessing—up to five recycling cycles—are written in the paper. Analysis of the shrinkage, water adsorption, selected mechanical properties, tensile impact strength, hardness and the microstructure of the surface layer was performed. The results show that the application of the buckwheat hulls into the biopolymer decreases the material shrinkage. It improves the material dimensional stability, as well as increases the water adsorption in the wake of the hydrophobic properties of the filler. The addition of the natural filler also leads to an increase in composite stiffness. The decrease in the tensile impact strength and the elongation at break is also noted. The reprocessing of the biocomposite initially led to a decrease in its mechanical properties, but the results stabilized after further processing cycles. This indicates the improvement of the microstructure homogeneity. The microscopic analysis shows that buckwheat hull particles were better embedded in the matrix after recycling. The increase in hardness was also noted. The PHBV–ground buckwheat hull biocomposite is characterized by stable mechanical properties and by recycling resistance, which makes it a promising material in terms of the sustainable development."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945927","journalIssue":{"objectId":"675be9f4fdbe834a822912d9","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"24","doi":null,"documentHash":"36be91ce-e6db-46b9-af58-d1d492d4b92b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/24/6136","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d607","name":"Grażyna","lastName":"Ryzińska","uuid":"B3076474CC57B0C77129AAB6C3ACE4D2B8F1323401BC51128FD845B3CE69B0D97FC60B0FCB76564CE6211FD9353BB348614491DBB3190F5E0C107C97F03F8CC0","orcidId":"0000-0003-4145-0799","documentHash":"0c1461a4-43c0-40b2-8320-5fa742173575"},{"objectId":"5e7092c5878c28a04739c5a2","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Janowski","uuid":"C91A5294B62067B92F5597F01629ACBE5DAE79FB0A78F75EF14DAAF61866D8CF9F70E56076BD9F459758BFA7E215CDE9555E6C8506F90BDBFEFBB405C8F566AB","orcidId":"0000-0001-9765-637X","documentHash":"50ba8ef4-394d-4958-8c16-d4ddb222fa8b"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c448","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Bąk","uuid":"EB5F84BFD3D3723D5BF11F34CEA4F64CC6D72908B86519720FB025B682332A9552F8899BCB664DAFF8FE6C71F5331608A9C352084CDB1C9E1D019D1F196BDD60","orcidId":"0000-0001-8164-3160","documentHash":"2f5471e2-3e3b-47e9-9f19-968cbed38120"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b6bb","name":"Marta","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"1EE75F5E73D85097334355D2D7991D8A8479D25A413A98A56F76ECA3CA8AEDBB3F48B0DBEAF4D2EE9B16023D1195ABE5DD975888E33AC3D16A4A4779B74EFBAF","orcidId":"0000-0003-3764-1058","documentHash":"54a50444-a263-4bf4-8ff6-29f99fc88726"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a04739521d","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Frącz","uuid":"A12F4710061BE1A084076A586D6D9F2482CEE0FDB43CB0E118BA549A57C266F7C259F169A8F8E6B82A41DADA81F73D1E6B4F31B783A892E4AFF0492A732281FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-2079-359X","documentHash":"c14600ef-2c7b-4dea-8336-c2e702e0ed90"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17246136"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["human-computer interaction","fingerspelling recognition","computer vision","deep neural networks","sign language recognition"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Nevertheless, achieving a high-quality welded joint proved challenging owing to the properties of the diverse range of materials' used. To improve the quality of dissimilar welded joints, the welding parameters should be selected precisely. With that in mind, the current research endeavoured to figure out the ideal RSW parameters for a dissimilar resistance spot-welded joint between grade 2 titanium alloy (Ti) and AISI 304 austenitic stainless steel (ASS) with equal and unequal thicknesses of 0.5 and 1 mm. The RSW cases based on the selected thickness were referred to as the following: similar thickness of 1 mm for Ti and ASS as case E, dissimilar thickness of 0.5 mm for Ti and 1 mm for ASS as case F, dissimilar thickness of 0.5 mm for ASS and 1 mm for Ti as case I, and similar thickness of 0.5 mm as case J. Tensile shear force, failure mode, and micro-hardness were the metrics used to assess the dissimilar joint's soundness. The RSW variables utilized in the scope of the present investigation were “welding current, pressure, welding time, squeeze time, holding time, and pulse welding”. Models from gradient boosting, CatBoost, and random forest machine learning (ML) algorithms were used to guarantee an accurate analysis, along with the artificial neural network regressions. Therefore, the ML and artificial neural network (ANN) models were trained using real data collected from 100 experimental RSW samples conducted under different RSW process parameters. Various transfer and training functions were applied with the multilayer perceptron employing the feed-forward-back propagation approach when building the ANN models. Also, for the first time in the RSW field, an estimation of the relative importance of the RSW variables regarding the predicted shear force is presented in the current study. Evaluating the experimental findings demonstrated that the highest shear force was 2.183, 2.589, 1.708, and 1.851 kN for cases E, F, I, and J. The micro-hardness data indicated that the nugget zone had a much higher hardness than the heat-affected zone (HAZ) and base metal (BM) zones, wherein case F showed the peak nugget hardness in comparison to the other cases. The best prediction model was found to be the ANN model when training the conjugate gradient with the Polak-Ribiere updates (Traincgp) training function with the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function (Tansig) with the mean squared error (MSE) and correlation coefficient (R2) values recorded as 0.01886 and 0.94973, respectively. However, the random forest algorithm gave the second best prediction of the MSE while the CatBoost and gradient boosting algorithms were third and fourth, respectively. The automotive and aerospace sectors are anticipated to benefit from the present research in applications associated with body component production that result in a superior strength-to-weight ratio."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945934","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bdbffdbe83317426348d","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"10","number":"24","doi":null,"documentHash":"122e6c17-145d-4406-9a35-fe846ce97530"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-31","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024169290","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bdbffdbe833174263490","name":"Alejandro","lastName":"Pereira","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f2478cd9-53f4-4799-bb59-d34a8b5e7887"},{"objectId":"6839bdbffdbe83317426348f","name":"Rusul Ahmed","lastName":"Shakir","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a77ae7ec-3d59-437f-a84b-7d4b1e7d4372"},{"objectId":"6839bdbffdbe83317426348e","name":"Marwan T.","lastName":"Mezher","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"95951bf0-8496-43b8-af4d-659c8c5533f1"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d60b","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Trzepieciński","uuid":"B1173B4E25A04EF20A9FC72135EA66107445195FB931A6F929E34828CBA837AE85B5284995C35F3192186D9A1A95198DD9965EC89FB78C1E42ABBEFD475C5341","orcidId":"0000-0002-4366-0135","documentHash":"819127f8-0b2e-43f0-ae91-077e24078b38"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e40898"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["metal manufacturing","quality management","bagged trees","NN model","SVM","machine learning"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

A variety of classification algorithms, including neural networks (NNs), bagged trees (BT), and support vector machines (SVMs), were employed to efficiently analyse and predict defects. The results show that neural networks achieved the highest accuracy (94.7%) and the fastest prediction time, thereby underscoring their efficiency in processing complex production data. The BT model demonstrated stability in its predictions with a slower prediction time, while the SVM model exhibited superior training speed, though with slightly lower accuracy. This article proposes that optimising key process parameters, such as temperature, machining speed, and the type of coolant used, can markedly reduce the prevalence of production defects. It also recommends integrating machine learning with traditional quality management techniques to create a more flexible and adaptive control system, which could help reduce production losses and enhance customer satisfaction."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945936","journalIssue":{"objectId":"672b77ecfdbe8307b0580cdd","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"14","number":"22","doi":null,"documentHash":"f91f5a0b-e432-4f3f-8678-6dd8ec4ff201"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-26","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/22/10450","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bd45fdbe833174263064","name":"Lucia","lastName":"Knapčíková","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"944dc674-b069-48bb-8a24-6d4d2f97d618"},{"objectId":"6839bd45fdbe833174263063","name":"Jozef","lastName":"Husár","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0116e0b7-8b6f-41ce-b448-96fb967ec1a4"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d612","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Antosz","uuid":"9227B894B819EC4FDA2000BA79F84317ABB82DB4451CE7BB5D6C607B3A89F9108D5AB04E8550B5275998C42D6B3E39C9BD4C243E6305197D3E17B6F65BF30493","orcidId":"0000-0001-6048-5220","documentHash":"169c335d-2e8d-4a05-8762-4ffd1a8b65e3"}],"doi":"10.3390/app142210450"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-83-7934-732-2","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Design/Methodology/Approach: The literature review focuses, in particular, on the essence of innovation, factors influencing the level of innovation and the measurement of innovation. The analysis of the innovativeness of industrial and service enterprises in Poland by voivodeships, in the years 2018-2022, was carried out based on data from Statistics Poland. Four indicators were selected for the analysis of innovativeness, including: 2 input indicators and 2 output indicators. Based on the selected indicators, synthetic measures on the input and output side were calculated using the TOPSIS method, and then rankings of the innovativeness of industrial and service enterprises by voivodeships were prepared. Research methods such as literature review, variability analysis, Spearman's rank correlation, and TOPSIS method were used in the study. Findings: The innovativeness of industrial and service enterprises in Poland by voivodeship can be measured using various measures. The measures based on inputs and outputs are worth noting in this respect, with the use of which synthetic measures were calculated using the TOPSIS methodand rankings were created. Based on the analyses conducted, it was found that in the groups of industrial and service enterprises, in the period 2018-2022, the share of innovation-active enterprises was significantly higher than the share of enterprises that incurred expenditures on R&D activities. In the period under review, a slight upward trend was also noticeable in the share of enterprises incurring R&D expenditures in both groups studied. Moreover, in the group of industrial enterprises there was a higher percentage of those that were innovation-active and those that incurred expenditure on R&D activities than in the group of service enterprises. The research indicates that the largest percentage of industrial and service enterprises introduced new or improved business processes in the 2018-2022 period. In turn, a much smaller percentage of enterprises were introducing new or improved products. The share of enterprises that introduced innovative products was higher in the group of inThalassinosdustrial enterprises than in the group of service enterprises. In 2020-2022, the share of service enterprises that introduced innovative business processes was higher than the share of industrial enterprises. It is worth noting that enterprises from a given voivodeship could occupy different places in the rankings in particular years, as well as according to inputs and outputs. The study also shows that there are very large application possibilities of multidimensional comparative analyses using rankings in assessing the innovativeness of enterprises. Thanks to this, it is possible, among other things, to use the results of the analyses in various spheres of management. Practical implications: The Polish government can use the conclusions from the regional analysis of the innovativeness of industrial and service enterprises to allocate funds for programs supporting the innovativeness of enterprises in individual voivodeships. The authorities in these individual voivodeships can determine their position in the area of innovativeness in relation to other regions based on the rankings. On the other hand, enterprise managers can find the regions (voivodeships) most supportive of the innovativeness of enterprises based on the results obtained. Originality: The originality manifests itself primarily in the comprehensiveness and scope of the research undertaken, in particular in the approach to the innovativeness of industrial and service enterprises across voivodeships, from the perspective of inputs and outputs, and the preparation of rankings on this basis using the TOPSIS method."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945939","journalIssue":{"objectId":"672de13cfdbe83502228ec5b","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"XXVII","number":"4","doi":"","documentHash":"2cc8ad97-9dda-46f9-9664-7bac7b9e9eec"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1266-1287","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ersj.eu/journal/3569","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d628","name":"Sabina","lastName":"Rokita","uuid":"FF28AC1AFF48ACFE8889977B66C24544994E693A18FC51959EB6C74C43A11B8E1A209F92624D0781D02A5400D5C8DAC0B3B84C1B882EDF60CEC68F3C5554F51E","orcidId":"0000-0002-2185-6399","documentHash":"b1c088be-8b77-4aa6-896a-51c755707106"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d595","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Szydełko","uuid":"CB16030DD6C8AEA7642B2C2EFE2329D766776F5CC2633B7F46AC8DFB3BD6374B589A244D6ADC6352D860EF5E6589FA48D33B662F8B4DC06DF4D57388196F2F56","orcidId":"0000-0002-6370-3999","documentHash":"74b54847-0c51-4545-b692-e5cf2fe87146"}],"doi":"10.35808/ersj/3569"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["butyl rubber","passive vibration isolation","bituminous material","experimental modal test","influence of temperature","damping materials","free layer damping (FLD)"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Two types of viscoelastic materials (butyl rubber and bituminous material) were tested. In the performed vibration analysis, the Oberst beam made out of aluminum alloy with a damping material in a Free Layer Damping (FLD) configuration was used. The experimental modal analysis was performed using the Unholtz-Dickie UDCO TA-250 vibration system. To investigate the influence of temperature on the effectiveness of passive vibration isolation, an isothermal cooling chamber (using Peltier cells) was designed and constructed. The tests were carried out in a wide frequency range from 40 Hz to 4000 Hz, at a constant sweep rate, in a temperature range from −2 °C to 22 °C. Miniature piezoelectric acceleration sensors were used to determine the acceleration of the beam and the exciter head. The analysis of accelerations of both the object and the shaker head allowed for the determination of a Frequency Response Function (FRF) for the beam. The course of FRF was used to determine the resonance frequencies and the vibration amplitudes of the beam damped with bituminous material and butyl rubber at various temperatures. The loss factor η, calculated for each resonance using the generalized half-power method (n-dB method), was used as an indicator of damping intensity. The research results presented in this work (important from scientific point of view) also have utilitarian significance and can be used in the design of more quiet and comfortable motor vehicles, railway wagons and aircraft structures."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945941","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67406cedfdbe832d853b35ae","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"23","doi":null,"documentHash":"64051828-5f95-4984-b33a-8ac6a987172f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/23/5832","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebedf25752340254fc42d9e","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Łabuński","uuid":"0C3F7F856C5D41A39ED1A6BD14E4944948E62EE4574F5D9D9D410D39BE112F5506D02BCD6112441638872DC0DD00B063AE2B7A38F7C648F03A7E39CD0E67089A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a40b3174-f901-46fa-bb8e-917b065637ad"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951e4","name":"Lucjan","lastName":"Witek","uuid":"0EF9E43F7EA9075EBAF7C110734D04444DC3CEEE5863952556B431033785BFB615C425C8C46FCE09AB4FE0F2CE3DBBB7A123D64F393FB75AEE13CD2DB87FFE3B","orcidId":"0000-0003-3292-0242","documentHash":"5115c896-63d0-4a40-a68d-d8994cfc9b04"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17235832"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis)","capacity of power","size of biogas plants","Malmquist Index","technical efficiency"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

In larger companies, economies of scale are a key consideration. The objective of this study was to evaluate the technical efficiency of agricultural biogas plants differentiated according to their capacity of power. The study included 43 agricultural biogas plants, which were divided into three groups according to their capacity power: group I, <0.5 MW; group II, 0.5–1 MW; group III, ≥1 MW. In order to assess the technical efficiency of agricultural biogas plants under the research, the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method was applied. It was found that the largest biogas plants were the most efficient. However, the technical efficiency of the smallest biogas plants was not statistically significantly different from that of the largest biogas plants. This indicates that small entities can achieve the technical efficiency at a satisfactory level. For this reason, in the development policy of agricultural biogas plants, the optimal solution is the coexistence of large and small facilities. The smallest biogas plants were more sensitive to changes in the macroeconomic environment than other biogas plants. This may suggest a need to pay more attention to energy policy mechanisms to stabilize their performance in periods of disadvantageous macroeconomic conditions."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945942","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67584acbfdbe835dc16a96ec","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"24","doi":null,"documentHash":"6285251b-203e-4a5e-987f-9187104e743a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/24/6256","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bdd8fdbe83317426356a","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Nowakowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"59ce0cc4-d9b2-432f-998f-c4da5765e987"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473be997","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Kusz","uuid":"64879C4D1C8E5D8AE2E6AA07045E4F2F36EED1557A73D1002FA35ABFE71E5D32D064A96979764E0689CCE6F81ED3BBBE387DACCA672F715981FE04199813EDAA","orcidId":"0000-0001-7867-162X","documentHash":"94dc14f4-9191-4f45-853d-0bd1ad00a96c"},{"objectId":"5e7091fe878c28a04738e409","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Kusz","uuid":"8EA23A77ADD90A13B0E4B01D2145264BCF850A3F852A072722264772D19C4F7441F3535A3A96F0775E64CDD1CA1D6EA5C379D413C227D17E26E66C390AA0E031","orcidId":"0000-0002-5643-5404","documentHash":"1a5dce9f-b21b-4f73-9bd8-90909a890b7c"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17246256"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6839feb0fdbe833174264a1d","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-33222-7","title":"Conservation of Architectural Heritage (CAH):  developing sustainable practices","year":2024,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-3-031-33221-0","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-33222-7","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"7ab49f7b-26cf-4f06-b8fb-1e67a59c843f","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.
