Interactions between the particle and the potentials are\\nmodeled by subjecting a particle's bispinor wave function to certain\\nlimiting conditions at the potential centers. Each of these conditions\\nis parametrized by a $2\\times2$ Hermitian matrix (or, equivalently, a\\nreal scalar and a real vector) and mixes the upper and the lower\\ncomponents of the wave function. The problem of determining particle's bound-state eigenenergies is reduced to the problem of finding real zeroes of a determinant of a certain $2N\\times2N$ matrix. As the lower component of the particle's wave function is inverse-square singular at each of the potential centers, the wave function itself is not square-integrable. Nevertheless, one can define a scalar pseudo-product with the property that wave functions belonging to different eigenenergies are orthogonal with respect to it. The wave functions may then be normalized so that their self-pseudo-products are plus one, minus one or zero. An auxiliary set of Sturmian functions is constructed and used to derive an explicit representation of particle's matrix Green's function. For illustration purposes, two particular systems are studied in detail:\\ 1) a particle bound in a field of a single zero-range potential, 2) a particle bound in a field of two identical zero-range potentials."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884664","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"444","pagesFromTo":"168974 - 1-27","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70925d878c28a047394656","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Szmytkowski","uuid":"FA338A45EC095A5247B7429BEE9F02228283A42F775816DA9AC43631EB92C8DE7E6C2323F0795F49E6FEBAD43D1A3916D26C69C1D598D99C3664FBD122A0750E","orcidId":"0000-0003-4408-9417","documentHash":"99958cbb-dd0b-47f6-b084-243e840538de"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.aop.2022.168974"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS","MARINE NAVIGATION","MARINE SAFETY","POSITIONING SYSTEM"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a5878c28a047399dec"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Concept of Using the Decision-Robustness Function in Integrated Navigation Systems","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796fd","mniswId":"18383","title":"Sensors","doi":null,"issn":"1424-8220","eissn":"1424-3210","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"80ff8bca-a845-44fd-adcb-a436c0342b72"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca53214097077ac1cfaef8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ca53214097077ac1cfaef9","5e7092a5878c28a047399dec"]},"issue":"16","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The diversity and non-uniformity of the positioning systems available in maritime navigation systems often impede the watchkeeping officer in the selection of the appropriate positioning system, in particular, in restricted basins. Thus, it is necessary to introduce a mathematical apparatus to suggest, in an automated manner, which of the available systems should be used at the given moment of a sea trip. Proper selection of the positioning system is particularly important in integrated navigation systems, in which the excess of navigation information may impede the final determinations. In this article, the authors propose the use of the decision-robustness function to assist in the process of selecting the appropriate positioning system and reduce the impact of navigation observations encumbered with large errors in self-positioning accuracy. The authors present a mathematical apparatus describing the decision function (a priori object), with the determination of decision-assistance criteria, and the robustness function (a posteriori object), with different types of attenuation function.

The primary purpose of this study is to review the ROC curve models proposed in the literature, primarily in biostatistics, and to fit them to actual credit-scoring ROC data in order to determine which models could be used in credit-risk-management practice. We list several theoretical models for an ROC curve and describe them in the credit-scoring context. The model list includes the binormal, bigamma, bibeta, bilogistic, power, and bifractal curves. The models are then tested against empirical credit-scoring ROC data from publicly available presentations and papers, as well as from European retail lending institutions. Except for the power curve, all the presented models fit the data quite well. However, based on the results and other favourable properties, it is suggested that the binormal curve is the preferred choice for modelling credit-scoring ROC curves."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884675","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"184","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709447878c28a0473b976d","name":"Błażej","lastName":"Kochański","uuid":"CE3DEF8B4CF53D1C35FF4C9E1DEE4CE21483F16E54AE103C985287C86F76D0BC627D0C0FD14CEB9137C584F96C5CD7A229459B05B6F006A6D6894BE9ED85FB72","orcidId":"0000-0001-8502-931X","documentHash":"ff883c29-6370-4e7a-9dc6-efc8617e33aa"}],"doi":"10.3390/risks10100184"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["BOUNDARIES","BUILDINGS","ENERGY","LIGHTING","OCCUPANCY"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70920d878c28a04738f313","5e709445878c28a0473b9610","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2aff"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Boundary conditions for non-residential buildings from the user’s perspective: literature review","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aae","mniswId":"5678","title":"Energy and Buildings","doi":null,"issn":"0378-7788","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"18de315f-c2aa-472d-99dd-3b9c97d40f9e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca516a4097077ac1cf9457","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709445878c28a0473b9610","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2aff","5e70920d878c28a04738f313","64ca516a4097077ac1cf9458","64ca516a4097077ac1cf9459","64ca516a4097077ac1cf945a","64ca516a4097077ac1cf945b","64ca516a4097077ac1cf945c"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background and objective: This paper aims to review the boundary conditions (B/C) in specific categories (energy,\\nbuilding use, and lighting) within non-residential buildings to pave the way to a better understanding of users’\\nrequirements and needs of the built environment. For this paper, B/C are understood as unique preconditions, specific\\ncharacteristics for use, determining specific features of buildings, enabling an accurate understanding of non-residential\\nspaces concerning energy use, user behaviour, and lighting.\\nMethods: This paper describes the results of an overall quantitative (1st method) review and a systematic review (2nd\\nmethod) of boundary conditions and their factors within different types of non-residential buildings from the users’\\nperception. Followed by a qualitative experts’ literature review (3rd method) on B/C within offices, schools, and hospitals\\nchosen by a team of international experts working together on Subtask A: User perspective and requirements, Task 61\\nIEA (International Energy Agency): Solutions for daylighting and electric lighting. .\\nResults: The first review method led to the selection of 21 papers. The second method resulted in the selection of 7 papers\\nout of 93,143 found in Scopus; during the 3rd review, experts collectively chose 74 additional papers focussing on the\\nmain and users factors contributing to specific B/C. The scope of this paper is limited only to offices, schools, and\\nhospitals. Based on the findings, the authors recognise a broad definition of boundary conditions from specific values, and\\nconditions to interconnected factors, user profiles, functions of the building types, and operating hours.\\nConclusions: This paper provides an overview of B/C factors found in the literature that can help explain the occupants’\\nbehaviour and the use of spaces. B/C are often type of building/user/location/situation/simulation input-values and\\nmethod-specific. Therefore, they cannot be widely applicable but offer patterns and help to understand the correlations\\nbetween various factors shaping the built environment. A better comprehension of the reasons for identifying B/C and\\ntheir factors can help in developing a deeper knowledge of how we use buildings to find optimal ways to design

Analiza danych finansowych obejmowała lata 2017-2021 i została przeprowadzona z wykorzystaniem wskaźników struktury i dynamiki.\n\nWnioski – Główne zadanie ubezpieczenia chorobowego, jakim jest zabezpieczenie społeczne w zakresie ryzyka związanego z niezdolnością do pracy, jest realizowane w formie świadczeń t.j. zasiłek chorobowy, zasiłek wyrównawczy, świadczenie rehabilitacyjne oraz zasiłek macierzyński i opiekuńczy. Wydatki związane z wypłatą wskazanych świadczeń stanowią tylko około 10% ogółu wydatków Funduszu Ubezpieczeń Społecznych. W analizowanym okresie największe wahania wystąpiły w przypadku zasiłku opiekuńczego, co było spowodowane ograniczeniami związanymi z pandemią Covid-19.

Nessuna malattia, come quelle che investono la mente, hanno così drammaticamente bisogno di parole, di racconti per dirsi. Nessuna malattia, come la follia, porta il peso di miti, pregiudizi, stigmi che nei secoli l’hanno imprigionata, esclusa, messa a tacere. Il narratore ferito nella mente cerca di ridare voce e senso alla malattia e alla sua vita, attraverso il racconto, ristabilendo un legame tra illness, disease e sickness. Alla luce degli studi sulle illness narratives, il libro analizza racconti di malattia (Daniele Mencarelli, Alice Banfi, Andrea Pomella, Simona Vinci, Fuani Marino, Paolo Milone, Carlo Patriarca) rappresentativi di un fenomeno recente nella narrativa italiana: un considerevole incremento di narrazioni in cui il disagio mentale è centrale.

The scope of the paper is to investigate the influence of the drop panel size and stiffness on the behaviour of the connection between the flat slab and the column topped by the concrete head. The impact of the head size and stiffness is analysed analytically and experimentally. The experimental test results show that at a ratio  the heads are too flexible to cause punching shear outside the head, confirm significant concentrations of shear forces at the corners of the large support, and show a significant contribution of the linear parts of the control perimeter to the ultimate force transmitted by the slab-column joint. The authors compare the experimental test results with the considered standard calculation methods and indicate the correlations. The paper provides new experimental results and proposals for the application of a reduction factor for permissible shear stresses in the EC2 standard that depends on the dimension of the support. Simultaneously, the experimental results and the comparison with the standard calculations indicate a further need for research on the connection of a slab to a column topped by a drop panel."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884684","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"364","pagesFromTo":"129961","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca55204097077ac1cfcd4a","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Grabski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"857cff3b-9d8c-48b9-ad87-5e11bc1cda92"},{"objectId":"5e709248878c28a047393065","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Ambroziak","uuid":"54D701152C69F348384AD443F40DE7F8D8D0B52BD89DE3406D6A2DC5CF50C751D7A25BA461AAB7E7712CF126125507F1BD13C93042FFE9693919EA8E3648A260","orcidId":"0000-0002-7735-7863","documentHash":"12814137-eec4-4965-8f0b-6d4e06cb86ce"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2022.129961"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["kopalnia Turów","jakość życia","zrównoważony rozwój","zrównoważoność"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Turów mine","quality of life","sustainable development","sustainability"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Asymmetry as a Factor Weakening Resilience and Integration in the Sustainable Development of the Polish-Czech Borderland in the Context of the Dispute About the Turów Mine","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c28514547937d","mniswId":"16502","title":"Problemy Ekorozwoju","doi":null,"issn":"1895-6912","eissn":"2080-1971","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"1fd8f736-f111-43ed-96f8-61b5daa0c649"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2022-12-09","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64facc3840970739aa9d629a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709252878c28a047393a16","64facc3840970739aa9d629b","64facc3840970739aa9d629c"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"By analysing asymmetry in socioeconomic and environmental development in the Polish-Czech borderland, we\r\ncontribute to the discussion on its impacts as a factor weakening resilience and integration for the purposes of\r\nsustainable development in the region.

Data on patients treated in dermatology-venereology clinics in 2019-2020 were taken from the Statistical Bulletins of the Ministry of Health. The surveillance definition is: a confirmed case (means meeting the laboratory criteria), probable case (clinical criteria and an epidemiological link - contact with a confirmed case of gonorrhoea) and a possible case (the doctor diagnosed gonorrhoea).\nResults: Year 2019 was the one with the highest number of reported gonorrhoea cases over the 2014-2020 period - 522 cases and 1.37/100,000 population. In 2020, there was a decrease in cases by 47.13% (246 cases and 0.64/100,000 inhabitants). Delays in reporting were identified - between the diagnosis and the first notification for 2019 and 2020, on average, intervened 36 and 52 days, respectively. On the other hand, in dermatologyvenereology clinics, the number of people treated for gonorrhoea did not change - 448 in 2019 and 442 in 2020. \nConclusion: 1) The COVID-19 pandemic has deepened the problems of reporting good quality gonorrhoea data in epidemiological surveillance - the planning of appropriate preventive measures in central/local health policies is not possible. Improving surveillance and reporting of complete data on gonorrhoea cases is essential for reliable evaluation of the epidemiological situation. 2) Extensive prophylactic measures should be implemented (including for those under 18 years of age), targeting the source of and to cross routes of infection, including the promotion of safer sexual behaviors and informing the sexual partner."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884687","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6446649e4097070d1f54e632","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"76","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"7f81f67f-90b1-4b00-a8b3-b6e957a00b4b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"76","pagesFromTo":"591-603","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.32394/pe.76.54","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709429878c28a0473b75a4","name":"Marta","lastName":"Niedźwiedzka-Stadnik","uuid":"86A98B84CECEB379725AFEB4E72A88E307184FB0306AF3C4A9AFA784590FBAA1EDF1CB60AFF2E9CB481D5407E8A43F470AC342C512842B9DEC6E8DC208CC5DF9","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4a283148-0198-4584-9331-1b34d49d67de"},{"objectId":"5e70934a878c28a0473a6957","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Zakrzewska","uuid":"00A0B2760EBE229EF2D3EA0C9721C874E9AEF1310EB0E69E95258B6A065613476E732503AB42C6C4469B4EBDB18CBFD49D0DD03710F66B27A673AB6CACA71803","orcidId":"0000-0003-4131-4738","documentHash":"11011bb1-9421-49f1-8bb4-a1aa3185a8bb"}],"doi":"10.32394/pe.76.54"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CLIENT–SERVER","QOS ABUSE","QOS DIFFERENTIATION","STACKELBERG GAME"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70925d878c28a0473945d8"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Defending against Fake VIP in Scant-Transparency Information Systems with QoS Differentiation","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780d5","mniswId":"8327","title":"Information Sciences","doi":null,"issn":"0020-0255","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"4163795f-444a-41b6-b172-a0bdb2570867"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca51fb4097077ac1cf9d3d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70925d878c28a0473945d8"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In client-server information systems with quality of service (QoS) differentiation, Client may deplete Server’s resources by demanding unduly high QoS level. Such QoS abuse has eluded systematic treatment; known defenses using Client authorization, payments, or service request inspection prior to QoS assignment, are heuristic and environment-specific.\\nWe offer a game-theoretic approach on the premise that a service request is occasionally trusted to reduce the inspection cost. We call Fake VIP attack (FVA) a form of QoS abuse that consciously exploits Server’s trust. An FVA strategy instills trust to maximize Client’s utility gained from successful FVAs, whereas a trust strategy maximizes Server’s utility by trading her loss due to successful FVAs against the request inspection cost. We consider a realistic scant-transparency setting where only long-term utilities are observable. Against a probabilistic FVA strategy we design a trust strategy based on double-blind reputation. Assuming a memoryless service request stream we analyze the impact of the request inspection cost and information leakage on the utilities at the Stackelberg equilibrium of the arising game. Experimental comparison with a real-world internally correlated stream is also shown."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884689","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"607","pagesFromTo":"831 - 848","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70925d878c28a0473945d8","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Konorski","uuid":"943975176B0029105906CD08F21786179EC77FAD1C8345F6AB82FDF2161E0BE0B980B57B79E205DFCA416AFA872CDD9C8AB72F3B0CA7F6D5168F1BE74BB213E0","orcidId":"0000-0002-3091-1628","documentHash":"1de27920-70dc-4124-a036-48c0300b4f2f"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ins.2022.06.024"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["EXTRACTION","PHOTOGRAMMETRY","POINT CLOUD","RAILWAY LINE","UAV"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709447878c28a0473b9a08","5e709285878c28a0473972d5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Framework for extracting rails and setting-out railway line axis based on UAV photogrammetric measurements","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c57e","mniswId":"9307","title":"International Journal of Rail Transportation","doi":null,"issn":"2324-8378","eissn":"2324-8386","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"084fa429-272a-422a-8d8b-ad70acd14507"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca54524097077ac1cfc14c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709447878c28a0473b9a08","64ca54524097077ac1cfc14d","5e709285878c28a0473972d5","64ca54524097077ac1cfc14e","5e7094bd878c28a0473c2df6","64ca54524097077ac1cfc14f"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Technical diagnostics enables assessing the current technical condition of a railway line and adjacent infrastructure, and forecasting its changes over a specific time horizon.

The scientific novelty lies in the use of commercially available S 0378 dye, the reaction of which with BAs results in a colour change of the solution. Sample preparation and analysis were simplified to make the method suitable for routine analyses even in resource-scarce settings. The optimization of the method was carried out using a Box-Behnken response surface design.

Some equations or even specific values of such gap sizes between two buildings have been introduced so as to avoid collisions. Increasing the stiffness of buildings, using tuned mass dampers, applying liquid dampers, or decreasing the mass of the structures may reduce lateral displacements, and therefore pounding can be prevented. On the other hand, the application of base isolation systems may result in the elongation of the natural period of the building, thus increasing the probability of structural pounding. The aim of the present paper is to verify the effectiveness of using rubber bumpers to reduce the negative effects of earthquake- induced pounding between base-isolated buildings. The analysis was conducted for different gap sizes between buildings, as well as for various values of the thickness, number and stiffness of rubber bumpers. The results of the study show that the peak impact force decreases with increasing thickness, stiffness, and number of bumpers. Moreover, the peak impact forces are reduced with increasing gap size. The results of the investigation clearly indicate that the use of additional rubber bumpers can be considered an effective method for reducing the negative effects of earthquake-induced pounding between base-isolated buildings."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884698","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"4971","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca51844097077ac1cf95ca","name":"Alireza","lastName":"Sharbatdar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"89ad5643-9b6d-433d-b9d9-5600834a19c6"},{"objectId":"64ca51844097077ac1cf95c9","name":"Alireza","lastName":"Mortezaei","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"22801f40-01ca-4484-bf9c-7396c312b06f"},{"objectId":"64ca51844097077ac1cf95c8","name":"Hosein","lastName":"Naderpour","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d27c0a16-09ae-4394-aceb-6ead7426953a"},{"objectId":"64ca51844097077ac1cf95c7","name":"Khatami","lastName":"Mohamma

we present the application of 2-deoxy-D-glucose derivatives as chiral probes for elucidation of the absolute configuration of chiral secondary alcohols. The probes are attached to the studied molecules via glycosylation reaction and the resulting products are examined by a set of standard 2D NMR experiments. The absolute configuration of an oxymethine carbon atom binding the probe is established on a basis of a set of diagnostic dipolar couplings (NOEs/ROEs). These correlations may be considered diagnostic due to a pronounced lack of conformational freedom of the formed glycosidic linkage.

The signals registered by a specially designed sensor network are processed to assess the state of the tested structure. Despite the constant development of novel damage detection algorithms employing guided waves, the phenomenon of wave propagation still needs detailed recognizing and understanding for the further progress of non-destructive wave-based methods. Special attention is paid to guided waves in plate-like structures, but the majority of considered cases concern plates with constant thickness. However, in the real world, we often deal with specimens with variable thickness. The thickness variability of the specimen is often forced to fulfill the construction requirements and optimize stress distribution or is the result of degradation i.e. corrosion. Thus, the development of NDT methods forces the need of considering specimens with complex geometry and the problem of wave propagation in waveguides with variable thickness is crucial for improving novel as well as so far proposed algorithms.\\n\\nThe article presents the results of the analytical, numerical and experimental analysis of wave propagation in plates with variable thickness. The analysis concerns the influence of thickness distribution of plate structure on wave velocity, the time course wave packet and amplitude. Moreover, the novel approach based on constrained convex optimization for determining the plate thickness distribution has been proposed and verified during numerical and experimental campaigns."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884705","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"196","pagesFromTo":"111221","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709389878c28a0473ac2cb","name":"Beata","lastName":"Zima","uuid":"3A1C10B8894F1B129C4B22404E23842279DC23E037B47D1862A33A506B7F264817992E432A9DB8EEF87663BF5554607FC318688369FC2D1418D6C7ADEEE948C7","orcidId":"0000-0001-8228-5959","documentHash":"ea7189a4-f9f1-44d5-af88-7f0eb2e2bd07"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.measurement.2022.111221"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["SHALLOW WATER WAVES BURGER'S EQUATION NUMERICAL METHODS"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709248878c28a047392f6d","61cd27b87523401fc10dfca2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Some new soliton solutions to the higher dimensional Burger–Huxley and Shallow water waves equation with couple of integration architectonic","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479540","mniswId":"17294","title":"Results in Physics","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2211-3797","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"369b6a49-1df2-4b64-8fe2-c9ad8ccd6bd5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca543a4097077ac1cfbfb2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ca543a4097077ac1cfbfb3","64ca543a4097077ac1cfbfb4","64ca543a4097077ac1cfbfb5","64ca543a4097077ac1cfbfb6","64ca543a4097077ac1cfbfb7","64ca543a4097077ac1cfbfb8","61cd27b87523401fc10dfca2","5e709248878c28a047392f6d"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, we retrieve some traveling wave, periodic solutions, bell shaped, rational, kink and anti-kink type and Jacobi elliptic functions of Burger’s equation and Shallow water wave equation with the aid of various integration schemes like improved -expansion scheme and Jacobi elliptic function method respectively.

Powierzono jej zarówno kontrolowanie przestrzegania przepisów o ochronie środowiska w bardzo szerokim zakresie, jak i samodzielne prowadzenie niektórych czynności o charakterze operacyjnym oraz nadano uprawnienia śledcze. Rola Inspekcji Ochrony Środowiska będzie w przyszłości wzrastać, o czym świadczy powołanie w 2021 r. Departamentu Zwalczania Przestępczości Środowiskowej w Głównym Inspektoracie Ochrony Środowiska. Jak do tej pory zdecydowaną większość postępowań karnych w sprawach środowiskowych prowadzi Policja. Nie posiada ona jednak wyspecjalizowanych komórek w tym zakresie i czynności prowadzone są przez policyjny pion zwalczania przestępstw gospodarczych.

So far, the vast majority of investigations concerning environmental crimes are conducted by the Police. There are, however, no specialised police units fighting environmental crimes and corresponding activities are carried out by departments combating economic crimes. Cases concerning organized forms of environmental crime are conducted by the Central Investigation Bureau of Police. No coherent strategy to combat environmental crime has been developed so far.

These discrepancies decrease with increasing heating power and plate surface temperature, in proportion to the increase in Ra and Nu, reaching typical values for this type of research. To explain this phenomenon, a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of the influence of the physical properties of a fluid (air and water) as well as primary (tw and t∞) and secondary (tav and Δt) temperatures on the Rayleigh number was carried out. The impact was found to be unequal. The plate temperature tw is of greater importance, which is much higher than the much lower and almost constant temperature t∞ of the undisturbed area, especially since it causes convective movement, generating differences in fluid density and thus driving the phenomenon. Similarly, the direct contribution of the temperature difference Δt to Ra suggests that it has a greater influence on convective heat transfer than the average temperature of the medium tav.\\n\\nBy analysing the effect of each of these temperatures separately, it was possible to show that their mutual, compatible or opposite interaction (tw/t∞) causes a different scattering of results, or may even lead to unusual Rayleigh numbers (Ra temperature dualism). This study led not only to a better understanding of the phenomenon, but even to a prediction of its unusual behaviour, unheard of in typical experimental studies of free convection.\\n\\nFor example, if we consider the theoretical convective heat transfer from a plate l = 0.15 m in air in the context of the interaction of tav and Δt, it turns out that for the same Δt = 40 K, the Rayleigh number may assume, depending on tav = (tw + t∞)/2, different values. So, for tw = 50 °C, t∞ = 10 °C and tav = 30 °C, Ra = 1.213.107, whereas for tw = 90 °C, t∞ = 50 °C and tav = 70 °C it is ≈ 1.7 times smaller (Ra = 0.687.107). This hypothetical phenomenon, unheard of in typical experimental studies, which could occur, and maybe even does occur in smelting, thermal energy, etc., forces us to think about the values of Nusselt numbers, heat transfer coefficients and heat fluxes for these two cases. This lies beyond the scope of the present paper, but it is a topic for possible future research."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884713","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"181","pagesFromTo":"107744","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca52134097077ac1cf9ea4","name":"Grzegorz J.","lastName":"Kwiatkowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6c9ce556-649c-42bc-9ed0-46870fb5cfb9"},{"objectId":"5e70926c878c28a047395585","name":"Michał","lastName":"Ryms","uuid":"C1CA06F831F32F493259E5A9B8A7206B152A8CB61ECC32D08D3575816FCF61A2DF79099A699B3D2E811DEEDD82EF60D5D4CDFC9133114914C8CB493F4BC0C984","orcidId":"0000-0002-0078-2992","documentHash":"0b0800c9-8489-4850-b86a-9a1efd35e923"},{"objectId":"5e70925d878c28a0473946fe","name":"Witold","lastName":"Lewandowski","uuid":"4450A8917751404FB50D1E30EB0355C30DD437DDD91D269A9AE3ED6A495632282121D88F7AF61A1F0C0C8C80555C3B6783096C61BC1627126B58D5A78D1653D0","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d6d4aa26-7180-4fd5-8b65-f6f7a5c9100d"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2022.107744"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CLUSTERS","COMPETENCIES","OPEN INNOVATION"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a5878c28a047399dda","5e709445878c28a0473b95d4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"What Skills for Multi-Partner Open Innovation Projects?

Open innovation ventures are seen as intricate collaborations that require the commitment of numer- ous partners during the lifetime of the project. In order to examine the specific competence of open innovation teams, we set the research question as follows: What individual competencies facilitate the exchange of knowledge in open innovation projects? We explored the theoretical framework of open innovation and collected information from a nation-wide, cross-industrial set of OI projects from three high-performing clusters, facilitating a total of 102 OI projects to identify open innovation competence dimensions, thus creating a novel profile. The outcomes showed that competencies facilitate the exchange of knowledge in open innovation ventures in distinct ways. Our findings showed that open innovation competence can be captured using a profile with the dimensions of creativity, entrepreneurship, communication and networking, open-minded thinking, risk-taking, and self-efficacy in digital skills. These dimensions of the open innovation competence profile are necessary for cluster project set-up. This analysis demonstrated that components of the open innova- tion competence profile could be paramount in understanding the underlying factors in the success of collaborative innovation projects."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884715","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"13330","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca53f94097077ac1cfbc0c","name":"Silke","lastName":"Tegtmeier","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a4972496-eb56-44f5-ba24-78a84ee67e32"},{"objectId":"64ca53f94097077ac1cfbc0b","name":"Tatjana","lastName":"Nikitina","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0757e03d-0e32-4fb2-8639-c4628adfb5d5"},{"objectId":"5e709445878c28a0473b95d4","name":"MARITA","lastName":"MCPHILLIPS","uuid":"69DE1E7BF785D92ED7158EFDD3C487E30CD9C427BAF676570F36D7354051EC69C33D23776C50B08AE98C5DAE78EB98AC098A718B9C4993B82FCDEB498597ABB5","orcidId":"0000-0003-1181-669X","documentHash":"997ef925-59f5-4e08-9b88-a39e146ec1c7"},{"objectId":"5e7092a5878c28a047399dda","name":"Michał","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"663BD36BE4DAA51770266138FA221AA87D98FDCD8625448FF57201B87C0D54625A8EF9AF0FA6B407245A67B7C6E1623CF817EE316277B891E28EC74854ACB95F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0934-7815","documentHash":"f656e0e2-66fd-4b54-9e50-2d4f18f88379"}],"doi":"10.3390/su142013330"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["TISSUE ADHESIVES,POLYSACCHARIDESBIO-ADHESIVESBIO-GLUEBIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70926c878c28a04739554f","6110ee1b9543c757bc082820"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Biomedical engineering of polysaccharide-based tissue adhesives: Recent advances and future direction","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547753f","mniswId":"3243","title":"Carbohydrate Polymers","doi":null,"issn":"0144-8617","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"c286039e-3a04-4eba-ac21-f6a7e1962904"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca524a4097077ac1cfa226","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ca524a4097077ac1cfa227","64ca524a4097077ac1cfa228","64ca524a4097077ac1cfa229","64ca524a4097077ac1cfa22a","64ca524a4097077ac1cfa22b","64ca524a4097077ac1cfa22c","5e70926c878c28a04739554f","6110ee1b9543c757bc082820"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Tissue adhesives have been widely used for preventing wound leaks, sever bleeding, as well as for enhancing drug delivery and biosensing.

Herein we overview the history of tissue adhesives, different types of polysaccharide-based tissue adhesives, their mechanism of gluing, and different applications of polysaccharide-based tissue adhesives. We also highlight the latest progresses in engineering of tissue adhesives followed by existing challenges in fabrication processes.

high entropy alloy (HEA) filler used during the fabrication method determines the reliability of HEAs for steel-aluminum dissimilar alloy configuration. HEAs have a direct impact on the formation of intermetallic compounds (IMC) formed by the interaction of iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al), and influence the size of the joint’s interaction zone. A novel welding process for Fe-Al alloy joints was developed to prevent the development of a brittle iron-aluminum interface. This research involved investigation of the possibility of using HEA powdered filler. Fe5Co20Ni20Mn35Cu20 HEAs was used as a filler for the laser joining lap configuration joining hyper-duplex stainless steel UNS S33207 to aluminum alloy 6061. This HEA has unique properties, such as high strength, good ductility, and high resistance to corrosion and wear. A tiny portion of the stainless-steel area was melted by varying the welding parameters. The high-entropy alloy (HEA) with slow kinetic diffusion and large entropy was employed to aid in producing solid solution structures, impeding the blending of iron and aluminum particles and hindering the development of Fe-Al IMCs. The weld seam was created without the use of Fe-Al IMCs,. The specimen broke at the HEAs/Al alloy interface with a tensile-shear strength of 237 MPa. The tensile-shear strength achieved was 12.86% higher than for the base metal AA 6061 and 75.57% lower than for the UNS S33207 hyper-duplex stainless steel."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884725","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"2849","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca504e4097077ac1cf83d2","name":"Sasan Sattarpanah","lastName":"Karganroudi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"47e6d715-28b8-4605-bc98-e5a1634fd79f"},{"objectId":"64ca504e4097077ac1cf83d1","name":"Dhanesh G.","lastName":"Mohan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d0e5896b-df57-4b0d-a5ae-d8001bbaddfc"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac1b6","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Tomków","uuid":"07FB9261BB193F37726CBAFE9495F456E35B5E9919E3B56C839ECBDF6E4605912060B19753178713F184B410443E21B1871D5CDBD016FD1FE39C0CB74A79A2B3","orcidId":"0000-0003-1096-7779","documentHash":"dbf01021-32db-471c-a6b4-b30f150beadc"}],"doi":"10.3390/app12062849"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["FIBROUS COMPOSITES, IN-PLANE BENDING, ISOGEOMETRIC ANALYSIS, MATERIAL INSTABILITY, NONLINEAR KIRCHHOFF-LOVE SHELLS, STRAIN GRADIENT THEORY"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602cd10c9543c7410626e3cd"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A general isogeometric finite element formulation for rotation‐free shells with in‐plane bending of embedded fibers","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478153","mniswId":"8558","title":"International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering","doi":null,"issn":"0029-5981","eissn":"1097-0207","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b2d2add5-bde0-4287-ae9a-45488e256d9c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca511f4097077ac1cf8ff6","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ca511f4097077ac1cf8ff7","64ca511f4097077ac1cf8ff8","602cd10c9543c7410626e3cd"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article presents a general, nonlinear isogeometric finite element formulation for rotation-free shells with embedded fibers that captures anisotropy in stretching, shearing, twisting, and bending - both in-plane and out-of-plane. These capabilities allow for the simulation of large sheets of heterogeneous and fibrous materials either with or without matrix, such as textiles, composites, and\\npantographic structures. The work is a computational extension of our earlier theoretical work that extends existing Kirchhoff-Love shell theory to incorporate the in-plane bending resistance of initially straight or curved fibers. The formulation requires only displacement degrees-of-freedom to capture all mentioned modes of deformation. To this end, isogeometric shape functions are used in order to satisfy the required C1-continuity for bending across element boundaries. The proposed formulation can admit a wide range of material models, such as surface hyperelasticity that does not require any explicit thickness integration.

Referring to research and media analyses of the representation of this phenomenon, attempts were made to reveal the causes and valuations attributed to it. The media discourse on poverty shapes and proliferates social perceptions about it. It is crucial because it influences how fellow citizens treat the poor and policies aimed at minimising this phenomenon. Two dominant mass media narratives about those affected by poverty can be divided as follows: 1) the deserving poor worthy of support because their poverty is due to external sources beyond their power, and 2) the undeserving poor, who are themselves responsible for their material situation due to bad attitudes, habits, and deviant behaviours"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884728","journalIssue":{"objectId":"64ae6bf44097077279b00ff3","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"66","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"1279cb3d-093a-4ed8-a4ac-c87a17cf594b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"66","pagesFromTo":"31-44","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"pol","title":"Ubóstwo i osoby ubogie w dyskursie medialnym w Polsce – współczucie czy obwinianie?"}],"publicUri":"https://czasopisma.kul.pl/index.php/znkul/article/download/15508/14487","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70922a878c28a047390ebb","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Pokrzywa","uuid":"B434B2CFC835A6A3CF5BE5A9C065CA15989FC2E392DE648ADE902CFEB32DDA19F690570AE7BD494856A03B85F6436941522A94C883469B9025215874651F3B86","orcidId":"0000-0002-1546-2270","documentHash":"f0047933-3b24-4114-a2de-2cd2c6d9a66c"}],"doi":"10.31743/znkul.15508"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["LINEAR ELASTICITY","STRAIN GRADIENT ELASTICITY","STRONG ELLIPTICITY","TOUPIN–MINDLIN FIRST STRAIN GRADIENT ELASTICITY"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094df878c28a0473c5abb"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Strong ellipticity within the Toupin–Mindlin first strain gradient elasticity theory","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478de8","mniswId":"14101","title":"Mechanics Research Communications","doi":null,"issn":"0093-6413","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"21ec3496-9fec-400f-91d3-4a635fb68a8a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca52e04097077ac1cfabb5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094df878c28a0473c5abb","64ca52e04097077ac1cfabb6"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We discuss the strong ellipticity (SE) condition within the Toupin–Mindlin first strain gradient elasticity theory.

The degradation level of ship structural elements has been assessed in two different ways. The first one is based on the spectral decomposition and zero-crossing incorporated reconstruction of the dispersion curve approach of the antisymmetric Lamb wave mode and the best matching of the theoretical solution. The second approach was based on searching for a solution to the convex optimization problem. In the first case, the plate thickness is assumed to be constant and the phase velocity reconstructed curve is fitted to match the best solution in the all considered frequency domain. In the second case, the assumption about the varying plate thickness is set and the optimal thickness distribution resulting in any times of wave flight is defined."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884735","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"253","pagesFromTo":"111318","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca50d74097077ac1cf8b94","name":"Yordan","lastName":"Garbatov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9c54fe6b-9602-475c-99e9-d9fc71e3d7ad"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b45","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Wołoszyk","uuid":"E71718625EECEBE8564AC993A2926445CE07F00E21F96B6469C16766EC525969948CD0DF85CD5E8EFF162370BDC32AB22DE6A17A5D9D8A2BF927DA6F50B83BDA","orcidId":"0000-0002-9088-8570","documentHash":"23ca6d93-963e-4488-93c0-d7621bd2e27e"},{"objectId":"5e709389878c28a0473ac2cb","name":"Beata","lastName":"Zima","uuid":"3A1C10B8894F1B129C4B22404E23842279DC23E037B47D1862A33A506B7F264817992E432A9DB8EEF87663BF5554607FC318688369FC2D1418D6C7ADEEE948C7","orcidId":"0000-0001-8228-5959","documentHash":"ea7189a4-f9f1-44d5-af88-7f0eb2e2bd07"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.oceaneng.2022.111318"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ALUMINIUM ALLOY","CORROSION","FRICTION STIR WELDING","RESIDUAL STRESS","WILLIAMSON-HALL ANALYSIS"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709248878c28a047392ffb","5e709423878c28a0473b6fac","5e70939a878c28a0473ad979","602f3d1e9543c7410626f243"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Corrosion Properties of Dissimilar AA6082/AA6060 Friction Stir Welded Butt Joints in Different NaCl Concentrations","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454782a0","mniswId":"9271","title":"International Journal of Precision Engineering and Manufacturing - Green Technology","doi":null,"issn":"2288-6206","eissn":"2198-0810","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"8d985d8b-2704-4eb5-8aad-217e679a676a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca51f14097077ac1cf9cd4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602f3d1e9543c7410626f243","5e709248878c28a047392ffb","5e709423878c28a0473b6fac","5e70939a878c28a0473ad979"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A solid-state friction stir welding method which is increasingly used in the marine and shipbuilding industry, has been developed to produce welds with high mechanical properties. In seawater, the oxide layer of aluminium is attacked by Cl− ions resulting in its disruption and formation of pitting corrosion. It is particularly important to determine the electrochemical properties of the produced welds and to evaluate the efect of welding parameters on these properties. The following paper presents a study on the corrosion properties of welds of dissimilar aluminium alloys, AA6082 and AA6060, produced for two diferent tool traverse speeds of 160 and 200 mm/min, with consideration of the size of crystallites and residual stresses in the samples, determined by Williamson-Hall analysis and micro-indentation tests. The results revealed that the size of the crystallites in the welds was larger compared to the base materials and the friction mstir welding process generated residual  compressive stresses. Furthermore, the welds exhibited higher corrosion resistance compared to the parent materials. Scanning electron microscope observations indicated that the preferred locations of corrosion propagation for welds are the edges  on the joint line formed by the combination of rotational and linear motion of the tool."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884736","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"457 - 477","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602f3d1e9543c7410626f243","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Laska","uuid":"B86B1C21D25381567E0DF5ADDADCD481E3A27C6AA967BDADEA417F546CB7708F50A08990D7EAE140C526E596F1D8CECEC48178A54B502535805A49BF68E634EA","orcidId":"0000-0002-4872-3959","documentHash":"2be4ccfa-a72a-4254-a90a-9fad39d5a123"},{"objectId":"5e709423878c28a0473b6fac","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Pawłowski","uuid":"8C02312E2528FEAD3221AE78F163D0B461ADB93474B9B5760CB6E3132433D81B1D66AFD9FFD150CDE00547C89F9651E28CFBA5885F1BBEB67C694E4A144E427A","orcidId":"0000-0002-3321-9207","documentHash":"ca204fe3-0502-416b-8dcd-e1225ef08b7d"},{"objectId":"5e70939a878c28a0473ad979","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Gajowiec","uuid":"BB4ED6F62B051D965573461C6E1BAD7F8001C28F50D09F8B91BA2E001F8A77385532E17E4593A4B91AF93766B7361E3A3315F8264CB782CE3C0CE0578031230A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"27ba1bc7-13cb-4691-bfb2-43acb5ba1d17"},{"objectId":"5e709248878c28a047392ffb","name":"Marek","lastName":"Szkodo","uuid":"60454E80C9592FD2E65CD95532E0517D955D8E35E3A560A78179C6DC7D792BEE6FD0B3173DAD7BCE87776DDD5354580991088819D337A96A73532BE8FC082D9D","orcidId":"0000-0002-4210-0718","documentHash":"a68a0924-2f8f-45b8-930f-83786725aa6f"}],"doi":"10.1007/s40684-022-00441-z"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["DEEP EUTECTIC SOLVENTS (DES)","EXTRACTION","NEUTRAL RED DYE","SAMPLE PREPARATION","SPECTROPHOTOMETRIC ANALYSIS"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["630981a87523404ea2459f0b","64ca53924097077ac1cfb62f","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bfa","603dfaca9543c711bc6e9f56"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Ultrasound-Assisted Dispersive Liquid-Liquid Microextraction Using Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) for Neutral Red Dye Spectrophotometric Determination","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":null,"issn":"1420-3049","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"85ea3d3d-2670-4384-98ee-1b5b44edab21"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca53924097077ac1cfb62b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ca53924097077ac1cfb62c","603dfaca9543c711bc6e9f56","64ca53924097077ac1cfb62d","64ca53924097077ac1cfb62e","64ca53924097077ac1cfb62f","64ca53924097077ac1cfb630","630981a87523404ea2459f0b","64ca53924097077ac1cfb631","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bfa"]},"issue":"18","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Deep eutectic solvents (DES), which have low toxicity and are low cost, biodegradable, and easily synthesized, were used for the extraction of neutral red (NR) dye before its spectrophotometric analysis. DES, containing choline chloride as a hydrogen bond acceptor and phenol as a hydrogen bond donor with a molar ratio of 1:2, was used for the extraction of NR dye from aqueous media. The possible interaction of different DESs with NR was studied using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Experimentally, a UV-visible spectrophotometer was used for the quantitative analysis. The most important parameters affecting method performance, such as pH, extraction temperature, DES type, its volume, THF volume, sonication time, and centrifugation time, were optimized. The developed method provides exceptional sensitivity in terms of LOD and LOQ, which were 2.2 and 7.3 µg/L respectively. The relative standard deviation was 1.35–1.5% (n = 10), and the pre-concentration factor was 40. The method was found to be linear in the range of 2–300 µg/L (R2 = 0.9967). The method was successfully used for the determination of NR in wastewater samples. Finally, the DES-based method presents operational simplicity, high sensitivity, and rapid determination (<5 min) compared with other analytical procedures."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884738","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"6112","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca53924097077ac1cfb631","name":"Roberto","lastName":"Castro-Muñoz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1bac875c-2295-48d8-8629-c6ad164fbc02"},{"objectId":"64ca53924097077ac1cfb630","name":"Muhammad Balal","lastName":"Arain","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5899199d-9d55-4aeb-ad16-05ce151bd7d6"},{"objectId":"64ca53924097077ac1cfb62f","name":"Faisal","lastName":"Safi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"04e8a51a-115d-439e-9fef-11ca9726bc86"},{"objectId":"64ca53924097077ac1cfb62e","name":"Faheem","lastName":"Jan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"be9e6539-170c-4332-bb53-6c016edae509"},{"objectId":"64ca53924097077ac1cfb62d","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Salman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6d586da2-a43a-406e-9929-37ab4e64ff1a"},{"objectId":"64ca53924097077ac1cfb62c","name":"Sana","lastName":"Ullah","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e2f02059-e516-4c38-87a2-bb9538c8fad2"},{"objectId":"630981a87523404ea2459f0b","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Khan","uuid":"F505FE3373D36E79010FFA71C0F223949C3CC0700D3A223DFFB6C390EA3B98FAD2B12EDE2938327A96C9C7157B9FCF806C74C508B48CAD87E38E62E62EB60C84","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e115fbee-f30f-4600-a4a4-e7e9fb294517"},{"objectId":"603dfaca9543c711bc6e9f56","name":"Hameed","lastName":"Haq","uuid":"568995A45FCFE91DA6578C2A1CD4409E9D364C3711736E9A44F4AFF71C42F35D87FD79ABEC60289A71E09EB7D308B0FA59F32E976F97E78C9284C791FC1370C0","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"71e820a9-d4bb-4608-ab66-e2e745d3a19b"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bfa","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Boczkaj","uuid":"9715EEAC4EAC127938012022C0A4ACD790F5566C9874EA60AB7E89002295933280DEA7551C62372A75C17B38F1F0807E49E0E86AD99D77507A737739E955F2FE","orcidId":"0000-0002-5874-7591","documentHash":"c246f4c1-d0f2-47ee-a492-b341b7da4144"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules27186112"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["re-imagination","self-translation","creative experimentation","multimodality","intersemiotic translation","Mieczysław Piotrowski","The Grey Ear"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","uid":"bhdVW0TkXv39ZSgac65mGnw","uuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","parentUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","rootUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","name":"Uniwersytet Komisji Edukacji Narodowej w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709292878c28a047398242"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Authorial Re-imagination in Comics and Picturebooks: Transformations of The Grey Ear","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d54878c28514547ae54","mniswId":"23543","title":"inTRAlinea","doi":null,"issn":"1827-000X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f4ee6c84-a9c3-4220-a564-f4050ee5f05a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64f985cd40970774bad8dc34","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709292878c28a047398242"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article analyses a comic book as part of an existing multimodal network of related entities, from a book to interlingual translations. It focuses on authorial re-imagination of an already existing work as one of the ways in which comics can be created. Authorial re-imagination is understood as a type of self-translation: a voluntary, creative transformation of the author’s own previous work, which may involve diverse and complex transfers between different media formats, taking place shortly after the creation of the first work or at later points in time, bearing affinities to Jakobson’s intrasemiotic translation. Typically discussed in a bilingual context, self-translations as intralingual multimodal re-writings also constitute, as the article argues, a category deserving of critical engagement. As a case in point, the article investigates an early avant-garde comic Szare Uszko (The Grey Ear, 1975) by Mieczysław Piotrowski, a reworking of his earlier book of the same title (Szare Uszko, 1963). Although created in a constrained context of communist Poland, the comic is an intriguing example of artistic innovation, heralding postmodernist trends in disguise of children’s literature. The analysis shows how the author skilfully and creatively self-translates his previous iconotext into the language of the comic genre and how the re-imagined work reflects the author’s growing anticipation of the postmodern: experimentation with form, plot fragmentation and discontinuity, self-reflexivity and playfulness. Out of the multimodal network around Szare Uszko, it is the comic in its original language which has proved lasting influence."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884740","journalIssue":{"objectId":"64f985cd40970774bad8dc35","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"25","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"da31fc9b-a253-465a-839d-011887e8fb33"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"25","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.intralinea.org/specials/article/2631","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398242","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Dybiec-Gajer","uuid":"5CD23AA215F356B1C6A3A334CADC8BF4DDCD755560A0C82056F60401A96233731DF3496746271D0599B6936C08A147E0B0E86C83FE62BC697D5E5639DF536D74","orcidId":"0000-0002-5349-6842","documentHash":"2dcc8cd2-a542-4a12-9cfb-2ea796abcfcc"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deff","uid":"by4PCcB-mQ7_XWJ3RZHOwLw","uuid":"617decfb-3a18-4108-bfde-bfe68fa3c662","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deff","parentUuid":"617decfb-3a18-4108-bfde-bfe68fa3c662","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deff","rootUuid":"617decfb-3a18-4108-bfde-bfe68fa3c662","name":"Narodowy Instytut Zdrowia Publicznego PZH – Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fb878c28a0473b45c3","5e7094f1878c28a0473c783a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Sensitive Method of Determination of Hazardous Phthlates in Polymeric Building Materials by High Performance Liquid Chromatography","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"64f9ae6b40970774bae0ec9a","mniswId":null,"title":"Rocznik Ochrona Środowiska","doi":null,"issn":"2720-7501","eissn":null,"websiteLink":"https://ros.edu.pl/index.php/en/?view=article&id=1111:2022-vol-24-en-08&catid=92:2022-vol-24-en","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"b0d72387-f895-4f06-ab12-04abab82aeb5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64f9ae6b40970774bae0ec99","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093fb878c28a0473b45c3","5e7094f1878c28a0473c783a"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Polymeric building materials and equipment for indoor use in spaces intended for people may, in an essential way, contribute to the deterioration of wholesome quality of life. Phthalates, present in many products, constitute an omnipresent group of compounds used widely as plasticisers. The research results show that these substances may negatively impact human health, and thus European Union has implemented several regulatory measures restricting their use. Manufacturers and suppliers must comply with these regulations. As a result, it is necessary to investigate and determine the contents of phthalates in these materials. This paper presents the analytic profile of the method of marking phthalates extracted from polyvinyl chloride using HPLC chromatography with UV-VIS detection and selected results obtained in examinations of materials used in interior design. The results of described examinations of phthalates content indicate that not all materials recommended by manufacturers may be used indoors in spaces intended for people. The method was verified for its suitability for routine analyses of materials made of PVC and submitted for attestation. The elaborated method can be used to determine the banned phthalates’ presence in PVC. The method allows for detecting these phthalates at the level required by the REACH regulation, and its validation parameters are highly satisfactory considering a very complex matrix."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884742","journalIssue":{"objectId":"64f9ae6b40970774bae0ec9b","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"24","number":null,"doi":"10.54740/ros.2022.014","documentHash":"4a4680de-2427-4255-8959-0eceb7db0ef4"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"190-201","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.54740/ros.2022.014","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094f1878c28a0473c783a","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Kaczmarczyk","uuid":"F6C72236E4BA1E4509BF0206637D49430EFA3F8498FB96BA4DB13C45315098917B49AEC58623753D48CD9593E32786305A02F9765AC2D371F210A479A4899A9F","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"31d9f0f4-7743-49cf-a65e-a6117cb5b28b"},{"objectId":"5e7093fb878c28a0473b45c3","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Kaniowska","uuid":"1BEB72530B4257770408900BD55D1A9191749587BFAF79B4F91EC0998B7320EE3271C16A514A784E7B5D8A4403D2CC10AF95510FF907A79C0B9D60DD37129C77","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dd2623c0-cddd-4366-a40f-b96ee923a6b5"}],"doi":"10.54740/ros.2022.014"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de6b","uid":"bNWXY3ewtn9TlYIbns6NsZQ","uuid":"9e04afdc-5fef-43e3-a5d0-6050e5afbe7f","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de6b","parentUuid":"9e04afdc-5fef-43e3-a5d0-6050e5afbe7f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de6b","rootUuid":"9e04afdc-5fef-43e3-a5d0-6050e5afbe7f","name":"Państwowa Akademia Nauk Stosowanych im.

Controlling this process requires a strict coordination of many factors at different levels of the functioning of genetic and hormonal changes as well as cellular organization. One of the most important examples is the transcriptional activity of the LAFL gene regulatory network, which includes LEAFY COTYLEDON1 (LEC1) and LEC1-LIKE (L1L) and ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3), FUSCA3 (FUS3), and LEC2 (LEAFY COTYLEDON2), as well as hormonal homeostasis-of abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellins (GA) in particular. From the nutritional point of view, the key to seed development is the ability of seeds to accumulate large amounts of proteins with different structures and properties. The world's food deficit is mainly related to shortages of protein, and taking into consideration the environmental changes occurring on Earth, it is becoming necessary to search for a way to obtain large amounts of plant-derived protein while maintaining the diversity of its origin. Yellow lupin, whose storage proteins are conglutins, is one of the plant species native to Europe that accumulates large amounts of this nutrient in its seeds. In this article we have shown the key changes occurring in the developing seeds of the yellow-lupin cultivar Taper by means of modern molecular biology techniques, including RNA-seq, chromatographic techniques and quantitative PCR analysis. We identified regulatory genes fundamental to the seed-filling process, as well as genes encoding conglutins. We also investigated how exogenous application of ABA and GA3 affects the expression of LlLEC2, LlABI3, LlFUS3, and genes encoding β- and δ-conglutins and whether it results in the amount of accumulated seed storage proteins. The research shows that for each species, even related plants, very specific changes can be identified. Thus the analysis and possibility of using such an approach to improve and stabilize yields requires even more detailed and extended research."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884747","journalIssue":{"objectId":"64ccddf64097074f2a2a37b9","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"24","number":"15","doi":null,"documentHash":"4b600b47-ed54-4a40-bbf2-fe2a1c90062f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"12380","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/15/12380/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64f9b57740970774bae16c14","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Wojciechowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4189bc67-e4ac-4e9d-a026-a8d73acadea7"},{"objectId":"64f9b57740970774bae16c13","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Kęsy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9db3dd5b-481c-4ab1-bcba-7e8e44d432c9"},{"objectId":"64f9b57740970774bae16c12","name":"Hubert","lastName":"Kugiel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3c5d211d-696d-4ee0-89c2-98fd9b723fb0"},{"objectId":"64f9b57740970774bae16c11","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Glazińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"55277bb1-77ca-47e5-8612-e8be49143353"},{"objectId":"64f9b57740970774bae16c10","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Pasikowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"08005734-8540-4063-af21-9668b164d793"},{"objectId":"64f9b57740970774bae16c0f","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Klajn","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9acc2252-87eb-4b1a-bd88-a54b97b4d610"},{"objectId":"5e70949c878c28a0473c05af","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kapczyńska","uuid":"2845ECEA973B549A05F8DE32DC13EFCF73EBFE1C476EC6ED0C640BB06B4F018B12806DBF6174BD221EE1B4EAD5A79F7FEC9FB8E557A2E1B78C20136FDA73976A","orcidId":"0000-0003-2722-9596","documentHash":"d31e95b5-120f-4b91-8244-ce797171a55a"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms241512380"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ALEXNET","BIDIRECTIONAL LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY","CHANGE DETECTION","FEATURE WEIGHTED ATTENTION","VGG16"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709388878c28a0473ac079","5e70925d878c28a04739461d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Feature Weighted Attention-Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory Model for Change Detection in Remote Sensing Images","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454794f5","mniswId":"17167","title":"Remote Sensing","doi":null,"issn":"2072-4292","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"adfc571f-e92f-4da0-8504-22894916b3f6"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca544f4097077ac1cfc131","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ca544f4097077ac1cfc132","64ca544f4097077ac1cfc133","5e709388878c28a0473ac079","5e70925d878c28a04739461d","64ca544f4097077ac1cfc134"]},"issue":"21","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In remote sensing images, change detection (CD) is required in many applications, such as: resource management, urban expansion research, land management, and disaster assessment. Various deep learning-based methods were applied to satellite image analysis for change detection, yet many of them have limitations, including the overfitting problem. This research proposes the Feature Weighted Attention (FWA) in Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) method to reduce the overfitting problem and increase the performance of classification in change detection applications. Additionally, data usage and accuracy in remote sensing activities, particularly CD, can be significantly improved by a large number of training models based on BiLSTM. Normalization techniques are applied to input images in order to enhance the quality and reduce the difference in pixel value. The AlexNet and VGG16 models were used to extract useful features from the normalized images. The extracted features were then applied to the FWA-BiLSTM model, to give more weight to the unique features and increase the efficiency of classification. The attention layer selects the unique features that help to distinguish the changes in the remote sensing images. From the experimental results, it was clearly shown that the proposed FWA-BiLSTM model achieved better performance in terms of precision (93.43%), recall (93.16%), and overall accuracy (99.26%), when

improve the user's localization estimation in indoor and outdoor environment a novel radiolocalization system using deep learning dedicated to work both in indoor and outdoor environment is proposed. It is based on the radio signatures using radio signals of opportunity from LTE an WiFi networks. The measurements of channel state estimators from LTE network and from WiFi network are taken by using the developed application. The user's position is calculated with a trained neural network system's models. Additionally the influence of various number of measurements from LTE and WiFi networks in the input vector on the positioning accuracy was examined. From the results it can be seen that using hybrid deep learning algorithm with a radio signatures method can result in localization error 24.3 m and 1.9 m lower comparing respectively to the GPS system and standalone deep learning algorithm with a radio signatures method in indoor environment. What is more, the combination of LTE and WiFi signals measurement in an input vector results in better indoor and outdoor as well as floor classification accuracy and less positioning error comparing to the input vector consisting measurements from only LTE network or from only WiFi network."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884752","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"68","pagesFromTo":"594 - 607","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca531f4097077ac1cfaed1","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Pietrzak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4311bd2f-c7e9-4fc4-93f9-24d2cf9f0c0d"},{"objectId":"64ca531f4097077ac1cfaed0","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Wysocka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8c45b43f-be8d-4423-8e3c-e35b11e13df8"},{"objectId":"64ca531f4097077ac1cfaecf","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Urwan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"759144ad-c0ad-41cf-959b-7b8a4db6a96a"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac291","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Cwalina","uuid":"74AD7E22D1ED7CB34BEFE9C7C755FF4A34C8AA6756E03010959848E5CBCE2DF50FDFE3AEDBBFA2DE7CA1D8E0742986ECC8A1F08750194CC0B97F829002B6935F","orcidId":"0000-0002-1900-8825","documentHash":"937072b4-f3a1-47e0-9cd6-e516a11f0f17"}],"doi":"10.24425/ijet.2022.141279"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["CORROSION DEGRADATION","NDT","SHIP STRUCTURES","STEEL PLATES","ULTRASONIC WAVES"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709389878c28a0473ac2cb","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b45"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Experimental and numerical identification of corrosion degradation of ageing structural components","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790c2","mniswId":"15344","title":"Ocean Engineering","doi":null,"issn":"0029-8018","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"1769a8a1-e28e-487a-8470-bf6196654271"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca51ec4097077ac1cf9c64","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709389878c28a0473ac2cb","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b45","64ca51ec4097077ac1cf9c65"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The study presents experimental and numerical identification of corrosion degradation of thin-walled structural components employing guided wave propagation.

A group velocity dispersion curve reconstruction has been used to determine the corrosion-induced plate thickness reduction. Two case studies are used to examine experimentally the newly developed approach. In the first one, the dispersion curve and the assessment of the corrosion thickness reduction have been made using wave signals of various excitation frequencies. In the second one, the analysis was conducted only for two wave propagation signals and one excitation frequency which allowed for reconstructing the dispersion curve in a limited frequency range. A good agreement between the natural and estimated corrosion degradation levels was observed in both case studies. The present study develops a signal processing methodology, which can be used in the SHM systems. Several aspects still need to be further investigated before the developed approach can be applied to the complex ship hull structures' large size and complex geometry."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884755","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"258","pagesFromTo":"111739","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca51ec4097077ac1cf9c65","name":"Yordan","lastName":"Garbatov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eca3732a-dc8f-4fdc-8487-90ad7b2237fd"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b45","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Wołoszyk","uuid":"E71718625EECEBE8564AC993A2926445CE07F00E21F96B6469C16766EC525969948CD0DF85CD5E8EFF162370BDC32AB22DE6A17A5D9D8A2BF927DA6F50B83BDA","orcidId":"0000-0002-9088-8570","documentHash":"23ca6d93-963e-4488-93c0-d7621bd2e27e"},{"objectId":"5e709389878c28a0473ac2cb","name":"Beata","lastName":"Zima","uuid":"3A1C10B8894F1B129C4B22404E23842279DC23E037B47D1862A33A506B7F264817992E432A9DB8EEF87663BF5554607FC318688369FC2D1418D6C7ADEEE948C7","orcidId":"0000-0001-8228-5959","documentHash":"ea7189a4-f9f1-44d5-af88-7f0eb2e2bd07"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.oceaneng.2022.111739"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["INCREMENTAL DYNAMIC ANALYSIS · STRUCTURAL POUNDING · EARTHQUAKES · PERFORMANCE LEVEL · FRAGILITY ANALYSIS"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709248878c28a047393069"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Fragility analysis of structural pounding between adjacent structures arranged in series with various alignment configurations under near‑field earthquakes","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477492","mniswId":"2921","title":"Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering","doi":null,"issn":"1570-761X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"3ea68e36-c164-4db9-9b3f-c8c83f1ee235"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca52e54097077ac1cfabfb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ca52e54097077ac1cfabfc","64ca52e54097077ac1cfabfd","64ca52e54097077ac1cfabfe","5e709248878c28a047393069"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A major cause of local to total damages is related to structural pounding in a large number of past earthquakes. In general, these collisions take place as a result of differences in the dynamic characteristics of the colliding structures. To acquire a better perception of the behavior of structures, in this paper, three structures featuring different heights are modeled in series and with various configurations next to each other in OpenSees. To determine the collision effects of the structures, three different configurations of 4-, 8- and 12-story adjacent reinforced concrete special moment resisting frames were considered. Then, by conducting an incremental dynamic analysis, their structural seismic limit state capacities were assessed via 20 near-field record subsets recommended by FEMA-P695. At last, for the above adjacent buildings with various separation distances and configurations, the fragility curves were determined, and the probability of exceedance from the primary Hazus-MH failure criteria was estimated. In addition, the results were compared with those obtained when this phenomenon did not take place for buildings to have a better perception of the pounding phenomenon. The results of the analyses show that arranging adjacent structures in series greatly affects the collapse capacities of the colliding structures. In addition, in the case when the shorter structure is placed in the middle of two taller structures, it results in the most critical situation among all configurations, and in this case, a higher reduction is observed in the structural performance levels."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884756","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"20","pagesFromTo":"7215 - 7240","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca52e54097077ac1cfabfe","name":"Hosein","lastName":"Naderpour","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"703e01b7-fbc9-4bef-b895-e1e071a2a6bd"},{"objectId":"64ca52e54097077ac1cfabfd","name":"Ali Mohammad","lastName":"Hadianfard","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"540decfc-eb43-45cf-8b61-c5eb24b157a0"},{"objectId":"64ca52e54097077ac1cfabfc","name":"Fahimeh","lastName":"Ebrahimiyan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"532381f8-c698-4424-8243-bfc45e8f9f9b"},{"objectId":"5e709248878c28a047393069","name":"Robert","lastName":"Jankowski","uuid":"021D29AC2BDBA9E64C6662E050050145052157AF505A4EC8CD7984A94E38FFED4631A6C38E8678A885B02E9AF2294B72ADE8089C728E780690BF8E691385D775","orcidId":"0000-0002-6741-115X","documentHash":"2d8ec20c-035c-40fb-935e-dbb34d1071bf"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10518-022-01471-3"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMSUPERVISED LEARNINGFRACTURE LOADFRACTURE TOUGHNESSDATA-DRIVEN TECHNIQUESPREDICTION MODEL"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61cd27b87523401fc10dfd0a","5e7092a4878c28a047399bd7","64ca54614097077ac1cfc248"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Prediction of fracture toughness in fibre-reinforced concrete, mortar, and rocks using various Machine learning techniques","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477ac2","mniswId":"5714","title":"Engineering Fracture Mechanics","doi":null,"issn":"0013-7944","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e3af2e36-6f99-488d-abe5-bc043dc10ba8"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca54614097077ac1cfc246","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ca54614097077ac1cfc247","64ca54614097077ac1cfc248","61cd27b87523401fc10dfd0a","5e7092a4878c28a047399bd7"]},"issue":"Part B","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Machine Learning (ML) method is widely used in engineering applications such as fracture mechanics.

A set of 401 specimens of “Brazilian discs with central cracks” were used as a training and testing dataset. The main features of the experimental technique in each specimen are the fracture mode, the tensile strength of the specimen, the inclination of the crack with loading direction, the thickness of specimens and the half-length of the crack. The improved ML algorithms were implemented using Python programming language. The results of the coefficient of restitution (R2) and statistical metrics confirm that the ML algorithms are able to predict the fracture toughness and fracture load in modes I, II, and mixed-mode (I-II) with high accuracy. To validate the reliability of the proposed ML-based prediction models, three experimental tests were used.

This study proposes a strategy to detect Lombard speech using a machine learning approach for applications such as public address systems that work in near real time. The paper starts with the background concerning the Lombard effect. Then, assumptions of the work performed for Lombard speech detection are outlined. The framework proposed combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and various two-dimensional (2D) speech signal representations. To reduce the computational cost and not resign from the 2D representation-based approach, a strategy for threshold-based averaging of the Lombard effect detection results is introduced. The pseudocode of the averaging process is also included. A series of experiments are performed to determine the most effective network structure and the 2D speech signal representation. Investigations are carried out on German and Polish recordings containing Lombard speech. All 2D signal speech representations are tested with and without augmentation. Augmentation means using the alpha channel to store additional data: gender of the speaker, F0 frequency, and first two MFCCs. The experimental results show that Lombard and neutral speech recordings can clearly be discerned, which is done with high detection accuracy. It is also demonstrated that the proposed speech detection process is capable of working in near real-time.

However, the relationship between GVC and wages differs according to gender: women are more affected by the negative impact of greater trade involvement than men. There is some education/skill heterogeneity: workers with a medium level of education and medium skills are most affected. Our results show different patterns for concentrated and competitive industries: a greater female wage penalty due to GVC intensification is observed in less competitive sectors.

In this theory, there exists a deformation energy density introduced as a function of strains and gradient of macrorotations, where the latter are expressed through displacements. So the couple-stress theory could be treated as a particular class of strain gradient elasticity. Within the micropolar elasticity, the model is called Cosserat pseudocontinuum or medium with constrained rotations. Applying the classic definitions of ordinary ellipticity and strong ellipticity to static equations of the couple-stress theory, we conclude that these equations are neither elliptic nor strongly elliptic.

Rehabilitation aims to help the patient to achieve the best possible level of functional status, to foster independence, to improve acceptance of the disease, to improve patient fatigue and improve the quality of life of the patients It is essential to focus the rehabilitation examination on several factors associated with impaired function, such as impaired cardiovascular and pulmonary  function, urinary incontinence or psychological or psychological distress. The pleiotropic effect \r\nof rehabilitation can also be used in pain relief, improvement of chemotherapy tolerance, in the treatment of lymphedema and in the improvement of pelvic fl oor muscle function. Purpose: \r\nThe main aim of this paper is to summarize available options for rehabilitation after gynecolo�gical oncological diseases."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884774","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"35","pagesFromTo":"114-118","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.prolekare.cz/en/journals/clinical-oncology/2022-2-2/rehabilitation-and-physical-activity-in-gynecological-oncological-diseases-130525/download?hl=cs","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64f9938440970739aa94512e","name":"J.","lastName":"Kováč","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"77948a0f-01f8-4fde-a896-c07bd81bb479"},{"objectId":"64f9938440970739aa94512d","name":"D.","lastName":"Líška","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"82fe0096-1293-4e23-ac8f-cb25782b60ca"},{"objectId":"5e7093a4878c28a0473ae55e","name":"SEBASTIAN","lastName":"RUTKOWSKI","uuid":"AC978DADDCE1FB02F95BFAFFFC64222BBFFA4A7A0B0A7DA874C154C973D968DB2B134E7A62B9A97024DC5926BCBAFCDE385516F9049CF27481C1ED7D6429186C","orcidId":"0000-0002-8504-0129","documentHash":"5b9f7e01-5b20-4b65-9e5c-a8747af4e1a7"}],"doi":"10.48095/ccko2022114"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["SPAR PLATFORMS, HEAVE PLATES, DAMPING COEFFICIENT, FLOATING OFFSHORE WIND TURBINES (FOWTS)"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094c0878c28a0473c307e","5e709445878c28a0473b9595","5e709248878c28a047393040"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Heave Plates with Holes for Floating Offshore Wind Turbines","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479305","mniswId":"16308","title":"Polish Maritime Research","doi":null,"issn":"1233-2585","eissn":"2083-7429","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"12d587ab-e63c-44b2-9698-f5fcaef6ebfe"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca50b54097077ac1cf896c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709445878c28a0473b9595","5e709248878c28a047393040","5e7094c0878c28a0473c307e"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper presents an innovative solution which is heave plates with holes. The long-known heave plates are designed\\nto damp the heave motion of platforms. They are most often used for Spar platforms. The growing interest in this type\\nof platform as supporting structures for offshore wind turbines makes it necessary to look for new solutions. Based\\non the available literature and the authors’ own research, it was concluded that the main element responsible for the\\ndamping of heave plates is not so much the surface of the plate, but its edge. Therefore, it was decided to investigate the\\neffect of the holes in heave plates on their damping coefficient. Model tests and CFD calculations were performed for\\nthree different structures: a smooth cylinder, a cylinder with heave plates with a diameter of 1.4 times the diameter of\\nthe cylinder, and a cylinder with the same plate, in which 24 holes were cut (Fig. 1). Free Decay Tests (FDT) were used\\nto determine the damping coefficient and the natural period of heave, and then the values obtained were compared.\\nThe full and punched heave-plate designs were also tested with regular waves of different periods to obtain amplitude\\ncharacteristics. The results obtained are not unequivocal, as a complex motion appears here; however, it is possible to\\nclearly define the area in which the damping of a plate with holes is greater than that of a full plate."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884778","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"26 - 33","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094c0878c28a0473c307e","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Grygorowicz","uuid":"D109D6C9689FD074D6584D43944B5C636529C0DB09DFFF1215C85A22B200F72CCBC3E5AA56A7C6AFD3AA9D94A8C6E1498A6FF15A66404BD1F2AD699310D2C890","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cb1c2a4e-f271-4963-a1f0-fa9f7641a17c"},{"objectId":"5e709445878c28a0473b9595","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Ciba","uuid":"7368824617CC3BD350FBD48F86339D5284AA27D02014CC38FF6FF0FE9F579BB76CCC57270B49D67217ACE082BE4BFF40A72EB406C6EBFF4F1FAD081985BDEA68","orcidId":"0000-0002-9042-5234","documentHash":"7474b833-a3f8-4ab6-b1e0-80ee9291d72e"},{"objectId":"5e709248878c28a047393040","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Dymarski","uuid":"988097EBE31469842DB301E9F7DF63B00B8D58E17753869F71E3A2BE745B9BBBD1388BBEFD9773BA3861BF9ABDDB6D9E488B6494C6790BE6AA37C516EEE44637","orcidId":"0000-0002-6033-0461","documentHash":"6e4eba8a-2ae6-4dd0-b22e-71af21da8402"}],"doi":"10.2478/pomr-2022-0003"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["dane ankietowe","oczekiwania","przetwórstwo przemysłowe","racjonalność","COVID-19 pandemic"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["survey data","expectations","manufacturing industry","rationality","pandemia COVID-19"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":"978-83-8030-615-8","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3d","uid":"b2eiZUbb85g0FOaTA2KZtOw","uuid":"c7c10a2a-f381-4dc2-8511-53400ceb4a90","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3d","parentUuid":"c7c10a2a-f381-4dc2-8511-53400ceb4a90","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3d","rootUuid":"c7c10a2a-f381-4dc2-8511-53400ceb4a90","name":"Szkoła Główna Handlowa w Warszawie","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f8878c28a0473b4223"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Monitorowanie działalności gospodarczej.

fossil fuel resources and anthropogenic climate changes are the reasons for the intensive development of new, sustainable technologies based on renewable energy sources. One of the most promising strategies is the utilization of hydrogen as an energy vector. However, the limiting issue for large-scale commercialization of hydrogen technologies is a safe, efficient, and economical method of gas storage. In industrial practice, hydrogen compression and liquefaction are currently applied; however, due to the required high pressure (30–70 MPa) and low temperature (−253 °C), both these methods are intensively energy consuming. Chemical hydrogen storage is a promising alternative as it offers safe storage of hydrogen-rich compounds under ambient conditions. Although many compounds serving as hydrogen carriers are considered, some of them do not have realistic perspectives for large-scale commercialization. In this review, the three most technologically advanced hydrogen carriers—dimethyl ether, methanol, and dibenzyltoluene—are discussed and compared. Their potential for industrial application in relation to the energy storage, transport, and mobility sectors is analyzed, taking into account technological and environmental aspects."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884787","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"4964","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61bc04397523404d4a8f364a","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Pawelczyk","uuid":"6A7994FF1D0B7CA3ED16A60EE628A5A52BD50BE088C1A587CA1EE0E927169256CB15A7B70A7350334CBD063E3B0C5F5DBE14ABB1C06817575B54F8E1966FEA52","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"be8744ab-76b4-4347-8e64-2dd71c5dc914"},{"objectId":"5e709445878c28a0473b9630","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Łukasik","uuid":"CBA4EA04BFA21E8FF27F9CD6EA9414DC0AA3720F1CC18D884A7F249AAD72AD40643B32D914B85CECB3BEC90688C8BCF727AE69C414825177205B0EB0169C129F","orcidId":"0000-0003-4386-8937","documentHash":"f5fd2dc3-2f81-44c1-b6aa-ca3fa5c9070c"},{"objectId":"5e709445878c28a0473b95ea","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Rogala","uuid":"944C67084F98509AC830E9C4FF08CEEE1195D0781F8617ABC40E2A7354B580997A873E91DD6B5C195F7B2D646624536A97E2C6622F947629E8966E2A12697979","orcidId":"0000-0002-5747-9425","documentHash":"25b2ce51-3a72-4ca3-b933-398fe8a1b851"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac1bf","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Wysocka","uuid":"103B35886F807DB57EDE5A08BE16FA24ABFC4D30076C48A520B1A0AE10D8FC34887135C649DED4BC7936EA55C69DA50A69F52603BEEBD56BF3433127D2DC4159","orcidId":"0000-0002-9528-7715","documentHash":"cbec3769-1688-4936-9261-3d3789f539bd"},{"objectId":"5e70926c878c28a047395543","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Gębicki","uuid":"8170D99BF4F35AF3C414DE86E954871557310BB19C2722980C57BCE1E641004D16310942A180CEE97775C65A2F0F9D175FE5C5FD2877EE454982A0FEAF64C260","orcidId":"0000-0002-4786-8363","documentHash":"2a01286f-2635-4b92-b320-db1e546328a5"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15144964"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19","HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING","MOLECULAR DYNAMICS"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709388878c28a0473ac256"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Pre‐exascale HPC approaches for molecular dynamics simulations.

It analyzes current\\napproaches to this education and the enhancements already deployed in the international perspective.\\nThe main aim is to conceptualize CSRS education forms within the context of technology-oriented\\nHEIs and propose the model for this education. This model has also been partially verified using the\\ncases of four technical universities.\\nThis research uses qualitative and quantitative research methods. The literature review is applied to trace HEIs’ educational and organizational CSR commitment methods. Based on this review, we proposed a model of CSRS education in HEIs. Using this model, we checked to what extent its elements are used in four technical universities from Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine and Poland.\\nFor this purpose, educational programs at universities were analyzed. We also confronted the activity of these universities with the students’ knowledge about CSRS. The results of the survey conducted among 3,424 students from these universities contributed to elaborating on this aspect.\\nFindings: The results confirm that students are ignorant of CSR, even those studying at business faculties.\\nWhat is surprising, even those students who are business owners do not demonstrate a high level of\\nknowledge about CSR. Universities, on the other hand, do not offer the possibility of eliminating this\\nignorance. Meanwhile, we believe they can do so not only through the standing-alone CSRS education\\nbut also by including CSR in other courses and by giving a good example.\\nDue to language barriers, the submitted model was only partially verified at selected universities. We are also aware that the described situation may be one-sided as the four cases presented in this study are homogeneous, as they represent technical universities, so only one profile among a variety of universities’ profiles (technical versus humanities versus economic).\\nBearing in mind the current level of implementation of education in the area of CSR and the results of the research carried out, we propose a model of education that includes three pillars: a good example of a university (socially responsible university), is responsible managers education (RME) and raising awareness among students of non-business faculties (ASR). At the same time, we indicated alarge gap between the educational needs in the area of CSRS and the offer of four technical universities."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884797","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"20","pagesFromTo":"87 - 105","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70925d878c28a0473946d1","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Popowska","uuid":"8414E02842ECCCF216CE5A7EC4828F7CB8D0111058BA44B2D87735A1578666110EF3393B7812B4B5A4163788F041E87065E1CD71529153E9CEEE60E33DE05EBB","orcidId":"0000-0002-2235-7196","documentHash":"cf985171-0a6b-4935-88da-f72daac957b7"},{"objectId":"5e709244878c28a047392bf1","name":"Julita","lastName":"Wasilczuk","uuid":"3D7BDEB1673CA8E33EF3F2F66B5A360C5D73AB494B23C739E3A26F209B6A79EE7CA58071406BE7093BCB40F6A745B46DD27D66EF9CD4E033A897536634A6268C","orcidId":"0000-0002-9373-0293","documentHash":"782db46d-5f68-49b2-abd9-b00f71dfd27b"}],"doi":"10.7172/1644-9584.95.4"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["BIRDS","CONTAMINATION","ORGANIC POLLUTANTS","QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES","SAMPLING"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70939b878c28a0473ad99e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"What should we know when choosing feather, blood, egg or preen oil as biological samples for contaminants detection?

The resulting bilayer wound dressing offers a lot of desirable characteristics, including good self-healing and repeatable adhesiveness. Likewise, the conductive bilayer wound dressing could be used to analyze the patient's healthcare data in real-time as epidermal sensors. Bilayer wound dressings remarkably have broad antibacterial efficacy against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The potential applications of this bilayer wound dressing are illustrated by detectable body movement and conductivity. The wound-healing rate of bilayer wound dressings containing chitosan and arginine was higher, but those without the aforementioned ingredients had lower wound-healing efficacy. Additionally, promoting collagen synthesis and reducing wound infection has a considerable therapeutic impact on wounds.

These\\nfindings suggest that this tetrahydroquinolinone can be an ideal lead compound for drug discovery\\nbased on quinone derivatives."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884806","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"9985","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac0f7","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Maciejewska","uuid":"17D2DD64E17B54924FD9E3BE8D98BBE0B79843CE5254D81115196FF530C8ED518C8F361826293B21EC19429ABD1091E172AC9C7A42085B7ABB4B8E4FF8AA7E2A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f24510a3-2541-49ee-926f-f3389afd451d"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac0e5","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Ryczkowska","uuid":"D1FCFDA62C8A3020156BCA0BC4B0954674C0F1239C2087B64A4FE26115734EF089375B448649D948846E6B9A0C91135D66FBC01C5919C3BBF614A2BE10C35E29","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"249ca660-fed7-4788-878c-d5ec557a8369"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac0e3","name":"MILENA","lastName":"WITKOWSKA","uuid":"085CBB430E5BFE755E01817B7FD94E904399EC7511E3EE9B7D38FDEEF39CCB6279C5706A73AA96AFCE2AFD5D5FB7BFD1FC08D83D1C05B07FD99D19EBD0E74409","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c252c860-87b6-445d-b9e8-bb316f3f86a0"},{"objectId":"5e70929c878c28a047399087","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Olszewski","uuid":"A0515E52B9A08DFE1256D9DE151874DFF6EF2F82C70D419B6CD1653D46DEE49DE5E2DA66A2768C59101624B0604F5021FBD3161433F41661BF0CFC607D35E107","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bacb5972-76c1-4f1a-bc92-96cdfad92d5f"},{"objectId":"5e70925e878c28a047394769","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Makowiec","uuid":"C6FDF1764D04F35008C1EF2C071E45A639B188BF6E592E6C58802B8A116A810BEDE49AE199EAC09BDB04EBCE2F904AAF121F75F39DDD8F23FACD690C76696B4B","orcidId":"0000-0003-1742-1840","documentHash":"1f7863c0-4c7e-40fd-95cf-fad012a21959"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-022-13867-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19 MOLECULAR DOCKING MULTI-EPITOPES VACCINESMM-PBSA/MM-GBSA ANALYSIS SARS-COV-2 VARIANTS"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61a83db87523402fabe26d0e","61cd27b87523401fc10dfc94"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Reverse vaccinology-based prediction of a multi-epitope SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and its tailoring to new coronavirus variants","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454784ef","mniswId":"10330","title":"Journal of Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics","doi":null,"issn":"0739-1102","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"7d753d70-8e2d-49ce-a240-6217370fa976"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca51be4097077ac1cf9974","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ca51be4097077ac1cf9975","64ca51be4097077ac1cf9976","61a83db87523402fabe26d0e","61cd27b87523401fc10dfc94","64ca51be4097077ac1cf9977","64ca51be4097077ac1cf9978","64ca51be4097077ac1cf9979","64ca51be4097077ac1cf997a","64ca51be4097077ac1cf997b","64ca51be4097077ac1cf997c","64ca51be4097077ac1cf997d"]},"issue":"11","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The genome feature of SARS-CoV-2 leads the virus to mutate and creates new variants of concern. Tackling viral mutations is also an important challenge for the development of a new vaccine. Accordingly, in the present study, we undertook to identify B- and T-cell epitopes with immunogenic potential for eliciting responses to SARS-CoV-2, using computational approaches and its tailoring to coronavirus variants. A total of 47 novel epitopes were identified as immunogenic triggering immune responses and no toxic after investigation with in silico tools. Furthermore, we found these peptide vaccine candidates showed a significant binding affinity for MHC I and MHC II alleles in molecular docking investigations. We consider them to be promising targets for developing peptide-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. Subsequently, we designed two efficient multi-epitopes vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2, the first one based on potent MHC class I and class II T-cell epitopes of S (FPNITNLCPF–NYNYLYRLFR–MFVFLVLLPLVSSQC), M (MWLSYFIASF–GLMWLSYFIASFRLF), E (LTALRLCAY–LLFLAFVVFLLVTLA), and N (SPRWYFYYL–AQFAPSASAFFGMSR). The second candidate is the result of the tailoring of the first designed vaccine according to three classes of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Molecular docking showed that the protein-protein binding interactions between the vaccines construct and TLR2–TLR4 immune receptors are stable complexes. These findings confirmed that the final multi-epitope vaccine could be easily adapted to new viral variants. Our study offers a shortlist of promising epitopes that can accelerate the development of an effective and safe vaccine against the virus and its adaptation to new variants."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884812","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"41","pagesFromTo":"4917 - 4938","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca51be4097077ac1cf997d","name":"Sayeh","lastName":"Ezzikouri","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b21b6cd7-a696-4e34-89c6-40887a57f822"},{"objectId":"64ca51be4097077ac1cf997c","name":"Soumaya","lastName":"Benjelloun","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7598e567-ef9e-42db-93cd-87a25a2b669f"},{"objectId":"64ca51be4097077ac1cf997b","name":"Michinori","lastName":"Kohara","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"be16c0ae-25a7-4fce-bcf4-50174fe82eb8"},{"objectId":"64ca51be4097077ac1cf997a","name":"Rachid","lastName":"Saile","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2bc019c6-c45c-4739-9f45-0da26153f3bb"},{"objectId":"64ca51be4097077ac1cf9979","name":"Haya","lastName":"Altawalah","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bbbff842-ba78-4998-9fb7-fa54a8e2150b"},{"objectId":"64ca51be4097077ac1cf9978","name":"Kyoko","lastName":"Tsukiyama-Kohara","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2d3ed183-43c3-4feb-aa56-5a13fceed4b5"},{"objectId":"64ca51be4097077ac1cf9977","name":"Hicham","lastName":"El Ossmani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5a826f1b-edcd-4e92-8ae0-f68a4207e2e2"},{"objectId":"64ca51be4097077ac1cf9976","name":"Anass","lastName":"Kettani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"78de7dcd-2b37-4c75-96b8-01b670e3375b"},{"objectId":"64ca51be4097077ac1cf9975","name":"Wahiba","lastName":"Ezzemani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4337bf81-3efb-4b4b-87a4-becb78f10efe"},{"objectId":"61cd27b87523401fc10dfc94","name":"Kavya","lastName":"Kondaka","uuid":"B45D555214E95A5F0E6114E789C2192618CA4EE45CBAEDCCC9131C6AD655E3F1A0194B3CE05027798D29422B78A1C3C179B952DDBD086C71586603F17A0B16F5","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"90d45516-561f-437a-8089-c22e1bcc3138"},{"objectId":"61a83db87523402fabe26d0e","name":"Subrahmanyam","lastName":"Sappati","uuid":"3E419920EDC064378A0CACC5D6ED6FC5A20D3E39AB0A502A62BC0E5702C7DF3B4318099A0BFF3DDA5CA7DB4775C5B313D106DB15BD14D0DD444251C7E0C51744","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"51c01896-518e-4a3f-9b23-d2cacd25f5c6"}],"doi":"10.1080/07391102.2022.2075468"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-66903-21-0","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","uid":"bQp8ITDzg_V-1GFpvOVvvtg","uuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","parentUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","rootUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","name":"Politechnika Opolska","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70923a878c28a047391f68"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Tasting China.

This oversight is of concern because research carried out in the last 20+ years indicates artificial light at night (ALAN) in cities, and the light pollution this generates can have negative consequences on human health and well-being and the entire environment, including ecosystems and the flora and fauna that inhabit them. By applying a literature review, analysis and synthesis method, this work offers a new perspective on lighting and a timeline of key events that established ALAN and light pollution awareness in different disciplines and professional groups connected to urban illumination. It also identifies three fundamental aspects which require further transdisciplinary research and the translation of this knowledge into practice in order to enable the development of sustainable cities and communities at night. Finally, it presents in detail a new, theoretical environment-centred design framework for responsible urban illumination, with four iterative design phases, in order to help guide various stakeholders in cities, along with a four-level pyramid model that can be applied to urban illumination in the form of principles, processes, practices, and tools. This framework is especially relevant for those urban planners, architects, and landscape designers, who are unfamiliar with the subject in order to present the most effective and appropriate lighting design approach and methods that should be taken into consideration with the design of a given urban nighttime environment/situation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884819","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"14525","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70940c878c28a0473b56d6","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Zielińska-Dąbkowska","uuid":"DCC324E6B7C5037A55972D54B80077B938F11A840EB3E0D5D377C37920DF01610011D1D7F87CCDCEA41B516D0DE5A064DC0FFF046F10E4057C4F3CBF9F3E2A34","orcidId":"0000-0003-1414-6978","documentHash":"37444597-46a7-4885-b534-700c0fd1e63c"}],"doi":"10.3390/su142114525"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["PHASE SHIFTER,SENSOR ELECTRONIC INTERFACE,CAPACITIVE SENSOR,MICROCONTROLLER"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70925d878c28a0473945d2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Measurement method for capacitive sensors for microcontrollers based on a phase shifter","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478dd6","mniswId":"14078","title":"Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation","doi":null,"issn":"0263-2241","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"066c10ef-6b87-4756-9477-5fcd8dff8d12"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca50234097077ac1cf8161","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70925d878c28a0473945d2"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A complete measurement method dedicated to capacitive sensors has been developed.

We obtained the relative errors of capacitance determination < 0.06%, which gives a measurement accuracy < 72 fF for the assumed range of the capacitance (100 pF – 300 pF)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884821","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"192","pagesFromTo":"110890","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70925d878c28a0473945d2","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Czaja","uuid":"366A3F04A3B6AB2CDD9A6EFE53B853022CB0EBAC5FF5C2B5C35F7D59E766A84356C444B1C40EEC61FCB5865E14A23862DA7FC1F46D312EBF3E542BE9AC284C30","orcidId":"0000-0001-9022-4101","documentHash":"2d5efd30-70f0-4aa5-b721-0908c316a58e"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.measurement.2022.110890"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["MIKROMETR","PIŁA TAŚMOWA","ROZWARCIE CAŁKOWITE","SUWMIARKA","ZUŻYCIE NARZĘDZIA"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094d0878c28a0473c458b","64ca53a34097077ac1cfb71b","5e709248878c28a047392fe3"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"OVERALL SET OF BANDSAW TEETH VERSUS METHODS OF MEASUREMENTS","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"60e728f52467f01e930d2cee","mniswId":null,"title":"Trieskove a Beztrieskove Obrabanie Dreva","doi":null,"issn":"2453-904x","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"9f0b933c-3ff1-4d6f-a1d7-e52c09229cf8"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca53a34097077ac1cfb71a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ca53a34097077ac1cfb71b","5e709248878c28a047392fe3","5e7094d0878c28a0473c458b"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This article deals with the impact of the manual methods of measurement on the overall set measurement results.

The sensor was prepared by immobilizing monoclonal antibodies specific for botulinum neurotoxin via a thiol monolayer deposited on a gold substrate. Studies have shown that the sensor enables selective analyte detection within a few minutes. In addition, the sensor can be used several times (regeneration of the sensor is possible using a low pH buffer). Nevertheless, the detectability of the analyte is relatively low compared to other analytical techniques that can be used for rapid detection of botulinum neurotoxin. The obtained results confirm the operation of the proposed sensor and give hope for further development of this label-free technique for detecting botulinum neurotoxin."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884830","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"7688","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/18/7688/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094d2878c28a0473c483a","name":"Michał","lastName":"Grabka","uuid":"3251B0175FE23FDFED5E57DAB479EB28EB81CCF6E7AA277EF198FF2ADB2CB08969337BA41E48F5BD4333D7E90A940E7120885F9B50A2B3D54ABC7347A7AD6BBA","orcidId":"0000-0003-4997-2364","documentHash":"7efc233c-3652-4e37-a178-de7257087c75"},{"objectId":"5e7092a5878c28a047399ca6","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Jasek","uuid":"45B57F0FBB5BF20DAD9C6680BF9E92BBC3E0E5735B8DF9B34496825753BADE5B2116D6EE0AE7237D99AA380C092DFD01AC9BDD16927281B93E1552A66ABABD2E","orcidId":"0000-0002-5098-4218","documentHash":"22a52726-c4f3-483a-a8f9-a1d1ea40b1be"},{"objectId":"5e70928c878c28a047397b96","name":"Zygfryd","lastName":"Witkiewicz","uuid":"E600F1EDAA4CBCF43BAD23C529C3E676B162AD93899B071F6952A66B934ED846ED8757715F9E9AD12BD40360F20F1DCE65869B259E6AAB89E858E257114957DF","orcidId":"0000-0003-4563-4624","documentHash":"f7daf230-4c63-48da-ab06-ce501bab1f7b"}],"doi":"10.3390/s23187688"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"64f985a340970774bad8d7e3","doi":null,"title":"Młodzież

For SVOCs, which are typically introduced to humans through the respiratory system, dermal adsorption, or digestive system, sampling solutions generally used in the indoor environments are classified as active and passive. From the user's perspective, the most convenient method to assess the potential risk is the use of an analytical tool that combines the benefits of passive and non-invasive sampling techniques—use of an unconventional personal sampler such as a silicone wristband, brooch, dog tag, cotton gauze, or viscose wiper. Despite the advantages of this method, the aforementioned techniques require further analytical research owing to the differences in the results of human exposure assessment owing to the lack of standards and unified sampling protocols."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884837","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"154","pagesFromTo":"116669","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bdf8a","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Marć","uuid":"6AF18A909E4434A978BD8F306251C98C1999795AEB1E36F9520EDE981BBB547A6C060D58D0EBA9A78BB0BB4A9FF029D38F48701E174CF5685B1A2D8933710071","orcidId":"0000-0001-8238-827X","documentHash":"f7cca4f7-ab2e-44ad-bae1-4dc87fecc7cc"},{"objectId":"5e70925e878c28a047394747","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Zabiegała","uuid":"85ADC974ACA2BDDF859DCCAF5D7E39083A6C9E473E2D26346E605508220BE1563AF47ABB4FD4E0AF7542F415840544958F9497F99E2DFD7CA98C315A687216A2","orcidId":"0000-0002-1699-835X","documentHash":"4e5e4916-4471-4f70-bf97-306c07fb3d12"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.trac.2022.116669"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["DESIGN OPTIMIZATION","GRADIENT-BASED SEARCH","MICROWAVE DESIGN","SIMULATION-BASED OPTIMIZATION","SPARSE SENSITIVITY UPDATES"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709429878c28a0473b7630","5e70925d878c28a047394615"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Fast EM-Driven Parameter Tuning of Microwave Circuits with Sparse Sensitivity Updates via Principal Directions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478c3e","mniswId":"13330","title":"Knowledge-Based Systems","doi":null,"issn":"0950-7051","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"c69b74f5-7df3-4f50-90c2-af810e823ba7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca52454097077ac1cfa1d6","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70925d878c28a047394615","5e709429878c28a0473b7630"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Numerical optimization has become more important than ever in the design of microwave components and systems, primarily as a consequence of increasing performance demands and growing complexity of the circuits. As the parameter tuning is more and more often executed using full-wave electromagnetic (EM) models, the CPU cost of the overall process tends to be excessive even for local optimization. Some ways of alleviating these issues exist, yet, they are limited either by their accessibility or applicability range. This work presents a novel algorithmic approach to accelerated gradient-based parameter tuning of microwave components with numerical derivatives. In our methodology, computational savings are achieved by exploiting the problem-specific knowledge, specifically, by restricting the gradient updates to an orthonormal basis of essential directions corresponding to the maximum variability of the circuit responses within the frequency bands of interest. The said directions are selected through an automated decision-making process involving the analysis of the circuit response variability. Our approach is demonstrated using two multi-parameter microwave devices. Comprehensive comparison with the benchmark methods, including the standard trust-region algorithm and the three accelerated versions, indicate savings of up to fifty percent associated only with minor reduction of the design quality."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884840","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"252","pagesFromTo":"109388","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709429878c28a0473b7630","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Kozieł","uuid":"ADE10A3FDF1ADAA43EDDED1EECEF7257987D36621DDC2651FA1743F0B2EC4A58B0FCDE0410C8591A1F30E812DFBC087E070124E8464AF6B145423E85D7C160AD","orcidId":"0000-0002-9063-2647","documentHash":"64490206-262d-4cc6-8295-a68adf4c2dfe"},{"objectId":"5e70925d878c28a047394615","name":"Anna","lastName":"Pietrenko-Dąbrowska","uuid":"D92C9C7576DBBE1EFC25050DE3FDDA72938A54DD93CCAE57615ECBB84D1CEDE94227300067A7AF2FD9FF4768EBC118FE349C8342D0C51685C9774D3748855262","orcidId":"0000-0003-2319-6782","documentHash":"b983edd8-e63f-4cf4-bad6-ae679aab18eb"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.knosys.2022.109388"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["3D PRINTING","EMISSIONS","INDOOR AIR","VOCS","VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709389878c28a0473ac363","5e709388878c28a0473ac1af","5e709479878c28a0473bdf8a","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b69","5e70925e878c28a047394747"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Emission Profiles of Volatiles during 3D Printing with ABS, ASA, Nylon, and PETG Polymer Filaments","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":null,"issn":"1420-3049","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"85ea3d3d-2670-4384-98ee-1b5b44edab21"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca51e64097077ac1cf9c13","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709389878c28a0473ac363","5e709479878c28a0473bdf8a","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b69","5e709388878c28a0473ac1af","5e70925e878c28a047394747"]},"issue":"12","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this short communication we characterize the emission of volatile organic compounds\\n(VOCs) from fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printing using four polymer materials, namely\\npolyethylene terephthalate glycol-modified (PETG), acrylonitrile styrene acrylate (ASA), Nylon,\\nand acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS).

paper concerns the problem of vibration reduction during milling. For this purpose, it is proposed that the standard supports of the workpiece be replaced with adjustable stiffness supports. This affects the modal parameters of the whole system, i.e., object and its supports, which is essential from the point of view of the relative tool–workpiece vibrations. To reduce the vibration level during milling, it is necessary to appropriately set the support stiffness coefficients, which are obtained from numerous milling process simulations. The simulations utilize the model of the workpiece with adjustable supports in the convention of a Finite Element Model (FEM) and a dynamic model of the milling process. The FEM parameters are tuned based on modal tests of the actual workpiece. For assessing simulation results, the proper indicator of vibration level must be selected, which is also discussed in the paper. However, simulating the milling process is time consuming and the total number of simulations needed to search the entire available range of support stiffness coefficients is large. To overcome this issue, the artificial intelligence salp swarm algorithm is used. Finally, for the best combination of stiffness coefficients, the vibration reduction is obtained and a significant reduction in search time for determining the support settings makes the approach proposed in the paper attractive from the point of view of practical applications."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884847","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62dd775c40970706fd6e306a","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"22","number":"14","doi":null,"documentHash":"8833eaa4-314c-4a1e-a36d-c5e923b551b1"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-20, [nr art.] 5099","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/s22145099","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6576d38e4097071b8efd5d68","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Stawicka-Morawska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"65237c53-3c0e-4d37-9fa8-2ca0fae039c6"},{"objectId":"6576d38e4097071b8efd5d67","name":"Michał","lastName":"Mazur","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"de97eb24-7452-4f9e-b0ec-5e3be7db60cb"},{"objectId":"6576d38e4097071b8efd5d66","name":"Krzysztof J.","lastName":"Kaliński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"31e5ef57-1ef4-4dd0-9680-2b945adcd43d"},{"objectId":"6576d38e4097071b8efd5d65","name":"Marek A.","lastName":"Galewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e475ecc9-d93c-4f96-8a34-36d0f816d82b"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a537","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Parus","uuid":"105AD469B23E5C110D7B75B3C3D3E0864426103DAF4A4B39C8E3A459E1F8917211F7882FA94CF8C3F05628848AE724F8C46B15CCAF1598B17743BAA60B87D503","orcidId":"0000-0001-7254-6051","documentHash":"df5fd220-58ca-4aea-b1d2-9006c4100a20"}],"doi":"10.3390/s22145099"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["BIOINFORMATICS","MACHINE LEARNING","TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","uid":"b1ds4os9esVerVwE7LSdHOw","uuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","parentUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de28","rootUuid":"76e7e103-e39c-48d6-8aa2-8fde70c50563","name":"Politechnika Gdańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709388878c28a0473ac256"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"DNAffinity: a machine-learning approach to predict DNA binding affinities of transcription factors","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479083","mniswId":"15242","title":"Nucleic Acids Research","doi":null,"issn":"0305-1048","eissn":"1362-4962","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"724567b3-4881-4976-8403-23b81227ac34"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64ca534e4097077ac1cfb1b8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64ca534e4097077ac1cfb1b9","64ca534e4097077ac1cfb1ba","5e709388878c28a0473ac256","64ca534e4097077ac1cfb1bb","64ca534e4097077ac1cfb1bc"]},"issue":"16","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We present a physics-based machine learning approach to predict in vitro transcription factor binding affinities from structural and mechanical DNA properties directly derived from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations.

For instance, up to 12 ppm HMX concentrations have been observed in the wastewater effluent of a munitions manufacturing facility, while up to 45,000 mg/kg of HMX has been found in a soil sample taken from a location close to a high-explosive production site. Owing to their immense demand for a variety of applications, the large-scale production of explosives has culminated in severe environmental issues. Soil and water contaminated with HMX can pose a detrimental impact on flora and fauna and hence, remediation of HMX is paramount. There is a rising demand to establish a sustainable technology for HMX abatement. Physiochemical and bioremediation approaches have been employed to treat HMX in the soil, groundwater, and wastewater. It has been revealed that treatment methods such as photo-peroxidation and photo-Fenton oxidation can eliminate approximately 98% of HMX from wastewater. Fenton’s reagents were found to be very effective at mineralizing HMX. In the photocatalytic degradation of HMX, approximately 59% TOC removal was achieved by using a TiO2 photocatalyst, and a dextrose co-substrate was used in a bioremediation approach to accomplish 98.5% HMX degradation under anaerobic conditions. However, each technology has some pros and cons which need to be taken into consideration when choosing an HMX remediation approach. In this review, various physiochemical and bioremediation approaches are considered and the mechanism of HMX degradation is discussed. Further, the advantages and disadvantages of the technologies are also discussed along with the challenges of HMX treatment technologies, thus giving an overview of the HMX remediation strategies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884853","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"15948","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64ca54e04097077ac1cfc9ad","name":"Ulla","lastName":"Lassi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"34db2226-b169-4ecd-bc02-5b80a9ac2104"},{"objectId":"64ca54e04097077ac1cfc9ac","name":"Varsha","lastName":"Srivastava","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9ee05dac-081a-42c2-bb9a-b10c1de9640c"},{"objectId":"5e7093d7878c28a0473b1bfa","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Boczkaj","uuid":"9715EEAC4EAC127938012022C0A4ACD790F5566C9874EA60AB7E89002295933280DEA7551C62372A75C17B38F1F0807E49E0E86AD99D77507A737739E955F2FE","orcidId":"0000-0002-5874-7591","documentHash":"c246f4c1-d0f2-47ee-a492-b341b7da4144"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph192315948"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["popyt na pracę","rynek pracy","system prognostyczny","szkolnictwo branżowe","zawód"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","uid":"bLDwoyIU1jG5BHqZ9HzVPQg","uuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","parentUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","rootUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","name":"Wyższa Szkoła Informatyki i Zarządzania z siedzibą w Rzeszowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebed806752340254fc40ded","5e709291878c28a04739803b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"PROGNOZOWANIE ZAPOTRZEBOWANIA NA PRACOWNIKÓW W WARUNKACH INFORMACJI ILOŚCIOWYCH I JAKOŚCIOWYCH","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"61b9abddad204581b62eba69","mniswId":"201407","title":"Rynek Pracy","doi":null,"issn":"1233-4103","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"3910219b-3483-490d-8588-a294b3e52bdf"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64fabf6c4097077c1aaf29bd","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709291878c28a04739803b","5ebed806752340254fc40ded"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Prognozowanie zapotrzebowania na pracowników zazwyczaj się wykonuje w celu uzyskania ilościowej informacji o wielkości strumienia pracowników niezbędnych do zaspokojenia przyszłych potrzeb podmiotów gospodarczych.

research community has long studied computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT) methods in non-native speech. Researchers focused on studying various model architectures, such as Bayesian networks and deep learning methods, as well as on the analysis of different representations of the speech signal. Despite significant progress in recent years, existing CAPT methods are not able to detect pronunciation errors with high accuracy (only 60% precision at 40%–80% recall). One of the key problems is the low availability of mispronounced speech that is needed for the reliable training of pronunciation error detection models. If we had a generative model that could mimic non-native speech and produce any amount of training data, then the task of detecting pronunciation errors would be much easier. We present three innovative techniques based on phoneme-to-phoneme (P2P), text-to-speech (T2S) and speech-to-speech (S2S) conversion to generate correctly pronounced and mispronounced synthetic speech. We show that these techniques not only improve the accuracy of three machine learning models for detecting pronunciation errors, but also help establish a new state-of-the-art in the field. Earlier studies have used simple speech generation techniques such as P2P conversion, but only as an additional mechanism to improve the accuracy of pronunciation error detection. We, on the other hand, consider speech generation to be the first-class method of detecting pronunciation errors. The effectiveness of these techniques is assessed in the tasks of detecting pronunciation and lexical stress errors.

The purpose of this paper is to address some challenging issues in qualitative research. The following issues are analyzed: the unequal power balance between the researcher and his/her respondents; the unintentional contribution by the researcher to the de-selving of participants, the gender biased composition of the research group, as well as the impact of the research process on the field researcher. A particularly important factor contributing to this impact is the possibility of emotional exhaustion due to facing dangerous situations or listening to emotionally intense narratives. Such a situation might create contextual vulnerability, in which researchers tend to be overwhelmed by the context in which they conduct intensive data collection.&lt;/div&gt;"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058884860","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"331-342","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://wydawnictwo.ignatianum.edu.pl/sites/wydawnictwo/files/publikacje_pdf/zrozumiec_postrzeganie-fragment.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092fb878c28a0473a0684","name":"Halina","lastName":"Grzymała-Moszczyńska","uuid":"CD815C9198F919EAB31A448D86DCAA88B78B70A6F2199142DCD46C0DDA11E821A555D085E9567817311EA65E1A90EC33B5A88F5499CDAB767A7368D51776B4FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-2751-3204","documentHash":"e47254d0-095e-437b-acfe-d02e074890da"}],"doi":null}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA1ODg4NDg2MA=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
