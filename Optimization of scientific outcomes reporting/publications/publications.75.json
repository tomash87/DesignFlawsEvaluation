Although many factors relating to bone structure have been described so far, the current knowledge on the occupational factors that may affect bone tissue metabolism is strongly limited. Literature data suggest that night shift work, via circadian rhythm disruption, may be considered a potential risk factor. To this date, only five epidemiological studies addressing this problem have been conducted worldwide. The outcomes of three studies confirmed such relationship, namely, a higher fracture risk was found among nurses with a long lifetime duration of night shift work in one study; and a lower bone mineral density was associated with occupational activity during night-time in two studies. In adults, the bone undergoes constant remodelling through bone resorption followed by bone formation. The various molecules released into the circulatory system during these processes are called bone turnover markers. We investigated the possible associations between night shift work and selected bone turnover markers: N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (P1NP), C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX), osteocalcin, osteopontin, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) and osteoprotegerin, measured in plasma of 189 female blue-collar workers. A significantly higher bone turnover rate was noted among the women working night shifts than among those working only during the day. This may potentially lead to a future development of osteoporosis in this population even if the macroscopic changes in the bone structure are not detectable. Night shift work is a prevailing occupational characteristics nowadays. It has been estimated that about 15-20% of the working population in Europe and the USA perform work under this system. Thus, the problem of osteoporosis can affect a large part of the working-age population."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185536","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"39","pagesFromTo":"818-825","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07420528.2022.2037626","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70949d878c28a0473c0788","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Bukowska-Damska","uuid":"3B4662ECDE0C33CADB4AC7C1719B043556454864B4898FB5792068C82762011D40A120F03D107F80880686898999E360AAD47E939DD2E2F83352D890D4572BDE","orcidId":"0000-0002-3223-6750","documentHash":"aee80aa4-63b8-4667-bba7-a18a1b1dd30c"},{"objectId":"5e70940c878c28a0473b5745","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Kałużny","uuid":"44ED6B7042DA76B00890987E026727A67AEC3202D51D0E9E17280B064F49D5BB01329188F2CE79CBB69ADFA66C338E55B13244F16A92BD3EAA035387DCAE3474","orcidId":"0000-0002-9559-5873","documentHash":"7ef4d7eb-2cdb-4539-8309-ee70e6664fd9"},{"objectId":"5e7092e2878c28a04739eb8e","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Skowrońska-Jóźwiak","uuid":"5F8DF4C229BC4BB34BB9A466FE263CA75C95CD2B747934C10B8192714FEAC1A5B187541547E505F5BC6E8266FA75EC565C2AB68B611D70A2642F28562DF52E5C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0019-4269","documentHash":"f4d3cfea-29f4-4ead-8168-370c1f697b2a"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397e29","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Lewiński","uuid":"9AEED36EF6FDD1C7A152FECD18B74C86EE0F5FC6C9ED4C2598D64A50DA2FC2EE937D8A80C049C92E0412EE6ECAB101D78D8BC8974E862491A24AB18E51685148","orcidId":"0000-0002-8748-3337","documentHash":"7d8b26bd-246c-4611-be81-a715727aeec0"}],"doi":"10.1080/07420528.2022.2037626"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Mistrzostwa Europy","koszykówka","sport kobiet"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["European Championship","basketball","women’s sport"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","uid":"bHvub0W7DW61k4FKLYJQ3Zw","uuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","parentUuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","rootUuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Długosza w Częstochowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a5878c28a0473ae6c2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Achievements of Poland’s national team in the European Women’s Basketball Championships in the years 1938–2021","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa81c9aff2974850ccf3","mniswId":"497036","title":"Sport i Turystyka.","doi":null,"issn":"2545-3211","eissn":"2657-4322","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"d1908854-e1db-419c-b86e-ca3ff7c0ec0a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-08-23","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":1},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6304a77c40970739a7631aa9","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093a5878c28a0473ae6c2"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Początki koszykówki na świecie datuje się na 1891 r., kiedy Kanadyjczyk James Naismith wymyślił grę dla studentów ze Springfield.

After a short time, matches were played in Europe, in Paris (1893) and London (1894). The first demonstrational game in Poland was played by women in 1909, in Lviv. The discipline spread throughout Europe after World War I. In the 1920s, some state and international organizations were established to standardize the rules of the game. They allowed to play the first national championships and afterwards to organize interstate matches. In 1935, the First European Men’s Basketball Championship was organized, and three years later, women made their debut in the competition of this rank. Between 1938 and 2021, there were thirty-eight editions of the championships, in which the Polish national team participated twenty-nine times. Most medals were won by athletes from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), Czechoslovakia, France, Bulgaria, and Spain. Poland’s most outstanding achievement was the gold medal won in Katowice in 1999. What is more, Polish women won two silver medals (1980,1981) and two bronze medals (1938,1968)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185544","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6304a77c40970739a7631aaa","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"5","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"62beb632-12dd-4384-bda4-748d19332f44"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"5","pagesFromTo":"11-28","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"pol","title":"Osiągnięcia reprezentacji Polski w Mistrzostwach Europy w Koszykówce Kobiet w latach 1938–2021"}],"publicUri":"http://dlibra.bg.ajd.czest.pl:8080/dlibra/docmetadata?id=6748&from=publication","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093a5878c28a0473ae6c2","name":"Michał","lastName":"Skalik","uuid":"00D019BDCC947778264C20B96D86611CDFFC0525A03071CB077E2B676024A5C5BCAF274FF2D73B2738E7B011823902DCC6A717508E621675CDD1F3472197E848","orcidId":"0000-0002-4823-0724","documentHash":"58058bf9-0174-44c9-b217-583aa72a0ed9"}],"doi":"10.16926/sit.2022.02.01"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Smart Cities","waste management","zero waste"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Exemplifying the Zero Waste Concept in Smart Cities","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479dd9","mniswId":"5526","title":"Ekonomia i Środowisko-Economics and Environment","doi":null,"issn":"0867-8898","eissn":"2300-6420","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"8baf52f6-5df3-4697-9cdb-ef0224c65527"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2022-07-09","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6304bebd40970739a7638a46","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709203878c28a04738e95c","5ebee6c2752340254fc45020"]},"issue":"nr 2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Due to the environmental imbalance on our planet, the concept of zero waste is gaining importance day by day.

This meta-analysis quantifies association of burnout and its subscales with self-reported medical errors among physicians.\n\nMethods \nThis meta-analysis followed the principles formulated in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and Meta-analyses of Observational Studies. The MEDLINE, PubMed, Web of Science, PsycInfo, and Eric databases were searched until February 5, 2019, using various combinations of key terms without any language restrictions: burnout, physicians, error, safety, and quality. Reference lists of selected studies were hand searched. Data were extracted from published reports. All quantitative studies reporting prevalence of burnout and its association with self-reported errors among physicians were considered. The analyses of heterogeneity (Cochran Q, I2), publication bias (Begg-Mazumdar and Egger), three subgroups, and sensitivity were performed. The effect of overall burnout and Maslach Burnout Inventory subscales on self-reported errors was calculated as odds ratios with 95% confidence interval.\n\nResults \nThirteen studies on 20,643 physicians and residents were included. The overall burnout among participants was associated with a significantly increased risk of self-reported errors (odds ratio = 2.72, 95% confidence interval = 2.19–3.37). Emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment were all independently predicting factors of self-reported errors. Cochran Q test and inconsistency index I2 were as follows: Q = 27.2; P = 0.0013, I2 = 67% (36%–83%).\n\nConclusions \nThe results provide evidence that not only overall burnout but also its subscales independently are to be associated with a significantly increased risk of self-reported errors among physicians. As self-reported errors may translate into different types of adverse events, this strong and unequivocal association should be of major concern to healthcare organizations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185557","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62037fa32467f03b337e2d5d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"18","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"d599e2d0-bc88-405d-adda-51f649ffbc4b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"180-188","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.lww.com/journalpatientsafety/Abstract/2022/01000/Association_Between_Physician_Burnout_and.32.aspx","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62037fa32467f03b337e2d5a","name":"Marek","lastName":"Tombarkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d3b0b0c7-3ea4-4580-8315-93b54277d27c"},{"objectId":"5e7094da878c28a0473c5675","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Mańczak","uuid":"1A65B4DE7AA1AD93823DFC472DEF41A4FA6EB0BB04DA7D23417441BF565943520B60FC0E593D12DED586D7434348D79C7217A84A99CFC665D313927C1D06B43A","orcidId":"0000-0002-0736-0389","documentHash":"a380d9df-b052-4978-b629-9c28df4c8860"},{"objectId":"5e709487878c28a0473bf004","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Jabłońska","uuid":"439B10B7880B3A6FCE19F50F6A015DB0B3B43A5FFB1418F3DC3D581F45A3656753009E9A03CC93A3F60035BDED1C64421E56F41E5814B6E00FD3A114125CB4C3","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aad266d9-7bca-4c9e-aac1-cf34aa8ceee1"},{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b4047","name":"Robert","lastName":"Olszewski","uuid":"129B76FE545A1060D89D74F72E62BC2F4B4305FC34589900152A29DE1AC5EC67044609E9B71DFB80CAAEEAA8984DEFD9E215FC60B8B62D04FF5DDE5E659A569F","orcidId":"0000-0002-4210-5279","documentHash":"ea84cb0b-d611-48ee-8c30-92502c5bc571"},{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f52","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Owoc","uuid":"D3B40B64D43A30141EB2C87375E99350CA6719F44433017B779DCE9B98BACE743F3EB3224DEF5C6EB7AD5A5E663853E977438AD5F4FAE47EF4E359FB8158F453","orcidId":"0000-0001-6513-4040","documentHash":"93d612d1-8179-4c4e-85b1-cff74ee93cba"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Epipactis","orchids","autogamy","flower visitor attraction","floral scent","floral volatiles","nectar chemical composition","GC-MS"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922e878c28a0473914f6","5e70922e878c28a047391391","5e70922e878c28a04739147a","5e7094c3878c28a0473c343e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Why does an obligate autogamous orchid produce insect attractants in nectar? - a case study on Epipactis albensis (Orchidaceae)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454773e6","mniswId":"2644","title":"BMC Plant Biology","doi":null,"issn":"1471-2229","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"35976cdd-8bea-4289-bcb7-e089c7b9935e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-13","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62b583474097077f6d5abe72","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094c3878c28a0473c343e","5e70922e878c28a047391391","5e70922e878c28a0473914f6","5e70922e878c28a04739147a"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background\nThe flowers of some species of orchids produce nectar as a reward for pollination, the process of transferring pollen from flower to flower. <i>Epipactis albensis</i> is an obligatory autogamous species, does not require the presence of insects for pollination, nevertheless, it has not lost the ability to produce nectar, the chemical composition of which we examined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) method for identification of potential insect attractants.</p>\nResults\nDuring five years of field research, we did not observe any true pollinating insects visiting the flowers of this species, only accidental insects as ants and aphids. As a result of our studies, we find that this self-pollinating orchid produces in nectar <i>inter alia</i> aliphatic saturated and unsaturated aldehydes such as nonanal (pelargonal) and 2-pentenal as well as aromatic ones (i.e., syringaldehyde, hyacinthin). The nectar is low in alkenes, which may explain the absence of pollinating insects. Moreover, vanillin and eugenol derivatives, well-known as important scent compounds were also identified, but the list of chemical compounds is much poorer compared with a closely related species, insect-pollinating <i>E. helleborine</i>.</p>\nConclusion\nAutogamy is a reproductive mechanism employed by many flowering plants, including the orchid genus <i>Epipactis</i>, as an adaptation to growing in habitats where pollinating insects are rarely observed due to the lack of nectar-producing plants they feed on. The production of numerous chemical attractants by self-pollinated <i>E. albensis</i> confirms the evolutionary secondary process, i.e., transition from ancestral insect-pollinating species to obligatory autogamous."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185558","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"196/1-196/12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-022-03563-3","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094c3878c28a0473c343e","name":"Marek","lastName":"Hojniak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2197972e-d8e7-40bd-8cfb-63b70e9dfcfa"},{"objectId":"5e70922e878c28a0473914f6","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kobyłka","uuid":"FBD95678D254AA750479025801B75E69798C08F0B6FE2D1C38BB3A3083471638F40BCC712CA8BC71DD1EE5B85380E90B0F6DA6EB70946BE871982F0D64EB6295","orcidId":"0000-0002-9680-4382","documentHash":"9e00e068-570c-4eee-9870-fae91b9c0f33"},{"objectId":"5e70922e878c28a04739147a","name":"Anna","lastName":"Jakubska-Busse","uuid":"7CA0AF2A2C073E1EB7557A7903D32AD11D78FDC923E227AC3380E094A77AF7FCCE7AC06B9471469AD216CB565AF167FE3DDEC6D22804DA2DA6CFAEDAB5137F2B","orcidId":"0000-0003-4284-9910","documentHash":"f5967be9-7f7d-4fb5-9c0f-62288b4b20fc"},{"objectId":"5e70922e878c28a047391391","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Czeluśniak","uuid":"BA7EE2C28B1F456423601E1053B80CA906C4D4D06E668431D32F12513E2052B5976683B9906F64AE40E897CBF26F596B99FE0EF72A12F047DEDB2C96FCF22CC3","orcidId":"0000-0002-9633-6419","documentHash":"4dd64252-f7e9-44ac-8b08-79c2db4cb7fd"}],"doi":"10.1186/s12870-022-03563-3"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62d7b738409707188ca87786","doi":null,"title":"Prawo

unparalleled dependency on petroleum based sources urged the research community to focus on developing renewable products, among which nanocellulose based commodities stands at the zenith due to its abundance, biodegradability and biocompatibility. Nanocellulose in form of coatings, aerogels, hydrogels, films and membranes have its own space in the research platform. The different coating technologies like spray, bar, roller, dip and foam coating are currently employed for the fabrication. The profound surface hydroxyl groups on the cellulose helps to incorporate desired properties like antimicrobial or antioxidant activities, barrier properties, superhydrophobicity or superhydrophilicity as per the applications ranging from biomedical to material engineering. Yet, the chemistry of these coatings have to be precisely tuned for its commercialization since many factors play challenging roles while the fabrication process like adhesion, brittleness and barrier properties. The manuscript discusses these aspects of the nanocellulose based coatings along with its challenges and future

Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) comprises a widespread group of slowly-growing bacteria from the Mycobacteriaceae. These bacteria are responsible for opportunistic infections in humans and animals, including farm animals. The aim of the study was to determine whether it is possible to predict the presence of M. avium in pig lymph nodes based on the size and type of lesions found during post-mortem examination at a slaughterhouse. Lymph nodes were collected from 10,600 pigs subjected to such post-mortem examination. The nodes were classified with regard to their quality, and the number of tuberculosis-like lesions; following this, 86 mandibular lymph nodes with lesions and 113 without visible macroscopic lesions were selected for further study. Cultures were established on Löwenstein-Jensen and Stonebrink media, and a commercial GenoType Mycobacterium CM test was used to identify and differentiate M. avium species. The prevalence of M. avium was 56.98% in the lymph nodes with lesions and 19.47% in the unchanged ones. Statistical analysis indicated that visual assessment of lesions in the mandibular lymph nodes, in particular the number of tuberculous lesions, is a highly-efficient diagnostic tool. Similar results were obtained for estimated percentage area affected by the lesion, i.e. the ratio of the changed area of the lymph node in cross-section to the total cross-sectional area of the lymph node; however, this method is more laborious and its usefulness in slaughterhouse conditions is limited. By incising the lymph nodes and assessing the number of tuberculosis-like lesions, it is possible to limit the inclusion of meat from pigs infected with M. avium into the human food chain."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185594","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0269912","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602fa00f9543c7410626f6b4","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Kaczmarkowska","uuid":"66A5980DF727359456FE5EEC4CDC09CE166D32ADA3E8C0D9DC010DE1BBA304045E84F17C60835BDFE2CFCFFFDC37A9476801DCC55D8DEA0621D3A7C625F91F37","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ee0308e6-8f69-4eba-8140-816d183e48c5"},{"objectId":"602f729d9543c7410626f4c4","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Kwiecień","uuid":"B87C6F3E840F90A3139598E9B55BB5EF66E7530A5C88209800169D33F5810FF605DDC8A1A25B3224F89041674476778F5DA69C4BE3FD648B2A72449FB3049CFA","orcidId":"0000-0002-9504-430X","documentHash":"b8184921-4147-4d0e-9ecc-6fd196629c33"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bdef3","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Brzezińska","uuid":"DEC0405D77CE67119892CDF07AB3975093CAFCB6A9970E6C7F61FABA25F5109DBB0702B03B48D78F9150AE7F443FDF11DD320DF52DF0D9D32CBE68867BC58BA7","orcidId":"0000-0002-0746-7063","documentHash":"a5c6cf21-fbd7-4e44-a4b0-b4af377ed94d"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b5a55","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Augustynowicz-Kopeć","uuid":"5D39A4E093F95952C32CFC093E74B37A20C8E88FA81DD9C5C9172D78AF7C28E097A2D8A806159D9D051FA21E7BE33A74D22910267E2AADE426BD4FCE975C1EF0","orcidId":"0000-0001-6162-8748","documentHash":"5714c8d6-ce35-4192-ab7e-1ca6b7c4eb02"},{"objectId":"5e709307878c28a0473a17c9","name":"Anna","lastName":"Didkowska","uuid":"BE8F102ADE1EFA47BABDF55BC7FF50F60E5C59EB95C830D467B9C1A934480B6672DD771CCA5FA838BE8151A1B7D24BF822A4503B1D5C693F1347F34ED3E27464","orcidId":"0000-0003-1073-174X","documentHash":"125d3e2f-5a57-44dc-8518-2977d53526b5"},{"objectId":"5e709297878c28a047398889","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kociuba","uuid":"4C8B36D39200CC91887D57637F60CACF86A804A2285C7874468849B19DEBB681B7F94521AAA70E25468E945D0294E91010D5EF4F888DA57804591DC1CD5E5238","orcidId":"0000-0002-9772-0180","documentHash":"f1e4e3a7-5871-4ba7-b461-223e09b3236b"},{"objectId":"5e709277878c28a047396370","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Klich","uuid":"6E8090F9C83161BC28C827882A7A82319AA1B81B46207D0B678772D03B58834414ABB8C91550468D764728C818F072A4C80496A4C3751A17D981515901F2AAAB","orcidId":"0000-0001-6276-2316","documentHash":"b1fd189a-f82f-4298-8be3-2c428bd54587"},{"objectId":"5e70923a878c28a0473920fd","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Anusz","uuid":"C2290DBF040655729BB9E82B4AC0CFB47A8594E727421542EEA851E6036C6EAA68166496E51F380C690DB781F854939E1AA8F2DDD7319CAEFCE97D5F01A8C4C3","orcidId":"0000-0002-8116-8491","documentHash":"06bf0f26-e53b-48d2-8622-98609890f265"},{"objectId":"5e70923a878c28a0473920f4","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Rzewuska","uuid":"6172A170B02921CDE0F20EE09AD247761D482D72DB9B272AA025A7D9856C207040F5AFA2F6DD9EDAB4F3288577E841F34FF25FCEEF7A91000D39CFDA2CFB64FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-4306-0575","documentHash":"7b62f7ff-7cc8-4f62-9d1b-b531f86e41b6"},{"objectId":"5e70923a878c28a0473920e2","name":"Izabella","lastName":"Dolka","uuid":"568201F3591F93A7930ABE54DEBB835915CB371E815C8D7CB1BC3AFB7186E9EA2BB1B99B6D30FD99079302ACC4FA6A7C5E1D203CD581941FC018C5150C2E795C","orcidId":"0000-0002-6904-0700","documentHash":"f7528603-c1ad-4cdb-a710-23b876529d6f"}],"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0269912"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Lactobacillus

The systematic increase in the support of the hydraulic legs due to deteriorating geological-mining conditions has increased their diameters, which currently exceed 0.32 m for the 1st hydraulic stage. Evaluation of the dynamic properties of the roof support and the hydraulic legs are carried out by the Central Mining Institute through calculation methods as an implementation of the Regulation of the Minister of Energy on occupational safety and health. However, the issue of validating the calculations concerning natural scale studies still needs to be addressed. There are significant limitations in this area due to the technical and metrological capabilities of the testing stations. This paper presents an attempt to evaluate bench testing of a hydraulic leg with 0.32 m of the 1st hydraulic stage diameter for the validation of computational and test methods. Results of previous studies affecting the evaluation of the research methods used are also cited. According to the authors, the optimal and economically justifiable direction is to undertake model tests using numerical analyses and to validate these results, based on the study of models of hydraulic legs that are in use at a reduced scale. The construction of testing stations to ensure adequate dynamic loading for the support of the largest diameter hydraulic legs is currently not economically viable. The problem presented, however, is important given the constantly deteriorating geological-mining conditions and the associated threat of rock mass tremors."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185615","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"67","pagesFromTo":"259-273","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/dlibra/publication/141457/edition/123705/content","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d37","name":"Janina","lastName":"Świątek","uuid":"49488BE970BD399389FE2ACD0E4F1A60398B359690A555FF69A9DBBA196EE6AD32B83F6C5D239ED3FFA4DD97617AEF3C6091CA7E3ED7126B38A8E85925CE0C65","orcidId":"0000-0003-2829-9545","documentHash":"0f0c6c5e-fd4b-42bb-a111-ba48fd6d495b"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396bd0","name":"Marek","lastName":"Płonka","uuid":"3C8614D0022C40A63907919678956D001392E4F8C03018FEA44578E0CF624CFFBA3E4F80DA29BB2C0C6289140E3E5C3E79D3BE865DFB405FEEBE5875751E1C54","orcidId":"0000-0003-2953-1692","documentHash":"4c88f698-a240-43e0-bb48-56d19dcd2d9c"},{"objectId":"5e70925a878c28a04739445b","name":"Kazimierz","lastName":"Stoiński","uuid":"D44327238872F5C4EDD7C5B307C576729ED0F83FF832479E2AEFAE1CBCA133CC749FBCD4B668D40D20580F921F1F39662D88E6FBAA966CFE7F1D78A75CD56DE5","orcidId":"0000-0003-2751-9817","documentHash":"1e972446-962e-47c7-be62-ec39f5784512"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["gasifier soot","microstructure","fractal dimension","gasification","pollutant to resources"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","uid":"bHvub0W7DW61k4FKLYJQ3Zw","uuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","parentUuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de44","rootUuid":"db46d396-2d15-4421-801c-e9db04debfb2","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Długosza w Częstochowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709414878c28a0473b5e0e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Comparison of physicochemical properties and gasification reactivity of soot from entrained flow gasification processes","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775cb","mniswId":"3472","title":"CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL","doi":null,"issn":"1385-8947","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"f24d2dac-4f50-43ed-8908-096bf783ae16"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62b9763b40970710ec707aba","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62b9763b40970710ec707abc","62b9763b40970710ec707abd","62b9763b40970710ec707abe","62b9763b40970710ec707abf","62b9763b40970710ec707ac0","62b9763b40970710ec707ac1","62b9763b40970710ec707ac2","62b9763b40970710ec707ac3","5e709414878c28a0473b5e0e"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Soot formation has been a hurdle to the development of entrained flow gasification (EFG) technology, as it damages the apparatus and remains a pollutant. Soot has a poor gasification reactivity in the multiphase flow in furnace. In this study, differences in physicochemical properties and their relationship with gasification reactivity were revealed for natural gas-derived soot (NGS), coal-derived soot (CS), and biomass-derived soot (BS) from EFG process. A comparative study was also conducted between the gasifier soot and a commercial carbon black (CB), N330. The thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) results showed the descending order of the activation energy (Ea) of gasifier soot was NGS>BS>CS, in both CO2 and H2O gasification process. Transmission electron microscopes (TEM) and Raman spectrum further determined that the gasification reactivity was highly dependent on the carbon content, carbon type, and graphitization degree but less dependent on soot microstructure. This study also investigated the potential replacement of commercial N330 as a rubber reinforcement additive with soot as a pollutant. This replacement was based on the microstructure similarities between soot and CB, as determined using fractal dimension (Dp) as an indicator on a statistical level from TEM. The Dp of NGS was 1.35, 1.06 times larger than that of CS, and 1.22 times larger than of BS. It was highly feasible that NGS would have the close physical property of N330 and could potentially replace the expensive N330 as a rubber reinforcement material."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185617","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62aca3374097076bfe980336","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"c69a6f14-e36d-4db6-8d99-501e3a472288"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"450","pagesFromTo":"136660","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S1385894722021556?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62b9763b40970710ec707ac3","name":"Fuchen","lastName":"Wang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"005073c4-337d-4c1f-bb62-e6c355c25e18"},{"objectId":"62b9763b40970710ec707ac2","name":"Guangsuo","lastName":"Yu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b89f5f11-4c13-43e2-a88d-78448a4e1bcd"},{"objectId":"62b9763b40970710ec707ac1","name":"Zhenghua","lastName":"Dai","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e5d73210-d84d-4a4d-b061-deb23bed5f02"},{"objectId":"62b9763b40970710ec707ac0","name":"Yunfei","lastName":"Gao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3c04ab11-8754-4763-a237-8d80525ef96f"},{"objectId":"62b9763b40970710ec707abf","name":"Lu","lastName":"Ding","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f8d29e26-a5df-44d8-9256-fee43a891b61"},{"objectId":"62b9763b40970710ec707abe","name":"Zhekun","lastName":"Chen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e8d37803-181b-41a1-a4ff-1164dd3b6659"},{"objectId":"62b9763b40970710ec707abd","name":"Yao","lastName":"Xiao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a41f383f-6857-49b1-bf2c-ba0616d03aaf"},{"objectId":"62b9763b40970710ec707abc","name":"Ming","lastName":"Gao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0075d9f0-cd88-4e16-92e5-8325ca92a475"},{"objectId":"5e709414878c28a0473b5e0e","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Krzywański","uuid":"6FAC0E6B4BE245209A579086F25201680319A379B458D4CE7B093503D9FB8BE571A6F2AAAE587850D438562E9A173BFD436E1FD05100FC55B355F2EE2E0E4E23","orcidId":"0000-0002-6364-7894","documentHash":"e203dab7-5806-4c43-a874-f46d47f677b3"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.cej.2022.136660"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["schoolchildren","mental capacity","meritocratic education","secondary school","dynamic changesv"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091d6878c28a04738c1e3","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"V.

The study involved 56 secondary schoolchildren in the dynamics of learning, which were divided into 2 groups depending on the education system. The level of mental capacity was assessed using proofreading tests of V. Ya. Anfimov. Statistical data processing was performed using one-way analysis of variance and t-test in the software package IBM SPSS Statistics 20.\n\nResults. During the period of basic education, the level of influence of the type of educational program, type of subject and day of the week on the accuracy of the test performance increased, the amount of work increased by 16.2-16.7 % (p<0.01) and its accuracy decreased (p<0,05). Higher initial and post-load intensity of mental capacity was revealed in schoolchildren with meritocratic education (353.23±8.52 and 341.41±8.65 respectively), and with a traditional system - higher and stable accuracy (5.68-5.86 errors) and productivity of mental work (35.29-35.72 conventional units; p<0.01). The weekly efficiency curve was the opposite in terms of accuracy for 6th and 9th grade schoolchildren, and the identical in terms of volume. In meritocratic education, a higher level of intensity was registered in the mathematics lesson, and in the traditional educational program − accuracy against the background of negative dynamics of quantitative and complex indicators.\n\nConclusions. Gender and age features of intensity, accuracy and productivity of mental work during basic education and the level of influence of factors of the educational process on them are established. The increase in the level of educational load was accompanied by an increase in the intensity and accuracy of mental work due to the adaptation of schoolchildren to the peculiarities of learning in secondary school and the stabilization of physiological processes. Comparison of weekly curves of mental capacity during training allowed to identify certain age trends in the formation of mental fatigue"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185622","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b5629b40970724320e1dea","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"3(48)","doi":"","documentHash":"68273ecc-6806-4705-a0e7-5d2427ebf35b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"43-50","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/sr_med/article/download/258096/255370","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62b5757640970724320ebaae","name":"Iryna","lastName":"Dudnyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8722-3108","documentHash":"e6280604-fa1d-4d85-9066-fff46bd166c4"},{"objectId":"62b5757640970724320ebaad","name":"Olha","lastName":"Zinchuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6777-2302","documentHash":"adc58c4a-a9db-45f5-90a7-b7f8faf21204"},{"objectId":"62b5757640970724320ebaac","name":"Tetiana","lastName":"Havrylova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6919-8348","documentHash":"b653314f-a7b7-4ecc-960c-56d83c6fd76c"},{"objectId":"62b5757640970724320ebaab","name":"Zhanna","lastName":"Sotnikova-Meleshkina","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-5534-8264","documentHash":"afd65c80-906c-4403-a8cb-8849c88490f5"}],"doi":"10.15587/2519-4798.2022.258096"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hydrolate","Urticaceae","volatile compounds","stinging nettle","secondary metabolites","Urtica doica L"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d4878c28a0473b172d","5e7093cc878c28a0473b0f0d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Determining the Parameters of the Stinging Nettle (Urtica dioica L.)

Despite the popularity of nettle hydrolate, there is currently no literature\ndescribing its composition; likewise, there is still a lack of research describing in detail the parameters\nof hydrolates in general. U. dioica hydrolate fractions were obtained by industrial steam distillation\nof fresh herb. Total stinging nettle hydrolate was prepared by mixing an equal volume of each\nfraction. The volatiles were isolated from hydrolate samples by liquid–liquid extraction with diethyl\nether, and analysed using GC-FID-MS. Over eighty volatile compounds were identified in U. dioica\nhydrolate. The main group of constituents were oxygenated compounds, mainly alcohols (e.g.,\n(E)- and (Z)-hex-3-en-1-ol, carvacrol) and oxides (e.g., caryophyllene oxide). The content of volatiles\nin the representative sample of total hydrolate amounted to 58.2 mg/L. Some qualitative and quantita-\ntive changes in the composition of U. dioica hydrolate were observed during the progress of distillation.\nThe content of low chain aliphatic alcohols ((E)- and (Z)-hex-3-en-1-ol) decreased, whereas the per-\ncentage of some monoterpene alcohols (carvacrol and ?-terpineol) increased. The total content of\nvolatiles in hydrolate also changed and decreased (128.0–6.2 mg/L) during distillation progress.\nAccording to our results, to produce stinging nettle hydrolate of good quality, the proper relationship\nbetween the amount of hydrolate and raw plant material should result in obtaining 0.74 L hydrolate\nfrom 1 kg of fresh stinging nettle herb.

The most stable tautomer with the five-membered ring stabilized by two double C=C and C=N bonds, was detected in argon matrices after deposition. When the AMT/Ar matrices were exposed to 265 nm selective irradiation, three main photoproducts, N-(1-sulfanylprop-1-en-2-yl)carbodiimide (fp1), N-(1-thioxopropan-2-yl)carbodiimide (fp2) and N-(2-methylthiiran-2-yl)carbodiimide (fp3), were photoproduced by a cleavage of the CS–CN bond together with hydrogen atom migration. The minor photoreaction caused by the cleavage of the CS–CC bond and followed by hydrogen migration formed 2-methyl-1H-azirene-1-carbimidothioic acid (fp15). We have also found that cleavage of the CS–CN bond followed by disruption of the N–C bond produced cyanamide (fp11) and the ˙C(CH3)=CH–S˙ biradical that transformed into 2-methylthiirene (fp12) and further photoreactions produced 1-propyne-1-thiole (fp13) or methylthioketene (fp14).

However, directly returning compost leachates to the mixture might increase the concentration of contaminants in the stabilized mass. The application of the ultrasonic modification of leachate was aimed at increasing the activity of microorganisms and the availability of nutrients, and reducing the number of pathogenic species. The purpose of the work was to determine the impact of variable ultrasonic (time and amplitude) field parameters on the biochemical properties, and number of selected groups of microorganisms, of leachates from a composting process. The tests used short sonication times of 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 s and vibration amplitudes of 15.25, 30.5, and 46 µm. The assessment was made on the basis of changes in numbers of microbial communities (mesophilic, thermophilic, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and fungi) and enzymatic activity (dehydrogenases-DHA), as well as respiratory activity (AR). Based on the conducted research, it was found that the leachate sonication time of 60 s and amplitude 30.5 µm were the most effective. The above parameters were considered borderline, above which there were no significant differences in the values of the analyzed indicators."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185636","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.14","pagesFromTo":"brak","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/9/5502","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709202878c28a04738e7d5","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Worwąg","uuid":"3B5901486A0AE5C9B4A0083261DF4FD126C751F06FA2B6850C266324218B2220CDCD80CFDFA495F33F7221A11C6780AC5EEE12A15339DF3A7BC84EB51BDAE81D","orcidId":"0000-0001-9029-8944","documentHash":"61ed5e3c-1960-4a87-b322-4031df1d94b9"},{"objectId":"5e709202878c28a04738e7be","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Zawieja","uuid":"609ECCAD1BC726E393353EF5F17E4CCDD9356E38B091DEEA65F79FF5997BA18919FD6C6E8B9BD553CDE191DC708FAE08D8C80DDB40E7E774101BAC52E86D45E0","orcidId":"0000-0002-4480-8736","documentHash":"986c7baf-3d75-44fa-8fc0-d1788fa2cc1d"}],"doi":"10.3390/su14095502"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["concrete additives; concrete fibers; concrete strength tests; threshold effect"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1e4","uid":"bkbp2VYA4xopaIA4HrQlzTQ","uuid":"21621076-b7f2-4bc3-a5a5-e684c8630041","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wydział Inżynierii Lądowej i Geodezji","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929f878c28a047399700","5e70929f878c28a0473996dd","5e70929f878c28a047399701"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Influence of the Type of Fibers on the Reduction of the Threshold Effect in the Transition Zone of a Railway Track","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1944","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6303a2784097075e4a6d9b2e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929f878c28a0473996dd","6303a2784097075e4a6d9b30","6303a2784097075e4a6d9b31","5e70929f878c28a047399700","5e70929f878c28a047399701"]},"issue":"16","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The presented article concentrates on the influence of various concrete additives in the form of fibers on the mechanical parameters of concrete so as to obtain the effect of gradual changes in these parameters, which is very important in the transition zone of the railway track. Steel, polymer and glass fibers, as well as concrete without additives, were accepted for the study. The effect of additives on the consistency of the mixture, compressive strength, frost resistance and elastic modulus was studied. The research concerned concrete samples and models of elements of the ballastless railway surface, i.e., track slab and concrete block supports. The track slab model was made of concrete without additives, while the models of supports were made both without and with additives. The studies were carried out in laboratory conditions. As a result, the tested concrete samples with various additives were ranked so that they could be used as a material for elements of the railway surface in the transition zones of engineering facilities on railway roads, which is important from the point of view of reducing the threshold effect occurring in these zones. Detailed laboratory tests were presented, the results of these studies were discussed, and final conclusions were drawn regarding the technology of materials and the methodology of constructing the transition zones of the railway surface in order to avoid or at least reduce the threshold effect existing in such zones"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185644","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62ffa0e040970761e7670615","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"16","doi":null,"documentHash":"fe3db8ed-c332-4529-9498-a24aa517c04f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"5730","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/16/5730/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6303a2784097075e4a6d9b31","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Pokropski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4f1b1e7d-5695-4401-a2b6-1a8741fefea9"},{"objectId":"6303a2784097075e4a6d9b30","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Lewandrowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e573be3e-ee12-473d-b289-ebebba2745bc"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a047399701","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Rudnicki","uuid":"0AD6A80E93C6717641B4D494E8D1A91D52E0A99EC59D19ABF45FB76F1F8AA6937E75E5E9E29611CE13AD720E533D4ECF8173940352731ED2481F725662A7C0F4","orcidId":"0000-0003-4522-2750","documentHash":"ef25d03c-d32b-4300-8b06-c3b6912e8a5f"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a047399700","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Rogojsz","uuid":"6C2E149F84F2ABD5BE95E34EE521B6BD9FE4FF78427D4309799B7B3A279C0EA5D323433144B4DA0CCD92420C8C146CDA32D047E95B7D93ED263E935240959A33","orcidId":"0000-0003-1501-2007","documentHash":"55f202d9-9b50-47b7-95a0-34a0a9947eb6"},{"objectId":"5e70929f878c28a0473996dd","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Idczak","uuid":"C0FC802CCE71FBFC8C333B225FCFEB8B8C40A14110F91318BA355E87E8A90FF7DAB05A85BB710C5AF9DE97D45E6E12BB343C6F42C63217C3304FB18D59101D56","orcidId":"0000-0002-0259-8152","documentHash":"ee040091-6a1e-4729-b52e-eae5eac1bef0"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15165730"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"630343494097075e4a6b1046","doi":null,"title":"Kierunki i perspektywy rozwoju odnawialnych źródeł energii.

Pomimo przyjęcia Polski do struktur Paktu Północnoatlantyckiego 12.03.1999 r. w Independence, w USA, zagrożenie w różnych dziedzinach bezpieczeństwa narodowego ciągle istnieje, a w niektórych nawet wzrasta."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185655","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"143-161","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://oficyna.prz.edu.pl/fcp/iGBUKOQtTKlQhbx08SlkTUgxQX2o8DAoHNiwFE1xVT35XFVZpCFghUHcKVigEQUw/18/public/otwarty-dostep/2022/2-monogr-internet.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093d4878c28a0473b16f0","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Karwan","uuid":"36B033F173EEF64F17097BBA4B68FEFD7108A9970198C15AAC69107EB6393B6ED7668B5AED55A11718759D1DA068DFF44F4667086FC830141C38B1A823DF4C92","orcidId":"0000-0002-0611-7264","documentHash":"8b3e17dd-3a2b-47a2-9953-2cf51231bc78"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["monitoring system; gas monitoring; underground mine; coal mine; wireless energy transfer; single-wire energy transfer"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709195878c28a04737f723","uid":"bFx_aJwdq28ivBe-OSOfEWQ","uuid":"9ca024e5-9515-4af9-85e0-02ab32d3d65d","parentId":"5e709195878c28a04737f723","parentUuid":"9ca024e5-9515-4af9-85e0-02ab32d3d65d","rootId":"5e709195878c28a04737f723","rootUuid":"9ca024e5-9515-4af9-85e0-02ab32d3d65d","name":"Instytut Techniki Górniczej KOMAG","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70934d878c28a0473a6df2","5e7093c6878c28a0473b0a40"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Designing a Monitoring System to Observe the Innovative Single-Wire and Wireless Energy Transmitting Systems in Explosive Areas of Underground Mines","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1073","eissn":null,"websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/energies","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"50727a7d-ab2b-443d-a0df-b47b78e4f0a9"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"JANUARY","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620b623c2467f07b3c5a0001","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["620b623c2467f07b3c5a0003","620b623d2467f07b3c5a0004","620b623d2467f07b3c5a0005","5e70934d878c28a0473a6df2","620b623d2467f07b3c5a0007","620b623d2467f07b3c5a0008","5e7093c6878c28a0473b0a40"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Suspended monorails are a common mode of transportation for materials and personnel in underground mines.

Measurements of non-prompt J/ψ originating from the weak decays of b-hadrons, can provide an estimate of beauty quark production in nuclear collisions. It is observed that the production of non-prompt J/ψ is modified in Pb−Pb collisions in comparison to that in pp collisions at the same energy scaled by the number of binary collisions, as quantified by nuclear modification factors (RAA). It is related to hot medium effects taking place during the QGP phase. The measurement of nuclear modification factors in p−Pb collisions is used to assess the so-called Cold Nuclear Matter (CNM) effects which can further modify the production yields of non-prompt J/ψ in collisions involving heavy-ions. The ALICE detector has excellent capabilities to measure J/ψ in the e+e− decay channel at midrapidity down to zero transverse momentum (pT) allowing the statistical separation of the non-prompt J/ψ component for pT down to pT = 1 GeV/c.\nIn this contribution \textendash , ALICE midrapidity results on non-prompt J/ψ production cross sections in pp collisions are presented and compared with the theoretical models. Moreover, RAA of non-prompt J/ψ at midrapidity as a function of pT in p−Pb collisions at the center-of-mass energy per nucleon pair sNN−−−√ = 5.02 TeV are presented and further compared with RAA of non-prompt J/ψ in Pb−Pb collisions at sNN−−−√ = 2.76 TeV.

Encapsulation in capsules remains the method of choice, but its\napplicability in precise magnetometry is limited. This is particularly true for minute specimens in the\nsingle milligram range as they are outweighed by the capsules and are subject to large alignment\nerrors. We present here a completely new experimental methodology that permits 30-fold in situ\nreduction of the signal of capsules by substantially restoring the symmetry of the sample holder that\nis otherwise broken by the presence of the capsule. In practical terms it means that the standard\n30 mg capsule is seen by the magnetometer as approximately a 1 mg object, effectively opening\nthe window for precise magnetometry of single milligram specimens.

We focus on studying gravitational wave (GW) emission produced during MBH mergers in terms of their detectability with current and future detectors, namely, Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) and Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The key advantage of SHARK is that it provides a way to explore a number of distinct models of MBH and galaxy evolution processes within a consistent framework and it was also successfully tested against current constraints from electromagnetic observations. In our work, we studied 12 models that vary in terms of their MBH seed formation scenarios and we tested two different MBH growth and feedback models. Based on our estimates, we find that LISA will be able to detect several to several tens of merger events per year for the most and least massive seed scenarios, respectively. We also show that the strength of this relation depends on the MBH growth model, where in the most extreme case, we find twice as many detected events for the same initial seed masses. Finally, we estimated the amplitude of the GW background at nHz frequencies to be on the order of 1.4 × 10<SUP>−16</SUP> − 1.1 × 10<SUP>−15</SUP>. This value depends solely on the time delay between the merger of galaxies and their MBHs."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185669","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"660","pagesFromTo":"A68","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A&A...660A..68C","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62b571444097077f6d5a489e","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Curyło","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fb5b864e-60e5-403b-b59d-69753a4ee3a0"},{"objectId":"5e709356878c28a0473a7921","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Bulik","uuid":"7AB8A64192D6469FADF6554CD24B13484A11CC5987A0362C40319B6C3DF9CFC27134599CFA3EDB7F89281C00C04E76B26C63A5A496B27FAC0EDB18D6A448D37F","orcidId":"0000-0003-2045-4803","documentHash":"3c84b7ce-4fb5-476d-b1e8-4686d8ed73bb"}],"doi":"10.1051/0004-6361/202141987"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["rodzicielstwo;","płodność;","wychowanie do małżeństwa;","wybór współmałżonka"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["parenthood;","fertility;","raising for marriage;","spouse choice"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ea878c28a04739f1d2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Wychowanie do małżeństwa i rodzicielstwa w aspekcie płodności kobiet ze szczególnym uwzględnieniem matrymonialnej roli balu","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a468","mniswId":"200152","title":"Rozprawy Społeczne","doi":null,"issn":"2081-6081","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"326bca5d-3ff8-42e1-95d9-c78fcf726f34"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_SA","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"JUNE","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62b9874640970710ec719d4a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ea878c28a04739f1d2"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Kobieca płodność, która trwa stosunkowo krótko, determinuje realizację rodzicielskich zamierzeń.

It is predicted to be located in the plasma membrane and it is essential for Candida albicans zinc uptake and growth at acidic pH. Zrt2 from C. albicans is composed of 370 amino acids and contains eight putative transmembrane domains and an extra-membrane disordered loop, corresponding to the amino acid sequence 126–215. This protein region contains at least three possible metal binding motifs: HxHxHxxD (144–153), HxxHxxEHxD (181–193) and the Glu- and Asp- rich sequence DDEEEDxE (161–168). The corresponding model peptides, protected at their termini (Ac-GPHTHSHFGD-NH<sub>2</sub>, Ac-DDEEEDLE-NH<sub>2</sub> and Ac-PSHFAHAQEHQDP-NH<sub>2</sub>), have been investigated in order to elucidate the thermodynamic and coordination properties of their Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> complexes, with the further aim to identify the most effective metal binding site among the three fragments. Furthermore, we extended the investigation to the peptides Ac-GPHTHAHFGD-NH<sub>2</sub> and Ac-PAHFAHAQEHQDP-NH<sub>2</sub>, where serine residues have been substituted by alanines in order to check if the presence of a serine residue may favor the displacement of amidic protons by Cu<sup>2+</sup>. In the native Zrt2 protein, the Ac-GPHTHSHFGD-NH<sub>2</sub> region of the Zrt2 loop has the highest metal binding affinity, showing that three alternated histidines separated by only one residue (-HxHxH-) bind Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> more strongly than the region in which three histidines are separated by two and three His residues (-HxxHxxxH- in Ac-PSHFAHAQEHQDP-NH<sub>2</sub>). All studied Zrt2 loop fragments have lower affinity towards Zn<sup>2+</sup> than the zinc(II) binding site on the Zrt1 transporter; also, all three Zrt2 regions bind Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> with comparable affinity below pH 5 and, therefore, may equally contribute to the metal acquisition under the most acidic conditions in which the Zrt2 transporter is expressed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185676","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"121/1-121/16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biom12010121","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62b5719b4097077f6d5a7c40","name":"Maurizio","lastName":"Remelli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f8988b76-d30b-4dc0-b2b8-225ad452eb9d"},{"objectId":"62b5719b4097077f6d5a7c3f","name":"Denise","lastName":"Bellotti","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3a880bee-1506-4a99-bd59-a08cfe9d63d3"},{"objectId":"5e7093eb878c28a0473b352b","name":"ADRIANA","lastName":"MILLER","uuid":"3BA0FA313401FD49B348927A1F3F79831C4BD1AD48A7B42467EE3B874E374277166C66EDEE09488AABDD04B86F7D8CB28DB52596721611B531416CE7BE54BBD0","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"24a0e32c-1060-4f0f-a857-271df871f965"},{"objectId":"5e709231878c28a0473916ce","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Rowińska-Żyrek","uuid":"EA8740CA78CC0D6A9BEF105A5CE500543BE74E2CC299E2596B29DB14EEF5DDA001C57BBC5036B0DD453AC2C5AACE9470BA9AEBB92D39C4AB26D42D8983524F1F","orcidId":"0000-0002-0425-1128","documentHash":"6f1ac606-9d53-4e37-b1f0-567857f17648"}],"doi":"10.3390/biom12010121"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["konformacje cząsteczek chitozanu","ładunek cząsteczki chitozanu","średnica hydrodynamiczna","modelowanie dynamiki molekularnej","zeta potencjał"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["chitosan molecule conformations","chitosan molecule charge","hydrodynamic diameter","molecular dynamics modeling","intrinsic viscosity","zeta potential"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Chitosan characteristics in electrolyte solutions : combined molecular dynamics modeling and slender body hydrodynamics","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547753f","mniswId":"3243","title":"Carbohydrate Polymers","doi":null,"issn":"0144-8617","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"c286039e-3a04-4eba-ac21-f6a7e1962904"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-27","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6304922540970739a7629da3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["66029ece4097076263242924","66029ece4097076263242925","66029ece4097076263242926","66029ece4097076263242927","5e709349878c28a0473a6742","5e7093e6878c28a0473b2ecb","5e7092bd878c28a04739bdb6","66029ece4097076263242928"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Molecular dynamics modeling was applied to predict chitosan molecule conformations, the contour length, the\r\ngyration radius, the effective cross-section and the density in electrolyte solutions.

These mixed results point to the likely existence of third variables influencing the link between tears and perceived competence and suggest that crying may affect competence only in specific circumstances. In the current project, we reexamine this link using a large, openly available dataset of responses to tearful faces collected across 41 countries and 7,007 participants (Zickfeld et al., 2021). Our results show that tears have no general effect on perceptions of competence but do reduce competence when crying is regarded as inappropriate (e.g., there is no clear reason for shedding tears) or when the target is perceived as helpless. Moreover, shedding tears increases competence when the target is perceived as honest. As emotional tears have been found to signal both helplessness and honesty, the interplay of these effects might result in no overall effect of tears on perceptions of competence. The present findings suggest that the link between emotional tears and perceived competence is highly context dependent."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185681","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"292-304","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/emo0001010","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65707dc64097071b8e612ce4","name":"Niels","lastName":"van de Ven","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3913560b-a619-4537-bd54-f7ee7b4529a8"},{"objectId":"65707dc64097071b8e612ce3","name":"Janis H.","lastName":"Zickfeld","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"34829d10-cec2-4565-bf7c-5e56b5edd70b"},{"objectId":"602e11959543c7410626eba6","name":"Julia","lastName":"Wągrowska","uuid":"81C52379C60B23A0CEC967100500D9947EC3C93F86E3ADFED58A2A0CF3212D33B29970D8A616C7D23C3FE471A58832B8A9CFE6B7F883F4D486D306A55DE1ED65","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"be86b7f0-76c5-43da-b74e-2894a63884a2"},{"objectId":"5e709378878c28a0473aa76c","name":"Monika","lastName":"Wróbel","uuid":"8AA40F6B3421E5D0F67A098EC42A3EE2D27B55CD8975EA6DD87497F221FC6FA6196822BC7EF563C0F135980E08EDF2C587B688295E20E9C6983B2296F816FC8C","orcidId":"0000-0002-4326-6154","documentHash":"26afa370-a60a-4021-889c-c28d66a61e61"}],"doi":"10.1037/emo0001010"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ants","Greece","Macedonia","Thassos","faunistics"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092cd878c28a04739ce90","5e7091f5878c28a04738dba1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Notes on ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) of Thassos Island, Greece","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e71060446e0fb0001b894a8","mniswId":null,"title":"Annals of the Upper Silesian Museum in Bytom, Entomology","doi":null,"issn":"0867-1966","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"cb86b0b5-6ee7-4b37-8cac-c13f181fb50a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-17","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620f4c7c2467f0419c57d32b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7091f5878c28a04738dba1","5e7092cd878c28a04739ce90"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A list of 52 ant species and 6 morphospecies collected recently from 36 sampling sites on Thassos island is given.

This study complements previous studies by exploring the retail investors’ attitude toward ESG in Poland as a Central and Eastern European country (CEE) with a minor but developing sustainable investment market. While EU ESG regulations focus mostly on disclosure obligations, this study aims to determine whether retail investors in Poland are interested in ESG and identifies the conditions for the investors’ interest. The binomial logistic regression is applied to retail investors based on data from a survey of a representative sample of the Polish population. The results show that Poles consider human-caused climate changes as an important challenge and most of those willing to invest in the capital market want to do so in a sustainable way. However, they are unwilling to sacrifice their profits for the sake of ESG. Only those investors who make investment decisions based on social aspects are more likely to forgo a part of their profits. Women are more willing to engage in responsible investments and forgo higher profits."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185688","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09721509221114754","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709431878c28a0473b7f6d","name":"Janina","lastName":"Petelczyc","uuid":"8D014C06E080AEFF34326D1309DBEB92225FF5D5E8855462F33C10A4CC18A69A0D29BF18E4369D963E5403658FC154160EAA2C8C6C7C8B6AA22DFCC7CDE59850","orcidId":"0000-0002-5800-3269","documentHash":"a2e22db3-5ec1-4879-b0ea-881233a5e37d"}],"doi":"10.1177/09721509221114754"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"9783030785352","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Regenerative Territories: Dimensions of Circularity for Healthy Metabolisms","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":318,"publicationPlace":"Cham","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"PUBLISHER_WEBSITE","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"FEBRUARY","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620b92602467f07b3c5b2683","editors":[{"objectId":"620b92602467f07b3c5b2686","name":"Arjan","lastName":"van Timmeren","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"574567c6-5eac-4291-bafd-384d435ff7a4"},{"objectId":"620b92602467f07b3c5b2685","name":"Michelangelo","lastName":"Russo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f59a2690-09cc-4006-a782-272df1666e7d"},{"objectId":"620b92602467f07b3c5b2684","name":"Libera","lastName":"Amenta","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a11a637a-599c-4fac-9014-1ee07783b64f"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["620b92602467f07b3c5b2684","620b92602467f07b3c5b2685","620b92602467f07b3c5b2686"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058185689","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":"0924-5499","series":"GeoJournal Library","translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-78536-9.pdf","numberInSeries":"128","authors":[],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-78536-9"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709218878c28a04738fde2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Postępowanie w przedmiocie przedłużenia stosowania, uchylenia lub zmiany środka zabezpieczającego -

The study involved 22 healthy children at an average age of 7 months and with an Apgar score of 8–10 points, who were referred for rehabilitation due to a slight delay in the phases of psychomotor development. The first group consisted of 11 children with increased muscle tone (IMT) and the second group consisted of 11 children with non-increased muscle tone (nonIMT). All study participants received a one-time Vojta therapy session, which was continued for 4 weeks by parents at home. The viscoelastic parameters of the dorsal extensor muscle were measured three times. In the first study group, changes in the viscoelastic parameters of the extensor muscles of the back occurred immediately after the therapy at the first examination, whereas changes in the supporting and extensor function of the limbs occurred in both groups at the second examination. Analysis featuring an objective assessment allows physiotherapists to diagnose local changes in the viscoelastic parameters after the implementation of therapy. These studies are the first pilot studies to be continued with a 30- or 60-day follow-up."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185697","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63047bcd40970739a761f724","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"19","number":"16","doi":null,"documentHash":"6fcf689c-4343-4220-b2a8-f7a2b280debd"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"art. 10448, s. 1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/16/10448/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093c1878c28a0473b0393","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Ptak","uuid":"9B61DCEA42B696A3275EAC2D5BB3AA04EE08F0D60AE344DA98D10B8180A8580B1AB8786D43277CA2D550AA10355BA2930547D750C6F6C89711DD65A6EA2DF500","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"59f927ca-27b5-47a9-900c-da54303a8d38"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394b89","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Dębiec-Bąk","uuid":"DA8C34E18C5284745DD72F8570B4142F326551CF2D85EEF59207ED8B5628D38DB5A9D2E94FA9C62DBCEF914BFE31C9FA93FDFE171E5E44A4D67067ED36BFD178","orcidId":"0000-0001-7005-3018","documentHash":"d24d4fba-bb78-494b-90b0-9a6394ca741c"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394b3f","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Stefańska","uuid":"FF4262BB2960DAB73FDE64EEF3CB773B1E9EFD0F6DE9E93447602B4703CB993051E20D3654F812AB541DF22ED48FB43DE949B6ED720001EA26391261591DE61B","orcidId":"0000-0003-2070-8535","documentHash":"8a841b43-c469-442e-a109-64f8629b5584"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph191610448"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"620dfca12467f02b135c6e70","doi":null,"title":"Encyclopedia of Smart Materials.

of peptide biomarkers of pathological states of the organism is often a serious challenge, due to a very complex composition of the cell and insufficient sensitivity of the current analytical methods (including mass spectrometry). One of the possible ways to overcome this problem is sample enrichment by capturing the selected components using a specific solid support. Another option is increasing the detectability of the desired compound by its selective tagging. Appropriately modified and immobilized peptides can be used for these purposes. In addition, they find application in studying the specificity and activity of proteolytic enzymes. Immobilized heterocyclic peptide conjugates may serve as metal ligands, to form complexes used as catalysts or analytical markers. In this review, we describe various applications of immobilized peptides, including selective capturing of cysteine-containing peptides, tagging of the carbonyl compounds to increase the sensitivity of their detection, enrichment of biological samples in deoxyfructosylated peptides, and fishing out of tyrosine–containing peptides by the formation of azo bond. Moreover, the use of the one-bead-one-compound peptide library for the analysis of substrate specificity and activity of caspases is described. Furthermore, the evolution of immobilization from the solid support used in peptide synthesis to nanocarriers is presented. Taken together, the examples presented here demonstrate immobilized peptides as a multifunctional tool, which can be successfully used to solve multiple analytical problems."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185706","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"31/1-31/26","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/chemosensors10010031","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"616a392975234017e0545a79","name":"Marta","lastName":"Kowalska","uuid":"5B2F248DDC4A41EEE75D98B74B99FE0CC18B3018AC9165A84139EF45A892FC7931FDF7D667EC5E189E69292BF58C0BC0045EEE267DD2DF997DC716CFF90F827F","orcidId":"0000-0003-4245-3203","documentHash":"cc506884-3abe-4249-80bb-946ee9460758"},{"objectId":"5f9287b3085dcb424e4c1a65","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Popiel","uuid":"C2EC09A8BFC2D137D74854B753BDCFAB5E7860ECB3B2C7A424AE2B074C27FC20D64E484CE4D73DD04E38225E3244D1971974A8A98A96678760D825DB3759F613","orcidId":"0000-0002-6144-9915","documentHash":"8e151c93-afb6-47a8-acd3-af77d7d83e32"},{"objectId":"5f92602a085dcb424e4c1a1c","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Walter","uuid":"ED0E046002CF0D45D32B5A3FE192588EA5237D8DA7E504912F59AB2DA635E240AF9C9AB4A9704FA4566CA2D1B709147B1A365BF8462BA8E1EFC11381332B2C89","orcidId":"0000-0001-6219-9965","documentHash":"b6bbb906-2bbb-4d5a-9c5d-27fd93d2d00f"},{"objectId":"5e70944a878c28a0473b9ca6","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Modzel","uuid":"442D6C07F2895DCAD5C3AE428974944E86032F2103B9E81CBD174227822FC8B2E2A0A16C9640090123D51E00C28548FDAAFBCBE0B41D48205AF4AFBAA856F637","orcidId":"0000-0003-2063-0563","documentHash":"c4e77b77-2632-4523-ae9a-7c26b7e45ae9"},{"objectId":"5e709431878c28a0473b7e4a","name":"Remigiusz","lastName":"Bąchor","uuid":"DE0A26B63D502D4258C709A18B1B7401218D4A919969B3B6B638383B70BCE704F2AE71239C7D8297409B0BF5A7E23C6248EEFC641ED390AE3E432F717D5FD691","orcidId":"0000-0003-1247-8709","documentHash":"97a765ea-1083-4f3f-aa79-e8c50638ead2"},{"objectId":"5e7093b3878c28a0473af6e1","name":"Monika","lastName":"Biernat","uuid":"0744CF5B159704DAC10B5C2F194317CA3485410A90EC69EB6F705F453E3C643E5B462F1B0B8471342C06439A39DA8014733E86BEC7CD2555445D98C20C308926","orcidId":"0000-0002-5812-8520","documentHash":"719aec5b-5a36-4623-8c4a-2f0512511181"},{"objectId":"5e70922f878c28a04739155b","name":"Mariola","lastName":"Kuczer","uuid":"B9D79D2502DFCC836DEF6689F0628D8B1039C4D0A63AD929ADEB1C9A3689315414DE963698187082ECB9E4C33F7F47686E0250D8130912134A075FD45DDFC903","orcidId":"0000-0002-3151-1538","documentHash":"1b27c95e-d78f-4f52-b0f1-6018a37143cf"},{"objectId":"5e70922e878c28a0473914f1","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Kluczyk","uuid":"94155C793F74D893DB0C602AE47694709C2C5BD2BCD6FEBB3E1746CDAB6FC2003B102442EBB20E0FB1B5D9C79498F89E1249D914E96026DC16BEC1FAB9EF00BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-2943-2782","documentHash":"d2f621bd-e7a6-44b1-991f-e92f4d566fef"},{"objectId":"5e70922e878c28a0473914e0","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kijewska","uuid":"45F72D310301AB60328540CDADA66EEA6805498E7D9E2E1054EC17C33691E6EA4D79D9D493FC4B0ED083C9F8B6D6DD743C3ADAD5BB4F5C43FD43510B01149443","orcidId":"0000-0001-6227-7169","documentHash":"b7aafc9e-76f0-49c1-b45a-6dd06014d078"},{"objectId":"5e70922e878c28a04739135f","name":"Marek","lastName":"Cebrat","uuid":"201F79B7D121E606EDF7B0FEC4657499445EF276E3C2DC06579E1613E9E362E396BD559220C798E5CA16274FC07D6C002CE547CD14D27D557230412064EB12FC","orcidId":"0000-0003-4975-4025","documentHash":"c0c569e3-2013-4113-a9ef-2d5494703d4b"}],"doi":"10.3390/chemosensors10010031"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Glass-ceramics","Mechanical

designed glass-ceramic from the ZABS (ZnO-Al2O3-B2O3-SiO2) glass-forming system were used for the experiment. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of copper oxide on the structural and mechanical properties of a glass-ceramic, with willemite as the main crystalline phase. Generally, transition metal (TM) oxides significantly affect the crystallisation characteristics, subsequently influencing the thermal behaviour of the glass-ceramics. Both samples were tested to determine the type of structural changes that occur after the introduction of the modifier – copper oxide. The type of deformations occurring during scratch-test, were also checked in terms of plastic flow, structural densification and mechanical properties (Young's modulus and hardness)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185711","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62039f0a2467f03b337f7c5e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"582","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"779d342f-724b-42dc-b59c-3f8c3a4f5864"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"582","pagesFromTo":"121443","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022309322000527?via%3Dihub#!","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"60c2fd719543c7233654362c","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Węgrzyk","uuid":"ABAEFFD2B7C7E6247012B773D63407EFF34E383061712BF8F8740A991920CD70409BFEC6B691CE4CED75FD0A1E857F343F0A1B7CE964AF3D72C2479AC2BD1675","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3dcd1f2d-302e-484a-9fda-11dce7e90c32"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a847","name":"Daniela","lastName":"Herman","uuid":"FAE9319574BFB9A242535E1967308C2BC34FB84C6D70C653FAC73F7EA129DA4CB5A88E87638C4590A26618DC51C4061095BBC0C87FF7A624CF02FA22DA3CD84C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0686-2192","documentHash":"261543f9-1009-44d1-9b39-13a3f53d1a12"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a83c","name":"Mieczysław","lastName":"Pancielejko","uuid":"6857E719FC99F44FC3D2745A5BEDFF84CFE1796B24B861FBEB3B4CD4699EC3C553840D7F1FB092FAAEE9CB7B924A3A7DFB8654EF67D4AB62C026275D54ACD6DE","orcidId":"0000-0001-9243-1569","documentHash":"f3e01472-d348-4324-aad4-d6df1f4562de"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jnoncrysol.2022.121443"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"61f3f49b2467f061bc137db6","doi":null,"title":"Spektrum autyzmu - od diagnozy i terapii do integracji i inkluzji","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-62182-99-2","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://www.continuo.wroclaw.pl/home?func=productPage&wid=40&pid=417&cid=1&prid=","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"3e022b81-5a32-4303-b3b4-039411bc10a6","publisher":{"objectId":"5d78c016878c284eaa45d3e2","mniswId":"67100","name":"Wydawnictwo Continuo","documentHash":"4effbd0a-f1c4-4267-8b84-1fe59b6d2da9"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e195","uid":"bcVUjrBShspWcmLChW8ImtA","uuid":"8217df41-5961-4812-8b6a-5e5efc77fa48","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dc84","parentUuid":"1cdeb0b0-d2cb-4790-b753-32804af5202f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dc84","rootUuid":"1cdeb0b0-d2cb-4790-b753-32804af5202f","name":"Wydział Kompozycji, Teorii Muzyki, Dyrygentury, Rytmiki i Edukacji Muzycznej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70920f878c28a04738f4d8","5e709295878c28a04739875d"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","uid":"b8_88IdVhNl7JcW-ZebuD4Q","uuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","parentUuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de52","rootUuid":"2072dfce-faec-4917-bcb2-9421f61fe387","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Łodzi","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70920f878c28a04738f4d8","5e7092db878c28a04739e4de","5e709295878c28a04739875d"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de42","uid":"b6wbLGqd2-hodtaiYCyr6xA","uuid":"e45fc816-fbf4-4e46-adfa-89c07c084f45","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de42","parentUuid":"e45fc816-fbf4-4e46-adfa-89c07c084f45","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de42","rootUuid":"e45fc816-fbf4-4e46-adfa-89c07c084f45","name":"Akademia Pedagogiki Specjalnej im.

This traditional method, however, only provides information about recently consumed food, and is burdened with a risk of incorrect assessment of the role of individual diet components due to the different rates of digestion. A method free from such limitations is the analysis of fatty acids. The objective of our study was to recognise the potential of fatty acid signatures in providing information on the diet and feeding habits of six fish species from the shallow brackish Vistula Lagoon, southern Baltic Sea (Anguilla anguilla, Abramis brama, Rutilus rutilus, Pelecus cultratus, Perca fluviatilis, Sander lucioperca). Multivariate statistical analyses of fatty acid signatures permitted relevant grouping of the fish according to species and their diet, as well as evidenced substantial ontogenetic changes in perch, roach, and bream. They might be caused by dietary changes but can also result from internal regulatory processes. The obtained results confirmed that fatty acids provide useful, time-integrated dietary information, contributing to expanding knowledge regarding the feeding ecology of fish in shallow coastal water ecosystems. They also pointed to the necessity of assessment of the invertebrates and fish's ability to perform endogenous synthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly in research on benthic communities. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to investigate the feeding habits of fish and food-web relationships in the coastal waters of the Baltic Sea using fatty acids."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185729","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b9851540970710ec7178aa","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"92d0b906-473a-4725-bb72-45439288ef93"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"64","pagesFromTo":"567-582","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0078323422000513?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709482878c28a0473beb69","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Góra","uuid":"1FC7A9E2FA64E7126A616316B9A2A4151FD8AD7DA2EE4E85D3F71DC6C30901A4B48A9216EDE312D559C4DA0252286CD644270C6929F707C1F87558A7BEA4CCE8","orcidId":"0000-0003-0742-4810","documentHash":"959e126d-f731-46dc-8fab-2895782d0b39"},{"objectId":"5e70932f878c28a0473a490b","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Kornijów","uuid":"4ED54423D14D732021EDC222CC02E06379D5A4511E5F4510E5F06AD8B87BD4519D46BCE2C7DAACF8970A3504F4982518EA1AA040824FABB2B0AAB023B6C4DAB2","orcidId":"0000-0001-8110-1310","documentHash":"1e64ffb0-57d7-4af1-8096-402db763f62a"},{"objectId":"5e70932e878c28a0473a4752","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Szlinder-Richert","uuid":"CE8F83CB9EA8D313065B4FC5382A1CE2EBA7E12008ADC65FCBB035DEEF4520D3B22ED5615B1B8807B2DF5C5D7228DD12F30D9CC58AD95793F1E6C9F8E94446B1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8533-3936","documentHash":"29d47fe8-03c2-4ca2-876a-a3ac2aec63d3"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.oceano.2022.04.002"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","uid":"b-COLbcdAG-k5w4OvZzdVBg","uuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","parentUuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","rootUuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","name":"Narodowy Instytut Onkologii im.

The simulation production yields for 124I and the polluting radioisotopes were  calculated for the natural and enriched 124TeO2  +  Al2O3  solid targets irradiated with 14.8 MeV protons. The proton beam was degraded energetically from 18 MeV with 0.2 mm Havar foil. The 124Te(p,xn)124I reactions were taken into account in the simulations. The optimal thickness of the target material was calculated using the SRIM/TRIM and Geant4 codes. The results of the simulations were compared with the experimental data obtained for the natural TeO2 +Al2O3 target. The dry distillation technique of the 124-iodine was applied.\r\nConclusions: \r\n\r\nThe experimental efficiency for the natural Te target was better than 41% with an average thick target (>0.8 mm) yield of 1.32 MBq/μAh. Joining the Monte Carlo and experimental approaches makes it possible to optimize the methodology for the 124I production from the expensive Te enriched targets."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185730","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"9","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ejnmmiphys.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40658-022-00471-1","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65b0ef9e40970719778e8b73","name":"Andrea","lastName":"d’Amico","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"02e4e62b-8842-4cbb-864f-c231fde748cf"},{"objectId":"65b0ef9e40970719778e8b72","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Szydło","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bd95abce-6c88-461f-a1d5-c9b832a91935"},{"objectId":"65b0ef9e40970719778e8b6f","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Daszewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c6cb8381-304a-4ca5-b876-c01e556cc66b"},{"objectId":"65b0ef9e40970719778e8b6d","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Gorczewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6014da92-a68b-496c-ac64-d446dbacedec"},{"objectId":"65b0ef9e40970719778e8b6c","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Bzowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4692e0f1-727f-4f5c-bd93-6802adfb34cc"},{"objectId":"656e993840e3ff4ef3fe4e3b","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Chmura","uuid":"28778077B442709AAC59C146423D8C648FAC2E75E73B036CEBC3E43A7DA6885C276492A690CCCC22AA5F130DCD96E9116E887D9957C3E22A2C075C554FB492FE","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5e859644-1a17-47a6-a3b8-67a7d7ae260b"},{"objectId":"60c351309543c723365444df","name":"Anna

paper presents an analysis of research results for silica aerogel cement composites over the past twenty years. Recently, two trends in the development of these composites have been noted, towards structural applications and towards ultralight composites for coatings and renders. Ongoing research shows that important aspects of cementitious composites with good mechanical performance are the proper selection of aggregates and improved adhesion at the silica aerogel–cement binder interface, which will guarantee high compressive strength with the lowest possible thermal conductivity. The best physicomechanical performance of aerogel cement composites with low thermal conductivity below 0.03 W/(m·K) was obtained when cenospheres and aerogel were used in a weight percentage of 5%. In turn, the prerequisites for using aerogel cement composites as coatings for energy-efficient building façades are the use of large amounts of silica aerogel as a substitute for lightweight aggregates or the selection of an optimal composition of lightweight aggregates and aerogel, ensuring the lowest possible thermal conductivity coefficient. Other important standpoints are water transport and moisture protection of the silica aerogel-based coatings. Therefore, in recent years, more and more elements of the hygrothermal performance, porosity and durability of silica aerogel cement composites have been developed. The article also points out the weaknesses of the application of silica aerogel in the cement matrix, the most important of which are the lack of adhesion at the boundary of the aerogel–cement binder, the increased porosity of the composite, the high water absorption capacity and the significant decrease in compressive strength with large volumes of silica aerogel. Solving these issues will certainly contribute to the wider applicability of these materials in the construction industry."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185734","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62440f3c2467f070c45d184b","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"7","doi":null,"documentHash":"05988447-9b03-45dc-933e-80a719632c70"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1456-1 -

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of storage temperature (− 10, 5, 10, 18, 20 °C), postharvest treatment method (natural (N), washed (W)) and type of packaging material (GrainPro (G), jute (J) bags) on the content of chlorogenic acids (CQAs), caffeine and trigonelline as well as the sensory profile of RC from the specialty sector after 12 months of regulated storage. Sensory analysis showed that natural coffees have better taste and higher quality than washed coffees after 12 months of storage. The highest total scores were obtained from the natural coffee stored in a GrainPro bag at − 10 °C followed by coffee stored in a jute bag at 10 °C which had the smallest decreases compared to the initial recorded values. No notable differences among CQA contents in washed coffees stored in either type of bag was seen but natural coffees stored in jute bags at 10 °C and 18 °C displayed the lowest drops relative to the initial values."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185740","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6204e9a22467f04219d00aa3","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"6f277079-92a2-4906-a3fd-56acdd571480"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"620f8a9a2467f0419c5a67ea","name":"Artur","lastName":"Porada","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9ee6ba98-d503-49f2-b170-e34d5c26e5f6"},{"objectId":"620f8a9a2467f0419c5a67e7","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Matejuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"df2c1570-8480-474f-aa07-5f64c02cb43f"},{"objectId":"620f8a9a2467f0419c5a67e6","name":"Renata","lastName":"Kulesza","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"967c6e07-64c2-468e-ba84-a8da5683ff6f"},{"objectId":"620f8a992467f0419c5a67e5","name":"Anna","lastName":"Jaszkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1ea8bd1f-4228-4155-b08a-5938dead7506"},{"objectId":"620f8a992467f0419c5a67e4","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Barabosz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c16b1f94-11ec-429d-b4d6-9eedea082d57"},{"objectId":"620f8a992467f0419c5a67e3","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Stanek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2b918f58-867d-40ec-8aa3-e9a7296245ff"},{"objectId":"620f8a992467f0419c5a67e2","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Zarebska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f6f11171-8538-4abf-9b4a-ae92621587e8"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff4c","name":"ŁUKASZ","lastName":"BIŁOS","uuid":"250ECFA8A911872531BBE7B595C3E3DFD77936322BFD680CCD8E2748C841DF3313D5B2ACC89005A9927CECC874AC5C2B5839CEAF6F98EAE791C2860A3AF6499F","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"73e86e4f-eb55-4da4-b07a-660573e6bbf7"},{"objectId":"5e7093b2878c28a0473af5f4","name":"DARIUSZ","lastName":"ANDRZEJEWSKI","uuid":"1BAFF703960C2BCFF5BED937456E9E163107CDB0E6376FF1B9E7D648E7A0BCF8B3C38C0D8C9D7431C3557A64748916884E0FFD6D36FC92613B87B4691A55EA92","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"93135a2d-72ac-4193-aca2-4397f0b61725"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-022-06676-9"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6267b09140970720eb517e6c","doi":null,"title":"Pomoc społeczna.

rotating biological contactor (RBC) is resistant to toxic chemical and shock loadings, and this results in significant organic and nutrient removal efficiencies. The RBC system offers a low-energy footprint and saves up to 90% in energy costs. Due to the system’s low-energy demand, it is easily operable with renewable energy sources, either solar or wind power. An RBC was employed to degrade pollutants in domestic wastewater through biodegradation mechanisms in this study. The high microbial population in the RBC bioreactor produced excellent biological treatment capacity and higher effluent quality. The results showed that the RBC bioreactor achieved an average removal efficiency of 73.9% of chemical oxygen demand (COD), 38.3% of total nitrogen (TN), 95.6% of ammonium, and 78.9% of turbidity. Investigation of operational parameters, disk rotational speed, HRT, and SRT, showed the biological performance impact. Disk rotational speed showed uniform effluent quality at 30–40 rpm, while higher values of disk rotational speed (>40 rpm) resulted in lower effluent quality in COD, TN, and turbidity. The longer hydraulic retention time and sludge retention time (SRT) facilitated higher biological performance efficiency. The longer SRTs enabled the higher TN removal efficiency because of the higher quantity of microbial biomass retention. The longer SRT also resulted in efficient sludge-settling properties and reduced volume of sludge production. The energy evaluation of the RBC bioreactor showed that it consumed only 0.14 kWh/m3, which is significantly lower than the conventional treatment methods; therefore, it is easily operable with renewable energy sources. The RBC is promising substitute for traditional suspended growth processes as higher microbial activity, lower operational and maintenance costs, and lower carbon foot print enhanced the biological performance, which aligns with the stipulations of ecological evolution and environment-friendly treatment."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185760","journalIssue":{"objectId":"627ce1574097075f6793a660","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"15","number":"10","doi":null,"documentHash":"0cd845d7-5bef-4b96-9932-45a546ab0729"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"3523-1 - 3523-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/en15103523","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6304c49d4097076f71da91b1","name":"Sharjeel","lastName":"Waqas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cb112ec1-be20-40a0-8144-566871f60949"},{"objectId":"6304c49d4097076f71da91af","name":"Javed Akbar","lastName":"Khan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ae44d56d-c167-4ab5-9977-99f2f2b217d7"},{"objectId":"6304c49d4097076f71da91ae","name":"Saifur","lastName":"Rahman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8cdc2fb1-846a-476c-89e6-882b13951d2e"},{"objectId":"6304c49d4097076f71da91ad","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Irfan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8d530171-6171-4efa-b224-7113f3a30a34"},{"objectId":"5e7093a5878c28a0473ae6fa","name":"Dobrochna","lastName":"Ginter-Kramarczyk","uuid":"91EA3EA9678A6B925AD9C9CD139D2A19C94FE0221F6E0060A7F0535E8CE8048FC1244D3A9D72A9440AD90A6E87B708CE1011171FA08D93E670203A3F78B6F1B8","orcidId":"0000-0001-6588-4546","documentHash":"7525aeb7-f25e-45fd-a536-e5f17044bc76"},{"objectId":"5e70934f878c28a0473a6f11","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Włodarczak","uuid":"F17C9D1429CD5C8216E8AC3E1C4037EEE85D0CCE1B83A3817FC579E82513DC38363A364C8011CA4D88C88E7DB58C63A055517CB16DA1A221C49AA33E814957E5","orcidId":"0000-0003-0561-0177","documentHash":"3dc7bace-1e11-4bf0-9390-899ab38a82f6"},{"objectId":"5e70934d878c28a0473a6dc7","name":"Marek","lastName":"Ochowiak","uuid":"7F2DB91F2F7D116420A7F7FD0D9D24BB55A35CC2FDC7C996D1AF9D10234E7DB4B93F17A9332D991459FD7E2AFFDAB64098E4229871CBAB9BC9F8D21CB2B86715","orcidId":"0000-0003-1543-9967","documentHash":"32701356-99a7-41e4-872f-5d1ba3f0f3ea"},{"objectId":"5e70925e878c28a047394878","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Kruszelnicka","uuid":"3CFB1E0C8B4D64A2CEAE3EBB85101066E663F4DC4895EC5B424FAB84BAEC352A715F99881983166A9EEAC3B10EC4B52493E169B7B9E2A9221795F46558394221","orcidId":"0000-0003-4400-2553","documentHash":"44c52c12-88a4-4b0b-aa5a-b09a988a88ad"},{"objectId":"5e70925a878c28a0473944a8","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Legutko","uuid":"4CC0A326BF4EE2CDE634AB3E8538A043DFD82BC6891A0D06881F29DEEAB5DEE341030DB4B019D760D541C71732C21157D8CDAB8C96A83C6557DA3A9B7E591BCA","orcidId":"0000-0001-8973-5035","documentHash":"fbcb027e-2400-4e09-82d6-1aa8ce6c6b64"},{"objectId":"5e709243878c28a047392a42","name":"KRYSTIAN","lastName":"CZERNEK","uuid":"5041ABA05BE459B9E73F2009E1900E89E0E9B85D8E58B3C52A7F2BA70D94CEA1DC9BB4D6066DF88AC5C9E3E61FFB4EC11A119E57317AA84619241D2A50C51A66","orcidId":"0000-0002-5799-0071","documentHash":"9262f2f8-9faf-43c4-9195-3c00391608ce"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15103523"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Choroby układu nerwowego obwodowego","Zespół cieśni kanału nerwu łokciowego","Zespół cieśni nadgarstka","Zapalenie pochewki ścięgna"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee3","uid":"bnX0HoKbxpGTrsHNBITsQWQ","uuid":"bdc6f547-9a9a-42e0-baaa-e9556955346a","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee3","parentUuid":"bdc6f547-9a9a-42e0-baaa-e9556955346a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee3","rootUuid":"bdc6f547-9a9a-42e0-baaa-e9556955346a","name":"Instytut Medycyny Pracy im. prof. dr. med.

Sposób wykonywania pracy, który predysponuje do ich rozwoju, cechuje się monotypią, tj. powtarzalnością ruchów przez istotną część zmiany roboczej. W pracy opisano 4 przypadki odwoławczego postępowania diagnostyczno-orzeczniczego kobiet z chorobami układu ruchu i obwodowego układu nerwowego, u których wykazano związek przyczynowo-skutkowy pomiędzy rozwojem schorzeń a sposobem wykonywania pracy.

Trudności orzecznicze w ocenie możliwości wystąpienia procesu chorobowego w związku z ekspozycją zawodową powoduje częste współistnienie czynników pozazawodowych predysponujących do powstania choroby wymienionej w wykazie chorób zawodowych, które powinny podlegać szczegółowej ocenie w  toku postepowania prowadzonego w  związku z  podejrzeniem choroby zawodowej.

Often, this has been caused by the dangerous situations caused by spectacular collective suicides, killing those who dare criticise them or the acts of terrorism force one to reflect upon the essence of their activities as well as upon the dangers related to them. What are the characteristic features of these groups and how are they organised also proved to be important. A major place among them is occupied by apocalyptic sects, focusing their attention in a special way on issues connected with the end of the world, in which they are often supposed to play an important role. Among them, one can distinguish following groups: 1) referring to Christianity; 2) drawing inspiration from Far Eastern religions; 3) inspired by the belief in UFO; and 4) related to the New Age. Despite their doctrinal diversity, there are some similarities in their management. Understanding the governance mechanisms of these organisations, forms of leadership as well as disturbing doctrinal features, can help to identify the dangers associated with their activities."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185795","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"169-177","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://bg.pcz.pl/apisnb/book/67221/The-Elements-of-Management-in-Destructive-Apocalyptic-Groups-on-Selected-Examples","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709203878c28a04738e963","name":"Robert","lastName":"Janik","uuid":"CC4E6E4F43C20A8CA159B713BAB2E203D8193C2854DAF599F06D6A0245F055365C6F31194519636F95B5083D93E6C5466E2357E7A2DF4F459D3F7E7E30270C86","orcidId":"0000-0002-1884-6974","documentHash":"0449a671-b677-4ac1-83b2-0dcfbcb3cab7"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["badlands","rock fragment cover","soil erosion","soil organic matter","stone bunds"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918e878c28a04737e44c","uid":"bOsTJEvmlvq1TPV2NgBPXuw","uuid":"75fdfd10-8c3b-4407-8102-72c611142d0e","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Nauk o Ziemi i Gospodarki Przestrzennej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ebed7eb752340254fc40d73"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Event‐based run‐off and sediment yield dynamics and controls in the subhumid headwaters of the Blue Nile, Ethiopia","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478c79","mniswId":"13433","title":"LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT","doi":null,"issn":"1085-3278","eissn":"1099-145X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b478c5ac-32c9-442c-b503-c986d41e9fb4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620cd9002467f01217add34f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["620cd9002467f01217add351","620cd9002467f01217add352","5ebed7eb752340254fc40d73","620cd9002467f01217add354","620cd9002467f01217add355","620cd9002467f01217add356","620cd9002467f01217add357","620cd9002467f01217add358","620cd9002467f01217add359"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Land degradation due to soil erosion presents a major challenge for sustainable development. We investigated run-off and sediment yield (SY) dynamics in the north-western highlands of Ethiopia. The study area included 14 zero-order catchments\nwith a surface area ranging from 324 to 1715 m2. V-notch weirs produced from plastic jars were introduced as measuring alternatives that met local constraints. Run-off (RO) depth at the weir was registered manually at 5-min intervals during two rainy seasons in 2018 and 2019, and a total of 618 events were monitored. Rainfall was measured using tipping-bucket rain gauges. RO samples were collected in 1-L bottles, and suspended sediment concentration was determined. The mean event O coefficient ranged from 3% for forests to 56% for badlands. Similarly, the mean annual SY was lowest for forests (0.8 Mg ha-1 yr-1 ) and highest for badlands (43.4 Mg ha-1 yr-1 ), with significant differences among land-use types (14.8 Mg ha-1 yr-1 in cropland, 5.7 Mg ha-1 yr-1 in grazing land, and 2.9 Mg ha-1 yr-1 in plantations). Soil organic matter (SOM) reduced RO and SY, necessitating the consideration of agronomic and land management practices that enhance SOM.  Annual SY decreased exponentially with the rock fragment cover (RFC). In fields where RFC was less than 20%, collecting rock fragments for installing stone bunds resulted in a net increase in SY. Rehabilitating badlands and enhancing SOM content in croplands can substantially reduce catchment SY and hence contribute to the sustainability of land uses\nin the subhumid highlands."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185806","journalIssue":{"objectId":"620cd9002467f01217add35b","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"811f4044-0a98-4599-b89a-38f619d6c916"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"33","pagesFromTo":"565-580","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ldr.4144","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"620cd9002467f01217add359","name":"Amaury","lastName":"Frankl","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1685-2780","documentHash":"6f9d4dd2-6a14-4c09-8837-37d4227756b2"},{"objectId":"620cd9002467f01217add358","name":"Deribew","lastName":"Fentie","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e160fc8a-6b64-4644-aac4-94f679df4371"},{"objectId":"620cd9002467f01217add357","name":"Enyew","lastName":"Adgo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"27a1ecf7-d48e-43c6-8342-71d8cf023ce4"},{"objectId":"620cd9002467f01217add356","name":"Alemayehu","lastName":"Wassie","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ba98b587-6f03-49d4-a970-0912659bda60"},{"objectId":"620cd9002467f01217add355","name":"Derege Tsegaye","lastName":"Meshesha","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6465-0772","documentHash":"97a94406-985e-4461-8ce7-6fd1f27f536d"},{"objectId":"620cd9002467f01217add354","name":"Hanibal","lastName":"Lemma","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"01b44283-2c18-4a0a-b4b2-c374e93bd613"},{"objectId":"620cd9002467f01217add352","name":"Jan","lastName":"Nyssen","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2666-3860","documentHash":"d0201010-727e-4889-8a36-e16a68c73fbf"},{"objectId":"620cd9002467f01217add351","name":"Habtamu","lastName":"Assaye","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2252-8984","documentHash":"65465691-bf16-4c28-9954-889e66e1b9f7"},{"objectId":"5ebed7eb752340254fc40d73","name":"Jean","lastName":"Poesen","uuid":"D29B7A1EFC0A991B826FDD2646418935A73E1BDE11906E166850F8F3F1F4FC63467F00EC2A583721567180FC2DADCB5AAE2BA63502DB51AB5D6C1BDABD6657B9","orcidId":"0000-0001-6218-8967","documentHash":"f4ff93c0-be91-4abb-9708-a2e3a90838ff"}],"doi":"10.1002/ldr.4144"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Value management","logistics network","operational controlling","profitability","process cost analysis","cargo flow"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de0a","uid":"baUDwEr8mzwEHkagRyl8Vhg","uuid":"8395c169-9930-4090-acb2-320b9203f249","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de0a","parentUuid":"8395c169-9930-4090-acb2-320b9203f249","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de0a","rootUuid":"8395c169-9930-4090-acb2-320b9203f249","name":"Uniwersytet WSB Merito we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ff878c28a0473a0b65"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Model of Value-Based Management in a Multi-Hub Large-Scale Logistics Network","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dc39","mniswId":"22361","title":"European Research Studies Journal","doi":null,"issn":"1108-2976","eissn":"1108-2976","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"ee72860c-86eb-4a56-a31b-70fc70a07123"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6304904240970739a7629130","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6304904240970739a7629131","5e7092ff878c28a0473a0b65"]},"issue":"Issue 2B","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose: The dynamic growth of multi-channel sales (including e-commerce) causes a mass flow of cargo in supply networks and large-scale transport and logistics processes in complex multi-hub structures of logistics networks in Europe. One of the key objectives of the effective management of processes and cargo flows in complex structures of logistics networks is an increase in profitability of customer and shipment delivery. Design/Methodology/Approach: In the presented value-based management (VBM) model, multi-factor price lists for logistics services and taxation weight of shipment are the basis for revenue modelling by logistic operators, as well as their multi-criteria conditions for qualifying rates and add-on factors. On the other hand, transport and logistics processes implemented in supply chains and multi-hub network, create a complex cost environment. Findings: Dynamically and segmentally planned process loads in logistics networks according to the changing needs of customers, create complex and variable structures of direct and indirect costs of logistics operators. The allocation of costs in multi-hub logistics networks is determined by dynamic changes in the flow of cargo, through the settlement keys of resources costs used in the processes of the logistics network. Customer service quality indicators established by logistics operators are mapped to operational norms in the final settlement model. The key factor in using the value-based management model by enterprises is achieving the required operational and price competitiveness on the market of transport and logistics services with the assumed profitability of customers and services. Originality/Value: The results of the presented model analysis of the profitability of customers as well as the efficiency of processes in the logistics network influence managerial decisions shaping the appraisal of shipment contracts with customers. The VBM model presented in the article was used to verify the real costs and profitability of corporate customers in large scale multi-hub logistics network, taking into account analysis of the share and allocation of shipment flows, transport options in supply chains, as well as process routes and resource consumption."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185808","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62eb61004097071dc179675a","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"XXV","number":"Issue 2B","doi":null,"documentHash":"7f049ffc-35ef-4dc7-8be2-1dc63e7c37a2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"XXV","pagesFromTo":"369-384","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.35808/ersj/2974","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6304904240970739a7629131","name":"Boguslaw","lastName":"Sliwczynski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"65b91216-be5f-4b07-9641-af0375cce86d"},{"objectId":"5e7092ff878c28a0473a0b65","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Smal","uuid":"189C39ED97D228FAAB66DB9EC134AA839A9393ECA00EA75F027F5381CFD1D75A589A3A2C51EC41D037FFAEBFF0A0F1C3C0A32DDA1C0AE6827C5B7F4B86417F5F","orcidId":"0000-0002-3237-5494","documentHash":"68de0c0b-822c-4554-9ff0-ab56dc49ed99"}],"doi":"10.35808/ersj/2974"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a63d1","5e709347878c28a0473a6443","5e709344878c28a0473a61f9","5e7093b9878c28a0473afc1a","5e7094c0878c28a0473c316c","5e709409878c28a0473b5378","5e709347878c28a0473a641f","5e709346878c28a0473a62b0","5e7092cd878c28a04739d0ec"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Effect of weight and storage time of broiler breeders’ eggs on morphology and biochemical features of eggs, embryogenesis, hatchability, and chick quality","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547702a","mniswId":"1135","title":"Animal.","doi":null,"issn":"1751-7311","eissn":"1751-732X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"75e7d827-d0e7-4aaa-99e6-ce35edc7b49b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-20","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62b9773d40970710ec708149","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709347878c28a0473a63d1","62b9773d40970710ec70814b","5e709347878c28a0473a641f","5e709347878c28a0473a6443","5e709344878c28a0473a61f9","5e7093b9878c28a0473afc1a","5e709346878c28a0473a62b0","62b9773d40970710ec708151","62b9773d40970710ec708152","62b9773d40970710ec708153","5e709409878c28a0473b5378","62b9773d40970710ec708155","62b9773d40970710ec708156","5e7094c0878c28a0473c316c","5e7092cd878c28a04739d0ec"]},"issue":"7","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The transfer of hatchability results obtained under experimental conditions to the commercial ground with a positive financial effect proves the value and usefulness of these data. On the other hand, finding results on commercial processes of broiler breeders’ egg incubation in the literature is challenging. The presented study aimed to determine the effects of egg weight and storage time on the physical, biochemical characteristics of hatching eggs, embryogenesis and hatchability in Ross 308 broiler breeders. On the laying day, the eggs were divided into four weight groups: S – small eggs (57–61 g), M – medium eggs (62–66 g), L – large eggs (67–71 g), and XL – extra-large eggs (72–76 g). The eggs were then stored for 3, 7, 14, and 21 days under controlled conditions. As the egg storage time increased, a decrease in the yolk quality (lower index) was observed. The highest Haugh units were found in eggs from the S and M groups. The cholesterol content of the M, L, and XL groups was lower on days 7, 14, and 21 as compared to that of eggs only stored for 3 days. Egg weight loss during incubation decreased with an increase in the egg weight. An extension of the egg storage time caused an increase in the loss of egg weight. On the 14th and 18th days of hatching, an increase in the eggshell temperature was noted with an increase in the weight of the egg. The eggs stored for 7 days were characterised by the highest shell temperature on each day. The highest hatchability percentage was recorded for the M group. The hatchability rate decreased with the prolongation of the storage time, while the number of crippled chicks after hatching increased. The results confirmed that the increased weight of the eggs and prolonged storage time (14 and 21 days) increased the weight and decreased the length of the newly hatched chicks, respectively. Chicks from the heaviest eggs and those stored for 14 and 21 days showed poor results on the Pasgar score® test. The observations indicate the need to adopt various (of those available) methods to assess the quality of newly hatched chicks in hatcheries in order to produce high-quality broiler chickens. The results also indicate that prolonged egg storing beyond 14 days may affect the thyroid hormone economy during the hatching of chicks, especially in the XL group."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185810","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b9773d40970710ec70815a","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"16","number":"7","doi":null,"documentHash":"57a1d949-6705-4d78-9e31-7c42d72c5628"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"100564","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S175173112200115X?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62b9773d40970710ec708156","name":"A.","lastName":"Ciszewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e66d9abe-371a-467e-9e9d-41fb5ee48602"},{"objectId":"62b9773d40970710ec708155","name":"Ł.","lastName":"Jarosz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cacdf92b-2663-4428-b010-aefbc72675fd"},{"objectId":"62b9773d40970710ec708153","name":"M.","lastName":"Kwaśniewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4a22aeae-efba-4e28-a3cc-901f81dad5c2"},{"objectId":"62b9773d40970710ec708152","name":"M.W.","lastName":"Lis","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8609-572X","documentHash":"d04ee9d1-a725-4898-b6d3-049bdd779242"},{"objectId":"62b9773d40970710ec708151","name":"A.","lastName":"Sechman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6005bc0c-221c-4dc3-b76a-afba93dafc5a"},{"objectId":"62b9773d40970710ec70814b","name":"M.","lastName":"Babuszkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d7a80c0b-b27e-4fe4-9a6c-889aaec8a34f"},{"objectId":"5e7094c0878c28a0473c316c","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"858312226ECE716D8609BE25EFFD3666F435CF525E2979A5A3AA645C9ED034D771ACCA17A1FB93CC3BEAE3E35EFC9407B44BF7648E9B525F14344E04F04AE39A","orcidId":"0000-0002-1820-5202","documentHash":"e45e039a-cb16-45aa-a4d4-7246c3bed109"},{"objectId":"5e709409878c28a0473b5378","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Racewicz","uuid":"EBFAF4609BD118CC9FFB93A30CA08933A657D5D7529A978A5694018F216CF49B406412AA0ACCFE9E89CE2F9A43D8A32B8D4FF971C9831A3C467110238AD824D7","orcidId":"0000-0002-2572-0202","documentHash":"3577e89e-826d-420a-bc44-343579221438"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afc1a","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Tomczyk","uuid":"CEDCB252BFDEE258FF2205EA0E43C77AC9D83A25FBCA2DE1CB59A1D170F5EA74E6CC17168BEE8807861F02A1C05B443D15543D08424DE992156EEADDBFE2F8EB","orcidId":"0000-0002-4644-0111","documentHash":"92c17a10-41ce-4243-9769-e83fc5606dce"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6443","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Stuper-Szablewska","uuid":"89458AD33E90F7D5DA9FFF004F3ED6F9D46DD48F28D476632DF610494D078B410E9A695A0F8B865E8D5320F2B388403A8BCDD94A880E282F730324D9B26CDFC3","orcidId":"0000-0002-9011-8592","documentHash":"4c7eab1d-0090-4e50-a0ef-5e15d76ef13b"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a641f","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Szablewski","uuid":"DABDF95B3C9D44CA2EADC955C209C3C39E0D7B187A17449B14D35C834F55F271626F03A960C73EF6E094EF9EE160B878AE77D97777EE7DCB14F4CE0D22E80C5F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6076-8095","documentHash":"265568ef-0520-45d1-8ee8-29d19822d918"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a63d1","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Nowaczewski","uuid":"270CD23E05516FCD25C9F9BC2EA37D27D4B86C0EBA8D644766896F34174A6CB6112C09CD36BE5FF577F869E9CB2CB167116A6A9505571479624BA59F3BE14E62","orcidId":"0000-0002-9204-5534","documentHash":"d01bdb09-721f-4f32-81b4-f65d8c2f9d18"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62b0","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Kaczmarek","uuid":"925D8AF9FAF348A9B88668FE9B4E4C8F53C5AFDF941BAABFB9D4C2EA3CC33C2899685C56A5484021702B6895E41CDB150F86B7743F84848523C78DB3F5A18BDE","orcidId":"0000-0003-3638-4192","documentHash":"c6ab529a-05c8-4254-9151-d42d261e65e8"},{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a61f9","name":"Renata","lastName":"Cegielska-Radziejewska","uuid":"117859058E31AB8D52FCF638636E8150FB78BBD13C6BEE320F8B45FB54D0AD64D01DAE917D41ABD7E7E70F3CB03D882B314AFB7A2B8E12F46C6DA7DDC124AE51","orcidId":"0000-0002-3554-5276","documentHash":"8a4b55dd-929f-402f-9bc5-2461eb2fbb7b"},{"objectId":"5e7092cd878c28a04739d0ec","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Hejdysz","uuid":"D28768DF44C85E7C35AAFB48CF40D239E6E0252AD1495CCC2D4B97D5057E3D263ABB745AF8137CC0FEF1496B7FD17B795543F983865DA68C0016066B690D9BD6","orcidId":"0000-0003-1772-7997","documentHash":"dca77911-f07c-4a5a-812b-aaf4948f3eef"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.animal.2022.100564"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb5","uid":"bFdp5gORDGmB2AOTB2xubqg","uuid":"8f22901b-d306-4fb5-9de1-af0923a7dbc8","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb5","parentUuid":"8f22901b-d306-4fb5-9de1-af0923a7dbc8","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb5","rootUuid":"8f22901b-d306-4fb5-9de1-af0923a7dbc8","name":"Instytut Metalurgii i Inżynierii Materiałowej im.

The present experiment is focused on the effect of the modification of its composition by rising the content of the cenospheres (max. 2.5 wt.%) or by introducing up to 1.5 wt.% of polymer Belmix™ fibers (~34 μm diameter/12 mm length) on the microstructure and mechanical properties. The maximum amount of introduced additions was limited by the accompanying loss of mass viscosity, which must allow for deposition through immersion. Next, the differential scanning calorimetry and differential thermogravimetric analysis techniques were employed to evaluate the extent of the weight change and heat response of the mass during the drying and annealing stages. The dried materials’ microstructure was investigated with light and scanning electron microscopy, while the chemical composition was studied by energy dispersive spectroscopy. Finally, a three-point flexural bending method was used to determine changes in the material mechanical properties. The performed experiments proved that the small addition (~1 wt.%) of polymer fibers is sufficient for the significant improvement of the Thermacoat™ green mechanical strength at ambient temperature, presenting a reproducible ultimate flexural strength of ~0.2 MPa."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185816","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6304c84340970739a763badd","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"5","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"3ad323af-854e-47df-a688-72b748413462"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"5","pagesFromTo":"173-181","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2571-6131/5/2/15/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6304c84340970739a763bade","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Prochwicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"32d36161-f07e-49e6-a56f-94131a9fcc77"},{"objectId":"5e709440878c28a0473b8e7e","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Czaja","uuid":"5F12E2D264072B64A77968C65839818F301F79FB66FA5EA416B87C0833D662A88C24D935C3C63B3DA7F30113F36D1005BECBAAEBB8358F71027751C33C00C0DB","orcidId":"0000-0001-5011-9323","documentHash":"3c1d39a6-485f-46ff-af7c-7f2a4bf2b45a"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af0f8","name":"Anna","lastName":"Góral","uuid":"739D14B53839140BF4FAA72C138780472B0F9273A64ABC3BC9B6ECF0DFF15A3A02879BEF666E6CB61E50CA2F0EE32C91875EF942B6697C8691CFDD7DF4CF13FD","orcidId":"0000-0001-7823-0496","documentHash":"a9ed6836-d8fe-4ebf-b090-ff4d51ca35e5"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af0f5","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Morgiel","uuid":"942B866E4FFBF64BB71F71B416D858043C11FEEA6B845A43D9928C9AC1049FA95EBA59806071977C19D8CC0CE07D29212DEF2FCB52D24A5F23C42D7823FB201F","orcidId":"0000-0003-1807-0149","documentHash":"8773308a-1464-4ccf-b3d4-fc926d04b1fc"},{"objectId":"5e7093ad878c28a0473aeef7","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Czeppe","uuid":"9FEE4112CC649E2E94D2F159C29F247B72D16C571E0D77B8DF6D5DD9B3197AF032B9B5AAC75CC1CE063CB3ADB19F706C363D94FED8C4BAFB538E820149F681C5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8637-4008","documentHash":"e944d7e6-ee28-421f-a44b-dcc001514995"}],"doi":"10.3390/ceramics5020015"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Taliban","Takeover","Afghanistan","Humanitarian","Assistance"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df13","uid":"bKtjZT6qPD3d_ou1lCI-Heg","uuid":"64e6c5a1-1be6-4917-9d49-9dec59ed1713","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Nauk Politycznych i Studiów Międzynarodowych","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602f89559543c7410626f5b7"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Taliban Urges for Joint Mechanism: The Assessment of Vulnerability in Afghanistan","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"62b82d53409707665c835451","mniswId":null,"title":"Academia Letters","doi":null,"issn":"2771-9359","eissn":null,"websiteLink":"https://www.academia.edu/","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"e5572031-e397-4e25-9558-dcdf74bf43c0"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":true,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62b82d52409707665c83544e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602f89559543c7410626f5b7"]},"issue":"5133","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"After the Taliban Takeover Afghanistan and the United States (US) left it, the country is currently facing severe challenges to reinstall social, political and economic systems.

In 691 2- to 9-year-old Setswana-speaking children, the tibiofemoral angle, intermalleolar distance, femoral anteversion angle (AVA) and tibial torsion angle (TTA), were measured to determine LL development. Back-carrying practices were recorded with a questionnaire and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) was used for the analyses. Significant (p < 0.001) relationships, between back-carrying practices and LL development, were discovered. Statistically significant greater genu valgum (F(5, 690) = 7.2, p < 0.001), greater internal TTAs (F(9, 684) = 17.8, p < 0.001), and smaller AVAs (F(13, 685) = 5.1, p < 0.001) were observed in children back-carried more frequently than children back-carried less frequently. There are relationships between back-carrying practices and LL development in both the frontal and transverse plane. However, the genu valgum, internal TTA and smaller AVA noted in more frequently back-carried children is still within normal limits, thus no educational intervention in back-carrying methods or durations is required.

The right to good administration, well-established in EU legal order, is equally real, however, it must be borne in mind that this right has so far been defined only in relation to traditional administration . Therefore, the purpose of the paper is to examine whether the use of AI in public administration would allow individuals to fully exercise their right to good administration. To achieve this purpose, it is reconstructed, on the basis of EU law provisions in force and the case-law of the CJEU, the meaning and scope of the right to good administration, and analysed, taking into account a definition of AI systems and planned legislative changes, whether and to what extent the reconstructed understanding of this right enables the use of AI systems in public administration. In the course of research the hypothesis that the right to good administration does not preclude the use of AI systems in public administration is verified . As the conducted analysis shows, the right to good administration as interpreted in traditional administration enables the use of AI systems in public administration, provided that the appropriate quality of these systems and the level of knowledge and skills of the parties and authorities are ensured."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185850","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6295fd244097072fefba5806","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"49","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"1d962013-4c6c-47a9-8207-ef802bd7b7d8"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"49","pagesFromTo":"203-223","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://czasopisma.kul.pl/index.php/recl/article/download/13616/12394","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709232878c28a047391816","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Wróbel","uuid":"2812995840F7BCDBF5A0993E2F707FF9220F99F9550D4E603B7AD1B868BD051CD68DBFF896B6BA9C2BFBA8CFA0212DEEA61324E4A551575AE14D3D17DC436AE2","orcidId":"0000-0001-7907-646X","documentHash":"c16b34f8-411a-4fb4-b9d2-94f054d003fd"}],"doi":"10.31743/recl.13616"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["copper(I) π-coordination compound","crystal structure","DFT","N-allylthiourea","NLO"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","uid":"bdkLR6wGCrp59lwUjwb_dMA","uuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","parentUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","rootUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","name":"Instytut Fizyki Jądrowej im.

In the crystal structure of both Anor and 1, the organic part is disordered because of the superposition of (2S)-exo and (2R)-exo enantiomers. The Anor ligand in 1 acts as a bridging ligand, connecting Cu(I) ions into the cationic coordination polymer {[Cu(Anor)(CH3CN)]+}n through η2-allyl group and the thiourea S atom. The H atoms of the –NH– groups in the Anor structure participate in Nsingle bondH···S hydrogen bonding and form an infinite hydrogen-bonded layer, while the same ligand groups in the organometallic chain of 1 are linked by bifurcated Nsingle bondH···O bonds to the two O atoms of the same NO3– anion. The second-order nonlinear optical properties for Anor and coordination compound 1 were studied at 1064 nm generated by a nanosecond pulsed Nd:YAG laser.

We consider a diluted polydisperse spray, which evaporates and diffuses from a fuel-rich spray core, mixes with an oxidizer and eventually auto-ignites. The objective of the present study is to assess an influence of evaporation models and mean droplet diameter on the combustion process in a lifted flame, starting from an auto-ignition up to the flame stabilization. Three evaporation models are involved, i.e., (i) “D2 law”, (ii) infinite conductivity model with Stefan flow effect, and (iii) infinite conductivity non-equilibrium evaporation model based on a Langmuir-Knudsen law. An in-house high-order numerical code was used to carry out the computations. The continuous gas phase is modeled in the Eulerian coordinate system while the spray droplets are tracked in space in the Lagrangian manner. The obtained results show that in a stable combustion regime a flame size and liftoff height only slightly depend on evaporation model. However, in general, it is observed that the spray size can affect the flame structure to a much larger extent. On the other hand, for bigger droplets differences in initial size distribution cause only small flame movement downstream or upstream toward the fuel nozzle. For auto-ignition and initial flame development phase it is observed that both the droplets size and evaporation model affect the obtained results significantly."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185856","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.194","pagesFromTo":"brak","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00102202.2019.1678843","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70938f878c28a0473acd2e","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Stempka","uuid":"8385B398B97CCFC7F0506A3562BAE508F75FBA2EAFF26159BF7C0FE2ECA10605E8BB2D5865B0E4DBE646A895DEA6A808D36937C6E313D7A7CD4859B889210375","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8891954b-4ea6-4d05-a071-313508b1f28f"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e784","name":"Artur","lastName":"Tyliszczak","uuid":"6E2749999F4CE02F9A228B63591DE3E59EF0D76C4F18AC05C95F0ADEDDCB9F7E7658BFAC6DB7282C91F101216D98B98A889405A4437FE165D9400F576FA35497","orcidId":"0000-0002-4844-0289","documentHash":"ceb14b61-b4b3-4d83-aee4-7ab0e6ba3afc"}],"doi":"10.1080/00102202.2019.1678843"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["juvenile idiopathic arthritis; ankle arthritis; magnetic resonance imaging; scoring"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737def0","uid":"brcyYgRgvEjIItaX3WfS4aA","uuid":"b7bb6dea-d926-4b36-9e6d-e0ad8061342e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def0","parentUuid":"b7bb6dea-d926-4b36-9e6d-e0ad8061342e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def0","rootUuid":"b7bb6dea-d926-4b36-9e6d-e0ad8061342e","name":"Narodowy Instytut Geriatrii, Reumatologii i Rehabilitacji im. prof. dr hab. med.

MRI findings in both groups—patients with the final\ndiagnosis of JIA and without final diagnosis of JIA—were compared and scored. The sum of the\nscores of 22 ankle lesions in an individual patient (active, destructive and developmental), so-called\nthe MRI summarized score, was calculated and tested in terms of the most optimal diagnosis of JIA.\nInterobserver agreement was calculated. Inflammatory features were seen on MRI in 38 out of all the\nincluded patients (86%). The most common lesions in both groups were effusion in the tibio-talar joint\n(68% in JIA and 64% in the arthralgia group) and effusion in subtalar joint (64% in JIA vs. 59% in the\narthralgia group). In general, more lesions were identified in the JIA group than in non-JIA. However,\nonly tenosynovitis was significantly more common in the JIA vs. non-JIA group (p = 0.031). The MRI\nsummarized score did not allow for discrimination between ankle arthritis in JIA from non-JIA patients;\nthe best levels of sensitivity (32%), specificity (91%), positive predictive value PPV (78%) and negative\npredictive value NPV (57%) were achieved only at the cut-off point of 10."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185857","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61f140e32467f06d26f64c17","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"11","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"c063108d-5cfe-41d3-b775-249c055708ee"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"760-776","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/11/3/760","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"620382f42467f03b337e37da","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Posadzy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9ece159c-8778-4cae-8ef1-d7690a9fc0ce"},{"objectId":"620382f42467f03b337e37d7","name":"Emil","lastName":"Michalski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ca75bb99-f05b-47c4-9744-a9ca1a10b88b"},{"objectId":"602d00529543c7410626e672","name":"MONIKA","lastName":"OSTROWSKA","uuid":"D1CF4C94CA18ADFF3BB5AAAEAE3F4822EE08D539C3BDF90D236CD2D7AD208E780C52ED2B2F599C61BC6B97AC93D30B7C477F4131E5701ECAA3B8ACC74AE25A2A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bc76ef3a-c42c-40d7-8107-746095d66af9"},{"objectId":"5e7094da878c28a0473c5675","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Mańczak","uuid":"1A65B4DE7AA1AD93823DFC472DEF41A4FA6EB0BB04DA7D23417441BF565943520B60FC0E593D12DED586D7434348D79C7217A84A99CFC665D313927C1D06B43A","orcidId":"0000-0002-0736-0389","documentHash":"a380d9df-b052-4978-b629-9c28df4c8860"},{"objectId":"5e7093fd878c28a0473b47a4","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Gietka","uuid":"0623E5B610DED01C288486C49420C5BA2A526B1603EC242E5B871FCEAAE1122B78966408CBA2E41DB951CB2E515C89E0DA0E3BF9366AFD7E704A2A37AC310AA7","orcidId":"0000-0002-2413-0083","documentHash":"123c6886-1080-4642-b410-d2a20ff5e25e"},{"objectId":"5e70933b878c28a0473a55a0","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Sudoł-Szopińska","uuid":"36E623069B53B85A316BCBE165EB4DF5AF824EF5A00FC9F7FCB7E2D0D81FA85ABA0C41F7233DBCC191109B710C1684CEC29F5AE59159D4939BF4BEFBDE07DCE1","orcidId":"0000-0003-2671-3036","documentHash":"e71bf76d-00fe-4c33-a507-4e6b64651f3c"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["TiO2","Synthesis","Sintering","Precursor"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","uid":"b1CAWFlsJj7f886P9BWoCUQ","uuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","parentUuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","rootUuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","name":"Uniwersytet Radomski im.

It was demonstrated that the main phase of the obtained titania was anatase. Morphology of the obtained TiO2 can be controlled through variations of the precipitation temperature and the emulsifier concentration. It was found that the addition of the chloride ions during gel formation caused crystallization of the (NH4)2TiOF4 phase. When it underwent decomposition under heating, agglomerated particles in form of rods several micrometers long were synthesized. Obtained powders were sintered, and both the sintering process and the final bulk structures were examined. The results indicated the lowest microhardness of 540 kg/mm2 in the specimens prepared out of the powders synthesized without emulsifier, while the highest hardness of 1450 kg/mm2 was reached when the TiO2 particles had been precipitated at room temperature with emulsifier proportion С(Ti):C(OР9) = 1:0.5.

Knowledge about the practical use of the working fluid, with the addition of a phase change substance, in heat exchange systems is limited The paper presents the results of preliminary research aimed at determining the possibility of using microencapsulated phase change material slurry (mPCM) as a working fluid in installations with a flat liquid solar collector, and the potential benefits as a result. The following were used as the working fluid during the tests: water (reference liquid), and a slurry of microencapsulated PCM. The mass fraction of mPCM in the working liquids is 4.3% and 8.6%, respectively. The research was carried out in laboratory conditions, in the range of radiation intensity G = 270–880 W/m2. The mass flux of each of the three working fluids in the collector is 30 kg/h, 40, kg/h, 60 kg/h, and 80 kg/h. Two main advantages of using mPCM as an additive to the working liquid are found: 1. in the entire range of thermal radiation intensity, the increase in the thermal efficiency of the collector fed with slurries is 4% with 4.3% mPCM in the slurry, and 6% with 8.6% mPCM in the slurry (for = 80 kg/h); 2. the slurry is characterized by a lower temperature at the outlet from the collector as compared to the water with the same thermal and flow parameters, which reduces heat losses to the environment both from the collector and other elements of the installation, as a result of excessive heating of the working liquid."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185883","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b5acc04097075e19df4f50","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"13","doi":null,"documentHash":"254dbb64-8d1c-42aa-9ebc-6f22bd85ee4c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"4493","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/13/4493/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70943d878c28a0473b8ac1","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Kruzel","uuid":"D091BD183AC156941A5DF5BAD6F23EE0ECFC246C19C039785FE63B56A7744338D7F2256585ADB0D98276BE4251A864375B6DAB4AD8DAA1C0658F5806E53AD52E","orcidId":"0000-0001-8349-1375","documentHash":"d452d99f-10be-4bbe-8fdf-3170cf572404"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a9c3","name":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Bohdal","uuid":"FE557F48AB0BCC045D03604A21AEDB16741672CBE2E7B157B4A45AE5D5E72EB79C331BEBECE5AD6FC6B84C37D1B69EDEFCCC7D68374F3D61593EB69A6DA6EAEA","orcidId":"0000-0002-0621-2894","documentHash":"dad37454-6473-4143-a891-7d1629fca9aa"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a9a3","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Dutkowski","uuid":"AA6C5EEE9BF28E248AA3987F6B84BADD11B7EE2566C9BCF978C1C0EA061BB3F8E8A6E12B084EFABB40F63C62953E7FFD3D28EC3AF76121099BE86C592350DB98","orcidId":"0000-0003-3945-9882","documentHash":"3f150489-3dc2-4687-9b01-d2f241fe006b"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15134493"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6304b3ac40970739a7634b7f","doi":null,"title":"Biodegradable Waste Management in the Circular Economy: Challenges and Opportunities","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-1-119-67984-4","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781119679523","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"9c4d5c6b-06ce-412d-bf49-238743849e6e","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb76d","mniswId":"3500","name":"Wiley-Blackwell","documentHash":"3ce75f7e-782c-4762-968c-6e867119753e"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Toxicity Assessment","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6304b54140970739a76354a1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709202878c28a04738e7cc","5e709202878c28a04738e7ac"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058185889","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"177-192","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Biodegradable+Waste+Management+in+the+Circular+Economy:+Challenges+and+Opportunities-p-9781119679844#content-section","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709202878c28a04738e7cc","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Fijałkowski","uuid":"485E146A5F066761675F2AD92FBB52C2C858F01D28377215427D98A0859423C7CE6A0AFF4427E735646FEAB7C48D15B6B7CE99037CA3BF9A945C2E3BED40BD01","orcidId":"0000-0001-5718-0581","documentHash":"0ef95e07-46bd-487d-9470-763791225ae2"},{"objectId":"5e709202878c28a04738e7ac","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kwarciak-Kozłowska","uuid":"DC10A50C20B68E8010903B988D9B976905AE2F7528EDF3E9E680ACB17D573D2D27D1C36BC7374D55F29A864006D8F22F4D28E3E34B3B4FBC1F0EC210AE1CC930","orcidId":"0000-0002-6273-5868","documentHash":"50aee3ef-2e8d-4d12-8cc8-371d341a4429"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Narażenie zawodowe","Spawalnictwo"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee3","uid":"bnX0HoKbxpGTrsHNBITsQWQ","uuid":"bdc6f547-9a9a-42e0-baaa-e9556955346a","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee3","parentUuid":"bdc6f547-9a9a-42e0-baaa-e9556955346a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee3","rootUuid":"bdc6f547-9a9a-42e0-baaa-e9556955346a","name":"Instytut Medycyny Pracy im. prof. dr. med.

The aim of this study was to provide EU relevant data on occupational Cr(VI) exposure to support the regulatory risk assessment and decision-making. In addition, the capability and validity of different biomarkers for the assessment of Cr(VI) exposure were evaluated.\n\nThe study involved nine European countries and involved 399 workers in different industry sectors with exposures to Cr(VI) such as welding, bath plating, applying or removing paint and other tasks. We also studied 203 controls to establish a background in workers with no direct exposure to Cr(VI). We applied a cross-sectional study design and used chromium in urine as the primary biomonitoring method for Cr(VI) exposure. Additionally, we studied the use of red blood cells (RBC) and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) for biomonitoring of exposure to Cr(VI). Personal measurements were used to study exposure to inhalable and respirable Cr(VI) by personal air sampling. Dermal exposure was studied by taking hand wipe samples.\n\nThe highest internal exposures were observed in the use of Cr(VI) in electrolytic bath plating. In stainless steel welding the internal Cr exposure was clearly lower when compared to plating activities. We observed a high correlation between chromium urinary levels and air Cr(VI) or dermal total Cr exposure. Urinary chromium showed its value as a first approach for the assessment of total, internal exposure. Correlations between urinary chromium and Cr(VI) in EBC and Cr in RBC were low, probably due to differences in kinetics and indicating that these biomonitoring approaches may not be interchangeable but rather complementary.\n\nThis study showed that occupational biomonitoring studies can be conducted successfully by multi-national collaboration and provide relevant information to support policy actions aiming to reduce occupational exposure to chemicals."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185891","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6204faa72467f04219d0a1c8","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"204","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"22f9474f-8c26-49cd-a815-3e8c9ebab591"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"204","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0013935121012792?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6204faa72467f04219d0a1c6","name":"Henna","lastName":"Veijalainen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c450f4f2-d360-43af-8af5-f9f4f2ce0f68"},{"objectId":"6204faa72467f04219d0a1c5","name":"Maurice","lastName":"van

organisms drive major ecosystem functions by mineralising carbon and releasing nutrients during decomposition processes, which supports plant growth, aboveground biodiversity and, ultimately, human nutrition. Soil ecologists often operate with functional groups to infer the effects of individual taxa on ecosystem functions and services. Simultaneous assessment of the functional roles of multiple taxa is possible using food-web reconstructions, but our knowledge of the feeding habits of many taxa is insufficient and often based on limited evidence. Over the last two decades, molecular, biochemical and isotopic tools have improved our understanding of the feeding habits of various soil organisms, yet this knowledge is still to be synthesised into a common functional framework. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the feeding habits of consumers in soil, including protists, micro-, meso- and macrofauna (invertebrates), and soil-associated vertebrates. We have integrated existing functional group classifications with findings gained with novel methods and compiled an overarching classification across taxa focusing on key universal traits such as food resource preferences, body masses, microhabitat specialisation, protection and hunting mechanisms. Our summary highlights various strands of evidence that many functional groups commonly used in soil ecology and food-web models are feeding on multiple types of food resources. In many cases, omnivory is observed down to the species level of taxonomic resolution, challenging realism of traditional soil food-web models based on distinct resource-based energy channels. Novel methods, such as stable isotope, fatty acid and DNA gut content analyses, have revealed previously hidden facets of trophic relationships of soil consumers, such as food assimilation, multichannel feeding across trophic levels, hidden trophic niche differentiation and the importance of alternative food/prey, as well as energy transfers across ecosystem compartments. Wider adoption of such tools and the development of open interoperable platforms that assemble morphological, ecological and trophic data as traits of soil taxa will enable the refinement and expansion of the multifunctional classification of consumers in soil. The compiled multifunctional classification of soil-associated consumers will serve as a reference for ecologists working with biodiversity changes and biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships, making soil food-web research more accessible and reproducible."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185896","journalIssue":{"objectId":"620a112f2467f06a1eda1e81","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"fe68d1db-72aa-48cc-ba09-9bf00b5a6f0d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"97","pagesFromTo":"1057-1117","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/brv.12832","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"620a112f2467f06a1eda1e7f","name":"Stefan","lastName":"Scheu","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4350-9520","documentHash":"046d29d6-66a1-4e96-a901-af555709759b"},{"objectId":"620a112f2467f06a1eda1e7e","name":"Alexei

study presents the results of examinations of polypropylene-glass fiber composites.

Their understanding and interrelation between each other depend on accurate quantitative structural assessment at both the chain and elemental cell microstructural levels and the supramolecular level. FTIR-ATR technique was used to identify the characteristic functional groups present in the chemical structure of polypropylene and composites based on its matrix. Structure analysis at the supramolecular level was performed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and temperature microscopic examinations. These examinations allowed for the evaluation of thermal parameters such as melting point and crystallization temperature of the polymer matrix in the composites studied. Furthermore, by analyzing the values of thermal effects determined using the DSC method, it was possible to determine the degree of crystallinity. A deeper understanding of the interdependence between the structure and properties of polymers allows to predict the characteristics of the final product and enables optimization of technological processes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185911","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.1264","pagesFromTo":"brak","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022286022008389","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709202878c28a04738e832","name":"Renata","lastName":"Caban","uuid":"B1A3A5E80AA32F5014721D9347FCFBF890A0FC0D7ABF838044DE8540604C15448333A923399A38B0C7C4A98BBFB8A94250D9E6120F872953FDDE935C46CB2081","orcidId":"0000-0003-4674-6265","documentHash":"3c9c5af9-0650-437d-8993-522fbddf450a"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.molstruc.2022.133181"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["amphibians","hybridization","hybrid zones","Hyla arborea group","Hylidae","morphometics","transgressive phenotypes","transgressive segregation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922e878c28a047391334","6203bb4e2467f01c21b7a44a","5e70922f878c28a04739163a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Morphometry of two cryptic tree frog species at their hybrid zone reveals neither intermediate nor transgressive morphotypes","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454779fd","mniswId":"5330","title":"Ecology and Evolution","doi":null,"issn":"2045-7758","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"a6b248e0-1745-48f2-a68e-8649d2c3d9b3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-17","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6203bb4e2467f01c21b7a448","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6203bb4e2467f01c21b7a44a","5e70922e878c28a047391334","5e70922f878c28a04739163a","6203bb4e2467f01c21b7a44b"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Under incomplete reproductive isolation, secondary contact of diverged allopatric lineages may lead to the formation of hybrid zones that allow to study recombinants over several generations as excellent systems of genomic interactions resulting from the evolutionary forces acting on certain genes and phenotypes.

While transgressive morphotypes have been examined in fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals, studies in amphibians are rare. Here, we associate microsatellite- based genotypes with morphometrics- based morphotypes of two tree frog species of the Hyla arborea group, sampled across a hybrid zone in Poland, to understand whether the genetically differentiated parental species also differ in morphology between each other and their hybrids and whether secondary contact leads to the evolution of intermediate or transgressive morphotypes. Using univariate approaches, explorative multivariate methods (principal component analyses) as well as techniques with prior grouping (discriminant function analyses), we find that morphotypes of both parental species and hybrids differ from each other. Importantly, hybrid morphotypes are nei-ther intermediate nor transgressive but found to be more similar to H. orientalis than to H. arborea."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185913","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8527","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6203bb4e2467f01c21b7a44b","name":"Matthias","lastName":"Stöck","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b3c94a65-51a5-445e-941e-741c5043a151"},{"objectId":"6203bb4e2467f01c21b7a44a","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Majtyka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3521e52c-a381-4268-b16d-10a75a9e0116"},{"objectId":"5e70922f878c28a04739163a","name":"Maria","lastName":"Ogielska","uuid":"7706DD903CE487A536B25CE3DB89AEECB90EC22F64C5264CB7F2F377E3D8644581258CFF158E74BB6E902242CFE0866DBC7D82D9248373E1E0DBAB6C92617CB9","orcidId":"0000-0002-4485-4441","documentHash":"157597a1-6ccd-4a74-9004-aecd25177e63"},{"objectId":"5e70922e878c28a047391334","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Borczyk","uuid":"BE9DDDB9291D0799760018B0904025AC7825D5D98B6F6F652F818F5A55AD4C199423B90D5967ED71A84DB96E77C6A8022FF00F853C18FFC0B3ED8E39DFA0C81C","orcidId":"0000-0001-9630-1809","documentHash":"c4113ce1-5799-41f7-bc86-d6b9da4c807e"}],"doi":"10.1002/ece3.8527"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","uid":"bS25x-5GKBWClU_peXDGOaQ","uuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","parentUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9f","rootUuid":"4d604044-b7a4-4356-929b-76bc6e9d539e","name":"Instytut Chemii Fizycznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70921c878c28a0473900de"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Isotopic dependence of the frequency of optical vibrations in molybdenum monohydride","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478447","mniswId":"10084","title":"Journal of Alloys and Compounds","doi":null,"issn":"0925-8388","eissn":"1873-4669","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"12751826-2db5-44f0-bb8c-52b7f797beab"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620cf2472467f01217ae34f2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["620cf2472467f01217ae34f4","620cf2472467f01217ae34f5","620cf2472467f01217ae34f6","620cf2472467f01217ae34f7","620cf2472467f01217ae34f8","620cf2472467f01217ae34f9","620cf2472467f01217ae34fa","620cf2472467f01217ae34fb","5e70921c878c28a0473900de"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"It is currently known that three hydrides - PdHx, MoHx, and TiHx - exhibit an inverse isotope effect in superconductivity. Namely, the phase with a heavier hydrogen isotope, deuterium, has a higher critical temperature. Hydrides and deuterides of palladium have intensively been studied both experimentally and theoretically, but the origin of the isotope effect has not been established with certainty. The commonly accepted explanation is that the effect is likely to be due to the strong anharmonicity of the optical hy-drogen vibrations, which was considered to be responsible for the large deviation of the ratio of the fun-damental optical frequencies omega(H)/omega(D) = 1.51 from the harmonic value root 2 approximate to 1.41. In the present paper, powder samples of MoH1.1(1) and MoD1.07(3) were synthesized under a hydrogen/deuterium pressure of several gigapascals and studied by inelastic neutron scattering (INS) at ambient pressure and T = 10 K. The INS study demonstrated that optical vibrations of H atoms in MoH1.1 and D atoms in MoD1.07 are harmonic and the ratio of fundamental optical frequencies omega(H)/omega(D) = 1.44 is close to the harmonic value root 2 approximate to 1.41. This shows that anharmonicity is not a necessary condition for the presence of the inverse isotope effect. The MoD1.07 sample was additionally studied by neutron diffraction (ND) at ambient pressure and T = 100 K. In agree-ment with previous ND results for MoH1.2, the ND study of MoD1.07 showed that deuterium atoms occupied almost all octahedral interstitial sites in its hexagonal close-packed metal lattice and formed a NiAs-type crystal structure with the composition close to MoD. The overstoichiometric composition MoD1.07 of the deuteride is likely to result from a small fraction D/Mo similar to 0.07 of deuterium atoms partially occupying the tetrahedral interstices."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185915","journalIssue":{"objectId":"620cf2472467f01217ae34fe","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"893","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"fbdafb51-0a5e-453c-a313-dae5465c2d49"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"893","pagesFromTo":"162299","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0925838821037099?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"620cf2472467f01217ae34fb","name":"Stanislav","lastName":"Savvin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"323546cd-6b0e-49b6-9b84-72e6c929602c"},{"objectId":"620cf2472467f01217ae34fa","name":"Vitaly D.","lastName":"Muzalevsky","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1ccbc34d-6f7d-4f4c-8425-8ab6305cf9cf"},{"objectId":"620cf2472467f01217ae34f9","name":"Valery I.","lastName":"Kulakov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ab7a2e8a-b38d-4c5d-bfc7-c70f1806a5a3"},{"objectId":"620cf2472467f01217ae34f8","name":"Alexander I.","lastName":"Kolesnikov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7bec6855-3acc-48f1-b7a1-d833aabb2644"},{"objectId":"620cf2472467f01217ae34f7","name":"Alexandre S.","lastName":"Ivanov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c154f890-22d1-42e8-b279-fd7c6d3e97b0"},{"objectId":"620cf2472467f01217ae34f6","name":"Thomas","lastName":"Hansen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1f6fc064-742a-42ee-89d0-125313d8380a"},{"objectId":"620cf2472467f01217ae34f5","name":"Vladimir E.","lastName":"Antonov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"390faa06-27e0-42ab-a5cc-89bb1b54bc83"},{"objectId":"620cf2472467f01217ae34f4","name":"Mikhail A.","lastName":"Kuzovnikov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"77c7e405-22c7-4c42-a7bf-1a787679be2c"},{"objectId":"5e70921c878c28a0473900de","name":"Marek","lastName":"Tkacz","uuid":"8B70F4141E0385F6F13B5919BEC00024E494D0625AD8AA2A3E966F7088F2D35E44E033B1909D3397A00C865227FEB19AACA655CD14AC27B01BA3C5807FA8E907","orcidId":"0000-0002-7253-7005","documentHash":"5f7aec6d-d5d0-4116-aed7-d415144a9473"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jallcom.2021.162299"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Paul Tillich · Kairos · Courage to be · Ultimate concern · Radical hope · Climate crisis"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df1d","uid":"br6adl8JzUqEoa7sG0ujCXg","uuid":"2505fc7c-d493-4c57-8c1f-653bc032f337","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Pedagogiczny","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709359878c28a0473a7cbc","5e709358878c28a0473a7be4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Three Kairoi - Three Aions.

Nevertheless, we decided to read some of his works within a philosophical-educational context. Reading those works of Tillich we realized that they required a pedagogical-philosophical acknowledgement. Scarce as the educational analyses of Paul Tillich’s writings are, they concern mostly either religious education or some specific issues connected with teaching. Our proposal was to read him differently: as a critical tool for grasping contemporary educational issues, independent from a religious or didactic approach. In the article, referring to the thoughts of Tillich, we analyze the three most important tensions of the last and present centuries: kairos I and II, referring to the human condition after World Wars I and II, and kairos III, related mainly to the war on terrorism and to the growing climate crisis. The analysis of these special moments in the history of humankind is related to the postulates and pedagogical attitudes articulated by us. We conclude that as a result of the deepening climate crisis and the looming specter of a cataclysm, the transition to a better aion may enable the pedagogy of radical hope. The essence of this pedagogy is to shape the “courage to be” during grassroots, collective and political action - an existential attitude saturated with resistance, concern and hope that such grassroots, cultural-religious practices can contribute to social change and reduce the fear of inevitable death associated with the risk of annihilation of the Earth."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185916","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11217-022-09834-8","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7cbc","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Sosnowska","uuid":"4D1CBBB72E3386165C7FCA4F227BB76C46D9998CE83D7600E9B59A617B99372B7265F6ED06DE144A343CF100BDBFF6B0E37098A767F2E0AC6930C3D9B7A18B3C","orcidId":"0000-0001-6559-8160","documentHash":"79137b95-2503-4e2f-b008-2099f9e35a77"},{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7be4","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Zańko","uuid":"9740CF3CC02A5DFDD596BC15A132FDCBA538A2773F0408FCFFB8E4AA72A49C1A017F5E7D5A98C6B438ED056571032D7E0EB9C63864946916C3C7D4E6E0AE74AE","orcidId":"0000-0003-3931-2928","documentHash":"41428d2c-9cb9-40fb-90a4-7d1ab8ae992a"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["energy efficiency","renewable sources of energy","climate neutrality","public spending","soft modeling","data envelopment analysis (DEA)"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","uid":"bQp8ITDzg_V-1GFpvOVvvtg","uuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","parentUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","rootUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","name":"Politechnika Opolska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709221878c28a0473905a7","5e7091f3878c28a04738d9c1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Analysis of Public Funds Utilization Efficiency for Climate Neutrality in the European Union Countries","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1073","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-14","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6204e2292467f04219cf9d03","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["64f9beed40970739aa988658","5e7091f3878c28a04738d9c1","64f9beed40970739aa988659","64f9beed40970739aa98865a","64f9beed40970739aa98865b","64f9beed40970739aa98865c","64f9beed40970739aa98865d","5e709221878c28a0473905a7"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this article was to assess the efficiency of the utilization of public funds for climate neutrality. It was concluded that the data gathered in public statistics are not adapted to current challenges and hinder the direct measurement of climate policy objective implementation progress. Due to that, an innovative approach to public intervention efficiency analysis was proposed for the sake of decreasing CO2 emission in 27 European Union (EU) countries, based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method and soft modeling. Statistical data are derived from the Eurostat database and pertain to the years 2005–2019. It was demonstrated that activity efficiency of the particular EU countries on climate neutrality varied and that together with the increase in public funds spent on environmental protection, the growth of effects in the field of reaching climate neutrality objectives was not observed. The greatest positive impact on achieving climate neutrality objectives was revealed for activities connected with building renewable sources of energy (RES) and there was no correlation detected for expenditures connected with transport infrastructure, which means that public funds used for their construction did not influence climate neutrality. It was established that, in the analyzed period, the decisions on allocating public funds were not taken on the basis of the expected amount of reduction in relation to the volume of outlays. In order to track the reasons for detected inefficiency, 52 projects were analyzed within the case study, which covered 3738 investments in the replacement of heating sources in one region of Poland. It was revealed that the efficiency of those investments varies; however, due to the full availability of data of the acquired results and outlays devoted to them, a synthetic index of efficiency measurement was established that presents the amount of CO2 reduction for EUR 1. When comparing the analyses carried out on macro and micro scales, it was observed that on the scale of the EU, there is a lack of uniform measurements or benchmarks of projects in the field of CO2 emissions reduction. Meanwhile, from the whole EU’s perspective, it should be reasonable to undertake projects with the highest economic efficiency, irrespective of political and geographical aspects. The results obtained should be utilized by decision-makers to elaborate reference methodologies and good practices in order to successfully implement climate objectives and especially the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD). What should be established are universal, on the EU scale, measurements and rules for gathering and counting data as well as benchmarks for the particular project types."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185918","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-25","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/2/581","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64f9beed40970739aa98865d","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Ryciuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bd36d623-0248-4fe1-b5cf-3e7a994b4a05"},{"objectId":"64f9beed40970739aa98865c","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Rogala","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d0b8176b-b951-49c2-ac1b-0fe0058865bd"},{"objectId":"64f9beed40970739aa98865b","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Perło","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4a7e71c5-737f-4f78-b5ce-c67c0e86fb8c"},{"objectId":"64f9beed40970739aa98865a","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Perło","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"77cecf8a-1370-4725-9183-bb87919939f3"},{"objectId":"64f9beed40970739aa988659","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Kutwa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dcfe5ae9-453d-46b5-9704-ff0e9e8e5658"},{"objectId":"64f9beed40970739aa988658","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Dębkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e77407e0-84de-410f-8f0b-ed4916aaed8b"},{"objectId":"5e709221878c28a0473905a7","name":"MARZENA","lastName":"SZEWCZUK-STĘPIEŃ","uuid":"92F7B0B4FF264710EF5E20550B4594B6572FAE0807D6F687E1D274C060FE061116A9BC360728751E86F50444FFC00571ECAC5B2DEFDAF97612D32F5F1F660290","orcidId":"0000-0001-8080-9317","documentHash":"da5fe2ba-a8e6-4b4d-b44b-5a219db6979e"},{"objectId":"5e7091f3878c28a04738d9c1","name":"ŁUKASZ","lastName":"DYMEK","uuid":"2054F6B7D7A33B3ED3B15451299CA600529B26A8372FA7DE6F671F1B7DCF35DB5E084018281B1680D7A580AB801D7294E78F91A9701EC9A70F57F07A7CCC0C8C","orcidId":"0000-0001-6674-5281","documentHash":"212035db-488c-4aa7-84b4-63adab94ac78"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15020581"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Pseudomonas aeruginosa","carbosilane dendrimers","polyethylene glycol","biofilm","endolysin","bacteriophages","laser interferometry"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922e878c28a0473913bf","5e709437878c28a0473b8474"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","uid":"b_ZPtKgtv4v90uInHkYp6dg","uuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","parentUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","rootUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Kochanowskiego w Kielcach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5fc4802d085dcb1e6ae0b822","5e709479878c28a0473bde19","5e70928b878c28a047397acd","5e70928e878c28a047397c70","5e70928c878c28a047397af8"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Antibacterial Effect of PEGylated Carbosilane Dendrimers on P. aeruginosa Alone and in Combination with Phage-Derived Endolysin","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","doi":null,"issn":"1422-0067","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"850accc5-0c0e-4f6c-9a84-eaa108a84f20"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-07","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62038d242467f01c21b46351","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709437878c28a0473b8474","62038d252467f01c21b46354","62038d252467f01c21b46355","62038d252467f01c21b46356","62038d252467f01c21b46357","5fc4802d085dcb1e6ae0b822","5e70928c878c28a047397af8","5e70928b878c28a047397acd","5e709479878c28a0473bde19","62038d252467f01c21b4635c","5e70928e878c28a047397c70","5e70922e878c28a0473913bf"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The search for new microbicide compounds is of an urgent need, especially against difficult-to-eradicate biofilm-forming bacteria. One attractive option is the application of cationic multivalent dendrimers as antibacterials and also as carriers of active molecules. These compounds require an adequate hydrophilic/hydrophobic structural balance to maximize the effect. Herein, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of cationic carbosilane (CBS) dendrimers unmodified or modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) units, against planktonic and biofilm-forming P. aeruginosa culture. Our study revealed that the presence of PEG destabilized the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance but reduced the antibacterial activity measured by microbiological cultivation methods, laser interferometry and fluorescence microscopy. On the other hand, the activity can be improved by the combination of the CBS dendrimers with endolysin, a bacteriophage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase. This enzyme applied in the absence of the cationic CBS dendrimers is ineffective against Gram-negative bacteria because of the protective outer membrane shield. However, the endolysin—CBS dendrimer mixture enables the penetration through the membrane and then deterioration of the peptidoglycan layer, providing a synergic antimicrobial effect."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058185920","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61fa5df02467f013ba91dd47","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"23","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"777a1283-1b7b-4880-b166-d90fbed20095"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"[1-18], [poz.] 1873","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms23031873","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62038d252467f01c21b4635c","name":"F.
