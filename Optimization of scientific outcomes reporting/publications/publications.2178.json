In this study we reanalyzed 36 published pollen data sets with robust chronologies from Polish Lowlands to determine the patterns of large-scale forest decline after the Migration Period (fourth to sixth century CE). The study revealed substantial heterogeneity in the old-growth forest decline patterns. Using new high-resolution studies, we could better understand the timing of this transition related to increasing economic development. After the Migration Period, forest expansion continued until the seventh to ninth centuries cal. CE, when the dawn of Slavic culture resulted in large-scale forest decline, especially in north-western and north-central Poland. Later, forest decline was recorded mainly in north-eastern Poland and was related to Prussian settlements, including activities associated with the Teutonic Order, as well as with new settlements from the fourteenth century. The composite picture shows a varied spatio-temporal forest loss and transition towards the present-day, human activity dominated landscapes. However, some sites, such as in north-eastern Poland, are characterized by a less abrupt critical transition. The pristine nature of the oak-hornbeam forest had already been destroyed in Early Medieval times (eighth to ninth centuries cal. CE) and the potential for recovery was largely lost. Our study has confirmed previous assumptions that the decline of hornbeam across the Polish Lowlands may be an early indicator of local settlement processes, preceding severe forest loss, and establishment of permanent agriculture."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614061","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65818db94097076c14b795e4","name":"Mariusz Grzegorz","lastName":"Lamentowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fb93b589-80cd-42ba-bacd-4ea37018aeff"},{"objectId":"65818db94097076c14b795e3","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Wacnik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"110ed5d1-f881-4eb2-b731-96191cae4465"},{"objectId":"65818db94097076c14b795e2","name":"Sambor","lastName":"Czerwiński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6bafb9b0-a213-4010-9f6e-595fd27bcc35"},{"objectId":"5e709474878c28a0473bd6bd","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Marcisz","uuid":"1CFC02754870E19C3ACECF450C77626D46AF9B1CEA2ADD1D4C1E5DFEAAFCF7F9FD74CBFCD5EC6291B411EB2A0A7A76794AEB4F5A8E6E5D341F7C74B6D7E51899","orcidId":"0000-0003-2655-9729","documentHash":"781c47e8-97db-4cf9-a3f5-646bd0ae0be9"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-022-12241-1"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709408878c28a0473b51f8","67ab3e1bfdbe8362a5734712","67ab3e1bfdbe8362a5734711","5e70943f878c28a0473b8c19","67ab3e1bfdbe8362a5734713","5e709210878c28a04738f653"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Anatomical variations in Eurasian wolf (Canis lupus lupus) (Carnivora: Canidae) of the salivary glands: A histological and histochemical investigation","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454792e9","mniswId":"16243","title":"PLoS ONE","doi":null,"issn":"1932-6203","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"45cf93d6-1d2d-4b95-93ed-f1e3f136e1c7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2025-01-10","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67ab3e1bfdbe8362a573470f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709210878c28a04738f653","5e709408878c28a0473b51f8","67ab3e1bfdbe8362a5734710","5e70943f878c28a0473b8c19","67ab3e1bfdbe8362a5734711","67ab3e1bfdbe8362a5734712","67ab3e1bfdbe8362a5734713","67ab3e1bfdbe8362a5734714"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The study involved a gross anatomical description of the parotid gland, mandibular gland, monostomatic sublingual gland, polystomatic sublingual gland, and zygomatic gland in 12 adult Eurasian wolves (Canis lupus lupus) (wild free-ranging individuals and their zoo counterparts), including their morphometry and microscopic evaluation using hematoxylin & eosin, mucicarmine, azan trichrome, PAS, AB pH 1.0, AB pH 2.5; AB pH 2.5/PAS, and HDI stainings. Topographically, the salivary glands were located similarly to those of other terrestrial Carnivora. The parotid gland in all wolves had a shape similar to a trapezoid (four angles). The parotid duct opened onto the fourth upper premolar (P4). The parotid gland was a branched alveolar complex that produced serous secretion. In captive specimens, the mandibular gland was a complex branched tubular gland producing mucous secretion, while in free-ranging wolves it was a branched tubuloalveolar gland producing mucoserous secretion. The monostomatic sublingual gland in free-ranging wolves was a complex branched tubuloalveolar gland that produced seromucous secretion, while in captive wolves, it revealed a mucoserous secretion character. The polystomatic sublingual gland consisted of several independent packets (from 6–7 to 7–8) and was a complex branched tubuloalveolar gland with seromucous secretion. The zygomatic duct opened onto the last upper molar tooth (M3), and this gland was a complex branched tubular gland producing mucous secretion. The anatomical and histological similarities between the salivary glands of the oral cavity in captive and free-ranging wolves, compared to other terrestrial carnivores, provide valuable insights for veterinary treatments and understanding pathological conditions. These findings emphasize the need for further research on diverse populations of wolves and related species within the Canidae family to better understand the influence of diet on salivary gland morphology."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614063","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"20","pagesFromTo":"1-25","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0317102","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab3e1bfdbe8362a5734714","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Barszcz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c9bdf3cc-89b6-4184-a9f6-8c0e69e797d6"},{"objectId":"67ab3e1bfdbe8362a5734713","name":"Igor","lastName":"Jucenco","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"afcde536-7f35-46ea-8057-bd377795c990"},{"objectId":"67ab3e1bfdbe8362a5734712","name":"Gabriela","lastName":"Jędrszczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dd05fb1e-1652-41e7-ae10-3b6aabe75207"},{"objectId":"67ab3e1bfdbe8362a5734711","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Łupicki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c1b054e3-edcb-4aaf-b648-1095541ec24e"},{"objectId":"67ab3e1bfdbe8362a5734710","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Stegmann","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f5f4a6d1-8deb-427b-a2dd-8cc566d1407f"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8c19","name":"ARKADIUSZ","lastName":"DZIECH","uuid":"AC4B4A758E42237E8EEB221FFE7FE1EE98A7241AF3D5E017B5CE367DFAD966EAB3D80EAA95F9BA1C7C01FF9A6D2FE188AB062847BC679CAEC4346F27F51AAFD9","orcidId":"0000-0002-3947-1737","documentHash":"1310dff1-0d9e-4620-a721-767f5b6466e3"},{"objectId":"5e709408878c28a0473b51f8","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Goździewska-Harłajczuk","uuid":"06E4013E77388EE93B0357F35C3830ECE414111C91652095310B72C40865D3412BD10191EBEE33B1E1C84B206B531C74BFD3FB126E829323729746A06B897CA8","orcidId":"0000-0003-4412-1966","documentHash":"7bccc158-5abc-4da0-9637-9f87a36978ae"},{"objectId":"5e709210878c28a04738f653","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Klećkowska-Nawrot","uuid":"0A5A4277903B2DD08057F2C7DDB01291CED2905E3B8CEB11F0A18FB79C2686C624D1047DB0A6B6E967800C88C095789E149E618427739B2C5AFFA34ACB447915","orcidId":"0000-0003-1154-8736","documentHash":"6e75be22-58a7-4dcc-be24-aa9a56301252"}],"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0317102"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e22"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Postępowanie z apatycznym osłem.

January 2023, the International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) approved the tracking of 20 additional BeiDou-3 Medium Earth Orbit (BDS-3 MEO) satellites, integrating them into the ILRS tracking network. Before that, only 4 BDS-3 MEO satellites had been tracked. BDS satellites employ highly advanced GNSS components and technological solutions; however, microwave-based orbits still contain systematic errors. Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) tracking is thus crucial for better identification and understanding of orbit modeling issues. Orbit improvements are necessary to consider BDS in future realizations of terrestrial reference frames, supporting the determination of global geodetic parameters and utilizing them for the co-location of GNSS and SLR in space. In this study, we summarize the first 6 months of SLR tracking 24 BDS-3 MEO satellites. The study indicates that the ILRS network effectively executed the request to track the entire BDS-3 MEO constellation. The number of observations is approximately 1300 and 450 for high- and low-priority BDS-3 satellites, respectively, over the 6 months. More than half of the SLR observations to BDS-3 MEO satellites were provided by 5 out of the 24 laser stations, which actively measured GNSS targets. For 14 out of 24 BDS-3 MEO satellites, the standard deviation of SLR residuals is at the level of 19–20 mm, which is comparable with the quality of the state-of-the-art Galileo orbit solutions. However, the SLR validation of the individual satellites revealed that the BDS-3 MEO constellation consists of more ambiguous groups of satellites than originally reported in the official metadata files distributed by the BDS operators. For 8 BDS-3 satellites, the quality of the orbits is noticeably inferior with a standard deviation of SLR residuals above 100 mm. Therefore, improving orbit modeling for BDS-3 MEO satellites remains an urgent challenge for the GNSS community."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614069","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"28","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10291-024-01638-2","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6243c0a87523402df099a30f","name":"Adrian","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"46D72DEBF61825396A8FF479AE361D4F57384227AE4BFDF06088CAD3AF1FF75CFF4B2D3C990B8D6371DCB4C816EA85681875AC409E34A34F37A453106011E3D2","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"47cf6d26-ccb0-4755-9602-f9c824e794a7"},{"objectId":"602f925a9543c7410626f61e","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Zajdel","uuid":"5E7BB79C3A34BEF743303834A2DBB23BF5EFF85CEB7F1AFDE8C949BF43ECB7477C36C3D2ECD294A54E31DAE35D3937A3551D6FDD070CF1252A87DB6EB38D4ACF","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"de7129cf-4f7b-4a9c-8998-38645d850a36"},{"objectId":"5e709437878c28a0473b83c7","name":"KRZYSZTOF","lastName":"SOŚNICA","uuid":"22D515E8674D468ED4D4CF62223E7EECD8B8352CEB0CD1836B9DDC1CE8294387C0820DC8358CDFCBC932A875FC2E9DCD5A7090797CD99D2610AC43E60CE18002","orcidId":"0000-0001-6181-1307","documentHash":"083640a6-2e12-412c-8dfb-f1627940b3cb"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10291-024-01638-2"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"661516cd4097075b47789cd7","doi":null,"title":"Leksykon

The ground temperature was closely correlated mainly with air temperature, but also with insolation and water vapour deficit. There is a statistical increase in the air temperature in Poznań – the trends at the whole soil profile are positive although not statistically significant.

This study aimed to analyze the relationship of SNPs and their genotypes with the fat content and fatty acid profile of milk from Polish Red-and-White (ZR), Polish Red (RP), and Polish Holstein–Friesian Red-and-White (RW) cows. Milk samples were obtained during a milking trial. SNP genotyping was performed using the real-time PCR (HRM) method. It was shown that SNPs (with specific genotypes) were significantly associated with the presence of fatty acids such as C18:1n9t and C18:2n6c in milk. In addition, it was found that the milk fat from the ZR (genotypic variant A/G, AA) and RP (genotypic variant GG, A/G) breeds often exhibited a more attractive fatty acids profile than the milk fat from RW cows.

It leads to limitations in the horizontal (e.g., a single space-based radio occultation profile covers a 300 km slice of the troposphere) and vertical resolution (e.g., ground-based estimates of troposphere conditions have spacing equal to stations’ distribution) of the tropospheric products. The first stage to achieve an integrated model is to create an effective 3D ray-tracing algorithm for the satellite-to-satellite (radio occultation) path reconstruction. We verify the consistency of the simulated data with the RO\nobservations from the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC-1) Data Analysis and Archive Center (CDAAC) in terms of excess phase and bending angle. The results show that our solution provides an effective RO excess phase, with a relative error varying from 35% at the height of 25–30 km (1.0–1.5 m) to 0.5% at heights 5–10 km (0.1–1 m) and 14 to 2% at heights below 5 km (2–14 m).

Effectiveness of ATR targeting in human cancers has been confirmed in preclinical studies and ATR inhibitors are currently developed clinically in human oncology. In the presented study, we tested the anticancer efficacy of ATR inhibitor berzosertib in an in vitro model of canine haematopoietic cancers. Using MTT assay and flow cytometry, we assessed the cytotoxicity of berzosertib in four established canine lymphoma and leukaemia cell lines and compared it with its activity against noncancerous canine cells. Further, we estimated the level of apoptosis in berzosertib-treated cells via flow cytometry and assessed H2AX phosphorylation as a marker of DNA damage using western blot technique. In flow-cytometric analysis, we also evaluated potential synergism between berzosertib and chlorambucil and assessed the influence of berzosertib on cell cycle disturbances induced by the drug. The results demonstrated that berzosertib, even without additional DNA damaging agent, can be effective against canine lymphoma and leukaemia cells at concentrations that were harmless for noncancerous cells, although sensitivity of individual cancer cell lines varied greatly. Cell death occurred through caspase-dependent apoptosis via induction of DNA damage. Berzosertib also acted synergistically with chlorambucil, probably by preventing DNA damage repair as a consequence of S-phase arrest abrogation. In conclusion, ATR inhibition may provide a new therapeutic option for the treatment of canine lymphomas and leukaemias, but further studies are required to determine potential biomarkers of their susceptibility."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614081","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"602-612","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/vco.13014","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0e1c","name":"MARTA","lastName":"HENKLEWSKA","uuid":"671150290F691CB3A35305391F3D44A60ECD31284C0B41B41103CE7569B62C621C7D1F1B6397EE2A1D4B502132CD3C8C50BA937245B0E63B45D756416BEAD54E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9725-7969","documentHash":"3ef51e3c-6833-4395-9d74-bb2b085fac45"},{"objectId":"5e709447878c28a0473b997e","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Pawlak","uuid":"6312B2C996BE226EE65BBE86A5EF6DB125B144FB97326D92E8C8D7B51D34F0910B6AEFFA4D8D352A19A5E1B99B4E4DB179D47CCA6C74B2D919287375FEEA17E1","orcidId":"0000-0002-7449-1661","documentHash":"873b3466-b349-43e3-8721-62e4be3ef389"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e247","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Obmińska-Mrukowicz","uuid":"58E4BEE087344EE95C6CAD60705B723AA21C1C7A35A76A28A56E373C7CF25508522DB01DD74B517A9764CB25E5ABFC95E44FBCC6F60FB99F80C608828547E879","orcidId":"0000-0002-9511-3504","documentHash":"23860fea-3a85-49dc-834d-04a1778aff03"}],"doi":"10.1111/vco.13014"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Assessment

Galileo High Accuracy Service (HAS) is a free of charge Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) augmentation service provided by the European Union. It is designed to enable real-time Precise Point Positioning (PPP) with a target accuracy (at the 95% confidence level) of 20 cm and 40 cm in the horizontal and vertical components, respectively, to be achieved within 300 s. The performance of the service has been confirmed with geodetic-grade receivers. However, mass market applications require low-cost GNSS receivers connected to low-cost antennae. This paper focuses on the performance of the real-time static and kinematic positioning achieved with Galileo HAS and low-cost GNSS receivers. The study is limited to GPS + Galileo dual-frequency positioning, thus exploiting the full potential of Galileo HAS SL1. We demonstrate that the target accuracy of Galileo HAS SL1 is reached with both geodetic-grade and low-cost receivers in dual-frequency static and kinematic applications in open-sky conditions. Precision of a few centimeters is reached for static positioning, while kinematic positioning results in subdecimeter precision. Vertical accuracy is limited by missing phase center offset models for low-cost antennas. In general, the performance of low-cost hardware using Galileo HAS for real-time PPP is comparable to that of geodetic-grade hardware. Therefore, combining low-cost GNSS receivers with Galileo HAS is feasible and justified."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614084","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/16/21/4008","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab3862fdbe8362a5733f5d","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Bosy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"706ea4d5-4ac5-44ac-9cea-c8fb639c6e0a"},{"objectId":"617a0b297523400564d4b520","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Marut","uuid":"14FECFE7173CCD0DB87F1671D7405D64DA8B8C83FFC41F5E08EF74FF54E75851C2D7EA49D2C6DDE7C73DA9636821BBF87FF44C83A0CA3AC94F46A44244E52EBA","orcidId":"0000-0001-9877-1898","documentHash":"1788383b-42a7-4d3c-ae71-c0d70e32a0b4"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6d76","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Kaźmierski","uuid":"5981482D3F990652B8C98CCB767F7CB00D1165F221C461FDB104FBEEEE02F523B3874786112BC409CBAC5C75B659F29B95675FF4431D6160E10A02F09320EAB0","orcidId":"0000-0002-7927-9416","documentHash":"0d50890e-0c0c-49e6-ac2f-ed2a712582ca"},{"objectId":"5e709276878c28a047396118","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Hadaś","uuid":"4A99594710E9040CA242D65D081A1CFAB1E0450124D124C455F0CE852629B587EFE6D179ED578B652D2E6C871CD592B7D5FAF9713E0C7FBBB3B255D494DF8FEE","orcidId":"0000-0002-4409-5078","documentHash":"4a46da2e-e663-4087-b2cc-c266df617599"}],"doi":"10.3390/rs16214008"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["horse","renal","chronic

The empirical material used in the article concerns both the whole country and six voivodeships of eastern and western Poland, i.e. Lubelskie, Podkarpackie and Podlaskie as well as Dolnośląskie, Lubuskie and Zachodniopomorskie. The figures come from the Central Statistical Office in Warsaw (Social Cohesion Survey). The empirical material collected and ordered was developed in tabular and graphical form, using comparative analysis. Furthermore, all diagnostic features illustrating the financial situation of households in the eastern and western regions of Poland were scored against the background of the entire country, which is a new approach to the research problem undertaken in the article. Findings: The statistical data confirmed the research hypothesis presented in the article, assuming that households in the western regions of Poland are in a better financial situation than in the eastern regions, although there is variation in this respect between individual voivodeships of these regions. Originality/value: The originality of the work lies in the author's approach to the analysis of the research issues and the assessment of the financial situation of households in the eastern and western regions of Poland against the background of the entire country. The work is addressed primarily to politicians at the central level, as well as to local government officials responsible for the conditions, opportunities and directions of regional socioeconomic development, as well as to other decision makers implementing regional development policy in Poland."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614088","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6486be514097071aeb3f1c3e","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"170","doi":"","documentHash":"1dd10316-8f06-432a-a387-24c9b5d95508"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"499-515","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://managementpapers.polsl.pl/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/170-So%C5%82tysiak-Zaj%C4%85c-2.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"675762bafdbe835717458dc6","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Zając","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"06ea157f-ee4f-4168-9dcb-5b1e4cd83b82"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a04739524a","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Sołtysiak","uuid":"CAAB6BEF1942CB319F9BEB89B0DF8E2AC3D32F09BC409BAFB7184D00AFCFED8625A6491F8F7AFA978163151EDECFD01ADD66B9A8A2A6E086CAF916776436F2E5","orcidId":"0000-0003-3366-1537","documentHash":"2cc61158-136d-413f-81b4-e7921074b9ac"}],"doi":"10.29119/1641-3466.2023.170.31"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Inhibitor tkankowy metaloproteinazy 1","Rezystyna","Leptyna","Czynnik martwiczy nowotworu alfa","Interleukiny","Otyłość - dzieci"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["TNFα","TIMP-1","Leptin and resistin","MMP-9","IL-1 α","IL-6"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","uid":"b_b7HPtUTCJYlxfss9Ssv-A","uuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","parentUuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","rootUuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","name":"Uniwersytet Mikołaja Kopernika w Toruniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092c0878c28a04739c126","5e7092c0878c28a04739c04c","5e7092c0878c28a04739c010"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Implications of the matrix metalloproteinases, their tissue inhibitors and some other inflammatory mediators expression levels in children obesity-related phenotypes","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547e309","mniswId":"24289","title":"Journal of Personalized Medicine","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2075-4426","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"0934c293-0199-48ae-83cc-d9ae60aa7a6a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-03-19","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6756c3fcfdbe8357172f93fc","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6756c3fcfdbe8357172f93fd","5e7092c0878c28a04739c126","6756c3fcfdbe8357172f93fe","5e7092c0878c28a04739c010","6756c3fcfdbe8357172f93ff","5e7092c0878c28a04739c04c","6756c3fcfdbe8357172f9400"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Objectives: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are calcium-dependent zinc-containing endo-peptidases engaged in many biological processes including adipogenesis, angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling. Fat tissue infiltration by peripheral leukocytes plays an important role in transition of fat tissue residual, non-inflammatory status into the pro-inflammatory one, resulting in fat tissue inflammation and expansion as well as production of many mediators like adipokines and cytokines. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of MMPs, their endogenous tissue inhibitors (TIMPs), and selected inflammatory mediators in leukocytes and plasma of children with simple obesity to find their associations with obesity-related phenotypes. Material and methods: Twenty-six overweight/obese children and twenty-three healthy volunteers participated in the study. The leukocyte mRNA expression levels of MMP-2, -9, -12 -14, TIMP-1, -2, and IL-6 were analyzed by the real time quantitative PCR. Plasma MMP-9/TIMP-1 and MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratios as well as the concentrations of MMP-9, TIMP-1, IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF- alpha, leptin and resistin were tested by ELISA assays. Gelatin zymography was used to assess the activity of the leukocyte MMPs proteins. Results: The obese children showed the following: a) increased expression of leukocyte TIMP-1 and slight elevation (close to statistical significance) of leukocyte MMP-9 (p = 0.054), the decline in MMP-2, b) elevation of plasma MMP-9, leptin, and MMP9/TIMP1 ratio, c) reduced expression of plasma TNF-alpha and MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratio. Several negative correlations were found: TIMP2 vs. ALT (r = −0.536), AST (r = −0.645) and TTG (r = −0.438), IL-6 vs. GGTP (r = −0.815), and MMP12 vs. TTG (r = −0.488), leptin vs. ALT (r = −0.569), MMP-9 vs. total cholesterol (r = −0.556). The only positive correlation was that of plasma leptin level vs. GGTP (r = 0.964). Conclusions: At the beginning of obesity development (children), possibly compensatory reactions prevail, reflected here by an increase in the expression of leukocyte MMPs inhibitor TIMP-1, decrease in the level of leukocyte MMP-2 and plasma MMP-2, MMP2/TIMP-2 ratio, low plasma TNF-alpha and negative correlations between the expression of TIMP-2 and liver (AST, ALT) or fat (TTG) inflammatory markers."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614090","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4426/14/3/317","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6756c3fcfdbe8357172f9400","name":"Joanna Beata","lastName":"Trojanek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4339cdd6-8ad6-42af-a746-bbaa571790fa"},{"objectId":"6756c3fcfdbe8357172f93ff","name":"Mieczysław","lastName":"Szalecki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dd7f7b9d-9453-4723-abfd-d4ce92d4ff74"},{"objectId":"6756c3fcfdbe8357172f93fe","name":"Renata","lastName":"Grzywa-Czuba","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f108d954-5498-427b-a44a-b188bd60b808"},{"objectId":"6756c3fcfdbe8357172f93fd","name":"Aldona","lastName":"Wierzbicka-Rucińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4a43227b-d044-4905-862b-c7fb5e5afe22"},{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739c126","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Kubiszewska","uuid":"2AEEC7F5B2E9538396860F47E36537B586736E5F7722C506C01A0DAECB056484A4B9948B6D37486120A9C46BA5CF4F95B4B66BF2D33209C6C0B77BF3FE1DFB20","orcidId":"0000-0003-4224-0961","documentHash":"8e83d9c5-401d-47a3-85a0-89b4649a01ec"},{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739c04c","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Michałkiewicz","uuid":"680EDA5A56F9A6E1A95C7907C31ECDD49B57BE7D86AA3BE079E3C0A46FF62912B9D418FFBDD12D080CD88E71349311EC0C8B988163D77725F40A446005A325F5","orcidId":"0000-0001-7773-1766","documentHash":"5f4af189-6b15-40fb-a674-09d8e3ada017"},{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739c010","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Gackowska","uuid":"08BB5855CD3ABEF5CFEA4062BD0C3DC9E0B4F337AE1E998CEE03725C9DCA87BDA39B8FB5D67CEE95DA618D9F4A55B51A3F6FE40939E5EE95831ACA3E4B979955","orcidId":"0000-0001-7666-504X","documentHash":"9572adf4-6676-4f4d-9e25-23976ac179df"}],"doi":"10.3390/jpm14030317"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["krowy","techniki wspomaganego rozrodu","unasiennianie","bydło","błędy przy inseminacji"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cows","artificial insemination","cattle","insemination mistakes","assisted reproductive technologies"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ed70e257523404d1000e8a7"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Najczęstsze błędy przy inseminacji krów i jałówek","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"64f04bf6cf9a7471b0ea406f","mniswId":"201647","title":"Weterynaria w Terenie","doi":null,"issn":"1896-7655","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"MINISTRY","editor":null,"documentHash":"a3cb1a3e-98f9-4635-8116-e5516e890294"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67ab4afafdbe8362a5762599","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5ed70e257523404d1000e8a7"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Sztuczne unasiennianie ma w rozrodzie bydła ponad stuletnią historię.

It was found that the glass transition temperature, Tg, of PMMS homopolymer is significantly lower compared to the other systems. Moreover, surprisingly, in the methacrylate-grafted copolymers, there are two relaxation processes (α and α′), while in the systems grafted with various acrylates, only a single process is present in the supercooled phase. Complementary rheological investigations indicated that the faster α process comes from the segmental motions, while α′ is not detected in the mechanical response. Further high-pressure experiments showed that there is a superposition between segmental and α′ modes irrespective of applied pressure, p, in methacrylate-based PMMS copolymers. This result suggests that the latter process might be considered as a sub-Rouse mode, or alternatively, it may originate from the dielectric active relaxation of the rigid polar side chain (grafts). Moreover, analysis of the high-pressure data allowed us to estimate the pressure coefficient of the glass transition temperature, dTg/dp, which was much higher for polymer brushes with respect to the PMMS homopolymer. Interestingly, the values of dTg/dp for methacrylate-grafted copolymers are slightly higher compared to acrylate-based PMMS copolymers, which may be due to the different flexibility/rigidity of both groups of materials as all examined materials have the same degree of polymerization of homopolymer backbone (Nbb ∼ 12) and side chain (Nsc = 1). However, for both groups of studied systems, dTg/dp values did not scale with chain length. This unexpected result must be related to the structure of the studied grafted copolymers and the character of grafts, derivatives of acrylates/methacrylates. The data presented here extend our knowledge of the influence of the architecture of different molecules on the dynamics of polymers at ambient and high pressures."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614096","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67515acffdbe834f7681b531","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"57","number":"22","doi":null,"documentHash":"c21862fe-e34f-489c-9e16-845cf2a9963b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"57","pagesFromTo":"10754-10766","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.macromol.4c01779","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67515acffdbe834f7681b536","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Kamiński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7631e53c-69ec-437d-b99f-6c0eaf7e0220"},{"objectId":"67515acffdbe834f7681b535","name":"Marian","lastName":"Paluch","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"62fc44ab-b798-474d-85a5-80c3a28e95a3"},{"objectId":"67515acffdbe834f7681b534","name":"Żaneta","lastName":"Wojnarowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5373ff7b-798a-4ff8-99f6-b609edf1e252"},{"objectId":"67515acffdbe834f7681b533","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Tarnacka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3b45aa9c-0d42-4bc5-80ab-fd95df518a46"},{"objectId":"67515acffdbe834f7681b532","name":"Sara","lastName":"Zimny","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1efb6390-a360-42dc-8738-e233d1a2543e"},{"objectId":"5e70946c878c28a0473bcc48","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Maksym","uuid":"3A71EBE82A73601CA08F7704DCAC9A31B03046E1EF04E4D792E2A8FC7D8CAB1E409E7953D596FDD9B76A341037AADC158259234C70F460BA9A73A5C28203F697","orcidId":"0000-0002-8506-7102","documentHash":"0a4a9f79-d086-4593-8519-387a1f65ca88"}],"doi":"10.1021/acs.macromol.4c01779"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet

of spatial patterns of species richness (SR) is highly relevant for theoretical research in ecology and the development of conservation plans. In Poland, despite a long tradition of botanical surveys, vascular plant SR has not been mapped, nor have the correlations in richness among different plant species groups been explored at the entire country scale. Here, we used a recently published data set to examine spatial patterns and relationships among the joined SR of vascular plant species, including native species, archaeophytes, neophytes, and species with high conservation value (i.e., red-list species). The basic spatial unit employed was a 10 × 10 km grid from the Atlas of Distribution of Vascular Plants in Poland (ATPOL). We found that SR of native species and archaeophytes, neophytes, and red-list species were positively correlated. The main patterns of SR and the percentage of particular groups in the joined SR were based on three components: (1) gradient of overall SR, (2) invasion level, and (3) peculiarity of flora in some regions resulting from the high number and proportion of rare species that often have high conservation value (red-list species). In general, northeastern Poland was species-poor, while the Carpathian Mountain range, the uplands in southern Poland, and some parts of Wisła River valley had the highest SR concentrations. e location of SR hotspots usually did not overlap with the existing national parks system. The correlations among native SR, high conservation value species, and neophyte SR suggest that biological invasions are among the most important threats to vascular plant diversity in Poland. Finally, despite likely biases in SR assessments, we demonstrated that the presented maps seem to reflect general ecological gradients influencing vascular plant distribution in Poland."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614103","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"93","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.journalssystem.com/asbp/Spatial-patterns-of-vascular-plant-species-richness-in-Poland-Relations-among-species,192897,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab4470fdbe8362a573c84c","name":"Henok","lastName":"Tegegne","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"84403de0-3c40-4f98-8ed9-979e56046e02"},{"objectId":"67ab4470fdbe8362a573c84b","name":"Tomasz H.","lastName":"Szymura","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"26bd3bb9-950a-44a0-b6fa-0ff053bedf8c"},{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a047395fd8","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Szymura","uuid":"7AF996363FDF2E7EECD4DACAA781E2E4828D1D9F5A86A2D48AFE27EFA22FE2758B5C10BE6268DD12FED10A61E330C8786F1A5E6D87B9338517224FDBBE15A123","orcidId":"0000-0002-5726-7393","documentHash":"053b3603-fc37-4cdf-85a5-9c6eb4654788"}],"doi":"10.5586/asbp/192897"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Lepidoptera,","Erebidae,","Arctiinae,","Syntomini,","Metamicroptera christophi,","new record,","Malawi"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec5","uid":"bi0054EFyZHNUwKK3x5HmqA","uuid":"8cc45ab7-e9f8-4e3b-ac7b-5dd9a6fe481d","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec5","parentUuid":"8cc45ab7-e9f8-4e3b-ac7b-5dd9a6fe481d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec5","rootUuid":"8cc45ab7-e9f8-4e3b-ac7b-5dd9a6fe481d","name":"Instytut Systematyki i Ewolucji Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a9c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Metamicroptera christophi Przybylowicz, 2005, a hitherto rarely recorded species new for Malawi (Lepidoptera: Erebidae, Arctiinae, Syntomini)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547971a","mniswId":"18430","title":"SHILAP-REVISTA DE LEPIDOPTEROLOGIA","doi":null,"issn":"0300-5267","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"659d71c2-a8c2-4cc5-9623-1da3f9a2eae5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67ab42fffdbe837dc75eb98d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709410878c28a0473b5a9c"]},"issue":"200","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The genus Metamicroptera Hulstaert, 1923 and Metamicroptera christophi Przybylowicz, 2005 (Erebidae:\nArctiinae) is recorded for the first time from Malawi.

L. monocytogenes is isolated from soil, water, sewage, rotting vegetation, and the main source of these rods for humans is food (fish, unpasteurized dairy products, or raw fruits and vegetables). In recent years, there has been an increase in consumer interest in healthy food, especially organically grown. The use of natural fertilizers during organic farming can be a source of pathogens, including L. monocytogenes in the soil and finally in vegetables and fruits. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of L. monocytogenes in soil samples from organic carrot crops (Poland) and to characterize the tested strains. Microbial contamination of the soil has a direct impact on the safety of the crops grown on it. This is an important aspect in organic farming, where products are chosen as a healthier option and consumed by children and the elderly.\n\nMethods: The isolates were subjected to genetic similarity assessment (PFGE method), and the tested strains were evaluated for antibiotic susceptibility (disc-diffusion method), invasiveness (HT-29 line human colon cancer cell line), coaggregation with Salmonella Enteritidis, biofilm-forming ability and the effect of disinfectants on the biofilm.\n\nResults: Twenty-seven isolates of L. monocytogenes were isolated from 250 soil samples, 10 of which were genetically different. 80% of the tested strains were sensitive to the tested antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance was demonstrated in two strains (strain 11 – resistant to penicillin and cotrimoxazole, strain 22 – resistant to penicillin). The highest invasiveness against HT-29 cells at 23.2% was shown for strain 11. However, invasiveness of less than 1% was demonstrated for three strains, and strain 13 showed no ability to invade HT-29 human colon cancer cells. The level of coaggregation between the tested strains and S. Enteritidis ranged from 22.2 to 39.1%. The number of biofilm-isolated rods from the stainless steel surface was 6.37 to 7.10 log colony-forming unit (CFU)/cm2, while on polypropylene it was from 6.75 to 8.06 log CFU/cm2. The effectiveness of the disinfectants used depended on the duration of action and the concentration of the disinfectant. Chlorosol was shown to be the disinfectant causing stronger biofilm eradication on each of the tested surfaces. It has been shown that soils and thus food from organic farming can be a source of L. monocytogenes. These rods can vary in phenotypic characteristics and virulence levels.\n\nDiscussion: The research conducted allows to draw attention to the occurrence of pathogens, including L. monocytogenes in crops from organic farming.

study aimed to evaluate the impact of BEMER (Physical Vascular Therapy) on body surface temperature using infrared thermography (IRT) in the distal parts of the forelimbs in Thoroughbreds. The study tested the hypothesis that BEMER therapy leads to an increase in body surface temperature and blood vessel diameter in the distal parts of the forelimbs. The study involved 16 horses, split into 2 groups: active BEMER (n = 8) and sham (n = 8). The active BEMER group had BEMER boots applied to the distal parts of the forelimbs, whereas the sham group had BEMER boots applied without activation of the device. Both groups underwent IRT examination to detect changes in body surface temperature, followed by ultrasonographic examination to assess changes in vein and artery diameter before (BT) and just after (JAT) therapy. The IRT examination was repeated 15 min after BEMER therapy (15AT). There were no significant body surface temperature differences between BT and JAT in any regions of interest (ROIs) in either group. In the active BEMER group, the ROIs did not change significantly at 15AT, compared to the temperatures measured at BT (except for the hooves). At 15AT the temperature of all the ROIs (except the fetlock bone) dropped significantly in the sham group. In the ultrasonographic examination, there was a significant increase in vein and artery diameter in the study group JAT, whereas the sham group had a significant increase only in artery diameter JAT. These results suggest an effect of BEMER on stimulating blood circulation in the distal parts of the forelimbs in clinically healthy horses. IRT did not identify changes in skin surface temperature after BEMER therapy at the distal parts of the forelimbs."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614116","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/14/11/1538","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab440efdbe8362a5738c7e","name":"Kevin","lastName":"Howell","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"482a6faa-2414-49b9-a6d0-a31a7f34372c"},{"objectId":"67ab440efdbe8362a5738c7d","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Dudek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a2f20aeb-2755-4e39-b7d8-7aa64edf492d"},{"objectId":"67ab440efdbe8362a5738c7c","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Zielińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9e4a847c-77a6-4d2b-8fdc-8eca9b325607"},{"objectId":"65a89b3b40e3ff6b129e0c91","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Nawrot","uuid":"97C6E0F36342AD54DF05CB2BFAFA7B62C36B2F4D02E2D1FD06572E69A91A8A276CC58A762FDC47A9DB34E2E8AD0CFD552A34022C7870DE5E576665E3E6E36182","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bc3fdfc5-aa41-465e-b95d-72bcafe7226b"},{"objectId":"5e709415878c28a0473b5f65","name":"Maria","lastName":"Soroko-Dubrovina","uuid":"213319BB579762FF9676A753B02B488CC90C59AEA19A21D18DEFBAB8C4D763D4D72592B475BB5A1B1868C4D7B2A80DA7AB6DF4AE29305411686D9A4FA64BC210","orcidId":"0000-0002-8585-8000","documentHash":"426c9128-3fae-4bad-a16a-519863f20544"}],"doi":"10.3390/ani14111538"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["soja","rozstawa rzędów","Glycine max","ilość wysiewu"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["soybean","sowing amount","row spacing","Glycine max"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091fc878c28a04738e23c","67ab445ffdbe8362a573be60","5e7091fc878c28a04738e239"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Wpływ zróżnicowanej rozstawy rzędów i ilości wysiewu na rozwój i plonowanie soi (Glycine max (L.)

The study involved monitoring 33 racehorses aged 3 years in 3 imaging\r\nsessions over a period of 3 months. Temperature measurements of the neck and upper part of the forelimbs and hindlimbs from both sides were taken just before and after training. Three regions of interest (ROIs) located at the base of the neck, elbow and quarter on both sides of the body were analysed. Before physical effort, the average temperatures in all ROIs did not differ significantly between the right and left side of the body. After physical effort average surface temperatures of the left side of the elbow and quarter were significantly higher compared to the\r\nopposite side and the temperature at the base of the neck was higher on the right side in comparison to the left side (p<0.001). Body surface temperatures of all ROIs after physical effort significantly (p≤0.001) increased, with the greatest increase observed in the elbow (4.7°C) and\r\nthe lowest in the base of the neck (3ºC). All regions demonstrated a positive correlation between\r\naverage surface temperatures on the left and right side of the body, before and after training.\r\nThere was a strong positive correlation between the average temperatures in the analyzed ROIs after physical effort with the strongest correlation between the elbow and quarter (r=0.773) and the weakest between the quarter and base of the neck (r=0.474). In conclusion, our study revealed\r\nthat thermography remains a feasible diagnostic modality for identifying changes in upper parts of the body in response to physical effort and can therefore

lacking an intrinsic dynamo, is an ideal laboratory to comparatively study induced magnetospheres, which can be found in other terrestrial bodies as well as comets. Additionally, Mars is of particular interest to further exploration due to its loss of habitability by atmospheric escape and possible future human exploration. In this context, we propose the Mars Magnetospheric Multipoint Measurement Mission (M5), a multi-spacecraft mission to study the dynamics and energy transport of the Martian induced magnetosphere comprehensively. Particular focus is dedicated to the largely unexplored magnetotail region, where signatures of magnetic reconnection have been found. Furthermore, a reliable knowledge of the upstream solar wind conditions is needed to study the dynamics of the Martian magnetosphere, especially the different dayside boundary regions but also for energy transport phenomena like the current system and plasma waves. This will aid the study of atmospheric escape processes of planets with induced magnetospheres. In order to resolve the three-dimensional structures varying both in time and space, multi-point measurements are required. Thus, M5 is a five spacecraft mission, with one solar wind monitor orbiting Mars in a circular orbit at 5 Martian radii, and four smaller spacecraft in a tetrahedral configuration orbiting Mars in an elliptical orbit, spanning the far magnetotail up to 6 Mars radii with a periapsis just outside the Martian magnetosphere of 1.8 Mars radii. We not only present a detailed assessment of the scientific need for such a mission but also show the resulting mission and spacecraft design taking into account all aspects of the mission requirements and constraints such as mass, power, and link budgets. Additionally, different aspects of the mission programmatics like a possible mission timeline, cost estimates, or public outreach are shown. The common requirements for acceptance for an ESA mission are considered. The mission outlined in this paper was developed during the Alpbach Summer School 2022 on the topic of “Comparative Plasma Physics in the Universe”."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614126","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"73","pagesFromTo":"1-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273117723009171?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab3882fdbe8362a573403f","name":"Marcus","lastName":"Hallmann","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"99bc6377-9c0c-4c4b-8dac-ce57f0d09f34"},{"objectId":"67ab3882fdbe8362a573403e","name":"Florine","lastName":"Enengl","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a813d01d-d36f-4fd1-82ca-90cbac00c97c"},{"objectId":"67ab3882fdbe8362a573403d","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Teubenbacher","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b0f1ca9e-e370-4b92-85da-f05053657d13"},{"objectId":"67ab3882fdbe8362a573403c","name":"Inés","lastName":"Terraza Palanca","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9e8df916-c226-48af-8d93-b8b0472f1a63"},{"objectId":"67ab3882fdbe8362a573403b","name":"Vasco D.C.","lastName":"Pires","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"29c8f7c5-19fc-4588-9e64-b827475a2db9"},{"objectId":"67ab3882fdbe8362a573403a","name":"Sara","lastName":"Nesbit-Östman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1f602f43-ed0b-426d-90cc-84d253df5a03"},{"objectId":"67ab3882fdbe8362a5734039","name":"Sofia","lastName":"Lennerstrand","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"81e0dfdd-fcad-47ba-ac07-d42c8626389c"},{"objectId":"67ab3882fdbe8362a5734038","name":"Jonas","lastName":"Gesch","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a32b78ed-606e-44e2-b4f0-8a360eb41e78"},{"objectId":"67ab3882fdbe8362a5734037","name":"Alessia","lastName":"De Iuliis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e5f35deb-7094-42a2-8bed-de9cf3bcc758"},{"objectId":"67ab3882fdbe8362a5734036","name":"Pietro","lastName":"Dazzi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"81fa39ce-fdc3-4b3c-af84-e9aed7d5240a"},{"objectId":"67ab3882fdbe8362a5734035","name":"Marianne","lastName":"Brekkum","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5ccffff6-2f93-4d7b-8348-44efdba8d2fb"},{"objectId":"67ab3882fdbe8362a5734034","name":"Markus","lastName":"Baumgartner-Steinleitner","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"725c1036-26fd-4f98-838f-b93d934f9e95"},{"objectId":"67ab3882fdbe8362a5734033","name":"Leonard","lastName":"Schulz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a87c86a0-3790-4527-8969-a39bdadac566"},{"objectId":"67ab3882fdbe8362a5734032","name":"Ville","lastName":"Lundén","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dec2d474-18b9-4669-b8f8-739219bb97d2"},{"objectId":"67ab3882fdbe8362a5734031","name":"Cormac J.K.","lastName":"Larkin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cb01466e-48cb-449a-9a79-6863ccc42286"},{"objectId":"617768287523400564d3afe9","name":"Adam","lastName":"Cegła","uuid":"9626C0346C25EC4C6BD86E432619382FD81E8CAB4A279A8A90FAA48E3A3685375E79E28CF4331E9165330B036414950FD5237E99471B1A89F5D7D3591482124A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c52162bc-0b9a-4908-a181-f85f1af388ad"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.asr.2023.11.032"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Racial geography","residential segregation","racial diversity"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Improving assessment of urban racial segregation by partitioning a region into racial enclaves","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477ae7","mniswId":"5781","title":"Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design","doi":null,"issn":"0265-8135","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"62ade67b-be26-4e71-82cf-981a049996ca"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"618bd9482467f00198e86859","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ed878c28a0473b369c","65818cd44097076c14b78d00"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p> Frequently, a single-value metric is needed to rank urban regions with respect to the level of multiracial segregation or to compare a segregation level of a single urban region at two different times. Assessment of segregation depends not only on a metric used but also on a choice of region’s partitioning. The standard practice is to partition the region into single-scale subregions. In the United States, census tracts are the subregions of choice. Census aggregation units including tracts are delineated without a direct regard to racial homogeneity and are in fact heterogeneous. Consequently, using tracts as subdivisions leads to the underestimation of the segregation level of the entire region. Here we propose to partition a region into racial enclaves—units having boundaries that align with transitions between different racial compositions. By reflecting true demographic structure, such units minimize their internal racial inhomogeneity resulting in improved assessment of segregation. Enclaves are defined as aggregates of adjacent census blocks (smallest and the most racially homogeneous census units) of similar composition. In a typical US urban region, effective population size of enclaves is an order of magnitude larger than the size of a census tract and yet the segregation calculated based on enclaves is larger than segregation based on census tracts. The proposed methodology is described and applied to a set of 61 largest cities in the US in their metropolitan statistical areas as well as their urban areas boundaries using 1990 and 2010 block-level data. The method is compared to the standard methodology using correlations between cities’ segregation rankings. </jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614128","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"49","pagesFromTo":" 1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65818cd44097076c14b78d00","name":"Tomasz F","lastName":"Stepinski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"acafacf5-1ed5-44de-892f-a8f115a83061"},{"objectId":"5e7093ed878c28a0473b369c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Dmowska","uuid":"E5C68C52B1F7F60B3FCE247FE89547ED6123B3C259113FEEDDB6EF87323E886E89E318B65A515137179D212848969D4438CA71BC16C539AF69C18F1A19622F79","orcidId":"0000-0001-9333-3768","documentHash":"02469a04-30b0-4d20-8f78-330e74501e6f"}],"doi":"10.1177/23998083211001386"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6321c6a740970747dec11a48","doi":null,"title":"Podstawy chirurgii.

the genetic diversity and population structure of wheat germplasm is crucial for understanding the underlying variability essential for breeding programs and germplasm preservation. This research aims to contribute novel insights with respect to the genetic makeup and relationships among these wheat genotypes, shedding light on the diversity present within the Turkish wheat germplasm. In this study, iPBS-retrotransposon markers were employed to analyze 58 wheat genotypes, encompassing 54 landraces and 4 cultivars sourced from Türkiye. These markers serve as genetic indicators that can be used to evaluate genetic variation, build genealogical trees, and comprehend evolutionary connections. The PCR products were visualized on agarose gel, and bands were scored as present/absent. The ten iPBS primers collectively yielded an average of 16.3 alleles, generating a total of 163 polymorphic bands. The number of alleles produced by individual markers ranged from 4 (iPBS-2386) to 29 (iPBS-2219). The genetic parameters were calculated using the popgen and powermarker programs. The genetic relationships and population structures were assessed using the ntsys and structure programs. Polymorphism information content (PIC) per marker varied from 0.13 (iPBS-2390) to 0.29 (iPBS-2386), with an average value of 0.22. Shannon’s information index (I) was calculated as 1.48, while the number of effective alleles (Ne) and Nei’s genetic diversity (H) were determined to be 0.26 and 0.31, respectively. Genotype numbers 3 (Triticum dicoccum) and 10 (Triticum monococcum) exhibited the maximum genetic distance of 0.1292, signifying the highest genetic disparity. Population structure analysis revealed the segregation of genotypes into three distinct subpopulations. Notably, a substantial portion of genotypes clustered within populations correlated with the wheat species. This population structure result was consistent with the categorization of genotypes based on wheat species. The comprehensive assessment revealed noteworthy insights with respect to allele distribution, polymorphism content, and population differentiation, offering valuable implications for wheat breeding strategies and germplasm conservation efforts. In addition, the iPBS markers and wheat genotypes employed in this study hold significant potential for applications in wheat breeding research and germplasm preservation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614135","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/14/2/300","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab43c7fdbe8362a57375fc","name":"Jan","lastName":"Bocianowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3e124954-4de6-494f-9214-5bcc522b45c6"},{"objectId":"67ab43c7fdbe8362a57375fb","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Haliloglu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"922f8331-32bd-4a73-80ef-5796c97a1f19"},{"objectId":"67ab43c7fdbe8362a57375fa","name":"Aras","lastName":"Türkoglu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2df1e0de-10e0-45d5-b3db-909524210e2a"},{"objectId":"67ab43c7fdbe8362a57375f9","name":"Serap","lastName":"Demirel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"201ecc83-d323-4985-a4d6-60f3b9f21b63"},{"objectId":"67ab43c7fdbe8362a57375f8","name":"Baris","lastName":"Eren","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"18a55768-f819-4033-85c4-49eff022f8c5"},{"objectId":"67ab43c7fdbe8362a57375f7","name":"Bünyamin","lastName":"Yıldırım","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9deff57e-952f-44c3-9d4f-2d82718057e7"},{"objectId":"67ab43c7fdbe8362a57375f6","name":"Fatih","lastName":"Demirel","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6f89137c-ccf3-4ced-9e13-65d30073a5ef"},{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a047395f6d","name":"Kamila","lastName":"Nowosad","uuid":"E2F8421B119C2E4DA9BA4432BAFBE4BB5E55318EB0E142AF6755FCB078F31355B58C5104ECA43C9CA92A448969457652786FC2C199AFC1170147AC7E30F316E1","orcidId":"0000-0001-6837-7806","documentHash":"98afe9ae-e153-4bde-9870-cc16c0c2f46c"},{"objectId":"5e70922b878c28a047390efd","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Bujak","uuid":"2C0665638203C8A5E931D0E70AAB8D5C776DCE7776ED657815A87DD52D6A510325FF37A83E58D94FEA5140DAB1E1F5A835E37BE21A62C7E31265D39C88D97CD9","orcidId":"0000-0001-8095-2105","documentHash":"8a067178-c40a-4d3a-be3a-2f4781bf3836"}],"doi":"10.3390/agronomy14020300"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["postbiotyki","dodatki żywieniowe","psy","biotyki"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["postbiotics","dogs","dietary supplements","biotics"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6160fea975234017e050decb"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Rola postbiotyków w żywieniu psów","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"64f04bfacf9a7471b0ea4124","mniswId":"201648","title":"Weterynaria w Praktyce","doi":null,"issn":"1732-1999","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"MINISTRY","editor":null,"documentHash":"d38a8c76-30f8-4a38-bfdd-e1c75a5bac95"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67ab4d05fdbe8362a576336c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6160fea975234017e050decb","67ab4d05fdbe8362a576336d"]},"issue":"9","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060614137","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"21","pagesFromTo":"120-126","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://vetkompleksowo.pl/kategorie-tematyczne/weterynaria-w-praktyce-nr-9-2024-juz-w-sprzedazy/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab4d05fdbe8362a576336d","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Wilk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"41a846c2-9216-4582-9775-b930beb80ed0"},{"objectId":"6160fea975234017e050decb","name":"Anna","lastName":"Budny-Walczak","uuid":"C2B499A9BE3FAFB01CD0A831D17C2713C7CF0CBC323A97EBDD53E24AD3B4DBA5AE9CBB84F2E1508A459BC92DB77CFB2D1949AF018BE9D6BF77EE03104DD140AC","orcidId":"0000-0001-6936-0758","documentHash":"dcbf1b7f-bf85-46d4-a316-34996f1540d5"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"636b74c9409707100106601c","doi":null,"title":"Interna Szczeklika.

The most notable result was the identification of a transient apparently amorphous state, different from the glass, during slow heating from the glass. This transient state was interpreted as resulting from the competition between two organizations, i.e., a locally preferred structure reminiscent of the ordered form and the long-range order of the disordered form, energetically closer to the undercooled liquid than the ordered form. The first-order transformation of the undercooled liquid in this short lifetime amorphous state reflects a polyamorphism in a pharmaceutical active ingredient, which is a very unusual feature in the domain of solid-state transformations in molecular materials. Meanwhile, the bimodal polymorphic transformation of the stable crystalline form II into form III via a transient liquid state during rapid heating can also be considered as an uncommon feature for a polymorphic transition. It was found that both atypical transformations assisted by thermally activated conformational motions into the disordered crystalline form III could be kinetically hindered by the high energy barrier between conformational polymorphs. As a consequence, the polyamorphic transformation can only be detected using the rapid acquisition capability of a low-frequency Raman spectrometer, probing the molecular organization from short- to long-range order."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614147","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67c1bdf8fdbe831c6733a569","year":"2025","publishedYear":null,"volume":"162","number":"7","doi":null,"documentHash":"aee48c21-d64d-4c0a-8094-8850d8d36507"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"162","pagesFromTo":"Article number: 074501","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article-pdf/doi/10.1063/5.0253999/20399298/074501_1_5.0253999.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67c1bdf8fdbe831c6733a56d","name":"Alain","lastName":"Hédoux","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d62c164a-1f85-43f1-b6c2-5e58a9ff1010"},{"objectId":"67c1bdf8fdbe831c6733a56c","name":"Yannick","lastName":"Guinet","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2ae0c907-5312-43c9-a589-1017dcb1a4f5"},{"objectId":"67c1bdf8fdbe831c6733a56b","name":"Laurent","lastName":"Paccou","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"51f31628-bec6-49da-9fce-3e45216af6b4"},{"objectId":"5e7094ea878c28a0473c6c8a","name":"Mehrnaz","lastName":"Khalaji","uuid":"101776EC3F18FD4909E0C3C19014C162D0FBEF6E50B142EC15B8E0AD7F8CBD7F36705052F22D21D0CAF58CBBC1B9DF420E0A375B3ACA09ACD2E44DAF4030FF91","orcidId":"0000-0003-1436-932X","documentHash":"ed7283ee-42e2-4453-9bda-dbc987fae145"}],"doi":"10.1063/5.0253999"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["doświadczenie znacznikowe","wody podziemne","parametry adwekcyjne\ni dyspersyjne","model numeryczny"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["tracer test","groundwater","advection and dispersion parameters","numerical model"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"64ccbdd24097077ac1db468d","doi":null,"title":"Zintegrowany Monitoring Środowiska przyrodniczego.

Here, we present results of microstructure and stable isotope studies on exceptionally well-preserved skeletons of two species of the heterocoral Oligophylloides from the Famennian (Upper Devonian) of the Anti-Atlas, Morocco and the Holy Cross Mountains, Poland. The investigations provide new information on the skeletogenesis and isotope fractionation effects in Palaeozoic heterocorals. In order to estimate the possible role of diagenetic alteration on the observed carbon and oxygen isotope ratios, we have conducted several preservation tests, including transmitted-light, scanning-electron, fluorescence and cathodoluminescence microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and trace element analyses. The least- and most-altered skeleton portions identified based on this approach are typified by clearly different isotopic signatures. The least-altered parts of the specimens reveal carbon and oxygen isotope ratios close to those of contemporaneous marine-equilibrated calcites. The moderately-pronounced, positive correlations between the δ<sup>13</sup>C and δ<sup>18</sup>O values observed for these coralla may reflect relatively minor vital fractionation effects, obscured to some degree by diagenetic overprint. The results suggest that the isotope fractionation mechanisms of the heterocorals differed markedly from the significant kinetic fractionation characteristic of the modern scleractinian corals. Rather, the moderate, if any, extent of non-equilibrium fractionation during skeletogenesis in the Heterocorallia resembled the typical, environmental and metabolic CO<sub>2</sub>-dominated fractionation effects shown by most other marine calcifiers. These include the extinct rugose corals, modern hydrocorals and, in particular, modern octocorals, with which the heterocorals show notable architectural and structural similarities."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614157","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"598","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65818f244097076c14b79fe1","name":"Claudio","lastName":"Mazzoli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dded3d80-5b02-4d15-99f7-dd4e926b5020"},{"objectId":"65818f244097076c14b79fe0","name":"Michael

article presents a comparative study of two different kinds of processes that produce oscillatory motion on a work surface during the mechanical separation process. The investigation began with determining the trajectory produced by the oscillating separator’s active component of the classical drive mechanism. Based on this, a second mechanism—the six-bar mechanism—was created using the WATT program, and a mathematical analysis was conducted. The comparative examination of the two mechanisms was carried out using OriginPro, Mathcad, and Roberts software. This study’s findings all point to the same conclusion: the newly developed mechanism produces the same trajectory as the classical mechanism when viewed through the lens of the reference element, or the element that causes the oscillatory movement. However, when looking at the operating parameters, there was a noticeable difference in the movement’s speed and the angle of the crank when producing its maximum speed. Theoretically, this new mechanism increases the speed at which solid particles move across a work surface. However, this difference cannot be characterized as positive or negative because further research is required to determine how the nature of solid particles and the work surface’s inclination affect this process, in addition to this mechanism. The identification of the mathematical equations of motion for the constituent parts of the mechanism under study is the novelty produced of this paper.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614165","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/13/5836","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67a4eac3fdbe8362a56bfd73","name":"Nicoleta","lastName":"Sporea","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0ea52e11-5e42-4555-9760-0df2afc226be"},{"objectId":"67a4eac3fdbe8362a56bfd72","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Przydatek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4c82b54e-53c5-4d70-bae6-277dc8a6415e"},{"objectId":"67a4eac3fdbe8362a56bfd71","name":"Mirela","lastName":"Panainte-Lehăduș","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"337efa42-21cd-4950-9a25-e3c3d7bc43e2"},{"objectId":"67a4eac3fdbe8362a56bfd70","name":"Dana","lastName":"Chitimuș","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8ed52c41-db77-47ed-95b3-ebf37a3bfc44"},{"objectId":"67a4eac3fdbe8362a56bfd6f","name":"Luminița","lastName":"Bibire","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bda6aff3-5a17-409a-898b-a743f808f569"},{"objectId":"67a4eac3fdbe8362a56bfd6e","name":"Emilian","lastName":"Mosnegutu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5b3f6420-70f1-46fc-8288-4920c2a9b8e1"},{"objectId":"5e7092fe878c28a0473a0a46","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Jasiński","uuid":"4F919AE1CB47BDFB771ED47A379455AF30227B4261F6EA018F7CB41CF06E41B1F0C2A0647AD904FE0820CBE1C7D939195048ACA0126E9D1F0356BE7099D9411C","orcidId":"0000-0002-4434-8856","documentHash":"3eac1fed-8f9c-473e-9b3b-fe42b11f2393"}],"doi":"10.3390/app14135836"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["lakes","climate change","minimum temperature"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Trends of Changes in Minimum Lake Water Temperature in Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-3417","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ff202409-59bf-494e-82ae-6802b8fb2444"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63bd956e4097073596a61960","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709310878c28a0473a23cb","65818dfb4097076c14b7973c","65818dfb4097076c14b7973d"]},"issue":"24","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Water temperature in lakes is their basic property that determines many processes.

This paper analyses changes in the minimum temperature in 10 lakes in Poland in the period 1972–2021. The obtained results show variability over the course of the parameter, both at the annual and monthly scale. In the first case, half of the analysed set showed statistically significant increasing trends (on average 0.10 °C per decade). In the latter case, the greatest changes occurred in the months of the warm half-year (on average 0.57 °C per decade). The reported situation is caused by the individual conditions of particular lakes, i.e., their location, morphometric parameters, or the dynamics of the occurrence of ice phenomena. A successive increase in the minimum temperature in lakes has its consequences for biotic and abiotic processes.

While millimetre wave (mmWave)-based intra-vehicular communications promise large bandwidth and can achieve ultra-high data rates with lower latency, exploiting the advantages of mmWave communications largely relies on adequately characterising the propagation channel. Channel characterisation is most accurately done through an extensive channel sounding, but due to hardware and environmental constraints, it is impractical to test channel conditions for all possible transmitter and receiver locations. Artificial neural network (ANN)-based channel sounding can overcome this impediment by learning and estimating the channel parameters from the channel environment. We estimate the power delay profile in intra-vehicular public and private vehicle scenarios with a high accuracy using a simple feedforward multi-layer perception-based ANN model. Such artificially generated models can help extrapolate other relevant scenarios for which measurement data are unavailable. The proposed model efficiently matches the taped delay line samples obtained from real-world data, as shown by goodness-of-fit parameters and confusion matrices."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614168","journalIssue":{"objectId":"648828e54097072fd76a81bf","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2023","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"404f354a-9263-4cef-b386-a3396cfa0e43"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2023","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s13638-023-02257-0.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"648828e54097072fd76a81c4","name":"Ales","lastName":"Prokes","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"45899285-c743-450a-8c3e-f6f1fc1d4a1a"},{"objectId":"648828e54097072fd76a81c3","name":"Tomas","lastName":"Mikulasek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c8d7c126-68f8-4c02-93d7-b94f7779725c"},{"objectId":"648828e54097072fd76a81c2","name":"Aniruddha","lastName":"Chandra","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f61a3169-69ed-4d41-8d9d-aed87548bf82"},{"objectId":"648828e54097072fd76a81c1","name":"Abhishek Narayan","lastName":"Sarkar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"925d9c49-d895-4906-a649-b9b57c59ea89"},{"objectId":"648828e54097072fd76a81c0","name":"Rajeev","lastName":"Shukla","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"265cebfe-2d37-4ff2-8472-457cfa01203d"},{"objectId":"5e7092a2878c28a047399b32","name":"Cezary","lastName":"Ziółkowski","uuid":"279D85D2236CCE8BF7F3C669A99C1B427E6E687B1A5A9A6B7C446A06067931CFB151654FD38AD0C5C80CB7462479E1349BE0ED6280A42D6CECD15F90F7EC5566","orcidId":"0000-0003-0750-0705","documentHash":"0d7398bb-f6e3-44d6-b6d3-79d7883e03e0"},{"objectId":"5e7092a2878c28a047399ae7","name":"Jan","lastName":"Kelner","uuid":"376EF81A97B0DF2384385EB86745EAE8ABB183C467CA486060558F7F01FC7D9521E0C2B8F5AE20A87EF63390BC271412E3163FA946B3C55AE041EAC87BDECC54","orcidId":"0000-0002-3902-0784","documentHash":"c42c4cba-44a4-41f2-adeb-c3abf7de0b81"}],"doi":"10.1186/s13638-023-02257-0"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Przegląd wybranych portali mapowych prezentujących szlaki rowerowe","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d51878c285145479c81","mniswId":"1000576","title":"Badania Fizjograficzne Seria A - Geografia Fizyczna","doi":null,"issn":"2081-6014","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"8d598baa-b9c3-4583-9365-731a9476886a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"658d6f484097076c14582f38","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["658d6f484097076c14582f39","5e709310878c28a0473a23a9"]},"issue":"73","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060614170","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"R.XIII","pagesFromTo":"1-23","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://researchportal.amu.edu.pl/info/article/UAM9cf7af63d0934392a33b5f7238efb1c6/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"658d6f484097076c14582f39","name":"Adam","lastName":"Chudziński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6fef2f45-16d3-451e-98fc-5a09bd33e444"},{"objectId":"5e709310878c28a0473a23a9","name":"Radzym","lastName":"Ławniczak","uuid":"CCD85A8DC14A2BBBB5BA0A6ED89559BE72ED26910DA9440F466C5B13BC984566E15D86CEB16D0DA64248F811A8E62F7DCB9A448945344EA41A443EF4ED7CA2E3","orcidId":"0000-0002-0119-6661","documentHash":"ec7526e0-940c-40f5-b829-707da68c01e5"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6602c0be40970762632539f3","doi":null,"title":"Promocja, edukacja zdrowotna oraz profilaktyka w naukach medycznych.

The study was conducted among randomly selected 124 respondents in beekeeping throughout the country. Most answered questions on behalf of beekeeping groups or associations, indicating how many members they had. Based on these data, it was determined that the interview results were representative of 2226 respondents. Assumptions for the business model were developed using the Business Model Canvas methodology about: customer segmentation, value proposition, channels, customer relationships, revenue structure,key activities, key resources, key partners, cost structure.\r\nFindings: A business model was developed based on which the commercialization of the WAXO device should be carried out.\r\nPractical implications: The conducted research allowed for the formulation of conclusions along with the presentation of operational initiatives necessary to introduce the device to the market and further commercialize it.\r\nSocial implications: The invention of a beeswax quality analyzer protects bee colonies and the natural environment by changing the awareness of the beekeeping community and taking steps to change the applicable legislation. The presented recommendations support the university\r\nauthorities in making decisions regarding the commercialization strategy of WAXO and the selection of operational solutions necessary to introduce it to the market, production, sales, and customer service.\r\nOriginality/value: The subject of the invention is a portable electromechanical device allowing the analysis of beeswax for the presence of added impurities."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614177","journalIssue":{"objectId":"669dfa57fdbe83768620323a","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"198","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"757315a6-37a7-4e31-baba-00594818bf59"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"9-26","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://managementpapers.polsl.pl/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/198-Bednarzewska.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092a9878c28a04739a29f","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Bednarzewska","uuid":"E34AF18F1A782661CA0BE1DB99E7FA6060106B99622A9B3B2DFA6C0C8100828DA90F474D946C875832305C80F7236BB7F628FC29A4692ED13D41D3CB94DE8FEB","orcidId":"0000-0002-5786-928X","documentHash":"d287c162-e802-40b6-914b-d9657bb8f425"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Betula nana","dendroclimatology","shrub rings","serial sectioning","shrub parts","northern Alaska","temperature","PDO index","AO index","sea ice extent."]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"From Intra-plant to Regional Scale: June Temperatures and Regional Climates Directly and Indirectly Control Betula nana Growth in Arctic Alaska","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477a2e","mniswId":"5408","title":"Ecosystems","doi":null,"issn":"1432-9840","eissn":"1435-0629","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"de38e993-9b33-4dc3-a2dc-bef6ce44a965"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65818dd24097076c14b79672","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709310878c28a0473a23d2","65818dd24097076c14b79673","65818dd24097076c14b79674","65818dd24097076c14b79675"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Tundra shrubs reflect climate sensitivities in their growth-ring widths, yet tissue-specific shrub chronologies are poorly studied. Further, the relative importance of regional climate patterns that exert mesoscale precipitation and temperature influences on tundra shrub growth has been explored in only a few Arctic locations. Here, we investigate Betula nana growth-ring chronologies from adjacent dry heath and moist tussock tundra habitats in arctic Alaska in relation to local and regional climate. Mean shrub and five tissue-specific ring width chronologies were analyzed using serial sectioning of above- and below-ground shrub organs, resulting in 30 shrubs per site with 161 and 104 cross sections from dry and moist tundra, respectively. Betula nana growth-ring widths in both habitats were primarily related to June air temperature (1989–2014). The strongest relationships with air temperature were found for ‘Branch2’ chronologies (dry site: r = 0.78, June 16, DOY = 167; moist site: r = 0.75, June 9, DOY = 160). Additionally, below-ground chronologies (‘Root’ and ‘Root2’) from the moist site were positively correlated with daily mean air temperatures in the previous late-June (‘Root2’ chronology: r = 0.57, pDOY = 173). Most tissue-specific chronologies exhibited the strongest correlations with daily mean air temperature during the period between 8 and 20 June. Structural equation modeling indicated that shrub growth is indirectly linked to regional Arctic and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (AO and PDO) climate indices through their relation to summer sea ice extent and air temperature. Strong dependence of Betula nana growth on early growing season temperature indicates a highly coordinated allocation of resources to tissue growth, which might increase its competitive advantage over other shrub species under a rapidly changing Arctic climate."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614180","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65818dd24097076c14b79675","name":"Jeffrey M.","lastName":"Welker","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"66a93fb6-7844-48ed-91e0-3bd1baa55295"},{"objectId":"65818dd24097076c14b79674","name":"Hannah","lastName":"Bailey","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d882a04b-1471-43b3-a083-1ad9f521ded7"},{"objectId":"65818dd24097076c14b79673","name":"M.

ice phenomena in river systems is of great importance because these phenomena are a fundamental part of the hydrological regime. Due to the stochasticity of ice phenomena, their prediction is a difficult process, especially when data sets are sparse or incomplete. In this study, two machine learning models—Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)—were developed to predict ice phenomena in the Warta River in Poland in a temperate climate zone. Observational data from eight river gauges during the period 1983–2013 were used. The performance of the model was evaluated using four model fit measures. The results showed that the choice of input variables influenced the accuracy of the developed models. The most important predictors were the nature of phenomena on the day before an observation, as well as water and air temperatures; river flow and water level were less important for predicting the formation of ice phenomena. The modeling results showed that both MLPNN and XGBoost provided promising results for the prediction of ice phenomena. The research results of the present study could also be useful for predicting ice phenomena in other regions.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614192","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-29","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65818ee64097076c14b79e7a","name":"Senlin","lastName":"Zhu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c000e959-59a4-493a-8db9-dd9bfb8f4ee3"},{"objectId":"65818ee64097076c14b79e79","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kolerski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7c7fc482-926f-4f12-96f3-0675d4f1753c"},{"objectId":"5e709310878c28a0473a23b2","name":"Renata","lastName":"Graf","uuid":"F5AD278ACD5AD2D586A4A9E3E82900007D56967284F84EBA3337622875AFF0A16F1842187B65AC2F0507F52659F76F407EC4B05D90F053CFDDD13121647D06A5","orcidId":"0000-0003-1518-4773","documentHash":"21c3dd14-22e1-4304-8757-07a89412f773"}],"doi":"10.3390/resources11020012"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["germination","Lepidium test","sodium nitroprusside","hydrogen peroxide","multiplication","metallophytes"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091fc878c28a04738e222"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"In Vitro Propagation of Alyssum Species with Different Metal Accumulation Strategies","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547e776","mniswId":"25607","title":"Plants","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2223-7747","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9b5e2d0-7e4e-4b87-9cc1-37b3d46db596"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-11-06","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67ab4473fdbe8362a573caca","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67ab4473fdbe8362a573cacb","5e7091fc878c28a04738e222","67ab4473fdbe8362a573cacc","67ab4473fdbe8362a573cacd","67ab4473fdbe8362a573cace","67ab4473fdbe8362a573cacf"]},"issue":"22","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Alyssum genus, with its many metal-adapted species, is a good candidate for research on phytoremediation and metal tolerance mechanisms. These goals can be supported by elaborating on an in vitro multiplication protocol. Our study aimed to determine the aseptic conditions for the growth and effective propagation of Alyssum murale, A. alyssoides, and A. montanum, each exhibiting different adaptation strategies to nickel ions. Firstly, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were investigated in the biological Lepidium test to find their optimal concentrations that could improve the germination attributes of tested Alyssum species. The concentration of 0.5 mM H2O2 or SNP was selected for research on Alyssum seeds, which were the initial material to start in vitro cultivation. Regardless of the species, H2O2 harmed germination percentage; however, its application accelerated radicle emergence, especially in metal-sensitive genotypes, while in both metal-tolerant ones, the germination time of H2O2-treated seeds was similar to that of treated with SNP. These findings provide a novel insight into the effect of H2O2 or SNP on seeds, contributing to a better understanding of their role in the germination of different genotypes. Among tested media compositions, the synchronous plant regeneration of all species was achieved on MS medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/L 2iP and 0.1 mg/L IAA, making an essential advancement in the in

efficiency of road freight transport determines—to a significant degree—the total environmental footprint and the amount of greenhouse gases and other pollutants released into the atmosphere by inland transport. The rate of empty or partially empty vehicles is one of the key metrics for improvement of the environmental performance of freight road transportation. This paper presents the characteristics of road freight transport in Poland on the basis of data collected by weigh-in-motion stations. Data aggregation for environmental analysis represents a novel aspect of the work. Indicators describing the degree of loading, the share of empty vehicles in traffic, and the share of vehicles of maximum permissible total weight in traffic were determined for a representative group of heavy goods vehicles. Based on the representative load factor value (LFA), a classification of the road section into four groups was proposed. The results obtained show a clear differentiation of the values of the indicators analyzed for individual groups and their variability in the three-year period covered by the analysis. The aggregation method presented can be used to identify the nature of the distribution of the weight categories of the heavy goods vehicles and provide input information for targeted analyses relating to sustainable road transport management and environmental protection. Finally, the grouped LFA values were linked with indicators of energy consumption (ECI) and on-road emissions (EI)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614199","journalIssue":{"objectId":"671a0f6cfdbe834b041c302c","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"16","number":"21","doi":null,"documentHash":"f3ab1003-9b4c-4330-b311-3da989b2b1e9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"art.  no. 9364, 1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/21/9364","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093eb878c28a0473b34e1","name":"Artur","lastName":"Ryguła","uuid":"00A1567CB73D5255A670CF952FE7DFE8236EAB729F167D1E9E16932DE6B9A88D40E96179E8D370527BA75B6BF0C88070FE8F7775B2E1B5CBCE8687F24DFE1479","orcidId":"0000-0002-7215-6843","documentHash":"e04f2d15-ba3c-47d9-aa2a-bf8ab04762c3"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e355","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Brzozowski","uuid":"6EE8C3B28DE74617BD432D46EBED038D07201CB11CDD50F376095725E3F891A431A2A6C157D55F34DACCC78F34DF5C90215ABB1773066F4A05DD5D72E5D7E8A8","orcidId":"0000-0003-0973-1734","documentHash":"bc98f25f-aec2-4cd6-b4c6-02fdd116834e"}],"doi":"10.3390/su16219364"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["PPP","LSTM","GNSS tomography","Machine learning","Ray-tracing","Tropospheric delay"]}],"year":2025,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709276878c28a047396118","67ab3804fdbe8362a5733c9b","67ab3804fdbe8362a5733c9c","5e709271878c28a047395cab"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Machine learning-based tropospheric delay prediction for real-time precise point positioning under extreme weather conditions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477e6a","mniswId":"7309","title":"GPS Solutions","doi":null,"issn":"1080-5370","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e20d137e-3368-46c0-bd03-f1e42613709a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-12-09","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67ab3804fdbe8362a5733c9a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67ab3804fdbe8362a5733c9b","5e709271878c28a047395cab","5e709276878c28a047396118","67ab3804fdbe8362a5733c9c"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Satellite signals from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) are refracted as they pass through the troposphere, owing to the variable density and composition of the atmosphere, causing tropospheric delay. Typically, tropospheric delay is treated as an unknown parameter in GNSS data processing. Given the growing need for real-time GNSS applications, accurate tropospheric delay predictions are crucial to improve Precise Point Positioning (PPP). In this paper, time-series of tomography data are used for wet refractivity prediction employing Machine Learning (ML) techniques in both Poland and California, under extreme weather conditions including sweeping rain bands and storms. The predicted wet refractivity is implemented for tropospheric delay determination through ray-tracing technique. PPP processing is conducted in both static and kinematic modes using different setups. These are: (1) common PPP, called Com-PPP, (2) Ray-PPP, which applies obtained tropospheric delay on GNSS observations and thus eliminates tropospheric parameters from unknowns, and (3) Dif-PPP, which applies the difference of estimated tropospheric delay from ray-tracing and GNSS measurements to compensate for the remaining tropospheric delay in the observations. The results show that Dif-PPP reduces the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the Three-Dimensional (3-D) component between 8 and 33% in static mode compared to the Com-PPP method. Additionally, it can improve the convergence time of the up component in the kinematic mode by between 6 and 17%."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614206","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10291-024-01782-9","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab3804fdbe8362a5733c9c","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Bosy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c71404a3-35fd-4e73-843d-bb96683d7071"},{"objectId":"67ab3804fdbe8362a5733c9b","name":"Saeid","lastName":"Haji‑Aghajany","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b72d1261-7bf0-4fef-965e-25c041e68b90"},{"objectId":"5e709276878c28a047396118","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Hadaś","uuid":"4A99594710E9040CA242D65D081A1CFAB1E0450124D124C455F0CE852629B587EFE6D179ED578B652D2E6C871CD592B7D5FAF9713E0C7FBBB3B255D494DF8FEE","orcidId":"0000-0002-4409-5078","documentHash":"4a46da2e-e663-4087-b2cc-c266df617599"},{"objectId":"5e709271878c28a047395cab","name":"Witold","lastName":"Rohm","uuid":"190E4C660B8469B59BC59809E652CDBF7824CD50F7F493D11ADC0C9266AB8B0B404BEF2E9D17C4FF0CC57BF39AE4CC54C400DE81A6FD5FEF8A5764382BB6F98B","orcidId":"0000-0002-2082-6366","documentHash":"2b859ef5-36b3-4db6-ae64-2bc241c5656e"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10291-024-01782-9"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["water resources;","lake disappearance;","historical maps"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","uid":"bSd2phOsq9LEVExWUht3uGQ","uuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","parentUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3a","rootUuid":"154a0276-f7ef-42a3-a8d6-752e46ffd139","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a6437"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A Century of Changes in the Surface Area of Lakes in West Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547d0b9","mniswId":"17279","title":"Resources","doi":null,"issn":"2079-9276","eissn":"2079-9276","websiteLink":"https://www.mdpi.com/journal/resources","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"cf6b78df-466a-4135-a696-6776273bc71e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-19","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"650c0294409707102d698931","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["650c0294409707102d698933","650c0294409707102d698934","650c0294409707102d698935","650c0294409707102d698936","5e709347878c28a0473a6437"]},"issue":"9","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Lakes are an important element of the hydrosphere that contribute to the stabilisation of water circulation by providing biodiversity conditions or supporting the development of different branches of the economy. All these properties depend on the longevity of lakes in the environment and the processes related to their evolution. Based on archival morphometric data from historical maps and modern cartographic studies, this paper presents an analysis of changes in their surface area over a period of 100 years. Among 169 lakes, a decrease in surface area was recorded in 156 cases (including the complete disappearance of two lakes); no change was observed in four lakes; and seven lakes increased their surface area. The total surface area of all the lakes has decreased by 11.4% in comparison with the initial state in the early 20th century. The highest rate of decline concerned the shallowest lakes with a maximum depth of up to 5.0 m and lakes with the smallest surface area of up to 20 ha, averaging 24.1% and 22.2%, respectively. The spatial distribution of changes in the surface area of lakes is variable, and at a larger scale it presents no similarities. This suggests that factors determining the rate and direction of changes in the surface area of lakes depend on their individual features and local conditions, which is in accordance with similar studies from the territory of Poland. The obtained results reveal the scale of the changes in the surface area of the lakes, potentially providing important information for authorities in charge of water management in the context of activities aimed at slowing down the disappearance of these valuable ecosystems."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614208","journalIssue":{"objectId":"650c0294409707102d698932","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"9","doi":null,"documentHash":"d7a259d9-b29b-47c7-a228-d1c938e1ee4d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"110","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9276/12/9/110/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"650c0294409707102d698936","name":"Senlin","lastName":"Zhu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"58c1ca1f-32a9-47e3-a20f-cf2078d23b00"},{"objectId":"650c0294409707102d698935","name":"Salim","lastName":"Heddam","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bece1e6d-aa74-4d75-85c3-2188f50767b7"},{"objectId":"650c0294409707102d698934","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Szyga-Pluta","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2c4e250f-3f92-4697-afa4-2ef964c63af6"},{"objectId":"650c0294409707102d698933","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Ptak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f0b8357d-0c45-4fd2-aced-f7902bbd6a1b"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a6437","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Sojka","uuid":"073495857CF13E01195275681F67A79A3968A817DA229A3E551674CE4B5A13D63A1A529AD939BD49C64AE9D95F29F2363CE487F71459B13C87BFD3F26B2FBFDC","orcidId":"0000-0002-1453-0374","documentHash":"61520225-d1dc-4fbb-99c7-30e50a32e15c"}],"doi":"10.3390/resources12090110"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Orthoptera,","bioacoustics,","stridulation,","morphology,","Africa,","titillator,","chromosomes"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec5","uid":"bi0054EFyZHNUwKK3x5HmqA","uuid":"8cc45ab7-e9f8-4e3b-ac7b-5dd9a6fe481d","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec5","parentUuid":"8cc45ab7-e9f8-4e3b-ac7b-5dd9a6fe481d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dec5","rootUuid":"8cc45ab7-e9f8-4e3b-ac7b-5dd9a6fe481d","name":"Instytut Systematyki i Ewolucji Zwierząt Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f9878c28a0473b4444"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Review of song patterns and sound production in armoured ground crickets (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae: Hetrodini) with karyological data and taxonomic notes","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479b53","mniswId":"20563","title":"ZOOTAXA","doi":"","issn":"1175-5326","eissn":"1175-5334","websiteLink":"https://www.mapress.com/j/zt/","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"2c28747b-b4e9-43f8-8d93-ec866023bf4c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67ab4534fdbe837dc75ed732","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67ab4534fdbe837dc75ed734","67ab4534fdbe837dc75ed735","5e7093f9878c28a0473b4444","67ab4534fdbe837dc75ed736"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the mate finding system of bush-crickets, acoustical signals play a central role. Here we review and describe the bioacoustics of Hetrodini, a morphologically uniform group of Tettigonioidea with a distribution centered in Africa. The male calling songs are produced by tegmino-tegminal stridulation. In all species, these fore wings are completely covered by the pronotum (invisible in intact specimens) and lack the glossy mirror cells which are well-known from many other singing Ensifera. Concerning spectral composition, the broad frequency peak and the parts with the most energy lie in the high audio or low ultrasonic range. In amplitude modulation, the songs are relatively simply structured and contain only one type of syllables each. These syllables consist of heavily dampened impulses (non-resonant song) and are arranged in long series of echemes (chirps) or trills. As far as it is known, syntopic species differ in syllable and/or echeme repetition rates. In contrast to the uniform morphology, the karyotypes are surprisingly diverse with chromosome numbers ranging from 2n = 29 to 17 and one of two sex determination systems: X0 and neo-XY. In our opinion, taxonomically the group is at the moment at best considered as a tribe incertae sedis (without subfamily classification) within Tettigoniidae (not Tettigoniinae sensu OSF)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614210","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67ab4534fdbe837dc75ed733","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"5120","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"3cae215d-8d5f-4bd4-81c3-15a7804bfa01"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"5120","pagesFromTo":"451-481","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.11646/zootaxa.5120.4.1","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab4534fdbe837dc75ed736","name":"CLAUDIA","lastName":"HEMP","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ba784986-e0df-4e28-be20-42830d138d81"},{"objectId":"67ab4534fdbe837dc75ed735","name":"DRAGAN","lastName":"CHOBANOV","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d826f006-1706-444d-8a20-1da450c44967"},{"objectId":"67ab4534fdbe837dc75ed734","name":"KLAUS-GERHARD","lastName":"HELLER","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2cad1169-06d1-458a-9c7a-03c125ccaf3e"},{"objectId":"5e7093f9878c28a0473b4444","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Warchałowska-Śliwa","uuid":"9D75694330D78BE6703E66784016BE05348E4A6CDC64C889584BE588693ABFC3F8BFEDCA3238577CECAF783E2D9DB204B09AD9387FFA65AC6669B484DC6F9195","orcidId":"0000-0001-7812-1644","documentHash":"854b0040-a388-4597-8dbc-4d9e9e3e2d50"}],"doi":"10.11646/zootaxa.5120.4.1"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["konie","złamanie kręgów szyjnych","THO","ataksja","urazy odcinka szyjnego kręgosłupa"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ataxia","cervical vertebral fracture","cervical vertebrae injury","THO","equine"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67ab4afbfdbe8362a57625d5","67ab4afbfdbe8362a57625d3","5e709210878c28a04738f607"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Zaburzenia neurologiczne u koni będące wynikiem urazu - przypadki kliniczne","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"64f04bf6cf9a7471b0ea406f","mniswId":"201647","title":"Weterynaria w Terenie","doi":null,"issn":"1896-7655","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"MINISTRY","editor":null,"documentHash":"a3cb1a3e-98f9-4635-8116-e5516e890294"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67ab4afbfdbe8362a57625d0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67ab4afbfdbe8362a57625d1","67ab4afbfdbe8362a57625d2","67ab4afbfdbe8362a57625d3","67ab4afbfdbe8362a57625d4","67ab4afbfdbe8362a57625d5","5e709210878c28a04738f607"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Urazy w obrębie rdzenia kręgowego i patologie stawu skroniowo-gnykowego oraz samej kości gnykowej są coraz częściej stwierdzane u koni, co wiąże się z częstszym inwestowaniem w diagnostykę wymienionych okolic wśród właścicieli zwierząt przy prezentowaniu przez nie objawów neurologicznych.

The present study, based on direct multistep-ahead forecasting with multiple time series specific to the XGBoost algorithm, estimates the long-term changes and forecast monthly flows of selected rivers in Ukraine. In a new, applied approach, a single multioutput model was proposed that forecasts over both short- and long-term horizons using grouped or hierarchical data series. Three forecast stages were considered: using train and test subsets, using a model with train-test data, and training with all data. The historical period included the measurements of the monthly flows, precipitation, and air temperature in the period 1961–2020. The forecast horizons of 12, 60, and 120 months into the future were selected for this dataset, i.e., December 2021, December 2025, and December 2030. The research was conducted for diverse hydrological systems: the Prut, a mountain river; the Styr, an upland river; and the Sula, a lowland river in relation to the variability and forecasts of precipitation and air temperature. The results of the analyses showed a varying degree of sensitivity among rivers to changes in precipitation and air temperature and different projections for future time horizons of 12, 60, and 120 months. For all studied rivers, variable dynamics of flow was observed in the years 1961–2020, yet with a clearly marked decrease in monthly flows during in the final, 2010–2020 decade. The last decade of low flows on the Prut and Styr rivers was preceded by their noticeable increase in the earlier decade (2000–2010). In the case of the Sula River, a continuous decrease in monthly flows has been observed since the end of the 1990s, with a global minimum in the decade 2010–2020. Two patterns were obtained in the forecasts: a decrease in flow for the rivers Prut (6%) and the Styr (12–14%), accompanied by a decrease in precipitation and an increase in air temperature until 2030, and for the Sula River, an increase in flow (16–23%), with a slight increase in precipitation and an increase in air temperature. The predicted changes in the flows of the Prut, the Styr, and the Sula rivers correspond to forecasts in other regions of Ukraine and Europe. The performance of the models over a variety of available datasets over time was assessed and hyperparameters, which minimize the forecast error over the relevant forecast horizons, were selected. The obtained RMSE parameter values indicate high variability in hydrological and meteorological data in the catchment areas and not very good fit of retrospective data regardless of the selected horizon length. The advantages of this model, which was used in the work for forecasting monthly river flows in Ukraine, include modelling multiple time series simultaneously with a single model, the simplicity of the modelling, potentially more-robust results because of pooling data across time series, and solving the “cold start” problem when few data points were available for a given time series. The model, because of its universality, can be used in forecasting hydrological and meteorological parameters in other catchments, irrespective of their geographic location.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614223","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-24","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65818df84097076c14b79719","name":"Viktor","lastName":"Vyshnevskyi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"24265194-4815-4ea5-9935-50af710021e4"},{"objectId":"5e709310878c28a0473a23b2","name":"Renata","lastName":"Graf","uuid":"F5AD278ACD5AD2D586A4A9E3E82900007D56967284F84EBA3337622875AFF0A16F1842187B65AC2F0507F52659F76F407EC4B05D90F053CFDDD13121647D06A5","orcidId":"0000-0003-1518-4773","documentHash":"21c3dd14-22e1-4304-8757-07a89412f773"}],"doi":"10.3390/resources11120111"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6569cf0e40970749a8d7fa9b","doi":null,"title":"Patogeneza i terapie chorób nowotworowych","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-67104-25-8","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://ppm.umb.edu.pl/info/book/UMBd321e0f3dea347abb4ab09d53c824026/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"947dbfc7-2a1f-4ec7-8ef2-90aa03102536","publisher":{"objectId":"61decfcf2467f0772e5cde43","mniswId":null,"name":"Wydawnictwo Naukowe TYGIEL sp. z o.o.","documentHash":"04b092fe-d453-4448-ab2b-44ffa789bd42"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4e","uid":"bm3qIJZlNw1U92UVKrOsP_w","uuid":"7f12f268-786f-4504-9a3a-44afff1ba65c","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4e","parentUuid":"7f12f268-786f-4504-9a3a-44afff1ba65c","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4e","rootUuid":"7f12f268-786f-4504-9a3a-44afff1ba65c","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Białymstoku","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67ab4407fdbe8362a5738686","5e709377878c28a0473aa521","6711c828ece3983997134c1b"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Czerniak widoczny jak na dłoni?

The study period covers 70 years (1951–2020). The research identified an abrupt and significant change in the climate of Greater Poland, which started between 1987 and 1989, concerning not only air temperature but also a wider spectrum of climatic elements. The change in the state of the climate, which covers the entire Atlantic-Eurasian circulation sector, re-sults from a sudden change in the macro-circulation conditions in the middle troposphere (500 hPa). The reason for the change in the mid-tropospheric circulation is an equally abrupt and simultaneous change in the intensity of the ocean heat transport by the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation (NA THC). Climate change observed in Greater Poland is manifested in an increase in sunshine duration (SD) and air temperature, a decrease in relative humidity, a change in the cloud structure, and an increase in the degree of sky coverage. The main, physical reason for an increase in air tempera-ture is a rapid and strong increase in SD in the warm half-years, which began after 1988, and a significant increase in the frequency of positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) phases in winters. The ongoing climate change entails various effects, among which the most important is considered to be hydrological consequences. The water balance of Greater Poland is becoming increasingly unfavourable, mainly as a result of a rapid increase in field evaporation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614228","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"41","pagesFromTo":"183–206","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://qg.web.amu.edu.pl/archives/year-2022-volume-41/#issue3","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65a130394097076c1450dd59","name":"Anna","lastName":"Styszyńska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"064513ca-2dbf-4dcc-99a8-3dff415b420f"},{"objectId":"65a130394097076c1450dd58","name":"Andrzej A.","lastName":"Marsz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"12fd7a1c-d892-4f57-a843-f885206980eb"},{"objectId":"5e709310878c28a0473a23b4","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Wrzesiński","uuid":"AAD76FCE690E187C0D0D508F26E6533DDBA67D049B6D6D37C685628EA13CEA58400ADB556FE63DFB2ECC2BFC8FF7645CD6CF907DA11603E7FBE550332764926A","orcidId":"0000-0001-5025-1447","documentHash":"c6823c91-d063-4e52-9910-de38f3b5dbd2"},{"objectId":"5e709310878c28a0473a2377","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Sobkowiak","uuid":"73525F27D7A5FC90A04796B6CE8CB7385E6AEC6801204F04BC71EB2B9BD89C16B8C7E5F3406CEE4486AF27F0E84796B5C2FD788F306BB259E8F768D692933C3D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7921-1454","documentHash":"f75a3d7c-33d2-4d72-86e0-7ebc6b815ec2"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1c3","uid":"bq_xQN8TIwb_G48D9ae-rfg","uuid":"44cbe16c-3cde-4b4b-9c64-ad6da30ce36d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Instytut Fizyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092e6878c28a04739ee74","5e7093ce878c28a0473b1205","635b3eab7523405a7dcc45b6"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The influence of molecular shape on reorientation dynamics of sizable glass-forming isomers at ambient and elevated pressure","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":"","issn":"2045-2322","eissn":"2045-2322","websiteLink":"","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"c081063e-cfb2-4a54-ba01-2dc365eba2cf"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67b88adbfdbe83514c8731db","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["635b3eab7523405a7dcc45b6","5e7093ce878c28a0473b1205","5e7092e6878c28a04739ee74"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We used dielectric spectroscopy to access the molecular dynamics of three isomers with a structure based on a sizable, partially rigid, and non-polar core connected to a polar phenylene unit differing in the position of the polar group, and, consequently, the direction and magnitude of the dipole moment to address the question how unique molecular properties, in particular large size and elongated shape, affect the dynamics. The position of the polar group differentiates the molecular shape and isomer’s anisotropy and leads to different thermal and dynamic properties of the isomers. The shape of permittivity loss spectra was governed by magnitudes of the longitudinal and transverse components of dipole moment to a large extent. For para isomer with negligible traverse component of dipole moment, the narrowest loss peak was found while for meta isomer, the bimodal loss peak was observed at high temperatures. Its shape evolved on cooling limiting the possibility of individual mode separation near glass transition where the dynamics were more cooperative. High-pressure dielectric studies showed that sizable isomers were characterized by the pronounced sensitivity of glass transition temperature, Tg, to compression. Observed high activation volumes, such as 735 cm3/mol at Tg for para isomer, were found to correlate with the length scale of dynamic cooperativity. The number of dynamically correlated molecules depended on molecular shape and varied among isomers while the determined values were much smaller than that reported for other glass-forming liquids. We discussed here the obtained results in the context of the specific properties of the systems studied showing the overriding role of anisotropy."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614230","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6597d34e40970755be5e2b9e","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"7b2bf3c4-186e-4bd9-8908-044ad024e285"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-50894-8.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"635b3eab7523405a7dcc45b6","name":"Alfred","lastName":"Błażytko","uuid":"48BC5047DFE45D57DCC44450778D9EED12094B7B6F4B78B5D0CA1B4D1BEC5F05802FE1941A69FB393B252EC7045A11819AE977054E7AA0FE1C29D62F190EEECA","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f39ec6d7-b967-49d0-b632-2b8a537a4d7f"},{"objectId":"5e7093ce878c28a0473b1205","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Rams-Baron","uuid":"8B8E65B3C61945EF9225215C81FEC92546B5BA329D88B0CC4E3F4C4C656046BC523538721F0557DC09DA2BEFAB5B2455A29CABEF2FE32A0B8C32950C96656B55","orcidId":"0000-0001-8808-8067","documentHash":"ed70e153-e072-4cb6-b3b5-bdecea79acdd"},{"objectId":"5e7092e6878c28a04739ee74","name":"Marian","lastName":"Paluch","uuid":"19580B9385E748744EA3F1E457A85562D93ED34D457921146A553492871FBD597B4E5AC7E6574678167B12D0ED974D65FE4CA1FF4464F1CA2EF22A9ABC60BC0D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7280-8557","documentHash":"d6cf3f05-c9e8-49c2-8096-455a8dfc36de"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-023-50894-8"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","uid":"bjr1x2XPV3xi_POMC7VegNQ","uuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","parentUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb6","rootUuid":"80b1a3cb-dd5a-4ae4-8b16-78d0a76efd1d","name":"Instytut Nauk Ekonomicznych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70938d878c28a0473ac83d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Decline in Rent Sharing","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454787f9","mniswId":"11607","title":"JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS","doi":null,"issn":"0734-306X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"baf51813-1351-4b87-85bc-f419ad888f0f"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67ab5cb1fdbe837dc762a3fe","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67ab5cb1fdbe837dc762a400","5e70938d878c28a0473ac83d","67ab5cb1fdbe837dc762a401"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The evolution of rent sharing is studied.

The evidence of decline is robust, corroborated with alternative instruments and industry-level analysis for the United States and the European Union."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614231","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67ab5cb1fdbe837dc762a3ff","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"42","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"84acf54e-2301-4814-9369-fbb4432b1771"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"42","pagesFromTo":"683-716","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/724570","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab5cb1fdbe837dc762a401","name":"Stephen","lastName":"Machin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3640aca8-8864-44db-8e21-5042ff0211c3"},{"objectId":"67ab5cb1fdbe837dc762a400","name":"Brian","lastName":"Bell","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"62dc920e-edca-4762-a1dd-2e995474aa58"},{"objectId":"5e70938d878c28a0473ac83d","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Bukowski","uuid":"5FE3B8E3931BF260E31BE9603A7661728AFBD619DC7C61C62CE8F6A37A8A6AC4ACE9FEBABD0C4C4D3920D8DBA435739D83F7909CC76F900E6CEC916A9039382A","orcidId":"0000-0003-3795-6308","documentHash":"6a02446e-89df-4eba-b0dd-c5272610917f"}],"doi":"10.1086/724570"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["struktury klastrowe","dyspersja przestrzenna","koopetycja","innowacyjność","konkurencyjność","gospodarka morska"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cluster structures","spatial dispersion","coopetition","innovation","competitiveness","maritime economy"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709228878c28a047390d2d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Socio-Spatial Aspects of Cluster Structures with Particular Emphasis on Maritime Economy","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a534","mniswId":"200399","title":"Studia Maritima","doi":null,"issn":"0137-3587","eissn":"2353-303X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"4c9371fd-c9fc-41c0-91fc-e1bf098f9d3c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2023-12-31","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65cf28364097075ea840a2f3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65cf28364097075ea840a2f5","5e709228878c28a047390d2d"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Podstawowym celem powyższego opracowania jest prezentacja kontekstów społeczno- -terytorialnych związanych z funkcjonowaniem struktur klastrowych.

Today park managers and researchers use many different devices and technologies that facilitate data collection. Among these often used devices is the pyroelectric sensor. Despite its high degree of usefulness, this type of sensor can miscalculate. Therefore, there is a need to assess the magnitude of errors and the circumstances in which they occur. The purpose of the study was to evaluate pyroelectric sensor counting errors in relation to different visitor flow levels and time intervals between visitors. The study was based on a field experiment and on-site observations using pyroelectric sensors, part of the Monitoring System of tourist traffic (MSTT) in Stołowe Mountains National Park in Poland. The outcome of the assessment was the errors sizes and types and calibration formula. Pyroelectric sensors more often overcount than undercount. Errors occur in larger than 6-visitor groups and time intervals between visitors shorter than 3 seconds. Finally, the analysis of the causes of errors gave the ground to generate the typology of error circumstances. The calibration formula was generated based on a field experiment and on-site observation. The average error size was reduced from ±13 % to ±6 %. The calibration formula provided in the study is simple and universal and can be applied to other data.

critical step in the analysis of whole genome sequencing data is variant calling. Despite its importance, variant calling is prone to errors. Our study investigated the association between incorrect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calls and variant quality metrics and nucleotide context. In our study, incorrect SNPs were defined in 20 Holstein–Friesian cows by comparing their SNPs genotypes identified by whole genome sequencing with the IlluminaNovaSeq6000 and the EuroGMD50K genotyping microarray. The dataset was divided into the correct SNP set (666 333 SNPs) and the incorrect SNP set (4 557 SNPs). The training dataset consisted of only the correct SNPs, while the test dataset contained a balanced mix of all the incorrectly and correctly called SNPs. An autoencoder was constructed to identify systematically incorrect SNPs that were marked as outliers by a one-class support vector machine and isolation forest algorithms. The results showed that 59.53% (±0.39%) of the incorrect SNPs had systematic patterns, with the remainder being random errors. The frequent occurrence of the CGC 3-mer was due to mislabelling a call for C. Incorrect T instead of A call was associated with the presence of T in the neighbouring downstream position.

To date, options to utilize sewage sludge are limited. Local regulations and sludge characteristics strictly determine waste management options. Thermal disposal methods are recommended for highly contaminated sludge. Pyrolyzed sewage sludge generates biochar that can be used as a value-added agricultural product or as an alternative fuel. The biochar production itself carries the risk of emitting harmful compounds. Unfortunately, these important safety considerations are rarely addressed in the literature. This research investigates the mechanistic effects of the storage headspace-to-biochar volume ratio and stored biochar headspace ventilation on hazardous gas emissions. Five hazardous organic compounds were emitted by biochar. However, based on this initial proof-of-the-concept research, we could not derive conclusive trends for the effects of the headspace-to-biochar volume ratio or air exchanges in the biochar headspace. Further research, which is broader in scope (feedstock type, pyrolysis conditions), should be carried out. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when designing biochar storage, aiming to lower the risk of occupational exposure to hazardous gas emissions. Monitoring air pollutants, tracking the highest permissible concentrations and workers’ exposure, and using personal protective equipment are recommended."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614240","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"17","pagesFromTo":"1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/17/1/58","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab3d03fdbe8362a573429e","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Białowiec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3fc23f59-67ec-4a5b-89a6-a8a45dbecc5b"},{"objectId":"67ab3d03fdbe8362a573429d","name":"Jacek A.","lastName":"Kozieł","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e6a7adce-8fc4-4910-872e-ae7209aaedee"},{"objectId":"67ab3d03fdbe8362a573429c","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Leśniak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ed594de2-ccc9-4b33-86cd-e690381f2201"},{"objectId":"602f75b79543c7410626f4e1","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Syguła","uuid":"B81842B1AF2C66BABBB18D5A4BF79FE8A67E9C54027C8DC84E4B4EAA90B526654E82A36961CF8A3EF5900368A9107712D7C3862746BF74AA0B732E494BF239ED","orcidId":"0000-0002-4284-6990","documentHash":"6c5b0b01-822e-48f8-bc80-625fd51b415e"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e1c1","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Bobak","uuid":"CC4D1667A2CB95C6FD1FEDB56BA3C0277A58C93BD7F681D4389DC60ABE0CB0330E89D428C98060A2F6AB7D71B53639C981C9C85C4B64D2FA673AD1F946BFE9BC","orcidId":"0000-0002-4332-7252","documentHash":"3eb7ea90-ed70-4a9d-8926-50ed9682ee04"}],"doi":"10.3390/w17010058"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["agriculture","inflation pressure","tire footprint","soil compaction","vertical load","agricultural tire"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67ab43e4fdbe8362a57378a2","602f3bab9543c7410626f237","5e709273878c28a047395e14","5e7091fc878c28a04738e2b9","5e709407878c28a0473b510c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Evaluation of the Changes in Dimensions of the Footprint of Agricultural Tires under Various Exploitation Conditions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-3417","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ff202409-59bf-494e-82ae-6802b8fb2444"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-06-17","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67ab43e4fdbe8362a57378a1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67ab43e4fdbe8362a57378a2","5e709407878c28a0473b510c","602f3bab9543c7410626f237","5e709273878c28a047395e14","5e7091fc878c28a04738e2b9"]},"issue":"12","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents an innovative method to determine the impact of agricultural wheels on soil. The experiment was conducted under controlled conditions, and the parameters of the tire footprints on the soil were analyzed. The tested parameters were the width, length, and depth of the footprint, the cross-section area of the tire, and the area of the footprint. All parameters were determined using the 3D scanning method. Two types of tires, two levels of vertical load, and three levels of inflation pressure were used. The aim of the research was to demonstrate differences in changes in the footprint parameters as a result of changes in the operational parameters of the tires. It was found the bias-ply tire was less responsive to changes in the width and length of the footprint than the radial tire. Moreover, it was shown that radial and bias-ply tires achieved similar values for the footprint area but in the case of bias-ply tires, there was a much greater footprint depth. This means that the side parts of the footprint of bias-ply tires have a more vertical profile, so they carry the vertical loads to a lesser extent."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614241","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/12/5228","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab43e4fdbe8362a57378a2","name":"Agata","lastName":"Małecka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"35edbb16-f210-4818-9796-b0b0a9e3fdff"},{"objectId":"602f3bab9543c7410626f237","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Ptak","uuid":"7BCC3F50F85C0EB31632B44F7822CAF89AD3FE6CF9B8765D6F7F5F5CD3666378475DA9F1C0D2FDABC3C0065458AA5E96F03AD6239048D7187F0BAE086E3CAABC","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"597d4111-162c-477c-8ea4-66d31500ad92"},{"objectId":"5e709407878c28a0473b510c","name":"Marek","lastName":"Brennensthul","uuid":"34CD89AA510ED9A7EF753A2906A856E533C0D17D0170156745752B8C1FDC2411BE43C0F480A2AEE394584C75FF96026396F9733A63C09DA115E7A136BB2FF3B0","orcidId":"0000-0003-4964-482X","documentHash":"48cb4bdd-c2ce-4e39-a1b4-eab944ccfb42"},{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395e14","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Czarnecki","uuid":"08C2A4755B5F7AAC902CCE04544F34F77F32A456546850FFA163DD79214A6155C58D24D7DCF649CB1C1032E12BB0F66BF0B79692463F500F27E26E75F089978D","orcidId":"0000-0001-7086-1525","documentHash":"8e90f8cf-dcdc-4451-9593-af4d9dcfd441"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e2b9","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Lejman","uuid":"0F148B143432B12E4C4D6B30370C0C455D138A9688EAC5AD5FA693B984912BD12C3C56AE59DB734AFBF99B6D71DAF4F889BEF3A7E497A7686B95679F684B0A5A","orcidId":"0000-0002-7223-6595","documentHash":"a0ae3900-f081-41b1-b634-ad482e99327e"}],"doi":"10.3390/app14125228"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"636501bb4097070e8729594d","doi":null,"title":"Interna Szczeklika 2022","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-7430-669-0","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://ppm.umb.edu.pl/info/book/UMBf7760de699434c0089e9d5f3ad803a08/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"8e6111c9-84de-423b-a0f3-22cc976e87bb","publisher":{"objectId":"5d36b4b9878c281b354a77ce","mniswId":"41500","name":"Medycyna Praktyczna","documentHash":"46f0e2b9-930a-4fd5-a042-094720a0fcf6"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4e","uid":"bm3qIJZlNw1U92UVKrOsP_w","uuid":"7f12f268-786f-4504-9a3a-44afff1ba65c","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4e","parentUuid":"7f12f268-786f-4504-9a3a-44afff1ba65c","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4e","rootUuid":"7f12f268-786f-4504-9a3a-44afff1ba65c","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny w Białymstoku","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709375878c28a0473aa1e9"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Choroby zakaźne.

The structural characterization of compounds was done through different techniques i.e., FTIR, <sup>1</sup>H NMR, a single and powder X-Ray diffraction. Moreover, fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime assessed their fluorescent properties in the solid state and various solvents. Derivatives with Cl or Br substituent in positions 2 and 4 are isostructural. 4-Cl, 4-Br and 3-Cl compounds exhibit fluorescence with moderate efficiency (quantum yield 0.11–0.26) in solid state due to specific arrangements, so-called π-stack brick stone with head-to-tail self-assembly. Other crystalline compounds (2-Cl, 2-Br and 3-Br) that exhibit negligible fluorescence quantum yield have crossed V-type arrangement. In the solution, the nonhalogenated compound shows the best fluorescence efficiency. In turn, the presence of halogen atoms results in fluorescence decreasing.

The physical modification of both SPI and WPI was monitored using SDS-PAGE, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), measuring interfacial tension, color, solubility, foam volume, foam stability, and, finally, the density and oil absorption of the produced cryogel. The findings revealed that the application of ultrasonic waves resulted in a significant reduction in the content of alpha-helical of SPI and WPI while the other treatments increased the content of random coil proteins. FTIR analysis further showed that ultrasonic and heat treatment led to a decrease in C-N tensile vibration within the range of 1200–1650 cm−1 in SPI. Meanwhile, in cold plasma treatment, an increase was observed which was confirmed by the elevation of enthalpy from 100 to 128 kJ/kg. Physical treatments significantly altered the surface properties of both SPI and WPI, where this value was reduced in SPI and increased in WPI. The cold plasma method demonstrated superior performance in enhancing the solubility of SPI from 10 to 58.2%, while the solubility of WPI decreased from 96.4 to 90.4%. By modifying the proteins, the foam volume and oil adsorption ability of the related cryogel improved, as shown by the maximum oil absorption obtained after ultrasonic treatment for SPI (11.6 g/g) and cold plasma (9.17 g/g) for WPI. These results could be useful in applying physical treatments to modify proteins and create the cryogel as an oleogel template for structuring liquid oil and producing innovative health value-added foods."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614250","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/29/22/5415","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab4742fdbe8362a575836c","name":"Mehdi","lastName":"Rahimmalek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"145ddba2-3cff-4992-98de-07446b46ae33"},{"objectId":"67ab4742fdbe8362a575836b","name":"Hajar","lastName":"Shekarchizadeh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"937a386d-840c-4d7d-ad5c-89d154827d54"},{"objectId":"67ab4742fdbe8362a575836a","name":"Sayed Amir Hossein","lastName":"Goli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5a5af480-87a4-46b6-bb4f-38da68542466"},{"objectId":"67ab4742fdbe8362a5758369","name":"﻿Mojtaba","lastName":"Saneei","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e8dc9bfa-7fc2-4d09-82f9-ac282fa18dbb"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e2a7","name":"Antoni","lastName":"Szumny","uuid":"AE28B651B632C894879C2606F003399974DB4F842D3C49CA1D5C8EB76BBAD0B5F2BCC1B7BA62F3E92848A2BD932035D823CDA1FF929B80C04EA5CC526CE6F2D5","orcidId":"0000-0001-9058-1598","documentHash":"8b015d67-9d2a-4720-a998-2fe34600ba49"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules29225415"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Rozpuszczalniki głęboko eutektyczne","Oddziaływania międzycząsteczkowe","Dapson","Rozpuszczalność","Uczenie maszynowe"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Deep eutectic solvents","Solubility","Machine learning","Dapsone","Intermolecular interactions"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","uid":"b_b7HPtUTCJYlxfss9Ssv-A","uuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","parentUuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1b","rootUuid":"3fa8a5bb-a2e7-455d-8a1e-1f71ed0d992a","name":"Uniwersytet Mikołaja Kopernika w Toruniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092c1878c28a04739c1b0","5e709204878c28a04738eafd","5e7092c4878c28a04739c403","5e7092dc878c28a04739e50b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Solubility of dapsone in deep eutectic solvents : experimental analysis, molecular insights and machine learning predictions","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a293","mniswId":"25624","title":"Polimery w medycynie","doi":null,"issn":"0370-0747","eissn":"2451-2699","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"7c7c8672-c53e-4603-ac93-222d2c834c27"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-01-10","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65a207304097071218b1af16","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092c4878c28a04739c403","5e7092dc878c28a04739e50b","5e7092c1878c28a04739c1b0","5e709204878c28a04738eafd"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"<b>Wprowadzenie.</b> Dapson jest substancją czynną o działaniu przeciwzapalnym i przeciwbakteryjnym, stosowaną m.in. w leczeniu schorzeń związanych z AIDS. Jednakże jego niska rozpuszczalność to cecha utrudniająca jego efektywne wykorzystanie.\r\n<b>Cel pracy.</b> Po pierwsze, do rozpuszczania dapsonu jako alternatywy dla tradycyjnych rozpuszczalników zastosowano rozpuszczalniki głęboko eutektyczne (DES). Po drugie, opisano i obliczono oddziaływania międzycząsteczkowe w tych układach. Wreszcie, model przewidywania rozpuszczalności, wcześniej opracowany przy użyciu protokołu uczenia maszynowego, został rozszerzony i ulepszony uwzględniając rozpuszczalniki z grupy głębokich eutektyków.\r\n<b>Materiał i metody.</b> Przygotowano nowe rozpuszczalniki należące do grupy głębokich eutektyków (DES) poprzez zmieszanie chlorku choliny oraz jednego z sześciu wybranych polioli. W każdym z zaprojektowanych rozpuszczalników zmierzono rozpuszczalność dapsonu metodą spektrofotometryczną. Przebadano wpływ rozcieńczania wodą na rozpuszczalność. Badania eksperymentalne wzbogacono o interpretację teoretyczną oddziaływań międzycząsteczkowych i zidentyfikowano najbardziej prawdopodobne pary. Uwzględniono zarówno autoasocjację dapsonu, jak i jego zdolność do oddziaływania ze składnikami analizowanych układów. Charakterystyki termodynamiczne par wykorzystano jako deskryptory molekularne w procesie uczenia maszynowego. Otrzymany model wykorzystano do przewidywania rozpuszczalności zarówno w tradycyjnych rozpuszczalnikach organicznych, jak i nowych głębokich eutektykach.\r\n<b>Wyniki.</b> Potwierdzono znacznie wyższą efektywność nowych rozpuszczalników niż tradycyjnych rozpuszczalników organicznych, a niewielki dodatek wody wywołał wzrost rozpuszczalności, co wskazuje na jej rolę jako współrozpuszczalnika. Interpretacja mechanizmu rozpuszczalności dapsonu wykazała konkurencyjny charakter autoasocjacji oraz tworzenia par ze składnikami analizowanych roztworów. Parametry termodynamiczne charakteryzujące powinowactwo wykorzystano w procesie uczenia maszynowego i opracowano bardzo efektywny model pozwalający na teoretyczne badania przesiewowe w bardzo szerokiej domenie klas rozpuszczalników. Zwrócono uwagę na konieczność ponownego treningu modelu w przypadku rozszerzenia puli danych doświadczalnych o przypadki układów o nowych cechach na przykładzie wzbogacenia modelu o nowe wartości dla DES.\r\n<b>Wnioski.</b> Na przykładzie dapsonu udokumentowano, że projektowanie nowych rozpuszczalników głęboko eutektycznych jest wysoce efektywnym sposobem zwiększania rozpuszczalności prowadzącym do otrzymania ekologicznie i farmaceutycznie akceptowalnych układów. Oddziaływania między molekularne są wartościowym źródłem informacji umożliwiającym nie tylko zrozumienie mechanizmu rozpuszczalności, ale również sformułowania modeli teoretycznych wykorzystujących proces uczenia maszynowego."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<b>Background.</b> Dapsone (DAP) is an anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial active pharmaceutical ingredient used to treat, e.g., AIDS-related diseases. However, low solubility is a feature hampering its efficient use.\r\n<b>Objectives.</b> First, deep eutectic solvents (DES) were used as solubilizing agents for DAP as an alternative to traditional solvents. Second, intermolecular interactions in the systems were described and quantified. Finally, the solubility prediction model, previously created using the machine learning protocol, was extended and improved using new data obtained for eutectic systems.\r\n<b>Material and methods.</b> New DES were created by blending choline chloride (ChCl) with 6 selected polyols. The solubility of DAP in these solvents was measured spectrophotometrically. The impact of water dilution on the solubility curve was investigated. Experimental research was enriched with theoretical interpretations of intermolecular interactions, identifying the most probable pairs in the systems. Dapsone self-association and its ability to interact with components of the analyzed systems were considered. Thermodynamic characteristics of pairs were utilized as molecular descriptors in the machine learning process, predicting solubility in both traditional organic solvents and the newly designed DES.\r\n<b>Results.</b> The newly formulated solvents demonstrated significantly higher efficiency compared to traditional organic solvents, and a small addition of water increased solubility, indicating its role as a co-solvent. The interpretation of the mechanism of DAP solubility highlighted the competitive nature of self-association and pair formation. Thermodynamic parameters characterizing affinity were instrumental in developing an efficient model for theoretical screening across diverse solvent classes. The study emphasized the necessity of retraining models when introducing new experimental data, as exemplified by enriching the model with data from DES.\r\n<b>Conclusions.</b> The research showcased the efficacy of developing new DES for enhancing solubility and creating environmentally and pharmaceutically viable systems, using DAP as an example. Molecular interactions proved valuable in understanding solubility mechanisms and formulating predictive models through machine learning

The primary objective of SBM processing is the reduction and deactivation of anti-nutritional factors (ANFs) to enhance nutrient digestibility. However, eliminating ANFs does not necessarily correlate with increased protein and amino acid content. Several processing methods, such as soaking, cooking, and commercial techniques, improve SBM protein digestibility. To sustain feeding qualities, soybeans must undergo heating to remove inherent chemicals that interfering with poultry digestion. However, both under and overprocessing can impair meal digestibility. Extrusion heating significantly contributes to protein and starch digestibility while reducing certain ANFs. Thermomechanical and enzyme-assisted procedures reduce heat-resistant proteins more efficiently than extraction methods, producing soy protein concentrate (SPC) and fermentation. These techniques reduce ANFs in SBM, activating digestive enzymes and alleviating digestive tract pressure, leading to decreased endogenous protein deficits. Exogenous enzyme supplementation is a biotechnological approach for enhancing the nutritional content of SBM and certain other protein-rich products. However, different processing methods not only affect protein digestibility but also impact poultry production, gastrointestinal health, and the environment due to higher nitrogen excrement. Ammonia (NH3) emissions, are a significant environmental concern in chicken farming, resulting from uric acid production during protein consumption. It has a negative impact on the environment and the health of birds/humans. This review investigates the impact of several processing techniques on the digestibility of SBM protein and the reduction of N2 regarding one health concept. Future research should focus on identifying optimal processing methods maximizing protein digestibility while minimizing environmental nitrogen impacts."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614264","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"1037-1049","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://sciendo.com/article/10.2478/aoas-2024-0020","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67ab4c22fdbe8362a5762ced","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Wilk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"93ac3536-1e69-40b8-aeaa-b8c9cb882f4f"},{"objectId":"659b6c3a40e3ff6b129b19c6","name":"Qurat ul ain","lastName":"Sajid","uuid":"53BAA45FB7C499F594CEEE5D805A4EA007254F1B150BFB777565324964C8A15362858160149612404A1C0B40F1ABE27014DFE50D6C03DEB399B51142AB94308A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b32183e0-86fe-4ced-b641-970b772a903e"},{"objectId":"620b1e387523402df0840dfd","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Asghar","uuid":"465308559A826473A3F23C177A86C4EB330238F7380CB20C0C16387E6BB41BBC0A493EB03CD00DAC3CAB6CE0A4C472566F0DDD20E2ACFEEB25F6F650F24A8B9A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c604b059-3cb6-42d0-8890-23eda2691974"},{"objectId":"602f68699543c7410626f445","name":"Damian","lastName":"Konkol","uuid":"82BCB1459AEEC400572FBD0C56D3D1A1B115519121CCFFAA8F769C2152C3C1C633202BD7CB3B086B527E3DC03683D64FE1BB3991041B898247F2A0DDCBBD8C71","orcidId":"0000-0002-3993-2847","documentHash":"b0aa904c-70a3-4e32-a00d-677fb6ffd8fe"},{"objectId":"5e709262878c28a047394c95","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Korczyński","uuid":"75C627B202CF7C0999F89EC3288F4A31A484E16D9C37CA8ACB88EBF56189780D3DD1792ACFD817544511671E793DECA31C1086B40A466288273229640A39BCF5","orcidId":"0000-0003-1959-7866","documentHash":"78d39e9d-c759-45d1-a878-2e524ade3ba9"}],"doi":"10.2478/aoas-2024-0020"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Drainage","Gleysols","Humaquepts","Endoaquolls","Alluvial soils"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"66624e544097074fa1bdeb81","doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-50285-9","title":"Sandy Soils","year":2024,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-3-031-50284-2","ismn":null,"issn":"2352-4774","url":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-50285-9","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"d099d792-0419-491c-9050-f04cf096450a","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091fc878c28a04738e22b","5e7091fc878c28a04738e230"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Molic and Umbric Horizons of Alluvial Sandy Soils of River Valleys in SW Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67ab44b8fdbe8362a573fa51","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7091fc878c28a04738e230","5e7091fc878c28a04738e22b"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The sandy soils of river valleys in Poland and other European countries were subjected to the transformation since the seventeenth century following hydrotechnical engineering works. Regulation of river channels and expansion of drainage infrastructure were intended to protect residential areas from flooding, increase agricultural land, and improve inland navigation. It reduced natural alluvial sedimentation and led to the degradation or disappearance of natural muds, swamps, and bogs habitats. It led to disappearance of shelterbelts and herbaceous vegetation and a decline in landscape diversity and biodiversity. Floodplains are anthropogenically altered and endangered ecosystems in Europe. The lowering of the groundwater table causes the increase of the soil biological activity and intensification of the soil-forming processes, and it leads to the gradual disappearance of the original stratification of sediments (fluvial materials) and the development of horizons. Mollic or umbric horizons are regularly found in river valleys. The purpose of this study was to verify anthropogenic influence on the formation of deep organic matter-rich horizons in sandy soils. It was found that the original organic swamp-alluvial or marsh-alluvial soils, with histic horizons, periodically flooded or located in former oxbow lakes, gradually changed into mineral soils with thick, black, and structured mollic or umbric horizons with an abrupt boundary to subsoil horizons with anthric properties. Although drainage caused a decrease in organic matter content, SOC concentrations remain high despite the sandy texture. These soils are suitable for hay or pasture meadows, for arable land, or as forested areas."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614266","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"39-49","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-50285-9_4","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e230","name":"Beata","lastName":"Łabaz","uuid":"8406E6A1ED619554B565A604766930DBE8269EC2E70691DC4AB92928DDA2C86050D1A7E96D2CAAEDB748253E6F5AF122F49418DD379F38741F9A6B619D506E9E","orcidId":"0000-0003-0957-015X","documentHash":"21627ec9-e044-4590-bb43-01fd644e3212"},{"objectId":"5e7091fc878c28a04738e22b","name":"Cezary","lastName":"Kabała","uuid":"C7E20E83413AAA0ED0B12CCA72BE2F7F09EB42BC4AB605BBDA5D5FC56186D9D89E2E3EE42019BD8981EDE8921BF5F9AB1658E1FE95ACCD2CEA9B9637B93DB427","orcidId":"0000-0001-9796-3716","documentHash":"0c1c9ca8-1dfa-40d3-87db-35acee1fd4e5"}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-031-50285-9_4"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["choroby stawu nadgarstkowego","staw nadgarstkowy","nadgarstek","choroby nadgarstka","anatomia"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["wrist joint diseases","anatomy","wrist diseases","wrist joint","wrist"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["67ab4b2cfdbe8362a5762957","5e709210878c28a04738f607"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Anatomia kliniczna stawu nadgarstkowego u psa","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"64f04bfacf9a7471b0ea4124","mniswId":"201648","title":"Weterynaria w Praktyce","doi":null,"issn":"1732-1999","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"MINISTRY","editor":null,"documentHash":"d38a8c76-30f8-4a38-bfdd-e1c75a5bac95"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67ab4b2cfdbe8362a5762956","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["67ab4b2cfdbe8362a5762957","5e709210878c28a04738f607"]},"issue":"1-2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Staw nadgarstkowy jest skomplikowaną trzypiętrową strukturą, zbudowaną z siedmiu kości, w której skład wchodzą: staw łokciowo-nadgarstkowy, staw śródnadgarstkowy, stawy międzynadgarstkowe, stawy nadgarstkowo-śródręczne.

The research was carried out over two different periods with different thermal humidity indexes (THIs). In the first period, the THI was 59.27 (Run 1), while in the second period, the THI was 63.77 (Run 2). The experimental subjects comprised 111 sighthound-type dogs—whippets—that were photographed with a thermal imaging camera to determine their eye temperature (ET) and nose temperature (NT). The average minimum and maximum eye temperatures were statistically lower after running in both measurements. Increased minimum and maximum nose temperatures were also demonstrated after both runs. The nasal temperature values were statistically higher for Run 2, for which the THI was higher, compared to Run 1. Eyeball temperature may be a marker of thermoregulation ability, regardless of the ambient temperature. The value of ETmax decreased on average by 2.23 °C and 0.4 °C, while NTmax increased uniformly by 2 °C after both runs.

(P) retention in soils in the presence of organic matter (OM) has been, for years, a topic with no clear conclusions. Considering the important ecological functions of peatlands, the objective of this study is to examine the role of OM transformation in relation to P status in Histosols in the Oder Valley (Poland). Basic physical and chemical properties and the following P forms were determined in the organic horizons of 5 soil profiles from two habitats (eutrophic and dystrophic): total (Pt) and organic P (Po), available P (PM3), easily soluble P (PCaCl2), water-soluble P (PW), and fraction of Po in humic (Po_HA) and fulvic (Po_FA) acids after extraction with 0.5 mol L−1 NaOH. The results were statistically verified in both examined habitat groups separately. The higher values of mobile P forms were found in the upper organic horizons released from OM constituents as a result of their decomposition. The role of OM in P retention was strongly related to the activity of humic substances (HS): a higher Po percentage (6.9–99.4% of Po) was observed in dystrophic, whereas a lower (9.3–28.6% of Po) was observed in eutrophic Histosols. Humic acids played a dominant role in P retention compared to fulvic acids in most peat horizons, especially at pH < 5. The role of HA and FA in P retention was clearly dependent on forms found only in eutrophic Histosols. The important role of FA in P retention during OM transformation was confirmed by negative correlations between Po_FA and macronutrient ratios in both soil groups. The results confirm the variable role of OM in P retention, depending on soil environmental conditions and OM type (peat and moorsh). This may have important applications not only in areas of natural importance, for which the release of mobile P forms may be a threat, but also in agricultural areas where, for a change, we struggle to increase P availability."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614275","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/14/8/1688","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395e21","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Dębicka","uuid":"F3CB8A652276898BCE29ADFD380FB2DD34B90070E36D9296D2B442F30D8C36E7B30A550C0D6ACC18B9B03BFEFF39C35A912DDF06AB36508CC65946E6234B4E0C","orcidId":"0000-0003-4659-5380","documentHash":"e0d92ce0-46f7-44f9-a335-be2425fd928d"}],"doi":"10.3390/agronomy14081688"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7091fc878c28a04738e1ed","67ab4378fdbe8362a57373d0","67ab4378fdbe8362a57373d1","5e709479878c28a0473bde3a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Collembola growth in heavy metal-contaminated soils","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":null,"issn":"2045-2322","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2024-11-14","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67ab4378fdbe8362a57373ce","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709479878c28a0473bde3a","67ab4378fdbe8362a57373cf","5e7091fc878c28a04738e1ed","67ab4378fdbe8362a57373d0","67ab4378fdbe8362a57373d1"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Collembola play a key role in soil ecosystems by decomposing organic matter. Most of them inhabit the upper layers of the soil and are susceptible to contamination present in the pore water. These arthropods serve as model organisms in ecotoxicology for short and long-term exposure. This study aimed to assess the toxicity of three heavy metals (lead [Pb], cadmium [Cd], and copper [Cu]) using the springtail species Folsomia candida as the test organism, with mortality and growth inhibition as the measure of toxicity. We hypothesised that increasing metal concentrations in the soil would correspond to a growth reduction of Collembola. Each heavy metal was tested at a minimum of eight increasing concentrations in six replications. Twenty 10-12-day-old individuals were introduced into each test container filled with contaminated or control soil and incubated for 14 days. The test endpoints included growth inhibition determined by comparing F. candida growth rates in contaminated soil with those in control soil, as well as mortality rates. The EC50 values (mg/kg) for heavy metals were as follows: Cd = 66.89, Cu = 791.01, Pb = 10075.48.

The analysed region is not very snowy, with an average of 40 days with snow cover in the winter season and a mean maximum snow depth of 8–12 cm. Twenty-five snowfall events were selected using the threshold of 20 cm/2 days (i.e., 20 cm of snow depth increase during 2 days), and the synoptic climatology, as well as triggering factors of their occurrence, were defined. The bipolar pattern of sea level pressure with a high-pressure over Scandinavia and a low-pressure system southward of it was identified as favourable for sea-effect snowfall on the southern Baltic Sea coast. This pressure field, causing northeastern circulation in the lower troposphere, brings cold air masses over the relatively warm sea basin, and the negative anomalies of air temperature at 850 hPa geopotential level, amounting to −9°C, encompass Scandinavia, as well as central and northeastern Europe. This makes the temperature difference between the air at the 850 hPa geopotential height and the sea surface exceeding 15°C. This large temperature difference establishes favourable conditions for convection in cold air masses, which become unstable while crossing over the warm sea. The formed clouds give snowfall in the coastal areas. In the further part of the study, three sea-effect snowfall cases were chosen for detailed analysis, including atmospheric sounding, radar and satellite images, air parcel backward trajectories, and synoptic maps. They reveal high-pressure wedges associated with low air temperature over Scandinavia and northern airflow over the Baltic Sea. The wind direction and the temperature of air masses are key components in the occurrence of sea-effect snowfall, and global warming conditions seem to reduce the frequency of snow events over the Polish Baltic Sea coast."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614281","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"42","pagesFromTo":"5520-5534","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65818c9c4097076c14b78b58","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Bednorz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"db93e44c-d5fb-4be2-a246-79f62660ecc2"},{"objectId":"5e70942f878c28a0473b7c6f","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Czernecki","uuid":"610F00B7A669710B935D25B5655D6B72F79B63263A7709B396ABF6F874100692E978A7AB512E8E097B1CCC5CF9210418793EDB571D5ADB6C7D1BBFA955E85792","orcidId":"0000-0001-6496-1386","documentHash":"f513366a-bf16-4641-a8ab-bc29e97c9778"},{"objectId":"5e709392878c28a0473ad1cf","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Tomczyk","uuid":"3693F2CDD9D2065743DDD230CE240353CFEB62A1ACACBBDFCE33D7D0F1A0F1A1BD4123CF82BC8E7FC6537A9889ED2BF4F5038EB0059B1119CB4E68E59508DE37","orcidId":"0000-0003-1576-8795","documentHash":"25b50d82-8c69-4940-b2f1-6397ca9bb819"}],"doi":"10.1002/joc.7546"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":"978-83-66476-82-0","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet

and gel electrolytes based on common commercial and recently commercialized salts for application in lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are presented herein. Various solvent mixtures and electrolytes based on them are presented. Selected organic carbonates’ mixtures are chosen as the base for these electrolytes. LiTDI (lithium 4,5-dicyano-2-(trifluoromethyl)-imidazolide) and LiPF6 (lithium hexafluorophosphate) are chosen to compare the behavior and the electrochemical properties of the investigated systems. The limited optimizations of electrolytes are presented for LiTDI salt. Results for LiPF6 electrolytes are presented as a benchmark. The detailed comparison of lithium transference numbers is presented. All liquid electrolytes present quite high values of conductivity at room temperature and in some cases reach above 6 mS cm−1 for LiTDI solutions. The base for gel electrolytes is PVdF-HFP co-polymer (poly(vinylidene difluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene)). The conductivity of gel electrolytes exceeds 1 mS cm−1 in case of the LiTDI system. All presented electrolytes show relatively high stability vs. Li/Li+, up to 4.7 V in both liquid and gel systems."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060614285","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"155","pagesFromTo":"267-273","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00706-023-03166-0","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67a4e4dbfdbe8362a56bb8ea","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Walczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"88a94205-29c8-4854-b8f0-d6091d33fdb1"},{"objectId":"67a4e4dbfdbe8362a56bb8e9","name":"Anna","lastName":"Plewa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c685b18-ee13-4fe5-878d-a2b704dda638"},{"objectId":"67a4e4dbfdbe8362a56bb8e8","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kulka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fc233d63-3e66-45d6-8d3f-530077d59e65"},{"objectId":"5e709459878c28a0473bb1c9","name":"Marta","lastName":"Kasprzyk-Niedzicka","uuid":"3132A473E446522A3FFCC3F751D81B8682B895A746570F99BF393935E4A28EAA415DFC0A78CD602DBF1511ECACE67E2EFE67C539140CA0C0ADFE4CDAF98D1F21","orcidId":"0000-0001-5513-8750","documentHash":"d0fa3c5b-f234-4b28-9f84-07998dae12cb"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00706-023-03166-0"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","uid":"biYmBVqTIPjYnbitwxrPxow","uuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","parentUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3c","rootUuid":"70161bb7-629d-46ab-9c91-cc91851ed886","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczy we Wrocławiu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709262878c28a047394cbf"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"New records of three introduced heleomyzid flies (Diptera: Heleomyzidae) in western North America","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454774e0","mniswId":"3091","title":"Canadian Entomologist","doi":null,"issn":"0008-347X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"060aabf3-25e9-4144-b47e-73858b1b6013"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"67ab3ecdfdbe8362a5735cc3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709262878c28a047394cbf","67ab3f6dfdbe8362a5735fb3","67ab3f6dfdbe8362a5735fb4"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We report the presence of three Palaearctic species, Suillia variegata (Loew), Tephrochlamys flavipes (Zetterstedt), and Tephrochlamys tarsalis (Zetterstedt) (Diptera: Heleomyzidae), recently introduced to North America. We use community science (also known as citizen science) data to show that S. variegata, which was first reported in Portland, Oregon, United States of America, in 2016, has persisted in that area and has subsequently also been observed in Washington and California. Tephrochlamys flavipes, first reported in Seattle, Washington, United States of America, in 2010, has been observed comparatively more rarely, in a more restricted geographic area. The presence of T. tarsalis in the Nearctic, previously reported in Canada based on genetic barcodes, is verified from photographs taken in British Columbia, Canada and Washington. We provide updates to the keys to Suillia Robineau-Desvoidy and Tephrochlamys Loew of the United States of America and Canada.
