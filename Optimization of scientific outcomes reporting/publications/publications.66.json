This factor is particularly harmful to seed material, which is sensitive to air movement (some medicinal and vegetable crops). To address this issue, the design of vibratory machines is changed while their operational regimes are configured accordingly. This requires many full-scale experiments and (or) time-consuming personal computer-based simulation of the working processes of the vibrational motion of such seed mixtures.\n\nThis paper proposes several regression models that make it possible to replace time-consuming numerical modeling with simple analytical expressions (regression equations). These equations are used for a quantitative assessment of the degree of influence of aerodynamics on the kinematic parameters of the vibrational motion of particles of seed mixtures. The assessment is derived depending on the geometric characteristics of the aerodynamic screen, the design of the unit, and the amplitude of oscillations of the working surfaces of a vibratory machine. The models take the form of equations of multiple linear regression of the second order, obtained on the basis of a series of numerical experiments. The processes of vibration movement of the seed material of parsnips, lettuce, and fragrant dill were investigated. The coefficient of determination equaled 0.956...0.967.\n\nThe results reported here are useful for the construction of algorithms to optimize the design and adjust the operating modes of vibratory separators according to the criterion of minimizing the harmful effects of the aerodynamic

and Objectives: Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) was identified as a cell adhesion molecule that helps to regulate inflammation-associated vascular adhesion and the transendothelial migration of leukocytes, such as macrophages and T cells. VCAM-1 is expressed by the vascular system and can be induced by reactive oxygen species, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), which are produced by many cell types. The newest data suggest that VCAM-1 is associated with the progression of numerous immunological disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, transplant rejection and cancer. The aim of this study was to analyze the increase in VCAM-1 expression and the impact of exposure in a hyperbaric chamber to VCAM-1 levels in human blood serum. Materials and Methods: The study included 92 volunteers. Blood for the tests was taken in the morning, from the basilic vein of fasting individuals, in accordance with the applicable procedure for blood collection for morphological tests. In both groups of volunteers, blood was collected before and after exposure, in heparinized tubes to obtain plasma and hemolysate, and in clot tubes to obtain serum. The level of VCAM-1 was determined using the immunoenzymatic ELISA method. Results: The study showed that the difference between the distribution of VCAM-1 before and after exposure corresponding to diving at a depth of 30 m was at the limit of statistical significance in the divers group and that, in most people, VCAM-1 was higher after exposure. Diving to a greater depth had a much more pronounced impact on changes in VCAM-1 values, as the changes observed in the VCAM-1 level as a result of diving to a depth of 60 m were statistically highly significant (p = 0.0002). The study showed an increase in VCAM-1 in relation to the baseline value, which reached as much as 80%, i.e., VCAM-1 after diving was almost twice as high in some people. There were statistically significant differences between the results obtained after exposure to diving conditions at a depth of 60 m and the values measured for the non-divers group. The leukocyte level increased statistically after exposure to 60 m. In contrast, hemoglobin levels decreased in most divers after exposure to diving at a depth of 30 m (p = 0.0098). Conclusions: Exposure in the hyperbaric chamber had an effect on serum VCAM-1 in the divers group and non-divers group. There is a correlation between the tested morphological parameters and the VCAM-1 level before and after exposure in the divers group and the non-divers group.

Located along the beam collision axis and shielded from the interaction point by at least 100 m of concrete and rock, the FPF will house experiments that will detect particles outside the acceptance of the existing large LHC experiments and will observe rare and exotic processes in an extremely low-background environment. In this work, we summarize the current status of plans for the FPF, including recent progress in civil engineering in identifying promising sites for the FPF and the experiments currently envisioned to realize the FPF′s physics potential. We then review the many Standard Model and new physics topics that will be advanced by the FPF, including searches for long-lived particles, probes of dark matter and dark sectors, high-statistics studies of TeV neutrinos of all three flavors, aspects of perturbative and non-perturbative QCD, and high-energy astroparticle

X-ray diffraction analysis was performed in the laboratory of the Institute of Single Crystals of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (Kharkiv). Computer methods were used to build “structure – toxicity” models and predict LD50 using already created models GUSAR, TEST. The degree of toxicity (DL50) and the approximate doses for the subacute experiment were determined by studying the acute toxicity of the test chemical and the injectable solution based on it. Determination of acute toxicity parameters by intragastric administration was performed on white rats, aged 3-4 months, body weight 200-220 g.\n\nResults. Due to the study of the toxicity of 1,2,4-triazole derivatives by non-experimental methods using GUSAR and TEST models, it was found that the test compounds could be classified as low-toxic substances.\n\nThe compound is an organic salt that exists in the crystal as a solvate with one molecule of methanol and two molecules of water. When studying the structure of the crystal, it was found that the crystal is in the pinacoidal triclinic syngony.\n\nAccording to the results of the studies, it was found that after a single intragastric administration of the compound in doses of 1000, 3000 and 5000 mg / kg, all animals remained alive for 14 days. The basis of the biological action of chemical compounds is the violation of several biochemical processes. We found that the studied blood constants, on the background of the use of newly synthesized substance, underwent some changes.\n\nConclusions. According to the assessment of the toxicity of the drug “VPK-434” when administered intragastrically to laboratory rats, it was found that in accordance with SOU 85.2-37-736: 2011 the test substance belongs to the IV class of toxicity (low toxicity). It was found that the average lethal dose of DL50 of the test substance by intramuscular administration to rats is 1666.66 mg / kg body weight. It was studied that some abnormalities in the hematopoietic system (increase in the number of leukocytes, including eosinophils), liver and kidney function (increased activity of transaminases, decreased serum concentrations of total protein, urea and creatinine) and changes in mineral metabolism of experimental animals groups, on the background of receiving 10 multiple doses of the study drug, was short-term, and the restoration of the functional state of the body of rats could be said as early as 4-5 days after discontinuation of the drug into their

the annealing behaviors of defects in ion-implanted GaN are studied by positron annihilation, cathodoluminescence, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and atom probe tomography. Si or Mg ions are implanted into GaN to obtain 300 nm deep box profiles of the impurities. The samples are annealed up to 1480 °C under a N2 pressure of 1 GPa. For as-implanted GaN, the major defect species is identified as Ga-vacancy-type defects. After annealing above 1000 °C, vacancy clusters are introduced, and they remain even after 1480 °C annealing. For Mg-implanted GaN with the Mg concentration ([Mg]) ≤ 10^18 cm−3, no large change in the depth distribution of Mg is observed before and after annealing at 1400 °C. For the sample with [Mg] = 10^19 cm−3, however, Mg diffuses into the bulk, which is attributed to the over-doping of Mg and their vacancy-assisted diffusion. The Mg diffusion is suppressed, and the donor–acceptor pair emission is enhanced by sequential N-implantation, which is attributed to the reaction between Mg and vacancies under a N-rich condition. For the samples annealed at 1480 °C, an accumulation of Mg around dislocation loops and Mg clustering are enhanced by the N-implantation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169681","journalIssue":{"objectId":"652f8eba4097077f8aa4cba4","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"259","number":"10","doi":"","documentHash":"e9e00dec-3622-4379-bbe1-df81f2a4b9b7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"2200183","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/pssb.202200183","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62f2a011409707569c07408d","name":"Tetsu","lastName":"Kachi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ee86185f-1813-4062-94f7-28cd57105059"},{"objectId":"62f2a011409707569c07408c","name":"Kazuhiro","lastName":"Hono","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6b230338-d11a-4705-a508-8665e75984a7"},{"objectId":"62f2a011409707569c07408b","name":"Nobuyuki","lastName":"Ikarashi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"189af1f4-7c63-446c-aa9b-9041dcbeb72a"},{"objectId":"62f2a011409707569c07408a","name":"Tadakatsu","lastName":"Ohkubo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5cb555ec-8bab-4075-894b-8b800d0e9e76"},{"objectId":"62f2a011409707569c074089","name":"Jun","lastName":"Suda","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"155e00d5-fb05-4f2e-af97-683cc1091eef"},{"objectId":"62f2a011409707569c074088","name":"Shigefusa F.","lastName":"Chichibu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"064bf198-fec6-4483-8d69-08e6ab12e2fb"},{"objectId":"62f2a011409707569c074087","name":"Shoji","lastName":"Ishibashi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"03129d80-c724-4faf-9b1f-a115f49c20da"},{"objectId":"62f2a011409707569c074086","name":"Tetsuo","lastName":"Narita","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a3b98c20-752e-4728-bc0a-02a714189f9d"},{"objectId":"62f2a011409707569c074085","name":"Jun","lastName":"Uzuhashi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"56d4e6e9-5ddc-45d0-87b5-ea501bfeb611"},{"objectId":"62f2a011409707569c074084","name":"Hideki","lastName":"Sakurai","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7dd3a8b7-3845-4d11-bbb6-a6177ff45719"},{"objectId":"62f2a011409707569c074083","name":"Akira","lastName":"Uedono","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"27b3081b-d4ec-4f9a-ad2c-83e2afede225"},{"objectId":"5ffd5482085dcb6be6b60aad","name":"Kacper","lastName":"Sierakowski","uuid":"810B8E2D3914D3769951AF32282697540FE3E3E145221ECC7CD8BD4129D609CD107025D0B5A66E66EC2634138301B221E1C2B797B6EB99E1857587D6B603B067","orcidId":"0000-0002-9447-1182","documentHash":"90d71694-610e-4588-a91d-32144ad892ca"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5989","name":"Michał","lastName":"Boćkowski","uuid":"18E0485511ABDB0D41DB7F6F59E9E4626BB139E8F890BB7F1D72DE93FF779111D716976B750D1B02005018F23E408247F07044DC9DD6FE84870F35A167D66175","orcidId":"0000-0003-1616-685X","documentHash":"6f2bcbbc-7ec5-4a12-aa2e-323154ef506b"}],"doi":"10.1002/pssb.202200183"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["A.

The model developed was applied to simulate the resistance of ballistic packages against a 9 mm Parabellum projectile. The main concept of the proposed method is to model the bending stiffness of textiles by means of doubled membrane-shell elements with appropriately selected elastic properties, and to model the stiffness in the out-of-plane direction by means of a nonlinear contact algorithm. Both ideas are original in relation to generally known solutions. The numerical results obtained were compared with experimental data to verify the ability of the method to estimate the following parameters: depression depth in the backing material, number of perforated and damaged layers, and geometry of deformed projectiles. A satisfactory correlation of the parameters listed was achieved with experimental observations.

The purpose of this review is to summarize data on the synthesis and structural modification of heterocyclic systems with triazole and thiadiazole fragments in molecules as promising objects in bioorganic and medicinal chemistry.\n\nMaterials and methods. The research based on bibliosemantic and analytical methods using bibliographic and abstract databases, as well as databases of chemical compounds.\n\nResults. Modern medicinal chemistry faces many challenges, one of which is the determination of the activity and specificity of therapeutic agents. Recent scientific data showed that triazoles and/or thiadiazoles have broad spectrum of biological activities, in particular antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, anticancer and anticonvulsant. Synthetic research allows to propose a whole number of new molecular design directions of biological active triazole and/or thiadiazole derivatives, as well as to obtain directed library that include hundreds of new compounds. This review is an effort to summarize data of its analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity over the last decade. We summarized and analyzed the series of triazole and/or thiadiazole derivatives and provided data of their structure-activity relationship. For optimization and rational design of highly active molecules with optimal «drug-like» characteristics and discovering of possible mechanism of action SAR, QSAR analysis and molecular docking were summarized.\n\nConclusions.

Throughout the 20th century both texts were regarded as highly representative of Bulgarian literature with strong influence on the modern national mythology. Their common theme (the death and glorification of national heroes), however, has not provoked intertextual analyses to date. The research leads to the\r\nconclusion that while Botev builds his symbolic system on the basis of Bulgarian folklore, Vazov relies on military metaphors and Christian notions, such as the righteous death, the Second Coming and eternity. This pattern, consistent with other works by the two authors, allows to comment on a literary confrontation that shares some similarities with Western European disputes between defenders of classicism and romanticism. In the case of Bulgarian literary history, Botev can be interpreted as the initiator of a long-lasting tradition of romantic glorification through transformation and integration of the folkloristic heritage (mainly the folk song), while Vazov’s classicist concepts had far fewer adherents. In the light of the conducted contrastive analysis the popular thesis, defended by Milena Tsaneva, about Botev and Vazov’s collaboration and continuity in creating the national poetic pantheon demands verification through the questions of confronting ideological and symbolic strategies towards revealing the uniqueness of modern Bulgarian identity."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169698","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"20","pagesFromTo":"130-135","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37708/ezs.swu.bg.v20i1.17","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a04739ffe3","name":"Kamen","lastName":"Rikev","uuid":"55A688868524C931429D93288F1246AA70E5B2E822D284EAED73E579D5C1BCB0B2A6104388805476277857B4DF99800FBBD1DBA4B1B96EF9022A10993AA75C51","orcidId":"0000-0002-6606-4731","documentHash":"ba5b9bc3-aa22-4540-8167-1a8a1bf244b8"}],"doi":"10.37708/ezs.swu.bg.v20i1.17"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Ganders","Seasonal breeding","Testes","Proliferation","Apoptosis","Connexin 43"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918c878c28a04737e089","uid":"bxHCtILZYY8pW7S8fOkWkJQ","uuid":"7752bc98-48af-470c-82a0-9804ab0fbe41","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","parentUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","rootUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","name":"Wydział Hodowli i Biologii Zwierząt","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709307878c28a0473a17f8","5e709307878c28a0473a17f6"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Annual changes in cell proliferation and apoptosis and expression of connexin 43 in the testes of domestic seasonal breeding ganders","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479934","mniswId":"19490","title":"Theriogenology","doi":null,"issn":"0093-691X","eissn":"1879-3231","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"5a895e76-bf91-415f-9ad3-e560a5ae5bdf"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"628f47ba409707500aabb288","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709307878c28a0473a17f6","5e709307878c28a0473a17f8","628f47ba409707500aabb28c"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Molecular mechanisms of seasonal changes in testicular morphology, histoarchitecture, and functions in birds have not been fully elucidated. The aim of the study was to examine the alternations in cell proliferation and apoptosis, these processes-related gene expressions, and gap junction protein (GJA1gene, connexin 43 protein; Cx43) expression and localization in gander testes during annual stages. Testes from domestic ganders (n = 28) in the first reproduction season were obtained at five stages, i.e., prebreeding (PrB), peak of reproduction (PR), postbreeding (PoB), nonbreeding (NB), and onset of reproduction (OR). Males were kept under controlled breeding conditions. Testicular weight, morphometry, and histology (H&E staining) were evaluated, and the following parameters were tested: (1) number of proliferating (PCNA-positive) and apoptotic (TUNEL-positive) cells; (2) mRNA and protein abundances of PCNA, caspase-3, and Cx43 by qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively; (3) activity of caspase-3 by fluorometric method; and (4) localization of Cx43 by immunofluoresence. Testicular weight was found to decrease by 4-fold at the NB stage with massive depletion of germ cells concomitantly with a reduction of seminiferous tubule (ST) diameter and ST lumen compared to the PR and OR stages. The number of proliferating germ cells was higher at PrB and PR than at the PoB stage, whereas the number of apoptotic cells was higher at PoB and NB compared to PrB and OR. Thus, proliferation-to-apoptosis ratios were lower in PoB and NB than other stages. Moreover, mRNA expression of PCNA exhibited down regulation in these stages compared to PrB and PR. Stage-dependent changes in the Cx43 mRNA level and in the localization pattern in the ST germinal epithelium were observed. Lower abundances of GJA1 transcript during NB and OR than at PoB the stage and irregular distribution of Cx43 protein located near the lumen of ST primarily at PrB and NB compared to the remaining stages were noted. These results suggested that during gander testis development, function, regression, and recrudescence, the interaction between processes of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and changes in the localization of Cx43 protein in the germinal epithelium occurred. The balance between these processes may determine the final functional activity or inactive stage of the testes connected with weight and histoarchitecture changes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169700","journalIssue":{"objectId":"628f47ba409707500aabb28e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"186","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"7933cfdd-7ccd-43b4-8922-b4075751f069"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"186","pagesFromTo":"27-39","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0093691X22001200?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"628f47ba409707500aabb28c","name":"Israel","lastName":"Rozenboim","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8500c4df-8d55-49db-9c9d-53311dcd2058"},{"objectId":"5e709307878c28a0473a17f8","name":"Anna","lastName":"Hrabia","uuid":"CD5AB6F03458443F22B2E204A8392849939635D5BFAA034DD793C544424536546513D5D4F1E31D1CDED0EB2E95621F3333CF95B59F16A0695A765CBAD4355121","orcidId":"0000-0002-2290-7880","documentHash":"adad521b-48f9-473a-956c-5d9c8dd07f56"},{"objectId":"5e709307878c28a0473a17f6","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Gumułka","uuid":"D7B876C81F122095C71230062AA11484274D3C20A0C06B4A50E57495E8C5DF2A24A0C7DEA1A163DD0B14F6137693E4B4FFB8FAD2BBAE69C75D5AFAB745AFFAAB","orcidId":"0000-0001-9812-1529","documentHash":"4a22adb6-bcc3-4d69-b867-39ae646708ef"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.theriogenology.2022.03.031"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hysterectomy with salpingectomy","ovarian blood supply disorders","structural and functional parameters of the ovaries","hormonal imbalance after hysterectomy"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"619f9a962467f07d9879c933","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Bogomolets National Medical University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["628ca4964097074a658b5d62","628ca4964097074a658b5d63"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Hysterectomy with opportunistic salpingectomy and its influence on structural-functional parameters of ovarian tissue","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"61f252442467f039a441d07d","mniswId":null,"title":"ScienceRise: Medical Science","doi":null,"issn":"2519-478X","eissn":"2519-4798","websiteLink":"http://journals.uran.ua/sr_med","metadataSource":"USER","editor":null,"documentHash":"1b6de24b-f0ce-4bbd-b02b-7c1449072fdf"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-31","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"628ca4964097074a658b5d60","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["628ca4964097074a658b5d62","628ca4964097074a658b5d63"]},"issue":"2(47)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The study examined the development of posthysterectomy syndrome in patients after hysterectomy with preservation of ovarian tissue.\n\nThe aim of the study was to assess the functionality of ovarian tissue in patients with hysterectomy and opportunistic salpingectomy performed for uterine fibroids.\n\nMaterials and methods of the research. The study was performed in 160 women of reproductive age. The first group included 90 patients after vaginal hysterectomy with tubectomy and associated with laparoscopy, the second group - 70 patients after abdominal hysterectomy with tubectomy. The control group included 50 women of reproductive age 45.7±1.3 years with asymptomatic fibroids. The diagnostic algorithm included assessment of hormonal status and instrumental study of structural and functional parameters of ovarian tissue both at the stage of preoperative observation and for 12 months, 3 and 5 years after surgery.\n\nResearch results and their discussion. At the preoperative stage in both groups found a higher percentage of thyroid disease, hypertension and metabolic disorders, as well as combined proliferative processes of the uterus. Normal ultrasound picture of the ovaries was found in 67.8 % - in the first group and in 47.1 % - in the second group. Significant increase in blood flow in the ovarian artery, in the remote period showing atrophic changes with the development of ovarian depletion syndrome. Assessment of hormonal status in both groups shows marked changes in baseline levels of gonadotropic hormones (FSH and LH): increase in baseline FSH levels by 2.2 times, LH - 1.5 times against the control group (p <0.05), dyshormonal disorders persist for up to 5 years after surgery in one third of cases, and up to 36 months - there is an increase in the proportion of cystic and trophic changes, most pronounced in patients with reduced ovarian reserve, dysmetabolic manifestations and combined proliferative processes of the uterus and appendages before surgery, and syndrome chronic pelvic pain and venous pelvic blood supply in the postoperative period.\n\nConclusions. The technique of performing a hysterectomy does not have a significant effect on the functional state of the ovaries in the long term.

Twelve patients with brain injury of different etiology, with different degrees of consciousness disorders and not communicating through verbal and motor skills, qualified for the study.

The next part of the paper concerns the determination of strength properties of a welded joint in terms of a shear test. A thermo-elastic–plastic numerical model is developed using Abaqus FEA software in order to determine the thermal and mechanical phenomena of the welded joint. This approach requires the implementation of moveable heat source power intensity distribution based on circumferentially moving Goldak’s heat source model. This model is implemented in the additional DFLUX subroutine, written in Fortran programming language. The correctness of the assumed model of thermal phenomena is confirmed by examinations of the shape and size of the melted zone. The strength of the welded joint subjected to shear is verified by performing a compression test of welded pipes as well as computer simulations with validation of the computational model using the Dantec 3D image correlation system."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169716","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"brak","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/9/3243","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b41ca","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Stano","uuid":"EF46E1D10F259792F7861EE5389BCD4D5AF9BDEECCA604BA445FCCDF4B14F7A37F8D1B3557F0A5056AD8ECDFC6ED7248A7788ADCA6A2095E448977B4E7ECDC89","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8a0e6c09-ae5f-40ce-a4c9-7e5aa6ac7886"},{"objectId":"5e7093de878c28a0473b22d5","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Saternus","uuid":"B35695A605B8DE748F149DBED7FE8EB0469D3CB55A4913D09774B1793899209337D2F5FE3EB6C281A0A534CAF1FC7A7AF3C9FFD9985B98CFD94162F2667503CB","orcidId":"0000-0002-3837-1072","documentHash":"89becc0e-aca6-4527-afed-63bce72f562f"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e783","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Kubiak","uuid":"EFC9D5810BD95696F1C0FC9DE96681E5E58BC7BE37A2714FD0FCC97BFC0F03A054B5ACB0A7D9684A39EB9AB1FE88217D286DAD8289B7DA70C580AC5A0794B6F1","orcidId":"0000-0002-2276-535X","documentHash":"60644408-0703-449c-88cf-309910c2470f"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e778","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Domański","uuid":"9AA19D7714102E2B4D1DC9C727A28D9449BB61E8E79054B9BF28DA43FAD7A250D868E49CD1BCFF3892D63BE41BF69C6E5AE6978214671EA3BD475FC87BE0309A","orcidId":"0000-0002-5375-5402","documentHash":"011531fc-6ded-409a-a2dc-b9a1349b8fd1"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e753","name":"Wiesława","lastName":"Piekarska","uuid":"3F39BA349B7FDA340E7453957E9826FB4BF3E88B005A0503649E9CAF084432658E87F8AC5D748C5DD168588CA52647DAB0B5C6058A9AF7F4C463138DF948F353","orcidId":"0000-0002-0185-1419","documentHash":"811730fb-617a-4207-a53e-8ae97bc3bee3"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15093243"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet

article considers the psychological and pedagogical conditions of the future engineers-teachers’ professional competence formation, pedagogical creativity as a component of pedagogical skills, as well as features of working with talented and gifted students as an important factor in effective professional development.\n\nThe psychological and pedagogical principles of linguistic activity of able and gifted students were studied. Scientific approaches to understanding of “ability” and “dedication” and their influence on language activity of non-philological specialties students are defined. The psychological and pedagogical principles of organization of interaction of the teacher and students were formulated.\n\nPedagogical psychology investigates the processes of development of students’ thinking, attention and memory, ability to perceive language facts and phenomena in their dialectical unity. For gifted students there are high enough development of thinking, long-term memorization of educational material, high efficiency, developed self-control skills in educational activity, ability to give doubt and scientific thinking certain stereotypes.

The methodology of the conducted research derives from Wiesław Banyś’s object-oriented approach and the notion of object class, understood as a set of nouns characterized by a group of operations (verbs) and attributes (adjectives) specific to them. In the previous work (Hrabia 2019), the operations of the <smells> object class were analysed; in the present article, the focus is put on the attributes. Thanks to the analysis based on the \"frTenTen17\" corpus, 76 attributes typical of the examined nouns, i.e. \"odeur\", \"parfum\", \"arôme\", \"puanteur\" and \"senteur\", were identified. In addition, it was shown that the <smells> class is not homogeneous and it does not form a hierarchical structure with the smaller classes that it consists of. The last part of the article presents a bilingual lexicographical “flashcard,” which is one of the description formats used in the objectoriented approach."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169726","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62876f464097073b3975ca7c","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"24","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"ff97294a-b213-4dbd-9795-138bd8b728b1"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"24","pagesFromTo":"167-185","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://czasopisma.uwm.edu.pl/index.php/pj/article/download/7606/5999","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092eb878c28a04739f35b","name":"Michał","lastName":"Hrabia","uuid":"BA35675F58DAB71717C37021D125D0FE98CC4C13C2F78E76DC2B8318CAF0E9D1D966961152621AD098D07A79B9E523C3BDAF96C352EF05FFFD88F664CBE73083","orcidId":"0000-0001-5477-8211","documentHash":"5f257a9b-89a9-40f8-acd7-a63345f7bb6c"}],"doi":"10.31648/pj.7606"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["restoration of reinforced concrete structures","fiber-reinforced plastics","pre-stress","single-span reinforced concrete beam"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61ae0ab02467f00bc8c552e2","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Satbayev University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6294b1364097070db8363001"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Strengthening and restoration of damaged reinforced concrete structures with composite plastics","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6294b1364097070db8362fff","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6294b1364097070db8363001","6294b1364097070db8363002"]},"issue":"1 (116)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper considers directions to devise methods for restoring the operational suitability of reinforced concrete structures. Mistakes of designers and non-compliance with the concreting technology of monolithic reinforced concrete structures lead to the formation of cracks and deflections of unacceptable size in reinforced concrete beams and floor slabs, as well as to insufficient strength of the elements. Such structures require not only an increase in bearing capacity but also the restoration of the operational suitability of damaged structures. A technique for restoring the serviceability of bendable reinforced concrete structures with increased deflections and excessive crack opening is proposed. To restore bendable reinforced concrete structures, surface reinforcement with pre-stressed fiber-reinforced plastics is suggested, which is ensured by the creation of a building lift in the damaged elements. Fiber-reinforced plastics have a high strain modulus, elastic nature of the diagram, and increased frost resistance; they tolerate fatigue effects well and are resistant to the effects of chemically active substances. Unlike conventional reinforcement methods, surface reinforcement techniques are characterized by high gain efficiency, corrosion resistance, low labor intensity, and short terms of work; they ensure strength increase and provide for economic feasibility. This study's results established that the use of fiber-reinforced plastics not only increases the bearing capacity of reinforced concrete structures but also helps reduce the width of the cracks formed. Thus, it is possible to avoid an increase in the cross-section of structures and reduce the time of operations, which could lead to additional costs"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058169732","journalIssue":{"objectId":"629479484097070db8335269","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"1 (116)","doi":"","documentHash":"5f79214b-c144-4d81-b4e8-2b1ebc6a66bd"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"81–86","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/view/254728/252844","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6294b1364097070db8363002","name":"aliy","lastName":"Bespayev","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7279-2180","documentHash":"18fefcf4-a2c4-48c9-abf7-235818778e6d"},{"objectId":"6294b1364097070db8363001","name":"Zhanna","lastName":"Mukhanbetzhanova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9672-4374","documentHash":"1d457c60-3e13-4aac-80f9-6fb42092c6b0"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.254728"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Aspekty zdrowotne związane z grillowaniem mięsa","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"61b9ac13ad204581b62ebb5f","mniswId":"201291","title":"Gospodarka Mięsna","doi":null,"issn":"0367-4916","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WCN","editor":null,"documentHash":"57e32b0b-6684-4c43-a54f-e51aad919955"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629cff9a4097070cd34d6813","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923b878c28a047392213","629cff9a4097070cd34d6815","629cff9a4097070cd34d6816","629cff9a4097070cd34d6817"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058172204","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"22-26","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://sigma-not.pl/zeszyt-6875-gospodarka-miesna-2022-5.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629cff9a4097070cd34d6817","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Dasiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9239e6d0-902d-4be8-a845-da0b46309359"},{"objectId":"629cff9a4097070cd34d6816","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Hać-Szymańczuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3914902b-79b2-4cfb-b694-f96d967e9dc8"},{"objectId":"629cff9a4097070cd34d6815","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Cegiełka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3d170caf-621c-4d20-b55c-9a5a847ebfa0"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a047392213","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Słowiński","uuid":"96ACD3DA259DC1D67F1607824E660E76FECCE13F8DE884A1E4AAA5EC842E81FC8567093FB5B08823CEDD8FC3227D2FFD316506EEB88E7669015B857808100938","orcidId":"0000-0002-5924-1277","documentHash":"845c49f2-66f2-4dd5-8916-695fd3d71e57"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["wzmocnienie poaktywacyjne (PAP); piłka siatkowa; trening oporowy; trening kompleksowy"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"608135d42467f0276870e0c9","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Instytut Nauk o Sporcie, Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Such materials include those which combine raw natural resources with waste subject to disposal. The objective of the performed investigations was an assessment of the influence of fly ashes on selected parameters of building materials. The paper proposes a method of the enrichment of clay with fly ash, which would lead to the neutralization of heavy metals in the burnt matrix, possible oxidation of organic substances present in the ashes, or the destruction of pathogens, as well as an increase of the resistance of the clay ceramics to low temperatures. Clay samples were prepared with the addition of the fly ash from three sewage treatment plants. The experiments encompassed investigations of physical and chemical properties of the fly ash, as well as bending strength tests of the beam-shaped samples heated at temperatures of 20, 300, 500, and 700 °C. The beam halves, resulting from the destruction of the samples during these tests, served for testing the compressive strength. The collected results allowed a comparison of the properties of the samples. The obtained test results confirm the possibility of manufacturing a product modified with the fly ash from the thermal treatment of sewage sludge.

However, their effectiveness (as well as other ventilation systems) is strongly dependent on the weather conditions, especially the outdoor temperature. This paper describes the results of real-scale experiments of the airflow in a staircase’s natural smoke exhaust system. The experimental staircase was localised in a medium-high building, “LabFactor” at the Lodz University of Technology in Poland. The experiments were performed over a period of six months, from February to July 2019, and included measurements of external and internal air temperature as well as the airflow through the staircase. The results obtained enabled an evaluation of the effectiveness of the ventilation and natural smoke exhaust system in the staircase, in relation to external temperatures. It was found that natural smoke exhaust systems could operate below an acceptable level of effectiveness for nearly 25% of the year. The experimental results were confirmed with CFD simulations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172227","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e6eab52467f030e8c433a6","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"6f6ef340-c61f-44fb-8d93-a045bc59a21f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"[1-22]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/3/933","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6735a706fdbe83034962c804","name":"Arleta","lastName":"Bogusławska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e8f255a1-cf4c-4029-b918-8eeb7e4028ec"},{"objectId":"5e709334878c28a0473a4e4d","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Brzezińska","uuid":"8C1F4E64C0137EEBCB9DB2D0C1B3A53AC24D18BA3F11D8D4F58097F21FC19F77A0420B08B452EFC6B8156159FB18415DB3DB4FC287A0667E3EECA2A06AAF2726","orcidId":"0000-0003-4615-4454","documentHash":"9b7b11e6-409d-4be6-b0d9-588fa3ce057d"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15030933"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["conjugate gradient method","descent direction","global property","strong Wolfe-Powell line search","unconstrained optimization"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61b1c02a2467f0304b83b91c","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"University of Mosul","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62964ed04097072fefbe1287"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A new modified HS algorithm with strong Powell-Wolfe line search for unconstrained optimization","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62964ed04097072fefbe1285","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62964ed04097072fefbe1287"]},"issue":"4 (116)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Optimization is now considered a branch of computational science. This ethos seeks to answer the question «what is best?» by looking at problems where the quality of any answer can be expressed numerically. One of the most well-known methods for solving nonlinear, unrestricted optimization problems is the conjugate gradient (CG) method. The Hestenes and Stiefel (HS-CG) formula is one of the century’s oldest and most effective formulas. When using an exact line search, the HS method achieves global convergence; however, this is not guaranteed when using an inexact line search (ILS). Furthermore, the HS method does not always satisfy the descent property. The goal of this work is to create a new (modified) formula by reformulating the classic parameter HS-CG and adding a new term to the classic HS-CG formula. It is critical that the proposed method generates sufficient descent property (SDP) search direction with Wolfe-Powell line (sWPLS) search at every iteration, and that global convergence property (GCP) for general non-convex functions can be guaranteed. Using the inexact sWPLS, the modified HS-CG (mHS-CG) method has SDP property regardless of line search type and guarantees GCP. When using an sWPLS, the modified formula has the advantage of keeping the modified scalar non-negative sWPLS. This paper is significant in that it quantifies how much better the new modification of the HS performance is when compared to standard HS methods. As a result, numerical experiments between the mHSCG method using the sWPL search and the standard HS optimization problem show that the CG method with the mHSCG conjugate parameter is more robust and effective than the CG method without the mHSCG parameter"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172229","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62964f434097072fefbe1a21","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"4

efficient separation and purification methods are the major obstacles in the production and further use of bioproducts. One such valuable bioproduct is the thermostable C-phycocyanin (C-PC). There is a great commercial need to develop C-PC production with an appropriate degree of purity. However, the selected methods and their sequences are also depended on the quality of crude extract obtained from biomass. In this paper three down-stream processing methods, such as foam fractionation (FF), which according to our knowledge has not been used for separation of C-PC, aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE) and conventional ultrafiltration were investigated for purification of thermostable C-PC from two crude extracts with lower and higher protein concentration and purity obtained from biomass of Synechococcus sp. PCC6715. The FF process resulted in a recovery yield of 49% and a purification factor of 1.472 without the addition of surfactants or pH adjustment. The most effective ATPSystem consists of polyethylene glycol 6000 and phosphate salt with a recovery yield of 97%, partitioning coefficient of about 28 and purification factor of 1.466. Ultrafiltration gave a recovery yield of 92% and purification factor of 1.123. Two possible ways of C-PC purification depending on the crude extract purity and concentration was proposed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172238","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61fa80ce2467f013ba947955","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"171","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"5b812f75-2aa8-4dc5-a0f8-2e13a4810e69"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"171","pagesFromTo":"1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0255270121002580?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6735a49ffdbe83034961f4cb","name":"Damian","lastName":"Pietrzyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3106e594-f0a4-4c4a-a49d-464cb240074e"},{"objectId":"6735a49ffdbe83034961f4ca","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Szeląg","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b9386bf3-f79a-40a2-bd40-40bf38719071"},{"objectId":"5e709334878c28a0473a4df8","name":"Anna","lastName":"Antecka","uuid":"FBCFBBDCBDA07CAB0616BC5B2E299F7DF53330A7F26E9829F8C3898C2269CC494820EBD156086DC038A599F4AB9BFFD9EAC7B0CA873E4BBC0F3F0EA7DF536FC2","orcidId":"0000-0001-9618-3136","documentHash":"2ad58994-9398-4764-b093-c108ae393eb3"},{"objectId":"5e709333878c28a0473a4ce4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Klepacz-Smółka","uuid":"1D55A329F9B486CE139D9A9C0FE77FE9FD8F15104199739AEB7E15DF7B71802F80A7FFE73E1FD88D6C6383005939F9B682D55EBD11C5B46920F77DF66C334C30","orcidId":"0000-0002-3589-8004","documentHash":"21ace3ae-f5e2-4649-9d15-86518613eab3"},{"objectId":"5e70926a878c28a0473954db","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Ledakowicz","uuid":"48BC21FF9E2156E2C03C269BE76BF8260BA8457E1326D656235BC35BA560DBC7B6E5E253948790444638AFC6C6F6660B12E8AD1B192F9DC4D29B0B6874E11554","orcidId":"0000-0003-2888-2650","documentHash":"20a37087-8054-4e95-8e3a-b8c99dd0a102"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.cep.2021.108563"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["glutamine","amino acid","laying hen","eggshell quality","eggshell cracking strength","eggshell mineralization"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defb","uid":"biMkjldDwyEilXl7rx-ushQ","uuid":"2c5489cb-fc19-40bb-b145-deea13bb2bfd","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defb","parentUuid":"2c5489cb-fc19-40bb-b145-deea13bb2bfd","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defb","rootUuid":"2c5489cb-fc19-40bb-b145-deea13bb2bfd","name":"Instytut Zootechniki -

Thirty-eight (44.18%) strains were connected with the infection of inclusion body hepatitis, 11 (12.79%) strains were isolated from digestive system dysfunction, 33 (38.37%) strains had been obtained from the flocks with no symptomatic changes/behaviour, and four (4.65%) strains were obtained from flocks with the manifestation of depression. Sequencing analysis was based on Loop L1 region of the HVR1-4 fragment of the hexon gene. The adenovirus strains were classified into five species FAdV-A-E, belonging to the following eight serotypes: FAdV-1/A, FAdV-5/B, FAdV-3/D, FAdV-2/11/D, FAdV-10/C, and FAdV-7/8a/E.

The presented work was aimed at investigation of colour changes of European oak (Quercus sp.) wood surface treated with iron (II) sulphate. Three different procedures differing in time (2 h and 24 h) and temperature (20 °C and 70 °C) were used, as well as three different concentrations of aqueous iron (II) sulphate solutions (10 20 %, 20 %, 30 %). Beside the colour itself, it was evaluated the stained oak wood discolouration due to natural weathering. Thanks to iron (II) sulphate, wood colour changed to dark grey. In general, the colour changes on tangential section of wood were higher than those on radial section what was result of wood structure, in particular parenchyma cells arrangement in wooden rays. Contrary to expectations, the concentration of the iron (II) sulphate solution was not of significant importance for wood staining. Usage of concentrations higher than 10 % for the modification of the colour of wood gives the same effects. However, with increasing solution used to wood staining, the colour stability of the wood decreases during external exposure. The parameters of the procedure were not significantly affected.

However, recent high abstractions are threatening the sustainable use of groundwater, and action is needed to ensure continued supply. Increased managed aquifer recharge (MAR) using the > 200,000 existing tanks (artificially created surface water bodies) is one of the Indian government’s key initiatives to combat declining groundwater levels. However, few studies have directly examined the effectiveness of tank recharge, particularly in the complex fractured hydrogeology of Peninsular India. To address this gap, this study examined the impact of tanks in three crystalline bedrock catchments in Karnataka, southern India, by analysing the isotopic and hydrochemical composition of surface waters and groundwaters, combined with groundwater level observations. The results indicate that tanks have limited impact on regional groundwater recharge and quality in rural areas, where recharge from precipitation and groundwater recycling from irrigation dominate the recharge signal. In the urban setting (Bengaluru), impermeable surfaces increased the relative effect of recharge from point sources such as tanks and rivers, but where present, pipe leakage from public-water-supply accounted for the majority of recharge. Shallow groundwater levels in the inner parts of the city may lead to groundwater discharge to tanks, particularly in the dry season. We conclude that the importance of aquifer recharge from tanks is limited compared to other recharge sources and highly dependent on the specific setting. Additional studies to quantify tank recharge and revisions to the current guidelines for national groundwater recharge estimations, using a less generalised approach, are recommended to avoid over-estimating the role tanks play in groundwater recharge."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172276","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589915522000037","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629c9cf84097070cd3480c83","name":"Veena","lastName":"Srinivasan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a42e673b-9b42-42a9-a332-61c522e53b89"},{"objectId":"629c9cf84097070cd3480c82","name":"Siva Naga Venkat","lastName":"Nara","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8d74d738-4dee-4e2c-b9eb-bfb94d7ccef9"},{"objectId":"629c9cf84097070cd3480c81","name":"Muddu","lastName":"Sekhar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3d679444-0776-422c-ac01-e7a8b79e184c"},{"objectId":"629c9cf84097070cd3480c80","name":"Andrew A.","lastName":"McKenzie","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"76fc79f4-ed8d-4ec7-b71c-d886238d812c"},{"objectId":"629c9cf84097070cd3480c7f","name":"Alan M.","lastName":"MacDonald","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5cbd2219-fab4-43ff-bd7e-45eb93ad70d5"},{"objectId":"629c9cf84097070cd3480c7e","name":"Sian E.","lastName":"Loveless","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2f853dc2-f5e5-4c8d-89b2-7fa81f18b2f1"},{"objectId":"629c9cf84097070cd3480c7d","name":"Dan J.","lastName":"Lapworth","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7832fa3d-fc13-4dda-b975-6acc47dd83fa"},{"objectId":"629c9cf84097070cd3480c7c","name":"Bentje","lastName":"Brauns","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"35eb9357-f1ab-41ef-89f6-37564a037c11"},{"objectId":"609d11119543c73526c48e21","name":"Somsubhra","lastName":"Chattopadhyay","uuid":"CC86EB0DB9649B4012551CA6C511E27F7487D67F0D142D3952D2B6C2E5220A2C343913AE94B4A2042B675D73C4202BDBA2167E8D6C45C19326CDD18201E60CF7","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e5a40621-633d-4118-b29e-f013e601c518"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.hydroa.2022.100121"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"619eeea57523402fabdec1a7","uid":"bcD6ws1rBvMgqVrdBUveYFQ","uuid":"db928bb7-b202-4ae0-bb7c-d44c14aa8031","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Katedra Biotechnologii, Mikrobiologii i Żywienia Człowieka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709225878c28a047390a14","5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a71","5e7094f6878c28a0473c8129"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Effect of TiO2 on selected pathogenic and opportunistic intestinal bacteria","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547734f","mniswId":"2449","title":"Biological Trace Element Research","doi":null,"issn":"0163-4984","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d1959b82-6ceb-44de-aad4-b046ad9b5865"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-07-23","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61fa8f0b2467f066d656b25f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093d7878c28a0473b1a71","5e7094f6878c28a0473c8129","5e709225878c28a047390a14"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Food-grade titanium dioxide (TiO2) containing a nanoparticle fraction (TiO2 NPs-nanoparticles) is widely used as a food additive (E171 in the EU).

A pot experiment was carried out to determine the effects of Zn–Pb contamination on nodule apoplast (cell walls and intercellular spaces) of bird's foot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) that spontaneously colonized old calamine wastes. The plants were grown in pots filled with sterile calamine substrate (M, metal treated) or expanded clay (NM, untreated) and inoculated with calamine-derived Lotus-nodulating Bradyrhizobium liaoningense. Apoplast reorganization in the nodules was examined using specific dyes for cellulose, pectin and lignin detection, and immuno-histochemical techniques based on monoclonal antibodies against xyloglucan (Lm25), pectins (Jim5 and Jim7), and structural proteins (arabinogalactan protein - Lm14 and extensin - Jim12). Microscopic analysis of metal-treated nodules revealed changes in the apoplast structure and composition of nodule cortex tissues and infected cells. Wall thickening was accompanied by intensified deposition of cellulose, xyloglucan, esterified pectin, arabinogalactan protein and extensin. The metal presence redirected also lignin and suberin deposition in the walls of the nodule cortex tissues.\r\nOur results showed reorganization of the apoplast of cortex tissues and infected cells of Lotus nodules under Zn–Pb presence. These changes in the apoplast structure and composition may have created actual barriers for the toxic ions. For this reason, they can be regarded as an element of legume defense strategy against metal stress that enables effective functioning of L. corniculatus-rhizobia symbiosis on Zn–Pb polluted calamine tailings."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172283","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"268","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0176161721002005?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629cf12a4097070cd34d5714","name":"Arletta","lastName":"Kochańska-Jeziorska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bbcb51da-3073-4d94-a948-3bf034789725"},{"objectId":"5e709499878c28a0473c031d","name":"Anna","lastName":"Rusaczonek","uuid":"85B20E9001212450BE171B5B13452B8774EA9628B27E9828E3F3CFA87A6930E0A503C7C7F0D39FFF64D4DBF78F41F5DCC1499BE47F4449F06EB8AA890C2B7E2B","orcidId":"0000-0001-9677-4614","documentHash":"49db42a1-9fe1-4fb1-b58a-a7d044fe67f7"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941d0","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Sujkowska-Rybkowska","uuid":"DED2A876370D93084374C25ADDE169A18A5192EB0020708DF3D285376FDDE7CCCEB67B2CA811EF9C04DDCC1D91FF684B5454B2818A78736A1F307AB9C800A2E3","orcidId":"0000-0002-5234-2008","documentHash":"163ffb8c-d9e8-41c4-8c7a-29316b960861"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jplph.2021.153561"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["auxin-related compound","Bryophyllum calycinum","indole-3-acetic acid","methyl jasmonate","plant hormone dynamics","secondary abscission"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","5e709400878c28a0473b4af1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A Possible Mode of Action of Methyl Jasmonate to Induce the Secondary Abscission Zone in Stems of <i>Bryophyllum calycinum</i>: Relevance to Plant Hormone Dynamics","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547e776","mniswId":"25607","title":"Plants","doi":null,"issn":"2223-7747","eissn":"2223-7747","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"dae8e400-cb70-4c3b-acbe-f4f64f06f071"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61fa24bb2467f013ba90af09","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709401878c28a0473b4b5b","61fa24bb2467f013ba90af0c","61fa24bb2467f013ba90af0d","61fa24bb2467f013ba90af0e","5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b85","5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","5e709400878c28a0473b4af1"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Plants can react to environmental stresses through the abscission of infected, damaged, or senescent organs. A possible mode of action of methyl jasmonate (JA-Me) to induce the formation of the secondary abscission zone (SAZ) in the stems of Bryophyllum calycinum was investigated concerning plant hormone dynamics. Internode segments were prepared mainly from the second or third internode from the top of plants with active elongation. JA-Me applied to the middle of internode segments induced the SAZ formation above and below the treatment after 5–7 days. At 6 to 7 days after JA-Me treatment, the above and below internode pieces adjacent to the SAZ were excised and subjected to comprehensive analyses of plant hormones. The endogenous levels of auxin-related compounds between both sides adjacent to the SAZ were quite different. No differences were observed in the level of jasmonic acid (JA), but the contents of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA), a precursor of JA, and N-jasmonyl-leucine (JA-Leu) substantially decreased on the JA-Me side. Almost no effects of JA-Me on the dynamics of other plant hormones (cytokinins, abscisic acid, and gibberellins) were observed. Similar JA-Me effects on plant hormones and morphology were observed in the last internode of the decapitated growing plants. These suggest that the application of JA-Me induces the SAZ in the internode of B. calycinum by affecting endogenous levels of auxin- and jasmonate-related compounds."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172290","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e7d6632467f05e2961f3fe","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"11","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"d3f788bd-8bc4-46da-a86f-64fc6aa76c38"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"360","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/11/3/360","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61fa24bb2467f013ba90af0e","name":"Kensuke","lastName":"Miyamoto","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6be1ba62-4c04-445c-9cfc-2cc675344b13"},{"objectId":"61fa24bb2467f013ba90af0d","name":"Junichi","lastName":"Ueda","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7b436c1f-0ac6-44fe-b521-27ea49ecf078"},{"objectId":"61fa24bb2467f013ba90af0c","name":"Marian","lastName":"Saniewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9263daf2-c7d9-4401-bdda-2533a242a425"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Marasek-Ciołakowska","uuid":"6FAB3AE6D9EBCFA4FD26AA8B3CD63FA73B99A6498DEF6A1770D2A9643E68A306803F24C467726C9A84745750C9B2D96EDD4F279404023C905B13853E9A49233F","orcidId":"0000-0001-9349-2566","documentHash":"1c86d2dd-6830-448a-8df1-57210e29a74d"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4b5b","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Kowalska","uuid":"532470935FFE12D8B26391F48EA6285EBD2AB2217243563CE7423338BB3BC665CABB0925A6B888B898E0E195F902FC2DCF3DEFB88BBC81865A7A7F5495842717","orcidId":"0000-0003-1806-0493","documentHash":"62007188-3515-4fd4-b767-cf6cc1109c4f"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4af1","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Góraj-Koniarska","uuid":"9FC40A1F1A091811F5417DDDC0A27F9D6E4A7EBB7061A55729BDF382AC1C4764ACC6D5ECDCECC86E5F3AF92A60C7C453705F203CC84916CE364E17F25BA5DC27","orcidId":"0000-0001-7667-0279","documentHash":"2201bd21-407f-41c6-b322-bf2d514266ed"},{"objectId":"5e7093f0878c28a0473b3b85","name":"Michał","lastName":"Dziurka","uuid":"C508B84A3E98AF91D4A7CF2B3F96DCF5CDDD04199D55EC6231120160D35F2346ADF8454B963FAF986327F88BE636B80D8617AF7648BCC065B4DC89242B986449","orcidId":"0000-0002-8265-6243","documentHash":"2fccdaa3-374f-450a-82fb-cb867a75d10a"}],"doi":"10.3390/plants11030360"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Sustainable Urban Transport - Why a Fast Investment in a Complete Cycling Network Is Most Profitable for a City","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","doi":null,"issn":"2071-1050","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"76492123-acbe-4743-a4ae-6a63f3108e24"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629c9c794097070cd3480b66","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923d878c28a047392376","5e7091f3878c28a04738d9ff","629c9c794097070cd3480b69"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The development of safe cycling as a mode of transport is an important objective of the transformation towards sustainable mobility in European cities.

The article presented a simulation of the Perfect Cycling City Model in real conditions that inspired the design of two scenarios for the fast development of bicycle routes in a key transport network area in Warsaw. Scenario 1 assumes building subsidiary bicycle routes and links between the main routes. In Scenario 2, the development of all optimal cycling links at the local level is assumed. An increase in cycling participation is expected in both scenarios. The comparison of projected costs of each scenario indicated that building a complete network of connections is more profitable in terms of increased cycling participation and could counter the dominance of private car use.

One of the devices for controlling the outflow of groundwater from a network of ditches is a flow regulator. In this work, three flow regulators were studied for their water damming capacity in the drainage network and the adjacent ground with the aim of determining their hydraulic characteristics and operating conditions. The adjustment consisted of changing the closing height in order to obtain the required damming level in a ditch. All three tested regulators were characterized by the presence of effective flow Qe, the value of which was determined for different damming levels. Water leaks occurred mainly in places where the damming elements were embedded in vertical guides and, to a lesser extent, at the horizontal joints of successively placed beams. The impact of the overflow shape and the development of the crest line on the obtained flow rate increase was different for the tested S, U, and Z models. The expansion coefficient of the overflow crest equaled kr = 1.0 for the rectilinear S regulator, kr = 1.58 for the labyrinth U regulator, and kr = 1.74 for the compound Z regulator. For the S4 variant, the modular total flow factor reached kQ = 1.19 for the elevation of the upper water above the overflow H = 14.9 cm.

The reported experiments were conducted using data on hourly electricity consumption at the metallurgical plant AO ArcelorMittal Temirtau in the period from January 1, 2019, to November 30, 2021. The current research is related to the planned introduction of a balancing electricity market. 96 combinations of basic models were compiled, differing in the type of neural network, the set of initial data, the order of lag, the learning algorithm, and the number of neurons in the hidden layer. It has been determined that the NARX-type network is the most optimal architecture to forecast electricity consumption. Based on experimental studies, the number of hidden neurons needed to form a planned daily profile should equal 3 or 4; it is recommended to use the conjugate gradient method as a learning algorithm. When selecting models from three groups, it was revealed that the conjugate gradient method produces better results compared to the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. It is determined that the values of the selected RMSE error indicator take values of 23.17, 22.54, and 22.56, respectively, for the first, second, and third data groups. The adaptive hybridization method has been shown to reduce the RMSE error rate to 21.73. However, the weights of the best models with values of 0.327 for the first group of data, and 0.336 for the second and third ones, show that the individual use of a separate combination of models is also applicable. The devised forecasting electricity consumption model can be integrated into an automated electricity metering system"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172314","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62974e8140970702be5282b2","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"8 (116)","doi":"","documentHash":"3f6221f1-4348-4649-a145-a2fa45a923e7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"6-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/254477/252942","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6297512940970702be529fb6","name":"Yermek","lastName":"Sarsikeyev","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7209-5024","documentHash":"8eef0059-b524-4212-a3d6-c2253bf34391"},{"objectId":"6297512940970702be529fb5","name":"Yuliya","lastName":"Bulatbayeva","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3900-5568","documentHash":"63c84d7e-a81c-401b-809c-8bb4dd46900a"},{"objectId":"6297512940970702be529fb4","name":"Gulnara","lastName":"Ibrayeva","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0158-5333","documentHash":"63c99df9-7f62-4f66-8d7f-2f3252e77c02"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.254477"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709217878c28a04738fd7b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Assessment of antifungal efficacy and release behavior of fungicide-loaded chitosan-carrageenan nanoparticles against phytopathogenic fungi","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479331","mniswId":"16369","title":"POLYMERS","doi":null,"issn":"2073-4360","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"75c28aac-8cdb-4fcc-8756-104cf361c90b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-23","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629ddd924097073d586aa450","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["629ddd924097073d586aa452","629ddd924097073d586aa453","629ddd934097073d586aa454","629ddd934097073d586aa455","629ddd934097073d586aa456","5e709217878c28a04738fd7b","629ddd934097073d586aa458","629ddd934097073d586aa459","629ddd934097073d586aa45a"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Biopolymeric Chitosan-Carrageenan nanocomposites 66.6–231.82 nm in size containing the chemical fungicide mancozeb (nano CSCRG-M) were synthesized following a green chemistry approach. The physicochemical study of nanoparticles (NPs) was accomplished using a particle size analyzer, SEM and FTIR. TEM exhibited clover leaf-shaped nanoparticles (248.23 nm) with mancozeb on the inside and entrapped outside. Differential scanning calorimetry and TGA thermogravimetry exhibited the thermal behaviour of the nanoform. Nano CSCRG-1.5 at 1.5 ppm exhibited 83.1% inhibition against Alternaria solani in an in vitro study and performed as well as mancozeb (84.6%). Complete inhibition was exhibited in Sclerotinia sclerotiorum at 1.0 and 1.5 ppm with the nanoformulation. The in vivo disease control efficacy of mancozeb-loaded nanoparticles against A. solani in pathogenized plants was found to be relatively higher (79.4 ± 1.7) than that of commercial fungicide (76 ± 1.1%) in pot conditions. Nanomancozeb showed superior efficacy for plant growth parameters, such as germination percentage, root–shoot ratio and dry biomass. The nanoformulation showed higher cell viability compared to mancozeb in Vero cell cultures at 0.25 and 0.50 mg/mL in the resazurin assay. CSCRG-0.5 showed slow-release behavior up to 10 h.

It has been shown that pomace, due to its energy value, can be a good fuel. The obtained thermal data confirm the presence of cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignins and pectins in the analyzed pomace.

This study aimed to investigate the properties of yogurt-type rice-based beverages fermented with lactic acid bacteria and Propionibacterium. The changes in pH, viable population of bacteria, physical properties, and carbohydrate content of these beverages were tested. Fermentation using only Propionibacterium was insufficient to obtain a product with an acidity level similar to that of milk-based yogurt (pH < 4.5). After fermentation, the tested beverages had a high number of Lactobacillus sp. (7.42–8.23 log10 CFU/mL), Streptococcus thermophilus (8.01–8.65 log10 CFU/mL), and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (8.28–8.50 log10 CFU/mL). The hardness (2.90–10.40 N) and adhesiveness (13.79–42.16 mJ) of the samples after 14 days of storage at 6 °C varied depending on the starter culture used. The syneresis of all samples ranged between 29% and 31%, which was lower or close to that of milk-based yogurts. The content of individual sugars in the samples also varied depending on the starter culture used for fermentation. The results suggest that the combination of lactic and propionic fermentation helps in the production of rice-based yogurt-type milk substitutes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172340","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/8/2558","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629d00ba4097070cd34d698b","name":"Anna","lastName":"Ziębicka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fc181076-0be6-4506-8ceb-454d0c762b96"},{"objectId":"629d00ba4097070cd34d698a","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Cichońska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"14d381f0-367c-4686-897e-0d2ef65fb80b"},{"objectId":"5e70923b878c28a0473921f5","name":"MAŁGORZATA","lastName":"ZIARNO","uuid":"B545E3E1D2BBB16806233E4FF7CFD3B4789F2D33C7F94BF6CD7F12FD96D131A43F7678875D4DAB7C68BDB05B10488D911C894703CBFCD8E5B2491AE7DA9CAC88","orcidId":"0000-0001-7445-6375","documentHash":"0351d7a7-0b1d-487f-a357-0028c30fe438"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules27082558"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["szkolnictwo

Regulation of CRLs needs neddylation, a post-translational modification involving an enzymatic cascade that transfers small, ubiquitin-like NEDD8 protein to CRLs. Many previous studies have confirmed neddylation as an enticing target for anticancer drug discoveries, and few recent studies have also found a significant increase in advancement in protein neddylation, including preclinical and clinical target validation to discover the neddylation inhibitor compound. In the present review, we first presented briefly the essence of CRLs' neddylation and its control, systematic analysis of CRLs, followed by the description of a few recorded chemical inhibitors of CRLs neddylation enzymes with recent examples of preclinical and clinical targets. We have also listed various structure-based pointing of protein–protein dealings in the CRLs' neddylation reaction, and last, the methods available to discover new inhibitors of neddylation are elaborated. This review will offer a concentrated, up-to-date, and detailed description of the discovery of neddylation inhibitors."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172360","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13205-022-03162-x","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629cfd584097070cd34d646e","name":"Hira","lastName":"Sajjad","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"53e56799-b7d0-4d82-973f-f04e2855458f"},{"objectId":"629cfd584097070cd34d646d","name":"Liviu","lastName":"Giurgiulescu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8bd58aba-0773-4a6b-bc62-056693af632d"},{"objectId":"629cfd584097070cd34d646c","name":"Min","lastName":"Zhao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6531e9cb-fcac-4f6c-9fe5-38bc9cc34493"},{"objectId":"629cfd584097070cd34d646b","name":"Moolchand","lastName":"Malhi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"41e889e7-b96d-40fc-a554-46696d55c0b1"},{"objectId":"629cfd584097070cd34d646a","name":"Iqra","lastName":"Bano","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"68bc1f8c-6f6b-49bc-9091-1e39e439dc07"},{"objectId":"5e70943c878c28a0473b89a6","name":"Marek","lastName":"Kieliszek","uuid":"BF17B535A9DF7D5B71F0115DCAF96BF5B94A7C45AEB042E97F0F6906CA0A44B181AF535EF66D52D534049192E65B097C644136630E7ED390A314A25DE2C83EBA","orcidId":"0000-0002-5836-4865","documentHash":"f0c6999e-62a7-4e42-ac70-c769fa3373a5"}],"doi":"10.1007/s13205-022-03162-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Amelanchier alnifolia","chromosome doubling","octoploids","colchicine","oryzalin","trifluralin","amiprophos methyl"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709401878c28a0473b4c23","5e709200878c28a04738e669","5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","5e7094a7878c28a0473c1102","5e70928e878c28a047397dd7","5e709292878c28a047398339"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"In Vitro Induction and Primary Evaluation of Octoploid Plants in Saskatoon Berry (Amelanchier alnifolia Nutt.)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d9","mniswId":"689","title":"Agronomy","doi":null,"issn":"2073-4395","eissn":"2073-4395","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"f748c34e-fa45-428e-abf2-7624cc5986fd"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-18","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62970c0d40970702be4dcec1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928e878c28a047397dd7","5e709292878c28a047398339","5e709401878c28a0473b4c23","5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","5e709200878c28a04738e669","5e7094a7878c28a0473c1102"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Polyploids of many species of horticultural plants are widely used in breeding programs since they are characterized by vigorous growth, larger organs, and greater resistance to biotic and abiotic stress. Saskatoon berry (Amelanchier alnifolia Nutt.) is in a form of diploid (2n = 2x = 34) and tetraploid. So far, no reports on induction of polyploidy in this species have been found. The aim of the study was to obtain Saskatoon berry octoploids with the use of in vitro shoot cultures. Shoots of the tetraploid of Canadian cultivars ‘Martin’ and ‘Smoky’ derived from in vitro cultures were used for induction of chromosome doubling. The shoot explants were incubated in a multiplication medium with the addition of one of the following antimitotics: colchicine, trifluralin, oryzalin or amiprophos methyl (APM) for two weeks (six days in the darkness and then eight days under a 16-h photoperiod). Then, the shoots were transferred to the multiplication medium without antimitotics and propagated in vitro by two subcultures. Octoploids were selected based on flow cytometry. Trifluralin showed the most phytotoxic effect. Six octoploids were obtained, four for ‘Martin’ after treatment with 250 mg L−1 of colchicine and two for ‘Smoky’ following the treatment with 5 mg L−1 of APM. All obtained octoploid individuals were multiplied and the level of ploidy was re-examined by flow cytometry and chromosome counting, which confirmed their octoploid genotype (2n = 8x = 136). They are probably the first octoploids of the genus Amelanchier in the world. The newly obtained octoploids were rooted in vitro, acclimatized to ex vitro conditions and grown in a greenhouse. Octoploids grew very slowly and showed a tendency to premature dormancy, which was manifested by inhibition of growth. In octoploid plants, the stomata were significantly larger and the number of stomata per 1 mm2 of leaf area was lower, compared to the tetraploid counterparts."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172363","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62692e65409707015987748f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"994a1483-997c-49d4-8a3f-ea247a0a685a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1215","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/5/1215/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a7878c28a0473c1102","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Seliga","uuid":"CACBC0870CB157C461F900A444A42A1003A1358653DCE690FA7817C97D022571577B326BF6A9F98C765F25CF1B1F866F7C72D013982E6B727B35707609E0105C","orcidId":"0000-0002-1687-5499","documentHash":"a328f130-9c53-44ef-83c5-c9f648366336"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7e1c","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Marasek-Ciołakowska","uuid":"6FAB3AE6D9EBCFA4FD26AA8B3CD63FA73B99A6498DEF6A1770D2A9643E68A306803F24C467726C9A84745750C9B2D96EDD4F279404023C905B13853E9A49233F","orcidId":"0000-0001-9349-2566","documentHash":"1c86d2dd-6830-448a-8df1-57210e29a74d"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4c23","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Trzewik","uuid":"D90C1CC0E3D83B2B2F1625FA9A565157E627A2F8323223BC45F4856253F9A5C521B1E693EDA380BA27885A8406155EF8FD57CE6A8284BCCC3A80B5B041839784","orcidId":"0000-0003-0378-5440","documentHash":"13bbbab7-04ee-4311-b6f2-c929ad4744a8"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a047398339","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Podwyszyńska","uuid":"B2F52BE0F8A5B79B13A48C312966FAF67C57B8B98C867157CF8141B8D7208AF78325A4F99008EDCBA6781E8BB00736EC29CC4B6CD7950AC77678B349D9B9CC47","orcidId":"0000-0003-3005-4053","documentHash":"685f5ee6-b147-4b3e-b614-46c6ff16b171"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397dd7","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Kucharska","uuid":"0D8534221F0E905762DB2BCEFE1FCD90BD80EFFFBF0CAB2F3E4ACF5A7915B7391930D4FD47B34F736BFCA6AF9B23690A150677DF595F5413882D2E19B7C93360","orcidId":"0000-0002-9635-967X","documentHash":"99bf01ad-9202-4adc-aaaf-9fc06294d218"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e669","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Pluta","uuid":"A389F119DF07BF98605FE425265C9D7AAFC056C945E0F9E7F5B4B226B0057BD6E8D3D999781461C4DD166DE67E1F1EED446BB62F6F662DA5A98F3DB3747DFCD6","orcidId":"0000-0003-2837-7304","documentHash":"c4cc3f4e-bb2b-4925-be1d-b7e627597a4a"}],"doi":"10.3390/agronomy12051215"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Satellite-derived rainfall\nReal-time\nCentral Europe\nHigh resolution\nGridded dataset"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Hydrological application and accuracy evaluation of PERSIANN satellite-based precipitation estimates over a humid continental climate catchment","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c885","mniswId":"11386","title":"Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2214-5818","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"c4d5ca0b-a805-43bb-8259-8e725f906bd7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629c9ea64097070cd3480d4f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709249878c28a047393119","629c9ea64097070cd3480d53","629c9ea64097070cd3480d54"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Study region: The Wełna catchment (52◦30’–53◦N and 16◦35’–17◦50’E) is a medium-sized, lowland\r\ncatchment in the central part of Poland in Central Europe with a total catchment area of\r\n2621 km2.\r\nStudy focus: Research evaluating the performing of satellite-based precipitation datasets in Poland\r\nand Central Europe is scarce.

Estimates of PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS intake via eggs based lower-bound concentrations were 0.00–0.65 ng/kg b.w for children and 0.00–0.21 ng/kg b.w for adults which corresponds to 0–15% of the tolerable weekly intake (TWI) and 0–5% TWI for children and adult respectively."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172376","journalIssue":{"objectId":"629735df40970702be5104d3","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"303","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"77a2f704-b346-4410-9243-b1f6268ba811"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"303","pagesFromTo":"134950","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0045653522014436?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094d4878c28a0473c4d63","name":"Marek","lastName":"Pajurek","uuid":"358255257A75C74D59A14A68D4AD1D554284D6EA9DD40FBD386D3E65CF5750BD0AFFF658AA426C816DC388F1A156AECE3148D4AE805CC056A07EFA22690EE5D5","orcidId":"0000-0002-8222-7983","documentHash":"7f676a9f-a4bf-48d6-8a81-13e7fdd64d47"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0dfa","name":"Szczepan","lastName":"Mikołajczyk","uuid":"C57E964869276842E1B6331B9082F2B02A42D6FADD90FF381F756A49C8569C2E04C6F6ABF9E834E4B7AB5848A68D8684085BA83752893DAFEA5BB142A62126BA","orcidId":"0000-0003-0185-174X","documentHash":"40314827-db15-4c91-940f-4476439025a4"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be3c4","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Warenik-Bany","uuid":"4712B9142F37DE7444F67A0D87EE1C663B7551CC5403CE356609DD8451AC163AE66C02975F4E46C75BA54D138152C7CA025EC98E7A9BBC1C46CE7FDB9A2F3D49","orcidId":"0000-0002-3839-6464","documentHash":"a8205408-5907-4d58-85e1-a99171e81d41"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.134950"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["thermal destruction","thermal gravimetric analysis","catalysts","microsilicate","oil sludge"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61b0a2c52467f078640a58c2","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Karaganda Buketov University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["629735ee40970702be5105d1","629735ee40970702be5105cf","629735ee40970702be5105cd","629735ee40970702be5105ce","629735ee40970702be5105d0"]},{"id":"629735ee40970702be5105cc","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Xinjiang University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["629735ee40970702be5105d2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Kinetic study of the thermolysis process of oil sludge (atasu-alashankou) with nickel, cobalt and iron deposited on microsilicate","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629735ee40970702be5105ca","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["629735ee40970702be5105cd","629735ee40970702be5105ce","629735ee40970702be5105cf","629735ee40970702be5105d0","629735ee40970702be5105d1","629735ee40970702be5105d2"]},"issue":"6 (116)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The object of research is the process of thermal degradation of oil sludge in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts.\n\nThe creation of efficient technological processes for processing the organic part of oil sludge into motor fuels, raw materials for petrochemicals and the disposal of microsilicate is an important urgent task, the solution of which will allow to obtain a significant economic and environmental effect. The problem to be solved is to establish the general kinetic laws of the process of thermal degradation of oil sludge in the presence of microsilicate with deposited metals. The advantage of the Ozawa– Flynn–Wall method is that it is possible to determine the kinetic parameters for each value of oil sludge conversion, that is, for different stages of thermal degradation. The activation energy of oil sludge 67.1 kJ/mol, and with a catalyst 59 kJ/mol are calculated for each degree of conversion (α), respectively. The value of the correlation coefficient was (R2≥0.997) provides good convergence with experimental results. Compared with other methods of thermal processing of oil sludge, catalytic thermal degradation has a number of advantages: relatively low process temperatures (400–650 °C), low sensitivity to the composition of raw materials and the processing process, which meets all modern requirements of chemical production.\n\nRegularities of thermokinetic parameters of thermal decomposition of oil sludge were studied using raw materials obtained during the process of oil transportation, in the presence of catalyst with applied metal (nickel, iron, cobalt) to microsilicate. Obtained results of oil sludge decomposition kinetics can be used in creating a database for mathematical modeling of process of heavy hydrocarbon raw materials

The level of exposure to nanosilver is constantly raising, and a growing body of research highlights that it is harmful to the health, especially the nervous system, of humans. The potential pathways through which nanosilver affects neurons include the release of silver ions and the associated induction of oxidative stress. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the neurotoxicity of nanosilver, in this study we exposed male Wistar rats to 0.5 mg/kg body weight of AgNPs coated with bovine serum albumin (BSA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), or citrate, or to AgNO3 as a source of silver ions for 28 days and assessed the expression of antioxidant defense markers in the hippocampus of the exposed animals after 1 week of spatial memory training. We also evaluated the influence of AgNPs coating on neurosteroidogenesis in the rat hippocampus. The results showed that AgNPs disrupted the antioxidant system in the hippocampus and induced oxidative stress in a coating-dependent manner, which could potentially be responsible for neurodegeneration and cognitive disorders. The analysis of the influence of AgNPs on neurosteroids also indicated coating-dependent modulation of steroid levels with a significant decrease in the concentrations of progesterone and 17α-progesterone in AgNPs(BSA), AgNPs(PEG), and Ag+ groups. Furthermore, exposure to AgNPs or Ag+ resulted in the downregulation of selected genes involved in antioxidant defense (Cat), neurosteroid synthesis (Star, Hsd3b3, Hsd17b1, and Hsd17b10), and steroid metabolism (Ar, Er1, and Er2). In conclusion, depending on the coating material used for their stabilization, AgNPs induced oxidative stress and modulated the concentrations of steroids as well as the expression of genes involved in steroid synthesis and metabolism.

this study, titanium dioxide/copper oxide thin-film solar cells were prepared using the reactive direct-current magnetron sputtering technique. The influence of the deposition time of the top Cu contact layer on the structural and electrical properties of photovoltaic devices was analyzed. The structural and morphological characterization of the TiO2/CuO/Cu2O solar cells was fully studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and current– voltage (I-V) characteristics. Additionally, using van der Pauw sample geometries, the electrical properties of the titanium dioxide and copper oxide layers were investigated. From the XRD study, solar cells were observed in cubic (Cu2O), monoclinic (CuO), and Ti3O5 phases. In addition, the crystallite size and dislocation density for copper oxide layers were calculated. Basic morphological parameters (thickness, mechanism of growth, and composition of elements) were analyzed via scanning electron microscopy. The thicknesses of the titanium d oxide and coper oxide layers were in the range of 43–55 nm and 806–1223 nm, respectively. Furthermore, the mechanism of growth and the basic composition of the elements of layers were analyzed. The I-V characteristic curve confirms the photovoltaic behavior of two titanium dioxide/copper oxide thin-film structures. The values of short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the solar cells were: 4.0 ± 0.8 µA/cm2 , 16.0 ± 4.8 mV and 0.43 ± 0.61 µA/cm2 , 0.54 ± 0.31 mV, respectively. In addition, the authors presented the values of Isc, Pmax, FF, and Rsh. Finally, the resistivity, carrier concentration, and mobility are reported for selected layers with values reflecting the current literature."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172417","journalIssue":{"objectId":"629dd25c4097073d5869d643","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"8","doi":null,"documentHash":"61bd6161-5978-4463-a6f1-8017d0194b38"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1328","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-4991/12/8/1328","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67371a0cfdbe832d85af1c1b","name":"Marta","lastName":"Ruszała","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"983f52e3-3d1d-4de3-870b-e180db816173"},{"objectId":"67371a0cfdbe832d85af1c1a","name":"Lyubomyr","lastName":"Nykyruy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8d75f1bc-51ac-4e6f-9221-283fd61c5c6b"},{"objectId":"67371a0cfdbe832d85af1c19","name":"R.","lastName":"Yavorskyi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eb65d657-5bac-4b84-9daf-d772227d5ba1"},{"objectId":"67371a0cfdbe832d85af1c18","name":"Marian","lastName":"Cholewa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f9a8502a-a160-48c5-9c6c-2e4d3bc89c50"},{"objectId":"67371a0cfdbe832d85af1c17","name":"M.","lastName":"Bester","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"99058e79-0861-4fcc-94d6-ff92185f0c6d"},{"objectId":"67371a0cfdbe832d85af1c16","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Płoch","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f883a5b2-7221-4e59-ad55-211850ee7605"},{"objectId":"67371a0cfdbe832d85af1c15","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Sawicka-Chudy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a2ac9d71-1dbd-4a8d-b116-17e763338d22"},{"objectId":"67371a0cfdbe832d85af1c14","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Wisz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"60d08cee-a60f-4d1c-9d99-91f30d3614c0"},{"objectId":"5e709334878c28a0473a4d95","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Woźny","uuid":"683C56DE95A905DBF9A84E510C8C04F55B6F749E44696B7F544FD9BD00DA3A3A52C88275CEE4122C73D5003E4BBFDC77002D0E06E7165F5926EFDD573921BB46","orcidId":"0000-0002-0557-165X","documentHash":"7538118c-d1ae-4500-ae9f-daf3a5c66a8e"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a0473952ee","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Sibiński","uuid":"3BB0889A661E4A61376DFC4EDED1F455E86599BD4BDC3ED7506E0F03310B74D7CC5BF02DDCF60D9C0432B2B53B493530A26B3876F1FED3876715BA33D5DC0AD4","orcidId":"0000-0002-9752-3400","documentHash":"fd9f6ec2-6a0a-4f82-8f97-537e8a38e3cf"}],"doi":"10.3390/nano12081328"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["aronia czarnoowocowa","jagoda kamczacka","asortyment","rynek"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Rynek produktów z aronii czarnoowocowej i jagody kamczackiej","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"61b9ac26ad204581b62ebbb5","mniswId":"201426","title":"Przemysł Fermentacyjny i Owocowo Warzywny","doi":null,"issn":"0137-2645","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WCN","editor":null,"documentHash":"e2198ac2-6f6b-4870-a3f4-c9e0a3a9412a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629e37604097070cd357657b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923b878c28a047392225","629e37604097070cd357657e","629e37604097070cd357657f"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Streszczenie\r\nCelem pracy była analiza asortymentu produktów na bazie aronii czarnoowocowej i jagody kamczackiej.

Studying such spectral features is based on the calculation of the direct discrete Fourier transform for discrete measurements, equal in number, over the current intervals of observation of the hazardous examined parameter of the gas medium before and after the material is ignited. In this approach, a Fourier discrete transform makes it possible to determine the instantaneous amplitude and phase spectra for the time intervals under consideration. This makes it possible to explore the peculiarities of the distribution of amplitudes and phases of harmonic components in the spectrum of the dynamics of dangerous parameters of the gas environment before and after the ignition of materials. The results of experimental studies established that the nature of the amplitude spectrum is low-informative and not sensitive enough to fires. The main contribution to the amplitude spectrum of the dynamics of the investigated hazardous parameters of the gas environment in the chamber is made by the frequency components in the range of 0–0.2 Hz. The contribution to the amplitude spectrum of frequency components over 0.2 Hz is insignificant and decreases with increasing frequency. It is established that from the phase spectrum, the nature of the random scattering of phases for frequency components exceeding 0.2 Hz is informative. It was found that the nature of the phase spread for these frequency components in the spectrum depends on the type of ignition material. The results reported here could prove useful when devising new effective technologies for detecting fires in the premises of objects in various fields to protect against fires.

paper presents a method of calculation of rotationally symmetric circular plates, supported on piles and having a stiffness changing in the radial direction. The method is based on the superposition rule, i.e., an initial plate supported on piles is treated as a combination of two plates clamped on a middle post with a small diameter, wherein the first plate is loaded such as the initial one and the second plate is loaded by forces occurring as reactions in the piles of the initial plate. Obtained results are concordant with the engineer’s intuition and a comparison of results for various plates shows high similarity between each other. As works dealing with the analogical problems have not been found in the literature, then this concordance and similarity can be acknowledged as a premise showing a correctness of the presented method. The results obtained in the method have been compared to results obtained in a professional FEM-based environment for building construction design. It has been stated that in many cases the results of the presented method are highly concordant to those of the FEM, though in some cases discrepancies exist. However, the FEM is an approximate method, especially if related to plates, thus its results should be taken with a great care. In general, it can be stated that the presented method deserves an attention and further

Innovation development mechanisms developed by leading countries have been adapted and successfully used in many developing countries. They are used to ensure the transition from the resource and investment stages of technological development to the stage based on innovative technologies.

Light energy exceeding plant capability to use it for photochemical reactions must be dissipated by processes of non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of various components of NPQ on the response of Arabidopsis thaliana to fluctuating light and water availability. A laboratory experiment with Arabidopsis thaliana wild type (WT) and mutants npq1 and npq4 grown under optimum or reduced water availability was conducted. Dark-adapted plants were illuminated with fluctuating light (FL) of two intensities (55 and 530 μmol m−2 s−1) with each of the phases lasting for 20 s. The impact of water availability on the role of zeaxanthin and PsbS protein in NPQ induced at FL was analysed. The water deficit affected the dynamics of NPQ induced by FL. The lack of zeaxanthin or PsbS reduced plant capability to cope with FL. The synergy of both of these components was enhanced in regard to the amplitude of NPQ in the drought conditions. PsbS was shown as a component of primary importance in suiting plant response to FL under optimum and reduced water availability."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172451","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"5182","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/9/5182/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61b961387523402a58cc0894","name":"Maria","lastName":"Skorupka","uuid":"BA291E885CB07E71CD5C90ABBF0CE5406BB89E8BF86FCC648A1B368F73C4BEB214AC800D1B18741C0697727E923CA7217D9E5B469161D6E0DAA26A23CA93596F","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8dddf30e-1c0a-4ad0-92d4-e37bd7106c6e"},{"objectId":"601b76eb9543c74f83155297","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Okoń","uuid":"8A5FBA3DF99140CA134D291CFB2C7213D658F0FF4686BEEA60DD496C0525CF427C8AD392B2A387AF89B37ECC84053243EF498943860DE7634C9C89718326900D","orcidId":"0000-0002-9005-7339","documentHash":"cef73060-5b5c-4c70-880b-db96c2a40b24"},{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b4240","name":"Artur","lastName":"Nosalewicz","uuid":"8F90C013855FA77D9CCE874E6F1E9CE829656895A6D34693277DAF0E9E089A46808DC7E1804AB1B1B4381472D13A293BE21704B8EF92F4C7D8445574A3AFCBAD","orcidId":"0000-0001-5864-5619","documentHash":"c0d7da9f-ea7d-4fb3-bd6f-e85c09c4640f"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms23095182"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Landfill leachate","Biological tests","Toxicity","Gas exchange","Chlorophyll a fluorescence","Growth inhibition"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Sinapis alba L. and Triticum aestivum L. as biotest model species for evaluating municipal solid waste leachate toxicity","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547868b","mniswId":"10995","title":"Journal of Environmental Management","doi":null,"issn":"0301-4797","eissn":"1095-8630","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"a8a85e51-c558-4043-b45b-021782e22b46"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629c92b64097070cd347ee0b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709307878c28a0473a1779","629c92b74097070cd347ee0d","629c92b74097070cd347ee0e","629c92b74097070cd347ee0f","629c92b74097070cd347ee10","629c92b74097070cd347ee11"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The volume of municipal solid waste (MSW) inputs is rapidly increasing with a growing human population, and its composition is changing due an increased diversity of materials being deposited. There is an associated increase in leachate, a common toxic byproduct of MSW facilities that must be collected and treated prior to its release into the environment. There is growing interest in plant-based methods that are economical and efficient for leachate toxicity assessment such as biological tests that use indicator species. In the present study, the tolerance thresholds of two herbaceous species, Sinapis alba L. (mustard) and Triticum aestivum L. (wheat) to increasing shares of leachate sourced from an MSW facility in the Czech Republic were assessed through a variety of physiological parameters. Soil-based biotests showed a stimulation in the shoot biomass, leaf expansion, primary root elongation and carbon assimilation rate of the selected plant species to leachate concentrations between 20 and 50 %. Higher leachate concentrations led to reductions in most physiological parameters, especially the elongation of seedling roots when growth solutions with >50 % leachate were applied. While S. alba was more sensitive to increasing proportions of leachate in terms of growth parameters of the shoot tissues, photosystem II efficiency and chlorophyll pigment concentrations were more responsive in T. aestivum, indicating species-dependent differences. The present biotests provide further support for the use of both Sinapis alba L and Triticum aestivum L. as indicator species of phytotoxicity."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172456","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"302","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479721020740","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629c92b74097070cd347ee11","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Vaverková","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"727389c1-bf70-4744-a4b9-8534b36edf8e"},{"objectId":"629c92b74097070cd347ee10","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Jakimiuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2de6951b-f067-4aae-ad8f-61d3dbdc1351"},{"objectId":"629c92b74097070cd347ee0f","name":"Dana","lastName":"Adamcová","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ffa3f623-fcc5-4f5e-95c6-e9267456c76d"},{"objectId":"629c92b74097070cd347ee0e","name":"Werther","lastName":"Guidi Nissim","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"763433be-bbab-4836-9281-060c2772eaeb"},{"objectId":"629c92b74097070cd347ee0d","name":"Emily Rose","lastName":"Palm","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3115e98e-b786-4c60-bfd3-acf2e80724ef"},{"objectId":"5e709307878c28a0473a1779","name":"Anna","lastName":"Podlasek","uuid":"E4FF7ED59F49250745D8A7B58BE39E5CA9323A7DAA867C3442F35E59AE173C45DE0F45254BDB89256A83EC4F2F3A064BE85C7FEBB251ADE011775D0906539A52","orcidId":"0000-0003-0326-5672","documentHash":"dbbea2e1-09cf-400b-9dfc-a28bce4f9581"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.114012"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["artificial neural networks","digital light projection spectroscopy","near infrared spectroscopy","reflectance spectra"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","uid":"bnV99khMVeG3t9dh4evZESg","uuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","parentUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","rootUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","name":"Politechnika Koszalińska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094e4878c28a0473c631b","5e7092b2878c28a04739aead","5e7092b2878c28a04739aec7"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","uid":"bGA_QwQGoDNg-6MMEBxlWNQ","uuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","parentUuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","rootUuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","name":"Akademia Marynarki Wojennej im.

To stay within safe guardrails, usually defined as a maximum warming of 1.5 °C compared to pre-industrial times, this will mean decarbonisation within less than 30 years. This significant challenge is complicated because of growth in some sectors, such as tourism. This paper analyses emissions and economic output in Norway, considering national Tourism Satellite Accounts. Novel aspects of this paper include a longitudinal perspective covering 12 years through which critical developments and progress on emission reduction pathways can be assessed. Findings suggest that the carbon intensity of tourism (emissions per NOK) is more than twice the Norwegian economy average. Aviation in particular is a major barrier to emission reductions, as it generates 17% of national tourism revenue and 75% of direct tourism emissions. Trend extrapolation shows that tourism will be the largest emission sub-sector of the Norwegian economy by 2030. The Norwegian economy will have to decarbonise at a rate more than 30 times faster than its current rate, if it is to decarbonise to mid-century, while continuing on its observed economic growth trajectory."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172461","journalIssue":{"objectId":"629ddd3d4097073d586a9d6e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"363","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"5f7e9eed-42c5-4786-8fec-5f22bb140e32"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"363","pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360879879_Can_Norway_become_a_net-zero_economy_under_scenarios_of_tourism_growth","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629ddd3d4097073d586a9d6b","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Scott","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2b3f84e8-189a-41b9-976c-b093b7e596ae"},{"objectId":"629ddd3d4097073d586a9d6a","name":"Hans Jakob","lastName":"Walnum","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7621-8688","documentHash":"5c876291-c775-4fd4-8d5d-f069951c870b"},{"objectId":"629ddd3d4097073d586a9d69","name":"Nina M.","lastName":"Iversen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"41e9a0bb-fc73-4d47-8b63-7019abb3c3ec"},{"objectId":"629ddd3d4097073d586a9d68","name":"Leif E.","lastName":"Hem","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"193e49b9-b9ee-4dba-90f0-eb0aed331bbc"},{"objectId":"629ddd3d4097073d586a9d67","name":"Stefan","lastName":"Gössling","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0505-9207","documentHash":"f69757d0-0fe3-41f7-a3d3-13d78c778c56"},{"objectId":"629ddd3d4097073d586a9d66","name":"Ya-Yen","lastName":"Sun","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6788-7644","documentHash":"b1233f8c-1d04-4f81-b56f-cce5200fc838"},{"objectId":"5e7094f6878c28a0473c815a","name":"Ove","lastName":"Oklevik","uuid":"F2753E8246198A46A621A2F9EB8C704D325313BC6600519721778D08263B38A7AB8BA28A80079E11F5B5A3963395C3333D09639C3884F19341DEA24BBCD6653F","orcidId":"0000-0002-7129-5737","documentHash":"b115b0db-28c5-47d4-b73f-269be83dd636"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132414"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["low-cost thermal camera","thermal imaging","remote sensing","UA"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Experience Gained When Using the Yuneec E10T Thermal Camera in Environmental Research","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454794f5","mniswId":"17167","title":"Remote Sensing","doi":null,"issn":"2072-4292","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"adfc571f-e92f-4da0-8504-22894916b3f6"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629918a140970757143f51ac","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709310878c28a0473a2385","65818e544097076c14b798f9","65818e544097076c14b798fa","6025012c9543c7744e88f390"]},"issue":"11","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>Thermal imaging is an important source of information for geographic information systems (GIS) in various aspects of environmental research.

Unfortunately, as a commercial product, the camera is available without radiometric characteristics. Using the heated bed of the Omni3d Factory 1.0 printer, radiometric calibration was performed in the range of 18–100 °C (high sensitivity range–high gain settings of the camera). The stability of the thermal camera operation was assessed using several sets of a large number of photos, acquired over three areas in the form of aerial blocks composed of parallel rows with a specific sidelap and longitudinal coverage. For these image sets, statistical parameters of thermal images such as the mean, minimum and maximum were calculated and then analyzed according to the order of registration. Analysis of photos taken every 10 m in vertical profiles up to 120 m above ground level (AGL) were also performed to show the changes in image temperature established within the reference surface. Using the established radiometric calibration, it was found that the camera maintains linearity between the observed temperature and the measured brightness temperature in the form of a digital number (DN). It was also found that the camera is sometimes unstable after being turned on, which indicates the necessity of adjusting the device’s operating conditions to external conditions for several minutes or taking photos over an area larger than the region of interest.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172466","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65818e544097076c14b798fa","name":"Monika","lastName":"Konatowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a05e1a42-fe89-4c42-aa5e-5fd5b3169590"},{"objectId":"65818e544097076c14b798f9","name":"Adam Marcin","lastName":"Młynarczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c3bc10d0-e1ed-40a9-bf05-0c0439e8a380"},{"objectId":"6025012c9543c7744e88f390","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Jankowiak","uuid":"401E291E7664EA1396FE28506EB10B9DBE9FB9A7527B2CA790AB6EA657F63EF5D582C504E883FC6E8755E7CE58B8C534423F374B8B34A1D09E9C35BC8DDA9549","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8d0c2b8e-7de8-43e8-b63a-5037a6e85489"},{"objectId":"5e709310878c28a0473a2385","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Królewicz","uuid":"68315C290D2E75503DED8725A37E183A11BBBD73007A70748581F2B229E96C111B5FDC5A4063C8D49BD4540FD2747FC601C8857B285C8D7417144FDEDE1AC7FA","orcidId":"0000-0003-1117-7832","documentHash":"999e2ecb-abf3-424a-9f9d-a7de8c312631"}],"doi":"10.3390/rs14112633"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["folie jadalne","wysort warzywny","wytłoki jabłkowe","pektyna jabłkowa."]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["edible films","vegetable outgrades","apple pomace","apple pectin."]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"An attempt to develop edible packaging films based on vegetable outgrades ®","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"61b9ac03ad204581b62ebb26","mniswId":"201201","title":"Postępy Techniki Przetwórstwa Spożywczego","doi":null,"issn":"0867-793X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WCN","editor":null,"documentHash":"5716a3f9-ec67-4b3e-9c97-85452fd31d51"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629d019e4097070cd34d6e75","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923b878c28a047392204","5e709342878c28a0473a5c3f","5e70923b878c28a0473921f2"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W artykule przedstawiono wyniki badań dotyczących sposobu\r\nzagospodarowania wysortu warzywnego z kalafiora, brokułu,\r\nżółtej i zielonej fasolki szparagowej w postaci opakowań\r\njadalnych.

Revealing the main vulnerable points of the use and operation of these systems, it is proposed to use biogas obtained from agricultural, crop and livestock waste as fuel for gas turbine engines.\n\nAnalyzing the work of gas turbine engines, it reveals not only the technological advantages of using biogas instead of fuel, but also reducing the cost of heat and electric energy obtained by obtaining a productive land biohumus. This will result, firstly, it is especially emphasized, the usefulness of the resulting ground humus as a waste material, when producing biogas as fuel, for the operation of a hybrid energy system operating on the basis of gas turbine engines. Secondly, during the operation of a hybrid power system, it is possible to simultaneously obtain thermal and electrical energy. Thirdly, the low cost of the heat and electric energy received.\n\nThe following are other useful applications of such a power system. The resulting thermal energy is used for heating the greenhouse, and the electrical energy obtained from the operation of the hybrid power system can be used not only for lighting the premises, but can be used for the needs of the greenhouse. It is shown that the proposed hybrid power system consists of two technological structures. The first design is to obtain fuel in the form of biogas for the operation of gas turbine engines, the second design is the connection of the first design with gas turbine engines. A schematic diagram of the general design of the proposed hybrid power system and the principle of its operation is proposed. The difficulties encountered in the design and operation of such hybrid power systems are noted"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172477","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62974e8140970702be5282b2","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"8 (116)","doi":"","documentHash":"3f6221f1-4348-4649-a145-a2fa45a923e7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"29-37","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/255451/252945","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62975a6540970702be52ecb3","name":"Аskhat","lastName":"Berguzinov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6954-8259","documentHash":"831cf60b-d61e-46b3-8048-707ee408619a"},{"objectId":"62975a6540970702be52ecb2","name":"Shokhrukh","lastName":"Babakhan","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7723-0045","documentHash":"1694c906-fc27-4623-91c0-d9f03a905ea1"},{"objectId":"62975a6540970702be52ecb1","name":"Аdylkhan","lastName":"Kibishov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3056-2584","documentHash":"54bc712d-ad36-4aa2-8fd7-18d968ef74eb"},{"objectId":"62975a6540970702be52ecb0","name":"Oksana","lastName":"Meirbekova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0949-1443","documentHash":"664de918-d8c0-4673-92de-965243004d71"},{"objectId":"62975a6540970702be52ecaf","name":"Nassim","lastName":"Rustamov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6437-6600","documentHash":"71be7b0d-952c-4de8-9a28-1954662b5225"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.255451"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Wi-Fi","QoS","FIFO","PQ","WFQ","VoIP","FTP","Telkom ST3’s","end-to-end packet delay"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"62976ec840970702be53f6cb","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Imam Al-Kadhum College (IKC)","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62976ec840970702be53f6cc"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Characteristic analysis of queue theory in Wi-Fi applications using OPNET 14.5 modeler","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62976ec840970702be53f6ca","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62976ec840970702be53f6cc","62976ec840970702be53f6cd","62976ec840970702be53f6ce"]},"issue":"9 (116)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) broadband network technology has created great influence in the evolution of broadband wireless networks that are anticipated to progress regarding broadband speed and coverage. Several Wi-Fi hotspots are available everywhere, making it a medium of internet access that is easier to use compared to a local area network (LAN). However, the internet being the best effort network doesn’t provide the required Quality of Service (QoS) and there is no differentiation of service traffic. The chief aim of the current paper is to study the operation of the three organizing mechanisms: First-In, First-Out (FIFO) method – the standard method of network implementation to process the packets one by one as it arrives, Priority Queuing (PQ) and Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ) whereas PQ and WFQ classify the types of traffic based on service priority. In addition, WFQ assigns fair weight to each service on multiple traffic classes like video conferencing, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), and File Transfer Protocol (FTP), using Telkom ST3’s Wi-Fi network. This study applies four different scenarios: the first scenario applies the methods without any queuing discipline; the second scenario implements the methods with FIFO; the third scenario carries out the methods with PQ and the last scenario applies the methods with WFQ. The studies have shown that “end-to-end packet delay and packet delay variation for VoIP in the WFQ scenario” is good when compared to other queuing mechanisms with values of 171.717 ms and 0.977 ms, respectively. In the case of videotape conferencing also, the performance is better in the case of WFQ with values of 32.495 ms and 7.207 ms, correspondingly, since the WFQ has a “bandwidth allocation” tailored to the requirements"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172482","journalIssue":{"objectId":"627538654097075854f9fd16","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"9 (116)","doi":"","documentHash":"6d0fbd7b-0fdd-48ef-aa38-791b135c9936"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"35-43","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/255520/252913","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62976ec840970702be53f6ce","name":"Ali Hashim","lastName":"Abbas","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7947-7025","documentHash":"6a7b5a0a-1c1e-4ef3-bb11-a2d03901ce9c"},{"objectId":"62976ec840970702be53f6cd","name":"Hassnen Shakir","lastName":"Mansour","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4406-0390","documentHash":"ba477784-187c-40c8-bb59-310ed78061f9"},{"objectId":"62976ec840970702be53f6cc","name":"Ali Hamzah","lastName":"Najim","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2898-9634","documentHash":"69e207dc-e0eb-488e-b07b-ad2ee387431f"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.255520"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737def0","uid":"brcyYgRgvEjIItaX3WfS4aA","uuid":"b7bb6dea-d926-4b36-9e6d-e0ad8061342e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def0","parentUuid":"b7bb6dea-d926-4b36-9e6d-e0ad8061342e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737def0","rootUuid":"b7bb6dea-d926-4b36-9e6d-e0ad8061342e","name":"Narodowy Instytut Geriatrii, Reumatologii i Rehabilitacji im. prof. dr hab. med.

Sexual Behavior Disorder is currently included in the forthcoming eleventh revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11); however, prior studies have been conducted mostly on heterosexual, White/European male samples.\n\nAim\nTo examine the correlates of compulsive sexual behaviors (CSB) with sociodemographic and sexual history characteristics, as well as predictors of CSB in a sample of treatment-seeking Polish women.\n\nMethods\nSix hundred seventy-four (674) Polish women aged 18–66 completed an online-based survey.\n\nOutcomes\nPolish adaptation of the Sexual Addiction Screening Test-Revised (SAST-PL) was used to assess the severity of CSB symptoms. Brief Pornography Screen was used to measure problematic pornography use. The bivariate associations between SAST-PL scores and demographic and sexual history characteristics were also examined. A linear regression analysis was performed to identify variables related to the severity of CSB symptoms.\n\nResults\nThirty one percent (31.8%) of women in the studied sample reported treatment seeking for CSB in the past. Problematic pornography use was the strongest predictor of CSB symptoms. Higher severity of CSB symptoms were observed among divorced/separated and single women compared to those who were married or in informal relation. Severity of CSB was positively related to the number of sexual partners during the last year, number of dyadic sexual intercourse during the last 7 days, and negatively associated with age of first sexual intercourse.\n\nClinical Implications\nOur results suggest that CSB is a significant concern among women and more research is needed to identify protective (eg, relationship status) and risk (eg, problematic pornography use, number of past year sexual partners, frequency of past week masturbation) factors associated with CSB symptom severity among treatment-seeking women.\n\nStrengths & Limitations\nOur study is one of very few investigating predictors of CSB among women. Given the lack of precise estimates of the prevalence, as well as lack of psychometrically validated instruments measuring CSB in women, present findings should not be considered indicative of CSB prevalence among Polish women.\n\nConclusion\nThe lack of clinical data on women reporting issues with CSB remains an important target for future clinical research exploration."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172496","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6299f76c4097072c2b7c4d35","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"10","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"c0829b95-6f1c-4c05-9402-b7b2eb4f3f4c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"[1-7]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35653876/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6299f76c4097072c2b7c4d33","name":"Shane W.","lastName":"Kraus","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"76c8a2ab-7f0f-4c57-bda8-ab6d4af310a3"},{"objectId":"5e709428878c28a0473b74bd","name":"Michał","lastName":"Lew-Starowicz","uuid":"246BA772208ACF452D325DB079D681951CAA3EB8D97B9078CD1E82D6CC4E69EDD97130CE0C524299D40B8D8025F6D93DBB169C40FE4DA5EDFF4479048FD91A82","orcidId":"0000-0002-0283-0839","documentHash":"c361111e-250b-40bf-9a01-192fc9bd7297"},{"objectId":"5e709378878c28a0473aa7f0","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Kowalewska","uuid":"4AD4AFF389C5B5E8E466C4123E8C634CB044CACC257DC23CB09D9B46841385AE562B52AD298A78750306BC078470F3087F37A753F36EED5EBB6598891E52BA60","orcidId":"0000-0002-2640-3778","documentHash":"db12a312-47ab-48ec-b7e8-a796db15cf3f"},{"objectId":"5e7092fb878c28a0473a060c","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Gola","uuid":"CF6BE2299FD31822016BBAFA279EE9137B0B6A95934F8AA4A065FD761485808B6703D940E4F8D281214F5C2AF25E3D1ACA4C1A83507F2ABCAA86F4D16C5180FA","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3463e973-384a-4115-8803-c1c3120d51c9"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.esxm.2022.100525"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["ogrzewanie mikrofalowe","przemysł spożywczy","gospodarstwa domowe","wartość odżywcza","zagrożenia"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["microwave heating","food industry","household","nutritional value","food safety","hazards"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Microwave heating process – characteristics, benefits, hazards and use in food industry and households – a review®","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"61b9ac03ad204581b62ebb26","mniswId":"201201","title":"Postępy Techniki Przetwórstwa Spożywczego","doi":null,"issn":"0867-793X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WCN","editor":null,"documentHash":"5716a3f9-ec67-4b3e-9c97-85452fd31d51"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629d026f4097070cd34d80a4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923d878c28a047392280","629d026f4097070cd34d80a6","629d026f4097070cd34d80a7"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W artykule przedstawiono zalety i wady stosowania ogrzewania mikrofalowego w przemyśle spożywczym oraz w gospodarstwach domowych.

The microwave oven enables\r\nfast heat transfer, which translates into a short heating\r\ntime and high energy efficiency compared to a conventional\r\nheating process. The efficiency of the process depends on\r\nmany factors, including the shape and size of the product,\r\nthe properties and position of the food during heating, and\r\nthe process parameters used. However, the challenge for\r\nproducers is still uneven temperature distribution, and hence\r\nuneven heating of the product. In summary, the quality of\r\nfood prepared in a microwave oven differs from that of food\r\nprepared with conventional heating.

The use of grasslands (by mowing, grazing, and mowing and grazing) affects the dominance of bacteria in abundance relative to fungal populations. This was particularly noticeable when manual mowing was applied. In general, the highest number of microorganisms occurred during spring and summer, which should be associated with the intensity of growth of root systems of grass vegetation. It was noted that the grazing system caused an increase in the enzymatic activity of urease and slightly less dehydrogenases and acid and alkaline phosphatase. Therefore, microbial abundance and enzymatic activity are considered as indicator parameters to evaluate the biological soil environment.

present paper discusses the impact of land use and seasons on the concentration of nutrients in the waters of the Utrata River (Pruszków Poviat, Mazowieckie Voivodeship) from April 2018 to March 2019. The pollution of rivers by nutrients is a major problem for society. Surface water is a source of drinking water, water used for industrial and agricultural purposes. With the increasing pollution of rivers, the purification process for these purposes becomes more expensive and more challenging. To assist in carrying out activities aimed at reducing the inflow of biogenic substances into large river systems and then down to the Baltic Sea, we analyzed the spatial and temporal dynamics of loads from the entire Utrata River catchment area. We divided the entire catchment area into three impact zones: grasslands and wastelands, urbanized areas, and agricultural land and examined changes in nutrient concentrations (total phosphorus, nitrate nitrogen, ammonium nitrogen) in each of the zones. The results were statistically processed using the 1-factor ANOVA method with the <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>-value of significance below 0.05. Research indicates an increase in the concentration of total phosphorus and nitrogen forms down the course of the river in urban and agricultural areas with persistently low concentrations of these biogenic substances in grasslands."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058172514","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"194","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10661-022-09821-z","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"629cde8e4097070cd348b63a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Dębska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6e77c4ed-31c2-4f88-868d-ad103c1bd3d4"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941d7","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Szulc","uuid":"D8414595692589FA764C43F6CB9DF1DAFB6C4A581C06900F2BD39764F6462BE75DABC95047F5C0451D78D44B7B0A0D2B6D12FD51B6D61865646ABEBD5BDA8726","orcidId":"0000-0001-8505-0514","documentHash":"bbd043ca-e672-4390-962d-729dc159b988"},{"objectId":"5e709257878c28a047394148","name":"Beata","lastName":"Rutkowska","uuid":"A533CE234522C2D1E6D4589E20F923E14DE3D99ABFC6848E02E407296347DC4CA988DC6474BEC3668C9062F2D629D80A687355F977532B8E91CCC7E3B25C69C3","orcidId":"0000-0003-4563-0156","documentHash":"34828859-ecf1-4322-a10d-eefb8efa256a"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10661-022-09821-z"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Freeze-drying","Vegetable snacks","Physical properties\nSustainable food products","Food waste management"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Freeze-dried snacks obtained from frozen vegetable by-products and apple pomace – Selected properties, energy consumption and carbon footprint","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454780f3","mniswId":"8382","title":"Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1466-8564","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"757d6b4d-fe90-4dfa-a8ab-eba3b90df9e7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"629d01af4097070cd34d6eee","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70923b878c28a047392204","5e709342878c28a0473a5c3f","5e70923b878c28a0473921f2","629d01af4097070cd34d6ef2"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Valorisation of food waste is one of the goals that food industry needs to achieve in terms of sustainable development. The aim of the research has been to analyse selected properties of freeze-dried vegetable snacks obtained from wholesome waste derived from the fruit and vegetable industry, such as frozen vegetable by-products and apple pomace as well as to estimate carbon footprint as the technological process output on the basis of the energy used for the purpose of producing snacks. Properties of snacks, such as water content and activity, shrinkage, density, porosity and hardness, were determined using common methodology. The water content of the finished products was very low (<1.5%) and determined the water activity below 0.02. Technological operations, such as grinding, caused destruction of the cell structure of the ingredients, which subsequently made the product structure inhomogeneous and more dense than most of the freeze-dried plant tissues. The snacks were porous and featured by hardness of 79.43–113.26 N. The colour depended on their composition, and freeze-drying caused the products to brighten significantly. The estimated carbon footprint (CF) depended on the technological process. Freeze-drying had the most significant impact upon the CF, accounting for 86–87%.
