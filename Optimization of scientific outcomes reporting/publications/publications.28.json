Celem artykułu jest odpowiedź na pytanie, jakie emocje i motywacje inicjatorów akcji można wyczytać ze słów używanych przez nich w mediach społecznościowych. Kwestie etyczne i prawne akcji leżą poza obszarem badawczym artykułu. Uzyskane z analizy Big Data dane zostały zinterpretowane w kluczu teorii psychologicznych związanych ze stresem i poczuciem dobrostanu. Uzyskane wyniki pozwalają stwierdzić, że wpisy związane z akcją #OtwieraMY na Facebooku i Twitterze zawierają duży ładunek emocji negatywnych. Tym niemniej w świetle koncepcji Antonovsky’ego, modelu GAS i cebulowej teorii szczęścia, zrozumiałe są gwałtowne reakcje emocjonalne przedsiębiorców na wprowadzane obostrzenia.

The authors analyzed the posts related to the #OtwieraMY action. Some businesspeople in Poland initiated it as a response to the restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic in winter and spring 2021. The article aims to answer what emotions and motivations of the initiators of the action can be read from the words they use in social media. Ethical and legal issues of the action are outside the research area of the article. The data obtained from Big Data analysis were interpreted in the key of psychological theories related to stress and sense of well-being. The obtained results allow us to conclude that posts related to the #OtwieraMY on Facebook and Twitter\ncontain a high level of negative emotions. Nevertheless, in the light of Antonovsky’s conception, the GAS model and the onion theory of happiness, entrepreneurs’ violent emotional reactions to the introduced restrictions are understandable.\nA long-lasting, strict system of control and punishment may deepen the crisis of psychological well-being among Polish\nbusinesspeople, intensifying symptoms of long-term stress and anxiety and, as a result, aggressive behaviour."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058108539","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"49","pagesFromTo":"48-76","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.21697/kmt.49.3","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6399d0e340970768cd121178","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Popek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"22ec9820-6662-414d-bfab-fb1878f265b4"},{"objectId":"5e70937d878c28a0473aadfe","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Gaweł","uuid":"73E8E014914F4EEE7EC843E4793B27CB3DCA72106562FF6DFBD5360C4EE8598EDAD09998D6D176B70BD5594F74B873EDE95ADC6CA9C3F259AF247C71008379AC","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"51596ee9-436a-472e-8b14-19d60ccaf1ac"},{"objectId":"5e7092b3878c28a04739afa9","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Adamski","uuid":"BAFE56ABDDB07D394AC51C725398619A2B56FFD48A2DD47B0C5DA02268ADA4FC049BB5030485054905AE41AB836CFFC6E77C13AC74768F764D2CEECB8091735E","orcidId":"0000-0002-4075-4224","documentHash":"5c22f035-c383-4e03-81fd-3301548f1654"}],"doi":"10.21697/kmt.49.3"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Działania operacyjne","Innowacje","Myślenie projektowe","Sztuka operacyjna"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Design thinking","Innovation","Operational art","Operations"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","uid":"bABmAiyO82JgMB2LqzOepAg","uuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","parentUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","rootUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","name":"Akademia Sztuki Wojennej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094cd878c28a0473c4227"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Analysis and Evaluation of a Complex Operating Environment","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":{"objectId":"626f8eb94097075c4b45b7e6","doi":null,"title":"Strategic and Operational Challenges in the (Post) Pandemic World","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-66731-22-6","ismn":null,"issn":"2719-6712","url":"https://sin.akademia.mil.pl/publications/details/i7233","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"fc6a4b6c-d601-4088-8de1-1f186a992bae","publisher":null,"openAccess":null},"_version":4,"objectId":"626f92024097075c4b45b923","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"626f8d314097075c4b459f72","mniswId":null,"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"fullName":"GlobState","shortName":"GlobState","city":null,"country":null,"website":"https://cdissz.wp.mil.pl/pl/articlespublikacje_cdissz/globstate-i-ksztaltowanie-przestrzeni-bezpieczenstwa-panstwa/","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"dc29bb62-6db2-4520-b008-4a75b6b82903"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094cd878c28a0473c4227"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose: The aim of the chapter is to present the results of research on the analysis and evaluation\nof a complex operating environment.\nDesign/methodology/approach: The research was based on the experimental model in the setup\nof a group for itself 2 with a verified measurement and an external control group. As part of the study,\nthe effects of work of project and planning teams were compared. The work of project teams was\nbased on alternative methods and tools used in the project approach, while the work of planning\nteams was based on the methods and tools specified in the normative documents concerning the\nplanning process of operations with the use of armed forces.\nFindings: The results of the research suggest that the adopted methodology of the project team’s\nwork, compared to the methodology of the planning team’s work, creates more favorable conditions\nfor the identification, analysis, and assessment of intangible elements of the operating environment\nand the relationships between these elements. The use of methods and tools of work within the\nproject team allows for a qualitatively different image of the analyzed operating environment,\nwhich results from taking into account the multi-paradigm nature of this environment.

Most\noften it is located on the trunk and is painless. The exact cause of\nformation is unknown. The etiology takes into account the trauma,\ngenetic factors and coexisting diseases. In order to diagnose lipoma\nlesions, we use X-ray, MRI, USG and PET. Treatment methods include\ncorticosteroid injection, liposuction and surgical removal, which is\nthe gold standard.

The\naim of this article is to present the mucosal preservation technique\n(MPT) as a minimally invasive surgical procedure to remove the\nlipoma located on the tongue in a 57-year-old, generally healthy\npatient.

Oral anticoagulation can reduce stroke risk but is limited by complication risk and non-compliance. Left atrial appendage exclusion (LAAE) is a new surgical option to reduce stroke risk in AF. The study objective was to evaluate the safety and feasibility of standalone thoracoscopic LAAE in high stroke risk AF patients.\nMETHODS:\nThis was a retrospective, multicentre study of high stroke risk AF patients who had oral anticoagulation contraindications and were not candidates for ablation nor other cardiac surgery. Standalone thoracoscopic LAAE was performed using 3 unilateral ports access and epicardial clip. Periprocedural adverse events, long-term observational clinical outcomes and stroke rate were evaluated.\nRESULTS:\nProcedural success was 99.4% (174/175 patients). Pleural effusion occurred in 4 (2.3%) patients; other periprocedural complications were <1% each. One perioperative haemorrhagic stroke occurred (0.6%). No phrenic nerve palsy or cardiac tamponade occurred. Predicted annual ischaemic stroke rate of 4.8/100 patient-years (based on median CHA2DS2-VASc score of 4.0) was significantly higher than stroke risk observed in follow-up after LAAE. No ischaemic strokes occurred (median follow-up: 12.5 months), resulting in observed rate of 0 (95% CI 0–2.0)/100 patient-years (P < 0.001 versus predicted). Six all-cause (non-device-related) deaths occurred during follow-up.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nStudy proved that a new surgical option, standalone thoracoscopic LAAE, is feasible and safe. With this method, long-term stroke rate may be reduced compared to predicted for high-risk AF population."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058108568","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63f88580409707099270d8b5","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"34","number":"4","doi":"","documentHash":"d09c3c2e-2e3b-471f-ac50-095dcff88757"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"34","pagesFromTo":"548-555","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/icvts/article/34/4/548/6454074","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"628e145640970776244cc9b4","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Suwalski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c230f5ae-0528-4d04-a5ed-4402eace890c"},{"objectId":"628e140740970776244cc60c","name":"Richard","lastName":"Cartledge","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f7ac69aa-ec15-42e1-b8ca-7e09c7dbb6a9"},{"objectId":"626bc85340970752eddc929c","name":"Barry","lastName":"Merrill","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a69ce55c-f2f1-4b48-98b7-1311f2cc1fab"},{"objectId":"626bc85340970752eddc929b","name":"Burak","lastName":"Ilsin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"71102142-7d51-42ae-905b-32ad07234e72"},{"objectId":"626bc85340970752eddc929a","name":"Gilbert","lastName":"Chidiac","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"963ca435-6423-4174-8199-6d853c0a7ce5"},{"objectId":"626bc85340970752eddc9299","name":"Anthony","lastName":"Cioci","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"039f60af-c2f2-46c4-bb74-422c78613fdb"},{"objectId":"626bc85340970752eddc9298","name":"Gary","lastName":"Gottlieb","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"915a9cea-9c60-4a01-bc26-95ebc59db837"},{"objectId":"626bc85340970752eddc9297","name":"Anna","lastName":"Witkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fb70d1f3-21bd-4119-92cf-82251ed43990"},{"objectId":"5e709394878c28a0473ad430","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Suwalski","uuid":"B2288C9A87D6C4919596257ACC2EC54A27B9DF58C2047AE43D4506B10419DB866F1CE15E9EDC4633FFA29789190AD0CCB5BD878F3DBB69ACF0F502AE438EE509","orcidId":"0000-0003-2670-4164","documentHash":"2527c532-ef00-4b70-a9e6-9abac5e55f5e"}],"doi":"10.1093/icvts/ivab334"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","uid":"bqvFVl6-FYxc-KjUUrbTwDw","uuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","parentUuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","rootUuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","name":"Instytut Ochrony Przyrody Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709313878c28a0473a26ee"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Human disturbance is the most limiting factor driving habitat selection of a large carnivore throughout Continental Europe","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477343","mniswId":"2437","title":"BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION","doi":null,"issn":"0006-3207","eissn":"1873-2917","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"dc2dc7d7-f00f-42af-b61b-2a248360e995"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"627263ba4097077af526ae1c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["627263ba4097077af526ae1e","627263ba4097077af526ae1f","627263ba4097077af526ae20","627263ba4097077af526ae21","627263ba4097077af526ae22","627263ba4097077af526ae23","627263ba4097077af526ae24","627263ba4097077af526ae25","627263ba4097077af526ae26","627263ba4097077af526ae27","627263ba4097077af526ae28","627263ba4097077af526ae29","627263ba4097077af526ae2a","627263ba4097077af526ae2b","627263ba4097077af526ae2c","627263ba4097077af526ae2d","5e709313878c28a0473a26ee","627263ba4097077af526ae2f","627263ba4097077af526ae30","627263ba4097077af526ae31","627263ba4097077af526ae32","627263ba4097077af526ae33","627263ba4097077af526ae34"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Habitat selection is a multi-scale process driven by trade-offs between benefits, such as resource abundance, and disadvantages, such as the avoidance of risk. The latter includes human disturbances, to which large carnivores, with their large spatial requirements, are especially sensitive. We investigated the ecological processes underlying multi-scale habitat selection of a large carnivore, namely Eurasian lynx, across European landscapes characterized by different levels of human modification. Using a unique dataset of 125 lynx from 9 study sites across Europe, we compared used and available locations within landscape and home-range scales using a novel Mixed Effect randomForest approach, while considering environmental predictors as proxies for human disturbances and environmental resources. At the landscape scale, lynx avoided roads and human settlements, while at the home-range scale natural landscape features associated with shelter and prey abundance were more important. The results showed sex was of relatively low variable importance for lynx's general habitat selection behaviour. We found increasingly homogeneous responses across study sites with finer selection scales, suggesting that study site differences determined coarse selection, while utilization of resources at the finer selection scale was broadly universal. Thereby describing lynx's requirement, if not preference, for heterogeneous forests and shelter from human disturbances and implying that regional differences in coarse-scale selection are driven by availability rather than preference. These results provide crucial information for conserving this species in human-dominated landscapes, as well as for the first time, to our knowledge, generalising habitat selection behaviour of a large carnivore species at a continental

The mechanical properties are determined via pressure-dependent diffraction studies and DFT calculations; the shear moduli appear to be very low for all studied compounds, revealing their high malleability (that can be beneficial for the manufacturing and stable cycling of all-solid-state batteries). The thermodiffraction experiments also reveal a high coefficient of thermal expansion for these materials. We discover a pressure-induced phase transition for K2B12H12 from Fm3̅ to Pnnm symmetry around 2 GPa. A temperature-induced phase transition for Li2B10H10 was also observed for the first time by thermodiffraction, and the crystal structure determined by combining experimental data and DFT calculations. Interestingly, all phases of the studied compounds (including newly discovered high-pressure and high-temperature phases) may be related via a group–subgroup relationship, with the notable exception of the room-temperature phase of Li2B10H10."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058108586","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"61","pagesFromTo":"5224-5233","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.1c03681","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6274c20840970745609d7237","name":"Hans","lastName":"Hagemann","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7183-8543","documentHash":"b7f51448-2a05-4172-9e69-ac583325d8d7"},{"objectId":"6274c20840970745609d7236","name":"Angelina","lastName":"Gigante","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7226-1360","documentHash":"a640ddc9-a105-4997-a6d7-65582c8c856c"},{"objectId":"6274c20840970745609d7235","name":"Elsa","lastName":"Roedern","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3fbff405-43c8-4d0d-8377-bee1619d80ce"},{"objectId":"6274c20840970745609d7234","name":"Léo","lastName":"Duchêne","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0309-4682","documentHash":"e364b9e7-563c-4e12-8e0b-2f459e3538ba"},{"objectId":"6274c20840970745609d7233","name":"Arndt","lastName":"Remhof","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8394-9646","documentHash":"6842679c-232d-4f87-82f4-bcf78cda3ad6"},{"objectId":"6274c20840970745609d7231","name":"Romain","lastName":"Moury","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1198-2586","documentHash":"bfdd03f5-4449-4792-a25d-7c5c8799ebaa"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d7fa","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Łodziana","uuid":"B53AF2AB0DCDC362EA71B3B12741A3345AB95A10809FA7B4AA3B7207E2BE076E9229DB0ABC08D460D63FAE1596D5E6BB3EA57525405A0465FE9673D0AD6B1322","orcidId":"0000-0002-4713-6891","documentHash":"7e6dd2bb-1387-4193-bd04-953fcfea6a5c"}],"doi":"10.1021/acs.inorgchem.1c03681"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["leksykografia","słowniki","kolokacje","analiza korpusowa"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["lexicography","dictionary","collocations","corpus analysis"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092eb878c28a04739f37b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Korpusy wobec poszukiwania optymalnych kolokacji  do celów leksykografii przekładowej","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b2f8","mniswId":"200193","title":"Przegląd Rusycystyczny","doi":null,"issn":"0137-298X","eissn":null,"websiteLink":"http://www.przegladrusycystyczny.pl","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"339b42c6-baa5-4916-a353-3f074a8148f1"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":"2022-03-14","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"626c2a6c40970752edddc4d7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092eb878c28a04739f37b"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W artykule niniejszym autor podejmuje próbę zweryfikowania wyników korpusowych dla 50 pierwszych poświadczeń rosyjskich leksemów прожить oraz пережить (jako ekwiwalentów niemetaforycznych polskiej jednostki przeżyć) pod kątem rejestrowania użytecznych leksykograficznie (i dydaktycznie) kolokacji.

The main topic of these debates is the rule of law crisis triggered by the Law and Justice government in Poland. The corpus contains over 157,000 tokens and about 20 h 45 min of recordings, counting both source and target texts. The two interpreting directions (English-Polish and Polish-English) are represented almost evenly. The annotation of the corpus completed so far includes mark-up information, POS tagging, labelling disfluency phenomena, and all forms of explicitating shifts. Manual annotation for personal deixis is in progress. An additional interesting feature is the speaker identification performed employing the X-vector method, which allowed us to identify 36 interpreters. We begin with an overview of the existing interpreting corpora. Then we proceed to explain the design features of the EP-Poland and report on two completed empirical studies analysing idiosyncratic interpreting behaviour. We conclude by outlining future development pathways and offering some remarks on corpus significance and its limitations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058108593","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62737b8a409707200058fd0d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"22","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"ce471e57-5ef3-4141-b2dd-05aebf2c40b4"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"110-126","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.17576/gema-2022-2201-06","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70938e878c28a0473acb91","name":"Danijel","lastName":"Koržinek","uuid":"510BE3E63C7932AC6D1A7DF874090CDFF02643A0B2414052C6185A7DFD6D47826CD44557EDF49E4DED7FF1A501C073514308E30FE549EF3FE2386E9F31A3FE2F","orcidId":"0000-0002-2916-4856","documentHash":"04b661bd-31e5-4ff0-8d17-2da70935adc9"},{"objectId":"5e7092eb878c28a04739f2ae","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Bartłomiejczyk","uuid":"D19A629EEE696F8DBAF018269B3234A14B18EF5516A6CCFE2B1DD9FEA9101AC3659B9A58461C5B550EC1B3B71E2E25788BA7588DD422A6AF4EAA087C857F03C6","orcidId":"0000-0001-6645-1849","documentHash":"94bcba91-e32d-4b92-a07a-b8a4d6b32e20"},{"objectId":"5e709274878c28a04739605e","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Gumul","uuid":"AFE2FB3D8702DAFFE591D79D108AACCD290D30A26DA057CD4141656C468B64BD44F8433EC9B935029DB11A1B18BCEEF848022CB2703DAD543B495FAC8FEF40C6","orcidId":"0000-0003-0859-6067","documentHash":"2a6db68a-18df-4ec9-98f1-edddfad9af16"}],"doi":"10.17576/gema-2022-2201-06"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["blood groups","blood transfusion","Ludwik Hirszfeld"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922e878c28a04739140c"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dead","uid":"byot1zGR6DaDBaUruYE9Eyg","uuid":"264294d6-d6d7-4b7e-93b6-8f267f0a455e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dead","parentUuid":"264294d6-d6d7-4b7e-93b6-8f267f0a455e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dead","rootUuid":"264294d6-d6d7-4b7e-93b6-8f267f0a455e","name":"Instytut Immunologii i Terapii Doświadczalnej im.

Together with Emil von Dungern, he showed that blood groups are heritable traits and established the terminology of the ABO blood group system. He discovered A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> blood groups, and showed for the first time, in a large-scale population study, that blood group frequency differs between populations. During World War I, he volunteered as an army physician. In the interwar period, he helped to create the National Institute of Hygiene in Warsaw and was instrumental in developing transfusion centres in Poland. During World War II, which he barely survived, he co-organized secret medical courses in the Warsaw Ghetto and played a major role in containing the typhus epidemic that ran rampant there since 1941. After the war, he was the first in Poland to put the theory of serological conflict between mother and foetus into clinical practice, saving the lives of almost 200 children by introducing exchange transfusions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058108594","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"117","pagesFromTo":"467-475","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1111/vox.13214","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709469878c28a0473bc6cd","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Kaczmarek","uuid":"2A2897289360CF5FC63F1A2A262DD71728060F1A4EA13F7E87156C00728F090D6F1042AF8E6FE3BBD76514B47F928B1270E06AD47B4710FF3BE4C15008CE64D9","orcidId":"0000-0001-8084-1958","documentHash":"8043f4b0-98a2-4916-8a89-a9f9f720734e"},{"objectId":"5e70922e878c28a04739140c","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Glensk","uuid":"7545B92330B3AB9FA3B878C62B345FF3B00D27D5CD70E6C7059445043B4FCD6A729951E8557EB99874D08ECA32621C5B179D7B372F203389F8E8A90F95C419F2","orcidId":"0000-0003-1045-915X","documentHash":"09a6286f-5778-420d-b261-52c6cdc30dab"},{"objectId":"5e709222878c28a0473906a7","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Czerwiński","uuid":"AAD296F0C4AD58A563EC5D202E27A407127D40E1812DE2767EE6D8E1FD2370A79AD1674F4E88223314443A6C0CA7FB102E1482F16231C7A5B697C303190E07FA","orcidId":"0000-0003-2859-3699","documentHash":"6b7799cc-b0d1-477b-ac01-18436da20677"}],"doi":"10.1111/vox.13214"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["kerogen","shale rock","Rock-Eval","bacterial community","oxygenation","dehydrogenation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","uid":"bKH7OhxrOAmP_ULnBGYKnJQ","uuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","parentUuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","rootUuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","name":"Instytut Biochemii i Biofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709358878c28a0473a7a4a"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Biologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709358878c28a0473a7a4a","5e709356878c28a0473a79ee"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Postdiagenetic Changes in Kerogen Properties and Type by Bacterial Oxidation and Dehydrogenation.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":null,"issn":"1420-3049","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"8615ffac-9999-41cd-9658-bd5ed633cde5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-08","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6273cb1d40970720005ba728","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6273cb1d40970720005ba72b","5e709358878c28a0473a7a4a","5e709356878c28a0473a79ee"]},"issue":"8","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A significant part of organic carbon found on the earth is deposited as fossil organic matter in the lithosphere.

The purpose of this study was to analyze whether the bacterial communities currently inhabiting the shale rocks have had any impact on the properties and type of kerogen. We used the shale rock located on the Fore-Sudetic Monocline, which is characterized by oil-prone kerogen type II. We were able to show that shale rock inhabited by bacterial communities are characterized by oxidized and dehydrated kerogen type III (gas-prone) and type IV (nonproductive, residual, and hydrogen-free). Bacterial communities inhabiting shale rock were dominated by heterotrophs of the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria phyla. Additionally, we detected a number of protein sequences in the metaproteomes of bacterial communities matched with enzymes involved in the oxidative metabolism of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, which may potentially contribute to the postdiagenetic oxidation and dehydrogenation of kerogen. The kerogen transformation contributes to the mobilization of fossil carbon in the form of extractable bitumen dominated by oxidized organic compounds."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058108598","journalIssue":{"objectId":"625512072467f052bca98431","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"27","number":"8","doi":null,"documentHash":"e672b8ba-bcc8-471e-9691-77366c1dc470"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"2408 (1-17)","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/8/2408","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6273cb1d40970720005ba72b","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Wilamowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ee514982-dc1f-4295-b5be-865caa2cb361"},{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7a4a","name":"Marta","lastName":"Koblowska","uuid":"6C28FF5C9E3FB5085D5BC0CB92529580E1FF2BA8A1C4EDFEC95ACB450A1793E04520F49694237BE94D4648C0F2D9CA156BE0386B36727F18B1260E09DD44A796","orcidId":"0000-0003-4497-6200","documentHash":"c38bb556-b62a-43e4-9e89-a0ae9d8849e2"},{"objectId":"5e709356878c28a0473a79ee","name":"Renata","lastName":"Matlakowska","uuid":"0669D8B6AC8C9D627A01E390472CEE889E9F8913DF95D7B456E216616D42C0F77E71B14CC99EE63291F759D9AFC541AB14F19E3ED28C946013BF1166EAFA1F76","orcidId":"0000-0002-9419-9254","documentHash":"42160f03-8e5c-4b1c-acc6-01e45319fd5c"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules27082408"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["active conservation","Amphibia","habitat selection","keystone species","ponds","puddles","reproductive success","substitute habitats","tadpole mortality","temporary ponds"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","uid":"bqvFVl6-FYxc-KjUUrbTwDw","uuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","parentUuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","rootUuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","name":"Instytut Ochrony Przyrody Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70949d878c28a0473c07af","5e709410878c28a0473b59e6","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f9d","5e7094a1878c28a0473c0b75","6013ad489543c74f83155161","5e7093ba878c28a0473afe10"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Small monsters: Insect predation limits reproduction of yellow‐bellied toad Bombina variegata to ponds in their earliest successional stage","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477162","mniswId":"1547","title":"AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS","doi":null,"issn":"1052-7613","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"0e13e9fa-944d-494f-9614-bfe64ec8e556"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"627270c24097077af5271751","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6013ad489543c74f83155161","5e7093ba878c28a0473afe10","5e70949d878c28a0473c07af","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f9d","5e7094a1878c28a0473c0b75","627270c24097077af5271758","5e709410878c28a0473b59e6"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The disappearance and deterioration of amphibian breeding habitats is a major cause of their global extinction. In Europe, this problem affects the yellow-bellied toad Bombina variegata, which inhabits small ponds in the early stages of succession, where no predatory invertebrate species normally occur. Nonetheless, as habitats, small temporary ponds are highly endangered, a situation that is intensifying with urban spread. A system of 13 pairs of artificial ponds was constructed in 2012 for the breeding of B. variegata with the aim of reconnecting disjunct populations. During the 2 years of the study, one of the twin ponds was regularly cleared of emergent vegetation and invertebrates. The survival rates of the tadpoles released in the cleared and uncleared ponds were analysed. The survival rate of the tadpoles released into the cleared ponds was higher than of those introduced into the uncleared ones. Tadpole survival rates were also higher in new, single ponds, constructed in 2013. The lower survival rates of the introduced tadpoles are best explained by the presence of predatory aquatic invertebrates, particularly the large diving beetle Dytiscus marginalis. Experimentally obtained consumption rates indicate that one Dytiscus larva is capable of destroying a typical clutch of B. variegata tadpoles within a few hours, much faster than any of the other insect predators tested. The impact of freshwater invertebrates on tadpoles is frequently studied but rarely quantified. For conservation measures to be effective, quantitative standards need to be applied that describe the impact of predation in a predictable manner. Construction of artificial small ponds is broadly accepted as an important conservation measure compensating for the disappearance of natural amphibian breeding sites. This function of artificial ponds may be substantially enhanced by the periodic removal of invertebrate predators."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058108600","journalIssue":{"objectId":"627270c24097077af527175b","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"c9bebc73-f921-42cf-868c-dc74db91d289"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/aqc.3779","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"627270c24097077af5271758","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Łaciak","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3312-913X","documentHash":"a245eb38-8a63-4af1-8250-d3579e7d59b3"},{"objectId":"6013ad489543c74f83155161","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Łaciak","uuid":"752EE343A6F8664DE4402030B33DA08598309C53437B9329D5C03A3E6DADB3AB80B90E689FDF08CCED6003EB214E8D3E2D9EAAC696FCC265F628015E3646E6E0","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0fde2e83-880e-4a88-9f3c-c37dfcfc6156"},{"objectId":"5e7094a1878c28a0473c0b75","name":"Adam","lastName":"Ćmiel","uuid":"24D42ED91E2E672C20E45A8421E8B4552CD29E144FFD6F946B8D208524EF88048992C1506A64910AC2DB022F0E2A60DBEF23694B5224429D4B5F7DF8883D296A","orcidId":"0000-0002-2822-655X","documentHash":"c81f423f-ac4d-485c-933a-1deae6410de3"},{"objectId":"5e70949d878c28a0473c07af","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Adamski","uuid":"093ACAD4EB8B2F86189B9531EFD08EA8A369E3D58D5C3C810C4F73576B2F4E83D43C89CE2A1C176F0DB3CDB7E5480ECE45C3B5650EC98F6BB5A8FB5411DA4196","orcidId":"0000-0002-2276-5739","documentHash":"9df31e2c-103c-4101-bc07-1ab16b801b61"},{"objectId":"5e709410878c28a0473b59e6","name":"Anna","lastName":"Lipińska","uuid":"0147C4A81725F5086AF7D2A5C09A0F568ED55D328E56D8B84D904E76B5BC14A750F8A3F48902C60A5017F509C65C4D3F4AF75187369028878DE3A1DB58F1BCC1","orcidId":"0000-0003-4065-1863","documentHash":"22a10d4b-093a-4ac5-9fb9-81cc9a612394"},{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f9d","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Bielański","uuid":"C1A1F21606D67566ABC55EE77BDD34A91E949B67DE5DFDB15F745F53E806513A44871DA71527A4D15EAD221F4A62A1CDFC66343BEAA2B6DA3BAD6EE6AE8426EA","orcidId":"0000-0001-5401-908X","documentHash":"f6483d5e-a423-48c2-a22d-e0f0d60e35e6"},{"objectId":"5e7093ba878c28a0473afe10","name":"Tadeusz","lastName":"Zając","uuid":"9178B53355547E4D561CEFAC3E0851F3A1EC07CA68DD8CD4B76DD5EFBBBC4174216CDFF750CB7A6BD6E92B3394E095CD099871174672AB596EDC64FCE97D24D4","orcidId":"0000-0003-2048-9205","documentHash":"e042435c-367b-4f59-86d9-aefae64814ff"}],"doi":"10.1002/aqc.3779"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biochar","municipal solid waste","undersized fraction","ammonia emission","carbon dioxide","aerobic biostabilization"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918c878c28a04737e08c","uid":"bbip_kWUjcRWwim80LuSB4g","uuid":"92447067-30f0-4cec-82d0-68fd4d6f1c81","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","parentUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de38","rootUuid":"becb0b4c-82d4-43a3-8673-2e07bf987463","name":"Wydział Inżynierii Produkcji i Energetyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709447878c28a0473b9767","5e709428878c28a0473b74a5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Impact of Biochar Addition and Air-Flow Rate on Ammonia and Carbon Dioxide Concentration in the Emitted Gases from Aerobic Biostabilization of Waste","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1944","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-26","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62723c404097077af525e03c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709428878c28a0473b74a5","5e709447878c28a0473b9767"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Application of additives to waste may influence the course of the biostabilization process and contribute to its higher effectiveness, as well as to a reduction in greenhouse gas and ammonia (NH3) emission from this process.

Six different biochar additives and three different air-flow rates were investigated for 21 days. It was found that biochar addition contributes to extending the thermophilic phase duration (observed in the case of the addition of 3% and 5% of biochar). The concentration of CO2 in exhaust gases was closely related to the course of temperature changes.

Likely, the crucial step to prevent bird-glass collisions is understanding spatial and temporal bird-glass collision patterns. As more and more glass-made constructions appear in public spaces, it becomes essential to identify main drivers of bird collisions with these novel objects. In this study, we perform an attempt to identify local characteristics that may influence the risk of bird collisions with glass bus shelters. We monitored 58 bus shelters from March to July 2018 in urban and rural habitats of south-western Poland. We visited the shelters searching for bird carcasses and traces of collisions but also surveyed birds near shelters, considering the two scales (20 and 100 m of the shelter), and bird behavior (flying vs non-flying). We found 52 evidence of bird collisions and number of collisions per bus shelter ranged from 0 to 7 which substantially deviated from random distribution. Bird abundances recorded near bus shelters, recorded at both 20 m and 100 m scales, were poor predictors of bird-glass collisions and did not improve parsimony of models explaining collision risk. This refers to all recorded birds as well as to the subsets of flying individuals and species being collision victims. Similarly, habitat composition near bus shelters hardly predicted variation in bird-glass collision risk. As we did not manage to identify any important drivers explaining collision risk, we conclude that before we learn how to predict areas with high number of bird-glass collisions, we suggest that developers, urban planners and architects should be advised to design all public transportation shelters using nontransparent materials."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058108627","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6273cbee40970720005bac89","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"217","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"89c40da3-6f75-44cf-88eb-fd7b78443e6e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"217","pagesFromTo":"104285","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0169204621002486?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6273cbee40970720005bac87","name":"Michał","lastName":"Żmihorski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"30792e2c-5e8f-44e1-aedc-f61d43cb3129"},{"objectId":"6273cbee40970720005bac85","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Kolanek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4f7e876a-2329-4dd1-84ec-a325f1759370"},{"objectId":"6273cbee40970720005bac84","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Pietkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a311a43a-993b-497f-aba9-fe126f828e96"},{"objectId":"6273cbee40970720005bac83","name":"Hanna","lastName":"Sztwiertnia","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"03efaba0-d0be-43b1-a2a5-449959c2e341"},{"objectId":"6273cbee40970720005bac82","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Zyśk-Gorczyńska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4d295858-47d9-4fe6-ab14-604e0f73f4ed"},{"objectId":"5e70946f878c28a0473bcf0b","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Bojarska","uuid":"1CD6F8BF56BABD6840899C7AFF17A6996219F0A766C08845B246724D0A83F5CF99CFA77B4A1F4D99B5042D1EA0D2277514345411A2C4E887222A7B9250687100","orcidId":"0000-0001-7141-3118","documentHash":"624cfc0a-4c4a-4664-a932-a2fa1ccf81d5"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.104285"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dispersion","experimental study","glass","nonlinearity","pumping","refractive index"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5fbdbeb6085dcb3958990a72","uid":"b6BkjFeIM7Ot5q0lVE0xCWg","uuid":"e228e3b7-3b6f-414f-9deb-a7b08b90f9e3","parentId":"5fbdbeb6085dcb3958990a72","parentUuid":"e228e3b7-3b6f-414f-9deb-a7b08b90f9e3","rootId":"5fbdbeb6085dcb3958990a72","rootUuid":"e228e3b7-3b6f-414f-9deb-a7b08b90f9e3","name":"Sieć Badawcza Łukasiewicz - Instytut Mikroelektroniki i Fotoniki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709358878c28a0473a7a75","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3fd0","5e709431878c28a0473b7e3d"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df15","uid":"bR42jPDMRkKGHv60Y9Q25kQ","uuid":"9b699ae6-6e42-406f-ab02-2d5c171b6c86","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Fizyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709358878c28a0473a7a75","5e709430878c28a0473b7e1d","5e709431878c28a0473b7e3d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Two octave supercontinuum generation in a non-silica graded-index multimode fiber","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f7e","mniswId":"14814","title":"Nature Communications","doi":null,"issn":"2041-1723","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"167820eb-857b-4f7e-affb-5bc3c9056dfe"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"627222184097077af525358c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["627222184097077af525358d","627222194097077af525358e","5e709431878c28a0473b7e3d","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3fd0","5e709430878c28a0473b7e1d","5e709358878c28a0473a7a75","627222194097077af5253593","627222194097077af5253594"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The generation of a two-octave supercontinuum from the visible to mid-infrared (700–2800 nm) in a non-silica graded-index multimode fiber is reported. The fiber design is based on a nanostructured core comprised of two types of drawn lead-bismuth-gallate glass rods with different refractive indices. This yields an effective parabolic index profile and ten times increased nonlinearity when compared to silica fibers. Using femtosecond pulse pumping at wavelengths in both normal and anomalous dispersion regimes, a detailed study is carried out into the supercontinuum generating mechanisms and instabilities seeded by periodic self-imaging. Significantly, suitable injection conditions in the high power regime are found to result in the output beam profile showing clear signatures of beam self-cleaning from nonlinear mode mixing. Experimental observations are interpreted using spatio-temporal 3+1D numerical simulations of the generalized nonlinear Schrödinger equation, and simulated spectra are in excellent agreement with experiment over the full two-octave spectral bandwidth. Experimental comparison with the generation of supercontinuum in a silica graded-index multimode fiber shows that the enhanced nonlinear refractive index of the lead-bismuth-gallate fiber yields a spectrum with a significantly larger bandwidth.

Rheumatic diseases are one of the most common problems in modern societies. The majority of rheumatic diseases occur when the human immune system attacks its own tissues, including the joints. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of sex, age, and drugs on element levels in synovial fluids originating from patients with arthritis and rheumatic diseases.\nMethods: This study was based on a flame atomic absorption (FAAS) and emission spectroscopic analysis (AES) of the concentration of selected essential elements, including both microelements (iron, zinc, copper, and manganese) and macro elements (calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium) and their interpretation by statistical methods.\nResults: The concentrations of essential elements in synovial fluids showed the following order: Mn > Fe > Zn > Cu for microelements, and Na > Mg > Ca > K for macro elements. It was also revealed that in the case of arthritis (rheumatic disease) several elements, such as Fe, Zn, K, Mg, and Ca were accumulated in the synovial fluid. The linear correlation coefficients indicated statistically significant relationships among elements in the investigated samples, such as Fe and Zn, and Ca and Mg. A negative correlation was found between Zn and Na.\nConclusions: The chemical profiling of synovial fluids of patients with rheumatic diseases based on the identification of essential elements and applying principal component analysis (PCA), allowed us to identify that the levels of Fe, Zn, Ca, Mg, and K have the highest impact on the differentiation of synovial fluid samples. No significant differences in element levels by sex or age were observed. The drug effect was especially significant for Zn, Cu, Na, and K, where differences in these element levels were noticed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058108712","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6220ba392467f004a5a7f5dc","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"945cc104-680f-4836-9df2-bdd7a4374531"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"3","pagesFromTo":"1

analizuje stan zaawansowania i perspektywy cyfrowej transformacji w przedsiębiorstwach przemysłu spożywczego w Polsce. W ocenie wykorzystano wskaźnik intensywności cyfrowej Eurostatu oraz wyniki badań DIGI Index firmy Siemens. Zdecydowana większość przedsiębiorstw przemysłu spożywczego w Polsce nie przekroczyła progu 3 punktów na 12. punktowej skali stosowanej przez Eurostat do obliczania DII (w ostatnich latach było to średnio ponad 70% przedsiębiorstw zatrudniających 10 i więcej osób). Niski poziom cyfryzacji potwierdzają również badania DIGI Index na grupie przedsiębiorstw zatrudniających od 50 do 249 pracowników (zarówno w 2020 r., jak i w 2021 r. wynik ten wyniósł tylko 1,7). Przeprowadzona ocena pozwala również stwierdzić, że pandemia Covid-19 w umiarkowanym stopniu wpłynęła na przyspieszenie cyfrowych zmian w przedsiębiorstwach sektora. Słabe oceny stanu zaawansowania cyfryzacji w przedsiębiorstwach przemysłu spożywczego w Polsce mogą niepokoić, zwłaszcza w kontekście rosnących oczekiwań rynku odnośnie do udziału przedsiębiorstw sektora w budowie zrównoważonej, konkurencyjnej i odpornej na wstrząsy gospodarki żywnościowej."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article analyzes the state of advancement and prospects of digital transformation in food industry enterprises in Poland. The Eurostat’s Digital Intensity Index (DII) and the Siemens DIGI Index study results are used in the evaluation. The vast majority of food industry enterprises in Poland did not exceed the threshold of 3 points on the 12-point scale used by Eurostat to calculate DII (in recent years it was on average over 70% of enterprises employing 10 or more people). The low level of digitalization is also confirmed by the results of the DIGI Index for enterprises with 50 to 249 employees (both in 2020 and in 2021, the value of the index reached only 1.7). The conducted assessment also allows to conclude that the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the acceleration of digital changes in the sector was moderate.

Analizie poddane zostały czynniki kształtujące kulturę organizacji uczelni wyższych, czynniki zapewniające spójność tej organizacji, czynniki i wartości, które ją kształtują i są postrzegane przez pracowników naukowych jako kryteria sukcesu organizacji. Jest to fragment wyników szerzej prowadzonych badań w latach 2020 i 2021. Głównym narzędziem badawczym był kwestionariusz ankiety – OCAI wg Camerona K.S. i Quinna R. E. Ankietę skierowano do 7 ośrodków akademickich. Dobór próby badawczej był celowy, a respondentami byli pracownicy naukowo – dydaktyczni ze stażem pracy dłuższym niż 5 lat. Próba badawcza stanowiła 35 procent wszystkich respondentów w dwóch grupach badanych. Analiza wyników i ich prezentacja została przedstawiona na układzie współrzędnych. Artykuł to studium przypadku. Artykuł zawiera nowe znaczące informacje dotyczące transformacji, którym obecne podlegają uczelnie. Przedstawia poglądy i dyskusje jakie toczą się wśród akademików. Stanowi pomost między teorią i praktyką. Posiada zatem nie tylko walory teoretyczne, ale i praktyczne. W badanych organizacjach panuje przewaga kultury hierarchicznej z niewielką tendencją kultury rynku. Natomiast respondenci opowiadają się za kulturą klanu i adhokracji. Tradycyjny etos pracownika akademickiego, poddany jest presji zmian w kierunku ukształtowania \"profesjonalnego pracownika wiedzy\". Wg respondentów za miarę sukcesu uważa się rozwój zasobów ludzkich, troska o ludzi, praca zespołowa i zaangażowanie pracowników."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the article was to diagnose the organizational culture of universities in the opinion of employees and university authorities. The factors shaping the culture of the organization of universities were analyzed, factors ensuring the cohesion of this organization, factors and values that shape and are perceived by academics as criteria for the organization’s success. This is part of the results of more extensive research in 2020 and 2021. The main research tool was the survey questionnaire – OCAI accord- ing to Cameron K.S. and Quinn R. E. The survey was sent to 7 academic centers. The selection of the research sample was deliberate, and the respondents were research and teaching staff with more than 5 years of work experience. The research sample accounted for 35 percent of all respondents in the two study groups. The analysis of the results and their presentation is presented in the coordinate system. The article is a case study. The article contains significant new information about the transformation that current universities are undergoing. It presents the views and discussions taking place among academics. It is a bridge between theory and practice. Therefore, it has not only theoretical but also practical values. Hierarchical culture prevails in the analyzed organizations, with a slight tendency in the market culture. On the other hand, respondents are in favor of a clan culture and adhocracy. The traditional ethos of an academic worker is subject to the pressure of changes in the direction of shap- ing a „professional knowledge worker”. According to the respondents, the measure of success is the development of human resources, care for people, teamwork and employee commitment."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058108724","journalIssue":{"objectId":"626a4e154097075861cb85cc","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"30","doi":null,"documentHash":"9130a98c-1f2e-4ab4-8ee4-7dcbe4bc9dab"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"81-94","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"Transformation of academic culture in a new model of higher education management in Poland – research report"}],"publicUri":"http://www.pedkat.pl/images/czasopisma/pk30/Pedagogika_Katolicka_30_net.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7091fd878c28a04738e396","name":"Danuta","lastName":"Mierzwa","uuid":"A80F8B8CCB75C2E2B3CAD924E88C84617A6A9D38A1AFCDD2C2EAA3846BF8A2926C05FB87880606E9A5259850F86FE121D96A247020CCE4054497CE37A2E8A352","orcidId":"0000-0002-4524-1241","documentHash":"9d514f64-ad0d-479d-9854-ebfee8312ff4"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6272a6f14097077af527e38f","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-92170-5","title":"Ancient Textile Production from an Interdisciplinary Perspective: Humanities and Natural Sciences Interwoven for our Understanding of Textiles","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"9783030921699","ismn":null,"issn":"1568-2722","url":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-030-92170-5.pdf","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"ffb1005a-54df-4cc5-93d5-65a2528d5820","publisher":{"objectId":"5e710c8046e0fb0001bafbe8","mniswId":null,"name":"Springer International Publishing","documentHash":"4b72cfd7-604a-44d2-8eb7-568cba1daf27"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5f5acc6c752340073806a9a0","uid":"brZDifRBMHGI91kY17HIq4A","uuid":"c6d3c564-2d7b-4da1-9c13-74923e459faa","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Archeologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709356878c28a0473a7998"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Introduction","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6272a7f74097077af5280779","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709356878c28a0473a7998","6272a7f74097077af528077c","6272a7f74097077af528077d","6272a7f74097077af528077e"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058108727","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"3-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-92170-5?page=1#about","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6272a7f74097077af528077e","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Öhrman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d6b41aab-5123-43af-8ead-b21d94e6e296"},{"objectId":"6272a7f74097077af528077d","name":"Ina","lastName":"Vanden Berghe","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0af47fc1-d71a-46fd-bc0e-76d86f874484"},{"objectId":"6272a7f74097077af528077c","name":"Karina","lastName":"Grömer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"04380de7-dd3c-44e0-b4a0-ad35294a192a"},{"objectId":"5e709356878c28a0473a7998","name":"Agata","lastName":"Ulanowska","uuid":"93A2AAE883105D3690234F4F78DC84F94F3C8409FAD32B8C603A986547CC4612589F6EEE4C771F458AD7E20455CA5B8134E67785D75667E79082946378BBB0AD","orcidId":"0000-0002-4946-2711","documentHash":"5c0ca43c-fd5a-4ec6-87f1-50d96744540a"}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-92170-5_1"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["osoba","autorytet","przywódca","wychowawca","formator","adept","wychowanek"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["person","authority","leader","educator","formator","model","adept","pupil"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"60926ddd2467f059f3eac581","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"AWL im. gen.

Tego rodzaju autorytet daleki jest od dominacji negującej lub ograniczającej autonomię osoby. Nie wyklucza on, obok uznania pozytywnych wartości, widzenia w swoim autorytecie również stron słabych. W ten sposób wychowawczo-twórczy autorytet inspirandera wspomaga osobę w jej dojrzewaniu, w wewnętrznym uwalnianiu się od tego, co opiera się na ukrytej indoktrynacji. Jan Paweł II skierował wezwanie do polskich wychowawców: „Trzeba, abyście byli dla młodych przyjaciółmi, wiernymi towarzyszami i sprzymierzeńcami w młodzieńczej walce.

This kind of authority is far from being dominant that denies or limits the autonomy of the person. He does not exclude, apart from recognizing positive values, also seeing weaknesses in his authority. In this way, the educative and creative authority of the inspirer supports the person in his maturation, in freeing himself internally from what is based on hidden indoctrination.

aimed to assess whether the ongoing course of the COVID-19 epidemic has been associated with an increased risk of adverse pathology (AP) findings in prostate cancer (PC) patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP). We performed a retrospective data analysis which included 408 consecutive, non-metastatic, previously untreated PC patients who underwent RP in our institution between March 2020 and September 2021. Patients were divided into two equally numbered groups in regard to the median surgery date (Early Epidemic [EE] and Late Epidemic [LE]) and compared. Adverse pathology was defined as either grade group (GG) ≥ 4, pT ≥ 3a or pN+ at RP. Patients in the LE group demonstrated significantly higher rates of AP than in the EE group (61 vs. 43% overall and 50 vs. 27% in preoperative non-high-risk subgroup, both p < 0.001), mainly due to higher rates of upgrading. On multivariable analysis, consecutive epidemic week (odds ratio: 1.02, 95% confidence interval: 1.00–1.03, p = 0.009) as well as biopsy GG ≥ 2 and a larger prostate volume (mL) were associated with AP in non-high-risk patients. The study serves as a warning call for increased awareness of risk underassessment in contemporarily treated PC patients."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058108754","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62961acf4097072fefbc33d7","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"29","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"97a399ea-d845-4da5-bf7d-d452bfe45ffc"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"2768-2775","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1718-7729/29/4/225/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6272249f4097077af5253a5b","name":"Roman","lastName":"Sosnowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4894-4233","documentHash":"e223256d-48d8-4dc2-929a-544c6de8c063"},{"objectId":"6272249f4097077af5253a58","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Mielczarek","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4840-2442","documentHash":"d035b922-f81f-421f-a7a7-049eaa8dea8d"},{"objectId":"6272249f4097077af5253a57","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Baranek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"46bb6e02-3488-4462-a0e7-78e040ce3a5d"},{"objectId":"6272249f4097077af5253a56","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Tokarczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"30ae7d9d-f821-41c1-92ab-d106e2d6c12b"},{"objectId":"6272249f4097077af5253a55","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Zagożdżon","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2c35f0f3-da07-456c-a88d-c490b7aafd04"},{"objectId":"60c32c479543c72336543fbe","name":"Hubert","lastName":"Kamecki","uuid":"28F24E0EBB559597BA534AB6941FC77FE2DE669354CE212E24092FC5528FC867392B7F717B6F8DCA95337B6BE179243D3A2D135CB224CE6F60418B7BE890D80E","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3370931e-f257-4579-9af3-6c7cd0534b91"},{"objectId":"5e7094e7878c28a0473c6637","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kryst","uuid":"1183CCA8E39C0C6120D4404005AF4DA5CD2634CC50E0AE80B9CDE7F63822B59E5D5B53DA3B74AEF4E514A56959C0E3F9ECDD9C5F43CCCFDDD8A63603B90330DD","orcidId":"0000-0003-2551-0296","documentHash":"a2c54de5-fa14-4d8f-8fc8-96344072d2d1"},{"objectId":"5e709431878c28a0473b7eef","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Poletajew","uuid":"3D8B133EA3D9C8FF555814C68B94027AEC73DDBF24F58A4179551F942A96E38C57B522B196307EC6503823D1A2FB5B5003BD63F220C0D06DD9B76786218F9B55","orcidId":"0000-0001-7664-9816","documentHash":"ce0a4ef3-d967-4afa-b1c1-744fe9dfd4f0"},{"objectId":"5e709429878c28a0473b762f","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Szempliński","uuid":"9F6C076E7ACB395D8EBE6AE0F07FA5CC9E59AA675CDFE53727D582A69E07472C5524DC5B8A2E2E684621DDFA8C45E53298E31BDCFEA8D83C9965865C1BF906DF","orcidId":"0000-0002-4441-3937","documentHash":"930b0b63-b5e6-4b67-8cc6-6dd81962d17f"},{"objectId":"5e709429878c28a0473b7610","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Nyk","uuid":"132100FB34811042687E23D0011B784EBBDCED7F06E1B3CEE37B6A9C1F8F9D982AFA742F51E5EE5907A2D03CDDF12C8D05270B37619681DBC33CCD898C76432F","orcidId":"0000-0003-4783-7273","documentHash":"75ce1071-37cd-44b3-a158-c38ad0839310"}],"doi":"10.3390/curroncol29040225"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["energy

essence of the research was the modeling of a real electric energy storage system in a phase change battery operating in a foil tunnel. The scope of the work covered the construction of two partial models, i.e., energy storage in the PCM accumulator and heat losses in the PCM accumulator. Their construction was based on modeling methods selected on the basis of a literature review and previous analyses, i.e., artificial neural networks, random forest, enhanced regression trees, MARS plines, standard multiple regression, standard regression trees, exhaustive for regression trees. Based on the analysis of the error values, the models of the best quality were selected. The final result of this study was the construction of such a model of the process of storing electricity in a PCM battery, characterized by the mean absolute percentage error forecast error of 1–2%. The achievement of this goal was possible thanks to the use of the artificial neural networks model for which the input variables were the amount of energy supplied to the accumulator and the temperature of the heat storage medium."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058108758","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e6eab52467f030e8c433a6","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"6f6ef340-c61f-44fb-8d93-a045bc59a21f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/3/735/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62737381409707200058e39a","name":"Anna","lastName":"Karbowniczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cd99a155-574e-40de-803a-c271efbf792a"},{"objectId":"5e709307878c28a0473a1844","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Bergel","uuid":"91F4E8A929116B296C9D862E91AD37DDBB075FC1535DCA57BB180E46A9C9387E361EF7AC928EF306BF521B87E3CFAA48489FC0F90051C9414FA3F6DEA8F7E395","orcidId":"0000-0003-0475-112X","documentHash":"f33b704a-5cc3-4275-bd8e-8bab5f800c1f"},{"objectId":"5e709306878c28a0473a1562","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Nęcka","uuid":"002C9AC654BDAF416C8FD168FD3C5C8AE72D22B014043BA6AC785AB6C631E653C0A6004A0367F8BEA7B90F7F705DE52E206FD0A79B7992EF761DCBBB68891752","orcidId":"0000-0002-0401-1239","documentHash":"4b72aaf0-69fb-4204-ae37-4ee6c0621ccb"},{"objectId":"5e709306878c28a0473a155b","name":"Hubert","lastName":"Latała","uuid":"4F4F53EDDE62826544EEF4A8649829DB5D281300A7EF0A57405048A7436BD15283141825FC2F78D0E5132759819B135B859729CE43074F0A5726F6A53EC9799B","orcidId":"0000-0002-8572-407X","documentHash":"45150c17-026c-43f3-b324-a63463ea4732"},{"objectId":"5e709306878c28a0473a1558","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Kurpaska","uuid":"1E22713E6732C3600E3E497026181E01DBE22DD3078A3B4442F53D23A269411A03AEB834910247541E84CA2A77CC04DB0133B025F1E73E3071C4B80A532C20C6","orcidId":"0000-0003-1885-4568","documentHash":"4db440c1-c527-4a15-ac3b-0f445d19b3ae"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15030735"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["horse

aim of this study was to identify how the literature analyzes (identifies, evaluates, forecasts, etc.) the relationship between health issues and urban policy in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Four main levels were identified in these cases: (1) direct demands for changes in health care, (2) social issues, (3) spatial organization and (4) redefining the tasks of public authority in the face of identified challenges. The basic working method used in the study assumed a critical analysis of the literature on the subject. The time scope of the search covered articles from January 2020 to the end of August 2021 (thus covering the period of three pandemic waves). Combinations of keywords in the titles were used to search for articles. The health perspective pointed to the need for urban policies to develop a balance between health and economic costs and for coordination between different professionals/areas. A prerequisite for such a balance in cities is the carrying out of social and spatial analyses. These should illustrate the diversity of the social situations in individual cities (and more broadly in urban areas, including, sometimes, large suburbs) and the diversity’s relationship (both in terms of causes and consequences) to the severity of pandemics and other health threats."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058108767","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62664e2b4097071c15d8ac2d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"19","number":"9","doi":"","documentHash":"c558534a-bd36-488f-87e5-04ba77466276"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/9/5322","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"672e0cddfdbe830349904aab","name":"Maciej ","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"02c1ada4-c6fe-4145-a590-6822373ca9fc"},{"objectId":"672e0cddfdbe830349904aaa","name":"Victoriya","lastName":" Pantyley","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ac501ae5-16ca-4418-bfcd-2601d2a26a8c"},{"objectId":"672e0cddfdbe830349904aa9","name":"Mark W.

Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica have been selectively bred to develop their psychoactive properties. The increasing use in many countries has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Cannabis can provoke both type 1 and type 4 allergic reactions. Officially recognized allergens include a pathogenesis-related class 10 allergen, profilin, and a nonspecific lipid transfer protein. Other allergens may also be relevant, and recognition of allergens may vary between countries and continents. Cannabis also has the potential to provoke allergic cross-reactions to plant foods. Since cannabis is an illegal substance in many countries, research has been hampered, leading to challenges in diagnosis since no commercial extracts are available for testing. Even in countries such as Canada, where cannabis is legalized, diagnosis may rely solely on the purchase of cannabis for prick-to-prick skin tests.

The aim of this study was to test if s-Klotho level is associated with cardiometabolic risk markers in younger healthy men in order to verify the possible role of s-Klotho level as an early marker of cardiometabolic risk. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 186 healthy men (M<sub>age</sub>=35.33, SD<sub>age</sub>=3.47) from a Western urban population. Serum basal levels of s-Klotho, lipid profile, homocysteine, glycemia markers, C-reactive protein, liver transaminases and creatinine were evaluated. Also, blood pressure was measured and cardiometabolic risk score and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were calculated. Testosterone and cortisol levels, self-reported psychological stress, physical activity, smoking in the past, alcohol use and body adiposity were controlled for. We found no relationship between levels of s-Klotho and physiological markers of cardiometabolic risk in the studied population. The results were similar when controlled for adiposity, testosterone level, physical activity, alcohol use and smoking in the past.

The present study utilized a large, well-characterized sample of veterans and service members (N = 493) engaged in intensive psychotherapy to investigate the associations between CRP, trauma exposure, related variables, and PTSD and depression, as well as investigating if CRP was associated with PTSD psychotherapy treatment response. Bivariate correlation results indicate that CRP was significantly associated with BMI (r = 0.48) and severity of experiences of childhood physical and sexual abuse (r = 0.14 and 0.15, respectively) and was not significantly associated with baseline PTSD total symptom severity, PTSD symptom clusters, or depression symptom severity (rs ranging from -0.03 to 0.04). In multivariate regression models investigating if CRP and related variables were associated with PTSD baseline symptom severity, CRP was not a significant predictor (β = -0.03). Hierarchical linear modeling did not identify CRP as a significant predictor of PTSD psychotherapy outcome. Given that findings indicate that CRP was broadly elevated in this treatment seeking sample but not associated with PTSD and depression symptom severity, results suggest CRP may not be a specific biomarker for PTSD or depression but may be elevated in psychiatric disease more generally."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111037","journalIssue":{"objectId":"627a349a4097077f84edd808","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"101","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"db7f2b28-8841-4273-a772-fca6d2e0ee61"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"101","pagesFromTo":"84-92","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159121006565?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"627a32d14097077f84edba7b","name":"Barbara O.","lastName":"Rothbaum","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2c6fd88f-a2ce-43c4-8535-69b6975e0087"},{"objectId":"627a32d14097077f84edba7a","name":"Vasiliki","lastName":"Michopoulos","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ed05bb6c-63e2-4f17-91f8-86298016ec20"},{"objectId":"627a32d14097077f84edba79","name":"Sheila A.M.","lastName":"Rauch","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3d63ebd4-e3ee-494f-b4a2-7959c6a40b15"},{"objectId":"627a32d14097077f84edba78","name":"Boadie W.","lastName":"Dunlop","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ecf064fd-e1b2-49ef-9af5-6e3b3b359a24"},{"objectId":"627a32d14097077f84edba77","name":"Mbapelen","lastName":"Unongo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"329d9388-65a4-48ca-b6e0-92f2cd1f0845"},{"objectId":"627a32d14097077f84edba67","name":"Alex O.","lastName":"Rothbaum","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c9c6b4e9-77a4-4188-a30b-63d001014aaf"},{"objectId":"627a32d14097077f84edba3b","name":"Samantha C.","lastName":"Patton","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fa6add6e-e3d2-42f7-b77b-fd15ab941108"},{"objectId":"627a32d14097077f84edb9f8","name":"Laura E.","lastName":"Watkins","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e0e2603b-4099-452c-a618-4e9f6f7de864"},{"objectId":"627a32d14097077f84edb9dc","name":"Meghna","lastName":"Ravi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5a544d75-3d39-44e8-bcb3-68f76a50946b"},{"objectId":"627a32d14097077f84edb954","name":"Carly","lastName":"Yasinski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5ccebe5f-b51f-454c-96d7-2f29af770480"},{"objectId":"627a32d14097077f84edb952","name":"Jessica L.","lastName":"Maples-Keller","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4877236d-bfbb-4288-ac93-4a9b2e6ecb83"},{"objectId":"607a68969543c73526c4875e","name":"Monika","lastName":"Stojek","uuid":"737C322FFFB655157A5965AB09A8A11935D2A2A3E1730847DD889DAF0BAC25C64BABA5F71CB01D362725A92E10FE07AFE9F26FD0BBA45FFF93CE2E72B25329C8","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"941908dd-a77f-4724-9870-7cc671ba2f3b"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.bbi.2021.12.025"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Kluczowe kompetencje","luka umiejętności","kompetencje menedżerskie","umiejętności menedżerskie","firmy IT","Przemysł 4.0","zarządzanie strategiczne"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Key competences","skills’ gap","managerial competences","managerial skills","IT companies","Industry 4.0","strategic management"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Skills’ Gap of Management Staff in Poland: Results of a Research of IT Companies","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dc39","mniswId":"22361","title":"European Research Studies Journal","doi":null,"issn":"1108-2976","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e13ec1b4-9fe9-4c4d-9da5-bd3082096ed5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-05","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62135e7a2467f01c210b748a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709252878c28a047393b06","5e709252878c28a047393a66","5e709252878c28a047393a7c"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Purpose: This article attempts to answer the following questions: What key competences and skills should characterise managers in the information technology (IT) sector; is there a skills’ gap, that is, a discrepancy between the desired and actual skills of IT managers; and what activities can contribute to minimising the identified skills’ gap? Design/Methodology/Approach: Answering the above-mentioned research questions required reviewing the literature on the subject and conducting research. The research covered 504 managers representing all levels of management in IT companies operating in Poland. The collected data were subjected to statistical analysis, based on which conclusions were drawn. Findings: It has been found that the smallest skills’ gap includes: using technological solutions efficiently, cooperating with others, disposing of the knowledge possessed and drawing conclusions based on one’s own mistakes. The greatest skills’ gap occurs in the areas of obtaining funds from outside an enterprise, making accurate assessments of the emotions occurring in a team, and making accurate personnel decisions as well as correcting mistakes, synthetic thinking and managing finances properly. Practical Implications: The presented results on the skills’ gap is part of a wider research project aimed at identifying and assessing the levels of the key competences of managers employed in IT companies. In order to minimise the identified skills’ gap, specific actions were recommended to be taken to improve these skills. Originality/Value: The value of the conducted research procedure is the identification of key skills of tactical and operational level managers of IT companies and their arrangement due to the size of the gap between the actual and desired state. Actions to improve key managerial skills were also identified. These activities may help increase the effectiveness and competitiveness of Polish IT companies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111043","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"25","pagesFromTo":"463-476","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.ersj.eu/journal/2864","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393b06","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Klimanek","uuid":"EB6421CB23494449E7835326513BF7E6A8F762CD8AD7B268BDB30169405389E5B73A63BEB51024A05897A5CCC860411AD8731E5724E91FCA70C367B22CD5B88D","orcidId":"0000-0001-6411-8145","documentHash":"6f69e5e8-0472-4a42-976c-9a65d033965e"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393a7c","name":"Gabriela","lastName":"Roszyk-Kowalska","uuid":"30EA80A6F26F1B322B7C770603ECD6E399C5DEC83D729FA3ADA85DB3C55732D31FE80DC09D06F1B2FA927635FBD42E0DE48C0E74BB603A414C41FBFCB5D65B7F","orcidId":"0000-0002-8424-471X","documentHash":"4da0b62d-9aef-457f-aa0b-d15e284394fe"},{"objectId":"5e709252878c28a047393a66","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Kraśniak","uuid":"2F8BCFEE2ADF8EF91AFEC989CAA949AD9C2A6741C639887B14BE8A530423F1EDB6BFD12B62E2AD72B5192DD727E1FEA89F883F995D92C306801759806A845860","orcidId":"0000-0003-1864-9687","documentHash":"9defed5e-ed9d-4942-8cfd-a7ebced854f3"}],"doi":"10.35808/ersj/2864"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["risks management;","FMECA;","compounded ointments;","priority risk number"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","uid":"bLDwoyIU1jG5BHqZ9HzVPQg","uuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","parentUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","rootUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","name":"Wyższa Szkoła Informatyki i Zarządzania z siedzibą w Rzeszowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094ec878c28a0473c712c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Compounding in Ukraine: Assessment of the Risks for the Ointment’s Quality by the FMECA Method","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a483","mniswId":"18262","title":"Scientia Pharmaceutica","doi":null,"issn":"0036-8709","eissn":"2218-0532","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"3b77837a-589a-4d78-ab5b-0257c9353969"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6278c9e94097077547e80a47","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6278c9e94097077547e80a49","6278c9e94097077547e80a4a","5e7094ec878c28a0473c712c","6278c9e94097077547e80a4c","6278c9e94097077547e80a4d","6278c9e94097077547e80a4e"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The level of compounded medicines (CM) quality has always been questioned in different countries. This problem has been resolved by the introduction of quality assurance system (QAS) standards. One of its main areas of significance is the risks assessment process, which is especially important for the compounding pharmacy according to the requirements of different international documents. Since ointments constitute a large part of CM, quantity assessment of risks for their quality by the FMECA method has been completed. During the first step of the research, 42 potential deviations of compounded ointments (CO) quality were identified. Via the questioning of compounding pharmacies specialists in different regions of Ukraine by a pre-developed ten-point scale, the severity of deviations consequence, their occurrence probability, and detecting possibility were determined followed by the calculation of the priority risk number (PRN) value. The Pareto analysis showed that nine possible CO quality defects represented 21% of their total number. Defects related to the composition or technology of ointments (29%) and their compliance with microbiological purity requirements (23%) had the largest percentage contribution to the total PRN value. It was also found that the deviations consequence had the most serious impact on the CO quality, due to their direct influence on patient health."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111050","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6278c9e94097077547e80a50","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"90","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"78ebfcfb-a4fd-4e7b-bb19-20edc96d6d4f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"90","pagesFromTo":"25","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2218-0532/90/2/25/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6278c9e94097077547e80a4e","name":"Victoriya","lastName":"Georgiyants","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8794-8010","documentHash":"72376cda-1ae7-4199-8be5-172f350bcd6f"},{"objectId":"6278c9e94097077547e80a4d","name":"Alla","lastName":"Kotvitska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7bcea968-86e6-49c4-88be-a15d07c095c8"},{"objectId":"6278c9e94097077547e80a4c","name":"Liudas","lastName":"Ivanauskas","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-5390-2161","documentHash":"60152f3c-a2ca-48f9-8197-5698ce683f42"},{"objectId":"6278c9e94097077547e80a4a","name":"Yuri","lastName":"Pidpruzhnykov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f984d256-11d4-46b8-bbbe-633f0e5c7d37"},{"objectId":"6278c9e94097077547e80a49","name":"Lesia","lastName":"Savchenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f4728c4d-0154-441e-9763-6c9e2a890a46"},{"objectId":"5e7094ec878c28a0473c712c","name":"Roman","lastName":"Lesyk","uuid":"D728A949B46A56D324EDF1BD11664D3D9D9FAE6CC0795B0E89CF1ACC7549E6EF63BFBC2BABFE1DCB47456EB6757B88401F082652E7FC92EACFA1171944ABEF6C","orcidId":"0000-0002-3322-0080","documentHash":"2c28c04d-3562-4b8c-974b-f3378f68b546"}],"doi":"10.3390/scipharm90020025"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Polish Archaeological project","Däbrä Gərgis","Eastern Təgray","Late Aksumite Church","Rock Art Shelter","Ancient Inscriptions"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709193878c28a04737f076","uid":"bCqlW6h6zLWtH9yEf7K0C7w","uuid":"f52e973e-8178-4182-9255-a2732fc2c77e","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Centrum Archeologii Śródziemnomorskiej UW im. prof.

The definition of the term Interdisciplinary Team in the medical context is very simple. It is a group of people, specialists in various fields of medicine, dealing with solving a specific problem using the resources at the disposal of each member of such a Team. Polish realities in many cases are far from this concept, which, unfortunately, may result in worse therapy outcomes. Although each of the members of this team may think that his contribution is the most important, it is only the sum of all activities that translates into success, the effect of which is regaining the health lost by the patient, and this success is achieved by not one person but a multi-person team. Currently, it is not possible to provide a patient with only one specialist with the full range of medical services guaranteeing success. Treatment is a complex process involving diagnosticians (imaging diagnostics, laboratory diagnostics), a doctor, physiotherapist, psychologist, dietitian, nurse and many other specialists without whom it is difficult to imagine any treatment activities. The group should be led by a leader, but information on the patient’s health should be available to each member of the therapeutic team, and decisions should be made on the basis of joint arrangements, so that none of the team members “pulls in their way” but contributes to mutual success, what a healthy patient is. The work raises problems such as the lack of reliability of information, points to the unfavourable phenomenon of “generalization” of disease entities and the frequent dissonance in the selection of appropriate therapeutic measures. The article indicates only a few situations that cause inconsistencies in the patient’s rehabilitation process. The rights and scope of the work of a physiotherapist on the basis of current legal documents were emphasized, the possibilities of extending the qualifications of physiotherapists were highlighted and the opportunities that would be granted to physiotherapists after obtaining additional qualifications were emphasized as well."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111067","journalIssue":{"objectId":"620f5c312467f0419c589109","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"64","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"f30f84b9-e91f-47d7-b524-e1401c59b480"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"64","pagesFromTo":"65-67","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"pol","title":"Zespół interdyscyplinarny - czy w rehabilitacji medycznej występuje forma współpracy?"}],"publicUri":"https://actabalneologica.eu/wp-content/uploads/library/ActaBalneol2022i1.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"620f5c312467f0419c589104","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Dziwulski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bb21d03d-da1e-4913-a7b1-beb7d0b32f27"},{"objectId":"5e709378878c28a0473aa717","name":"Gustaw","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":"13498C70BCEF7DF23FEDF256561A8D02C76F2EF31B51D4065F0E0909656E488ED1FF59D1855EF81D4517F450B7578E8387B2A81E218E1A3EE8EFAC083143E4FC","orcidId":"0000-0001-5005-9711","documentHash":"b1a576db-11ac-4c6f-ba15-f08b2b2c4e42"},{"objectId":"5e709330878c28a0473a4a0f","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kadłubowska","uuid":"4D2C5F64CC295B45DE5197699701FD8FD71DC97DFDE99034C78ADE29DF0A90C00F367C8E07E280921A0D93F085EE31CA8BC11E1768FBE0DCEDFE8AC338A968C3","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"64399c3a-a3e4-4afa-9b82-be903a958765"},{"objectId":"5e70925a878c28a047394381","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Łuczak","uuid":"54E271F5CD060AEED10E2CEEEE37C718947539593907AABA11C06F5ED094441AD74498170593F95251C76F846F870BE50BDA03D6ED2D31A0331ED29248DAA631","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9df2baf0-2037-4329-bbc7-4e4e589b0700"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["methane","hard coal","methane hazard","lost gas","methane-bearing capacity"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decd","uid":"bDVT6eE951oVevqx9vwsANA","uuid":"52307719-d5a8-4e16-8c65-acc1f011e9bb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decd","parentUuid":"52307719-d5a8-4e16-8c65-acc1f011e9bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decd","rootUuid":"52307719-d5a8-4e16-8c65-acc1f011e9bb","name":"Główny Instytut Górnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d43","5e709384878c28a0473abb8e","5e70925a878c28a04739438b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Multi-Parameter Analysis of Gas Losses Occurring during the Determination of Methane-Bearing Capacity in Hard Coal Beds","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1073","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62750aea4097075854f7dcfc","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709384878c28a0473abb8e","5e70925a878c28a04739438b","5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d43"]},"issue":"9","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The content of natural methane in hard coal seams, called methane-bearing capacity, is the basic parameter that enables the level of methane hazard to be determined in hard coal mines. This parameter is also used to determine the potential quantities of methane that can be collected and used for energy purposes and the amount of its harmful emission to the atmosphere. Direct methods are most often used to determine methane-bearing capacity. An important aspect that has a great influence on the final result of the research is the gas losses generated at the stage of sampling. Under the conditions of the Polish mining industry, the direct drill cuttings method is used to determine the methane-bearing capacity. Gas losses are compensated for in this method with the use of the coefficient 1.12, by which the obtained result is multiplied. In this paper, a multi-parameter analysis of gas loss in the determination of methane-bearing capacity in hard coal seams has been carried out. Several experiments were performed to identify the most important aspects to be taken into account to obtain a correct result. A methane-bearing capacity test was conducted using two direct methods: the direct drill cuttings method, otherwise known as the single-phase vacuum degassing method, and a method based on the United States Bureau of Mines standards. Sorption studies, such as methane sorption kinetics tests, were also conducted in which sorption properties, such as sorption capacity, effective diffusion coefficient, and half sorption time, were determined. Methane sorption isotherms were also determined, and pore structure was analysed. Based on the obtained test results, an analysis was carried out which made it possible to present appropriate conclusions concerning the gas losses during the methane-bearing capacity test, generated at the stage of sampling. The final result of the work was the proposal of a new gas loss coefficient for the direct drill cuttings method of methane-bearing capacity determination."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111074","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"Artykuł nr 3239","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/9/3239","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d43","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Strzymczok","uuid":"6A62BE8845373CA834B0889510838B5652C2A7F42A13723BC3078DA3DDED35CA16C1796C4073206A3C84DA24C15BA0BC69BA82730DBFD4795EF824694A85FEB9","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"37c5e917-3ca1-4bb4-a8d7-35ac8e435f59"},{"objectId":"5e709384878c28a0473abb8e","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Karbownik","uuid":"82019E9D2E19E50F0DE3185CB4D3649A9968759487F3B8BC27A44CE6CA4D48AA869248747A5151E52E1C0F7A190941D3AADDB73A33776FA068D23F9EBC42B12A","orcidId":"0000-0001-5858-5345","documentHash":"fe3e49b8-31f0-42f3-9990-0b0fd98023fc"},{"objectId":"5e70925a878c28a04739438b","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Dudzińska","uuid":"5CF3E1A3B20AB45476443DC45180769245420A870CCAD2DE4BC442D878A0C90A7B7B4C7E8173094589B18EF4C6909DBB3D3E022246DCDC100345C97D45476C10","orcidId":"0000-0001-5522-9599","documentHash":"9c045cb4-f015-45c0-80db-42602d8518a8"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15093239"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Modified Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (M-VRPTW)","Simulated Annealing Algorithm Learning","Network Matrix of Travel Times Estimation","Time-Dependent Networks","Optimization of Parcel Distribution"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e175","uid":"bnkzr3UasiTz1vPP0WAl9JQ","uuid":"22f88d8c-2881-4cb6-91f4-78f30bd047ac","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wydział Cybernetyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a8878c28a04739a11e","5e7092a8878c28a04739a150","5e7092a8878c28a04739a193"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Machine learning algorithms for the problem of optimizing the distribution of parcels in time-dependent networks: the case study","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479c48","mniswId":"21035","title":"Archives of Transport","doi":null,"issn":"0866-9546","eissn":"2300-8830","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"bf140c6d-8e2d-4c80-849a-7893ca734f50"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6278dafa4097077547e89534","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092a8878c28a04739a193","5e7092a8878c28a04739a150","5e7092a8878c28a04739a11e"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the paper we present machine learning algorithms for the problem of optimizing the distribution of parcels in stochastic time-dependent networks, which have been built as a part of some Distribution Optimization System. The problem solved was a modified VRPTW (Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows) with many warehouses, a heterogeneous fleet, travel times depending on the time of departure (stochastic time-dependent network) and an extensive cost function as an optimization criterion. To solve the problem a modified simulated annealing (SATM) algorithm has been proposed. The paper presents the results of the algorithm learning process: the calibration of input parameters and the study of the impact of parameters on the quality of the solution (calculation time, transport cost function value) depending on the type of input data. The idea is to divide the input data into classes according to a proposed classification rule and to propose several strategies for selecting the optimal set of calibration parameters. These strategies consist in solving some multi-criteria optimization tasks in which four criterion functions are used: the length of the designated routes, the computation time, the number of epochs used in the algorithm, the number of designated routes. The subproblem was building a network model of travel times that is used in constructed SATM algorithm to determine the travel time between recipients, depending on the time of departure from the start location. An attempt has been made to verify the research hypothesis that the time between two points can be estimated with sufficient accuracy depending on their geographical location and the time of departure (without reference to the micro-scale, i.e. the detailed structure of the road network). The research was con-ducted on two types of data for Warsaw: from transport companies and one of the Internet traffic data providers. Learning the network model of travel times has produced very promising results, which will be described in the paper."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111085","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6278db684097077547e897ff","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"61","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"d9041a76-30b7-4a57-a401-3e07e343cec9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"61","pagesFromTo":"133-147","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.archivesoftransport.com/eaot/2022/01/009.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092a8878c28a04739a193","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Tarapata","uuid":"EC36814F57466460DC27BD7B2C14521F93E3D71D94B3A1B45B07CE27252C2972D4817B0C15DF613E46E1F8FF8D9E5F1D7BB90B9DE313DA5BD0CC9998C6DBBA10","orcidId":"0000-0001-8143-7869","documentHash":"d3ffff82-0a78-49ee-9aef-2a8041feb39e"},{"objectId":"5e7092a8878c28a04739a150","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Kulas","uuid":"2717BBC021F35CC916B197D7CACEC0C4994D25BDF94ACA48D4670C6F8E7BC7619F8FF275F68E6AE8B40ABBE99863C2D6C20510AC1FA1543E80A203941E7F8B03","orcidId":"0000-0003-1489-4407","documentHash":"83c0eebb-8458-4121-b272-effedfb3275c"},{"objectId":"5e7092a8878c28a04739a11e","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Antkiewicz","uuid":"75E56FCC177FB17BF32D575104A44B797190DAF8C5C000F875AF35CFEDF2586A082491F3BFD707DEC4025766FCE3BCB0B1B7889F8C6F831C1FB57C400219E83C","orcidId":"0000-0001-6749-6563","documentHash":"437e8142-c6c1-4d83-a7a2-2bcf95c6ac83"}],"doi":"10.5604/01.3001.0015.8269"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Bezpieczeństwo","Nauki o bezpieczeństwie","Prognozowanie","Zagrożenia militarne","Zagrożenia niemilitarne"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","uid":"bABmAiyO82JgMB2LqzOepAg","uuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","parentUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","rootUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","name":"Akademia Sztuki Wojennej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473973d0","5e709430878c28a0473b7d71"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Case Study Method as an Interdisciplinary Approach to the Issue of Estimating the Security Level","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dc39","mniswId":"22361","title":"European Research Studies Journal","doi":null,"issn":"1108-2976","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e13ec1b4-9fe9-4c4d-9da5-bd3082096ed5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6203ca862467f03b33817e9b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709430878c28a0473b7d71","5e709285878c28a0473973d0"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose: The article presents the case study method, which allows the use of an interdisciplinary approach to multi-faceted estimation of the security level (in various dimensions). Design/Methodology/Approach: Due to numerous threats, forecasting, as rational, scientific, predicting future events, i.e., inferring about unknown events based on known events, has become an important element of security sciences. It allows to predict future events with high probability and thus effectively react in a crisis or conflict situations. Findings: 21st century has been dominated by information technologies, and information itself is becoming an extremely valuable resource. Therefore, main finding is method of estimating the level of security - scheme of analysis (eight stages) of any potential threat, incident or phenomenon in the scope of security level estimation. Practical implications: The content of the article can be useful to theorists and practitioners who are concerned with security in all dimensions. Originality value: State security is a derivative of many different - individual and group - values in the field of security. Security, however, cannot be seen as the algebraic sum of the security of individuals and social groups, and international security as the sum of the security of individual states. A nation perceives its security through the prism of challenges and threats caused by conflicts that occur in a given society or its neighbourhood."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111088","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61fa6cee2467f066d6556069","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"xxv","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"0c102017-179e-457f-889b-55ffe4e5014c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"XXV","pagesFromTo":"296 - 307","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.ersj.eu/journal/2853","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7d71","name":"Milena","lastName":"Palczewska","uuid":"84EEE0E6DA82A663F5BB2E96721D1FD2DC73D48B23400C66BF6246E9471512E8A8155EE037B017054DA40263EB433B96AFC1BDC9A0F13262AB80267C87A340D1","orcidId":"0000-0003-1601-6851","documentHash":"2cdd7709-fa6f-41bf-b931-b6d952c1e6c9"},{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473973d0","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"PILARSKI","uuid":"E3720FAD4E91DFFF579294FA96D84F5DE1874818A7395E865FA3E3609FB15C109027EE114583626894FCD1D5981FEF0F55427081145C98CB218B047AD6E454B7","orcidId":"0000-0001-9728-2611","documentHash":"c6b2504d-6d8c-4a1d-ae4a-c735cc9beaf3"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["indigenous microorganisms","arbuscular mycorrhiza","phytoremediation","heavy metals","energy crops","Miscanthus"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709193878c28a04737f022","uid":"b7_F259x3z87jBCBjF7Iavw","uuid":"14c88ce5-55f8-4086-b853-97c0b922b478","parentId":"5e709193878c28a04737f022","parentUuid":"14c88ce5-55f8-4086-b853-97c0b922b478","rootId":"5e709193878c28a04737f022","rootUuid":"14c88ce5-55f8-4086-b853-97c0b922b478","name":"Instytut Ekologii Terenów Uprzemysłowionych","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ae878c28a04739a720","5e7092ae878c28a04739a9cc","5e70937f878c28a0473ab0f3","5e709301878c28a0473a0e6b","5e7092ea878c28a04739f208"]},{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ea878c28a04739f208"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Field Evaluation of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungal Colonization in Miscanthus × giganteus and Seed-Based Miscanthus Hybrids Grown in Heavy-Metal-Polluted Areas","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547e776","mniswId":"25607","title":"Plants","doi":null,"issn":"2223-7747","eissn":"2223-7747","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"0384f596-dba0-43e1-8c93-4e010072591e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6278bde54097077547e7ca6b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ae878c28a04739a9cc","5e7092ae878c28a04739a720","5e70937f878c28a0473ab0f3","5e709301878c28a0473a0e6b","5e7092ea878c28a04739f208"]},"issue":"9","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Understanding the behavior of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) associated with plants is essential for optimizing plant cultivation to the phytoremediation of degraded soils.

During the third and fourth growing seasons, higher concentration of metals in the roots and a limited transfer of metals from the roots to the shoots were observed in all the plants studied. After the third growing season, the lowest values of AMF colonization rates were observed for the GNT34 hybrid. After the fourth growing season, AMF colonization decreased, which could be due to the drought that occurred during that season. GNT34 showed a lower tendency to develop mycorrhizal structures on heavy-metal (HM)-contaminated soils than GNT41 and M × g; however, this hybrid was insensitive to changes in colonization rates during the dry growing season."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111094","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6278bde54097077547e7ca73","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"11","number":"9","doi":null,"documentHash":"aee4e004-9bd2-4cd5-9a67-8d2341e8040a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1216","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/11/9/1216/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70937f878c28a0473ab0f3","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Rusinowski","uuid":"A7FFD4F388DC92F0B452F809FC97FCD4C01AA4473E0233EC3D2925D752D6B22777C7EC39D423ED183F4D3260C93B16CDCAD7571BE6BC56EC461DF4C4ED028AB2","orcidId":"0000-0003-4238-8763","documentHash":"c6045034-786e-4d18-9cdf-3416fded6107"},{"objectId":"5e709301878c28a0473a0e6b","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Szada-Borzyszkowska","uuid":"6915E23A124E86DDB04B0664190C51A4B193CF233ABD4B22AE6D149E09159B63E08EFE6CCE06CA979B440ECD97AA5BE20C54602C18BE36E58DCF9D807F99AE76","orcidId":"0000-0002-5274-0276","documentHash":"f9b8af13-df4f-4f66-b0b3-0c4ac8bad9ce"},{"objectId":"5e7092ea878c28a04739f208","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Sitko","uuid":"2652822CBFAD6552291F34AE8AAB09F0DB2D8842BB0B7F8C4E40FC49BD9F77A98CC9823316E24A795F7DE788EDF89AC14410E924FCE48B3BE371CA12B2F2C6DC","orcidId":"0000-0002-4378-0399","documentHash":"e129b0b6-d967-443c-b09c-99f083458376"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a9cc","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Krzyżak","uuid":"61535826A9DC8CF60775F4B3347FDE2B056BEBF2FE396485B0EAFCE57311C9211E7AB450ACFFAC6908BE9762B8BD15124FD7EB6B73D62A3EB14B357D2C370E9B","orcidId":"0000-0003-1606-8416","documentHash":"04c8932d-70eb-4679-ac65-a7d48701c683"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a720","name":"Marta","lastName":"Pogrzeba","uuid":"45F7981FDEF3E49DD18DA2C3EA41D2E1E509C4ABF629BCB6FCF5AA9FDF3ABF1C9DE76A5AFA08075F9ABF0EE3C5599773D4F319466075564F8ECB84B8F45BB6C7","orcidId":"0000-0002-9934-094X","documentHash":"ff86f29c-f708-44ce-8e98-add1834454fe"}],"doi":"10.3390/plants11091216"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd26","uid":"bE4ADQBDXjpzHhA6qqk78ZQ","uuid":"7b0ab8cc-4a9c-4409-a081-852409a0c9eb","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd26","parentUuid":"7b0ab8cc-4a9c-4409-a081-852409a0c9eb","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd26","rootUuid":"7b0ab8cc-4a9c-4409-a081-852409a0c9eb","name":"Uczelnia Techniczno-Handlowa im.

The recent discovery of MERS-related coronaviruses (CoVs) in hedgehogs from Germany, France, the UK, China, and Italy suggests that hedgehogs may represent a wild reservoir of betacoronaviruses. This study reports the first detection and characterization of novel betacoronovirus, subgenus Merbecovirus in wild hedgehogs in Poland. The CoV RNA was detected in 10 out of 40 hedgehogs’ rectal swabs and in 1 out of 18 samples of the lung. No viral RNA was identified in the duodenum and kidney. There was no significant relationship between clinical status, gender, hedgehogs’ age, and coronaviral RNA detection. Phylogenetic analysis showed that CoVs detected in our study grouped together with other representatives of Hedgehog coronavirus 1 species identified in Western Europe. Our findings provide further evidence that hedgehogs are a natural reservoir of Merbecovirus. Considering the high mutation rate of CoVs and their potential for crossing interspecies barriers, the proper management of hedgehogs admitted to wildlife rehabilitation centres is needed. It cannot be excluded that merbecovirus strains detected in hedgehogs may recombine with other CoVs leading to new viruses with potential for interspecies transmission."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111107","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"2386","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06432-z.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094ee878c28a0473c72c1","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Gogulski","uuid":"E6AD08B51A55367D5CBC501C1E27EEDB649AFA4C1264087C765C843EA311E581C4E23FE9673864FDEC58791515CBA5461CC1C0EE8B6DF4FA6BC6200EF05980FB","orcidId":"0000-0002-7227-0654","documentHash":"84aff5e5-d940-4d42-9bb6-c55267940eef"},{"objectId":"5e7093e4878c28a0473b2c7b","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Ruszkowski","uuid":"B3D1BA745122F08C2E430055888B4D2A605FA7B1BC298A06773E425A4A4FCA68A25A968A867DA387BE9AD7A06A374E6F1E94330E1BB72A716DF0D6843ACDDDF7","orcidId":"0000-0002-1256-0107","documentHash":"cf0248f5-27bb-4b1e-98f1-d25ed8606026"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d2d","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Pomorska-Mól","uuid":"3663DFB5079C125EB89157B9DE39D1AD156445BA79396812A4DD949A1C4D6BBD65613E1079394FCF4966F34EA069D8E6514C3AE9C8DF267E172DCE2BFEEE18E6","orcidId":"0000-0003-2220-2730","documentHash":"a0c850ff-8ead-4532-bd2c-e0a6ce45fc45"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b5a","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Domańska-Blicharz","uuid":"44C5DFE3C33AA49F72079D496E2377ECFB06FF9CECAF80BDDBA1D06D13EA5BC0296FA0DF1BE18E01648F10BC82C3BF11F8D0520B236A22625EBD476B49E108A6","orcidId":"0000-0002-0642-3931","documentHash":"be2eaa91-303e-4813-a127-8bc4b12d6232"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-022-06432-z"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["zasada konsekwencji, zasada pogłębiania zaufania, pewność prawa"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","uid":"bpBenp-xOEUyWFZisxulIDw","uuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","parentUuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","rootUuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","name":"Uniwersytet Kardynała Stefana Wyszyńskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b105"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Przesłanka utrwalonej praktyki rozstrzygania spraw przez organy administracji publicznej.

disposal of industrial steel mill sludge in landfills has frequently received significant concern as the sludge has a very notable potential to contaminate soil surface and groundwater in the long run. Recently, the incorporation of industrial steel mill sludge into fired clay brick has become one of the promising alternative methods as it could produce a lightweight product while minimizing the environmental impact of the waste used. In this study, fired clay bricks as the most common building material were incorporated with 0%, 5%, 10% and 15% of steel mill sludge and fired at 1050°C (heating rate of 1°C/min). The manufactured bricks were subjected to physical and mechanical properties such as firing shrinkage, dry density, and compressive strength while the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) was conducted to analyze leaching behavior from the manufactured bricks. The results demonstrated that incorporation up to 15% of steel mill sludge reduces the properties up to 27.3% of firing shrinkage, 8.1% of dry density and 67.3% of compressive strength. The leaching behavior of Zn and Cu from steel mill sludge was reduced up to 100% from 7414 to 9.22 ppm (Zn) and 16436 to 4.654 ppm (Cu) after 15% of sludge incorporation. It was observed that high temperature during the firing process would improve the properties of bricks while immobilizing the heavy metals from the waste. Therefore, recycling steel mill sludge into construction building materials could not only alleviate the disposal problems but also promote alternative new raw materials in building industries."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111114","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.67","pagesFromTo":"209-214","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.imim.pl/files/archiwum/Vol1_2022/26.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62062b412467f04995f21081","name":"Mohd

international scientific community has long acknowledged the importance of analysing green economy. At the same time, there is a need for developing a comprehensive index, which would embrace all the aspects of green economy development. Objectives: To that end, a group of scholars of Daugavpils University proposes to use an EEPSE Green Economy Index (which combines educational, economic, political, societal, and environmental indicators). This study aims to present the results of their research Methods/Approach: The EEPSE Green Economy Index, presented within the present paper, is based on the Quintuple Helix Model. The use of the model is substantiated, inter alia by qualitative content analysis. Results: The results of the present study advocate the efficiency of the Index, showing its potential in performing current analysis and highlighting its correlation with sustainable development goals progress in the European Union countries. Conclusions: Thus, it can be concluded that the EEPSE Green Economy Index can be used as a tool for analysing the level of green economy development in a particular country, as well as its progress towards implementation of sustainable development goals (SDGs)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111138","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6276c1ac409707083994cfa1","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"3","number":"2","doi":"10.46656/access.2022.3.2","documentHash":"6e007bec-0af3-416c-a987-4a6ef6641ba8"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"3","pagesFromTo":"121-135","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journal.access-bg.org/journalfiles/journal/issue-3-2-2022/3-sustainable_development_goals_progress_in_the_european_union.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6276c90d409707083994e445","name":"Oleg","lastName":"Rybalkin","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7310-4594","documentHash":"9fdb574c-39e3-4915-b91d-941b70185bb3"}],"doi":"10.46656/access.2022.3.2(3)"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Banach action","unconditional convergence","absolutely summing operator"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","uid":"b_ZPtKgtv4v90uInHkYp6dg","uuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","parentUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de45","rootUuid":"451f3300-ea98-4941-a77e-31f6cc80cbeb","name":"Uniwersytet Jana Kochanowskiego w Kielcach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928c878c28a047397bfd"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Banach Actions Preserving Unconditional Convergence","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bb1c","mniswId":"2219","title":"Axioms","doi":null,"issn":"2075-1680","eissn":"2075-1680","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"a98458ed-88a8-44e5-a824-5ab915a2d338"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2021-12-27","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620b97c22467f07b3c5b6f23","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70928c878c28a047397bfd","620b97c22467f07b3c5b6f26"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Let A,X,Y be Banach spaces and A×X→Y, (a,x)↦ax be a continuous bilinear function, called a Banach action.

The ecological role of RF has been widely discussed across the literature concerning the Rhinolophidae family, where it has been found that the RF may vary depending on many factors, although its role in shaping the variability of different populations remains unclear, and the data for many species-including Rhinolophus hipposideros-is scarce. In this study, we aimed to determine how sex, age and biometric parameters (body mass, forearm length and the body condition index) affected the RF in a R. hipposideros population and to investigate the individual variability in this parameter. Bats were captured in front of two Carpathian caves in Southern Poland during the mating season. The echolocation calls of the hand-held bats were recorded, and later their peak frequency was measured with computer software. The analyses showed higher RF values for females than for males, but (in contrast to previous reports) no differences between the age classes were identified. RF did not correlate with any biometric parameters in the studied population, which rules out the possibility of quality characteristic signalling through this parameter. However, we observed significant individual differences in RF within the sex-age groups, which might reflect some communication potential. The discrepancies among the research results available for this topic indicate the need for further studies aimed at investigating the variability of RF and its role across species distribution ranges and their phenology."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111143","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bfea9c40970702a668778a","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"70","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"a74f5bbf-66e4-4583-afde-757dfd83dcb7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"70","pagesFromTo":"33-42","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/isez/fb/2022/00000070/00000001/art00004;jsessionid=13fcrawiuauek.x-ic-live-03","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"627a2d7b4097077f84ed76cb","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Pierzchała","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6581-9485","documentHash":"ce3e67eb-f170-4560-b8eb-9acd90407bbc"},{"objectId":"627a2b7c4097077f84ed57df","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Koza","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"af7b719f-025e-41f1-8395-901b210b567e"},{"objectId":"5e709439878c28a0473b8644","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Kohyt","uuid":"B0C0FFB045DD69FD456FE4DB3F585BF9B69C536AA560B85751DD79037A6524359BE1A5684D39A7E251E3614B87B33C0B978515654F59C72C8176C3435D7ED498","orcidId":"0000-0002-4792-5989","documentHash":"16e1aa25-540f-4457-8324-2f430e6a1367"},{"objectId":"5e709291878c28a04739816e","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Piksa","uuid":"910A63D40933724F4780142E2F6B00AF2D1175DCFF00A45CAC4FC53DB4B2AE6900B160AC8DEAB81DBEB296EC4440CA10AFEAAECF821385219C588FB9813FAA14","orcidId":"0000-0001-5057-895X","documentHash":"c416b3f3-6fbc-4a4e-a49e-99441db1872d"}],"doi":"10.3409/fb_70-1.04"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["skolioza idiopatyczna (boczne idiopatyczne skrzywienie kręgosłupa)","diagnoza","skoliometr","skolioscan","diagnostyka ultrasonograficzna 3D"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"60813cdd2467f0276870e132","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Instytut Fizjoterapii i Nauk o Zdrowiu, Akademia WychowaniaFizycznego im.

Due to the harmfulness of radiological examination, non-invasive devices, including the 3D ultrasound technology and Scolioscan apparatus, are more and more frequently used for postural diagnostics. The aim of the study was to analyze the parameters of posture in patients with idiopathic scoliosis with the use of 3D ultrasound diagnostics. (2) Methods: The study included 20 girls, aged 10 to 16 years, with double-curve idiopathic scoliosis (the value of primary curve ranged from 25–50°), types I and II according to King–Moe classification. On the basis of X-ray scan, the Cobb angle of primary and secondary curves was assessed, the skeletal maturity was evaluated with the Risser test, and the type of scoliosis was determined. The girls participated in a 3-week rehabilitation program. The examinations were performed before and after therapy. A scoliometer was used for measurements. Each of the participants underwent individual therapy. The three-plane approach to asymmetric exercises was based largely on positions that included primary curve correction with hypercorrection of the secondary curve. (3) Results: After the therapy, values of trunk rotation angles and the angle of scoliotic curvature of secondary curve were significantly lower than before the therapy, except for the value of the primary curve angle. The parameters measured by X-ray were significantly and positively related to the results obtained with the scoliometer and the scolioscan. (4) Conclusions: The application of therapy that takes into account summing parameters may prevent the deterioration of the secondary curve when treating patients with idiopathic scoliosis. The observed correlations between the parameters of the radiological examination, the scoliometer, and the scolioscan prove the possibility of their interchangeable application in the assessment of effects of the therapy. Three-dimensional ultrasound diagnostics may become an alternative to radiological examination in assessing the treatment effects of patients with idiopathic scoliosis"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111152","journalIssue":{"objectId":"625678192467f0756e3b6d1e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"19","number":"8","doi":"","documentHash":"41f6d01f-380c-4cc3-8eb5-21d7a439a6b9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/8/4750/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebee284752340254fc43cce","name":"SANDRA","lastName":"TRZCIŃSKA","uuid":"DA4FF1085C8A20264FC3B0995155CF08982F4D9F941AE5DFA8933DF2C6095E98089B0207AC136E59B762DA554CAC5003569874B5665B1DA8525B4E1CA679C11F","orcidId":"0000-0002-6085-3932","documentHash":"07ad2acd-fd8a-4903-a8d7-a1c45b5b9d9a"},{"objectId":"5ebed614752340254fc40533","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Koszela","uuid":"5710BEEF14FF61A13473B00C2A7A82D62ABC5C901E4271FC2F20973563D383658D51FA23EF7271919E8330A97800FBD6F39398AE9ED56419DB46A33D7C9DA437","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d3dcc21c-2f39-4dd0-8c3a-0216a41869b6"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d3c6","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kuszewski","uuid":"2A3A8F8A05CFB2E815FEE37AE87A03BBE69499EAACC8604E89902BACC039F65E130CACD357E5F4A5A5856F2AD72E2160BA91406225FEF4A2391F19B845D9DCB1","orcidId":"0000-0002-9569-6017","documentHash":"37836d8f-de9d-4265-a765-f24cea6e9816"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19084750"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet

The present paper focuses on the possibility to apply the Harrison model to describe hysteresis loops of grain-oriented electrical steel subject to compressive stress. The model extension is achieved by introduction of an additional term into the equation that describes irreversible magnetization process. The extension term does not include a product of stress and magnetization, as could be anticipated from Sablik’s theory, applicable, e.g., to the Jiles–Atherton model. The present contribution points out the fundamental differences between the two aforementioned modeling approaches, which are based on different philosophies despite some apparent similarities. The modeling results are in a qualitative agreement with the experimental results obtained from a single sheet tester for a representative commercially available grain-oriented electrical steel grade 0.27 mm thick."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111161","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.15","pagesFromTo":"brak","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/3/1128","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"620e0afd2467f02b135ca4e0","name":"Fernando Jose Gomes","lastName":"LANDGRAF","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c6d699d3-8f2f-4459-8ecb-693c8d7b7128"},{"objectId":"620e0afd2467f02b135ca4df","name":"Mateus Botani de Souza","lastName":"DIAS","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2e3b5e90-429f-4721-86fb-c7e75a249d24"},{"objectId":"5e709200878c28a04738e6c0","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Chwastek","uuid":"2F990A0B5D03D3BB71C8721D8C2F440685CC5839499F113F7164DF7C30E8D7BDA3E85EABBAF3130F7684C908806618E57D5F6AF72667DA4B453C95FA52AF0ED8","orcidId":"0000-0002-2294-9976","documentHash":"fabc6e0d-a49d-4c14-8488-5362796bc358"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15031128"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-1-0716-1653-6","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Plant mitochondria : methods and protocols.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":"New York","translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":null,"translationFromPolish":null,"bookProjectNCN":null,"bookProjectFNP":null,"bookProjectNPHR":null,"bookProjectUE":null},"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6278e1e04097075f677aebcf","editors":[{"objectId":"6278e1e04097075f677aebdb","name":"Allan G.","lastName":"Rasmusson","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ee3b492f-f950-4aa9-809f-d422d6b4c82c"},{"objectId":"6278e1e04097075f677aebda","name":"Olivier","lastName":"Van Aken","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b46e9d95-5c34-436c-b68b-8989a8506268"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["6278e1e04097075f677aebda","6278e1e04097075f677aebdb"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058111166","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":"1940-6029","series":"Methods in Molecular Biology","translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb7f5","mniswId":"26100","name":"Humana Press","documentHash":"213d03f0-2207-42c0-ab22-8eda2cbd32db"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-1653-6","numberInSeries":"2363","authors":[],"doi":"10.1007/978-1-0716-1653-6"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["agresja fizyczna","dylematy moralne"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["physical aggression","moral dilemmas"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6278c59e4097077547e7f0b1","doi":"10.1201/9781003030966","title":"Rational decisions in organisations : theoretical and practical aspects","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"9781032193953","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://www.routledge.com/Rational-Decisions-in-Organisations-Theoretical-and-Practical-Aspects/Adam-Kuchta-Stanek/p/book/9781032193953","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"4752ddb4-e1ae-43df-b660-b6317c45a0a3","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb764","mniswId":"2600","name":"Taylor & Francis Group","documentHash":"186b7a58-eacb-453a-bc81-dbcca285e881"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5f477c782467f015faf1b102","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Faculty of Management, General Tadeusz Kosciuszko Military University of Land Forces","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d8878c28a04739e0a4","5e7091f2878c28a04738d8c1"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"The Moral Dilemmas Involved in Decisions to Respond to Physical Aggression","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6278ca214097077547e80ce3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d8878c28a04739e0a4","5e7091f2878c28a04738d8c1"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, the authors attempt to interpret the findings of research on moral dilemmas involved in decisions on whether and how to react to physical aggression targeted at either the respondent or another person. The research was conducted on groups of military university applicants and military university students (undergoing basic training), including students in the medical degree program. The findings reveal significant differences between the respondent groups in terms of their assessment of the ethicality and effectiveness of defense measures taken in self-defense, as well as in defending others against a physical assault. Based on these findings, the authors propose the following conclusions: in the face of physical violence, moral judgment (i.e. moral evaluation of the method of defense adopted) depends primarily on the target of the assault (whether the respondent or a stranger) and on the respondents’ prior engagement in social

paper describes series of studies concerned with welding of Sc-modified AA2519 at the Military\nUniversity of Technology. The modification of AA2519 alloy contains a higher concentration of scandium\nand zirconium and it has been developed in The Institute of Non Ferrous Metals, Light Metals Division\nin Skawina. The examination involves friction stir welding (FSW) and laser beam welding (LBW) of 5\nmm thick AA2519-T62 extrusion. FSW process parameters were: 600 rpm tool rotation speed, 100\nmm/min welding velocity, 4.8 mm depth plunge, and MX Triflute tool type. The used LBW parameters\nwere as follows: 3.2 kW laser power, 1.1 m/min welding velocity, 0.2 mm laser beam width, 10° laser beam\ninclination angle, 10 L/min shielding gas (argon) flow with the laser beam focused on the workpiece\nsurface (f=0). In this work selected results have been presented containing some problems and features\ntypical for investigated joints. Butt joints produced by FSW and LBW have been compared in terms of\nmicrostructure (grains), microhardness distribution, joint efficiency, localization of failure, etc. The basic\nfeatures of weld zones have been discussed together with the distributions of microhardness on the joint’s\ncross-sections. Both welding techniques cause a reduction of microhardness in the weld zone, but the\ndrop from the base material’s value (135-140 HV0.1) is far higher in the case of LBW (85-90 HV0.1) than\nFSW (120 HV0.1). The established values of joint efficiency were 80% (376 MPa) and 66% (314 MPa) for\nFSW and LBW, respectively. The FSW joints tend to fail in the thermo-mechanically affected zone and\nLBW in the fusion zone."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111195","journalIssue":{"objectId":"620ba3d82467f07b3c5bb669","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"21","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"7f84eb89-20f8-4a81-9394-74a0ab16d08d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"21","pagesFromTo":"818-823","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journalmt.com/doi/10.21062/mft.2021.093.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70930c878c28a0473a1d36","name":"Robert","lastName":"Kosturek","uuid":"C7AF0DB8CC48E536D3D6A47D17E3A3277A4B1E7F37AB2AB50794032B85C5548F9021E001212F2492C9438CA9624CEE3EEEBDFEA049BC9B405530F8EF465BC856","orcidId":"0000-0002-6663-0529","documentHash":"007e431f-ac82-4f24-a434-c30f022d321b"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a0473994b5","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Grzelak","uuid":"E9564761C15144BAF05ED3E8D4E0B3C8AF4B49E0B62A905A085169212D3E2014BED64CAC7FEA20E11697B9241A42FB87154ED5B03433E36DD5FC5288AF620E86","orcidId":"0000-0003-0675-1983","documentHash":"33f49ad9-f27b-430b-ac72-4403007531f1"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a04739949f","name":"Lucjan","lastName":"Śnieżek","uuid":"3491C0331123BA224526BFAD868E250DC2BA32E2964D7E4C2452ECE1F3B8AEF2F4D9C42195EE8DC86D30D008B8ADC2EA974E9D1439BD9F80AC876732DEF0C475","orcidId":"0000-0002-1157-0565","documentHash":"fff6a65d-d369-475b-9d42-7d0379f6c045"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398ed5","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Torzewski","uuid":"236DC0B4248CB3717AA96760D3EC7B8BE01D9A76AEB591DBBEF9B60FF2C9107DD4184D904663F2351591C3BDFC625AFC122631511AFC04266D3FC6944508513F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6475-9997","documentHash":"4f427c17-cc04-43f2-b702-18b3739c1651"}],"doi":"10.21062/mft.2021.093"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["endoprosthesis","FEM","strain","stress"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Numerical-Experimental Research on Some Parameters of Hip and Knee Endoprostheses, Determining Value and Form of Contact Stress Between their Elements","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454771a4","mniswId":"1678","title":"Archives of Metallurgy and Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1733-3490","eissn":null,"websiteLink":"www.imim.pl/wydawnictwo","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"690eb37e-8fda-4efb-8ca9-27eaab890cb9"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2021-12-21","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620644df2467f04995f31006","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709212878c28a04738f752","5e709213878c28a04738f755"]},"issue":"Iss.1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper presents Finite Elements Method numerical analysis of strength of friction pairs most often used in hip and knee joints alloplasty.

One of the most interesting forms of this material is a multilayer structure, sometimes called graphene paper, with a thickness approaching a value up to a few micrometers. We present and discuss the results of investigation on electronic structure of such a thick material produced by the improved Hummer's method and deposited on a metallic mesh. The samples were investigated by near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) around the carbon absorption edge. The NEXAFS results are supplemented with the output of the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis for C1s and O1s lines and with the micro-Raman spectroscopy. There are still some discrepancies concerning the electronic structure of graphene oxide (GO), especially, when many individual GO sheets are stacked together as in the case under consideration. The samples were heavily functionalized by oxidation (the presence of carbonyl, epoxy, and hydroxyl groups). There are indications that the prepared samples tended towards the turbostratic form of stacking when annealed in vacuum at moderate temperatures between 100 °C and 500 °C. These changes were observed in both π* and σ* resonance areas. Surprisingly, the features of the NEXAFS spectrum of both the annealed and non-annealed samples resemble reasonably the theoretically determined structure of the density of states (DOS) of monocrystalline carbon.

However, not every window is suitable for any building. The selection of an adequate window must include the analysis of various factors—the most important ones are the type of window (e.g., single or double glazing); filling gas in cavities (e.g., air, argon or some other gas); and placing, i.e., orientation of a window on a façade (facing north, south, or east, etc.). The research presented in this paper is dealing with the calculation of the window thermal loading for the cities of Kragujevac and Bor in Serbia and Žilina in Slovakia. These three cities were selected because they belong to different climate regions, according to the Köppen–Geiger climatic classification. The first two cities in Serbia belong to the same region Cf with difference only in the category of summer—Kragujevac Cfa and Bor Cfb—while the third city—Žilina in Slovakia—belongs to the Dfb region. The calculated thermal loading through the window was obtained as a sum of the thermal loading due to the heat conduction and thermal loading due to the solar radiation. The objective was to find the optimal window construction and orientation of a building’s façade for each of these cities, by varying the type of the window, its frame material and the filling gas. The results show that for the first two cities in Serbia, there is a difference in the window frame material in the optimal window construction, while for the third city (Žilina in Slovakia), the results are the same as for the second city (Bor in Serbia) despite the fact that they belong to different climate regions (Cfb and Dfb, respectively). These results support the fact that the climate affects the optimal window construction for any city/region in the world."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111215","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.15","pagesFromTo":"brak","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/1/323","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"620b956c2467f07b3c5b4d5a","name":"Filip","lastName":"PASTOREK","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fefa2198-e4a9-4347-96cc-3d43540055a7"},{"objectId":"620b956c2467f07b3c5b4d58","name":"Branislav","lastName":"HADZIMA","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"418fd0cb-7dc4-4c59-838c-6cfbce0bd5ef"},{"objectId":"620b956b2467f07b3c5b4d56","name":"Ruzica R.","lastName":"NIKOLIC","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"299bcb94-4fa9-4637-831d-e1f72f49fd86"},{"objectId":"620b956b2467f07b3c5b4d55","name":"Jelena M.","lastName":"DJOKOVIC","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fb55ec18-8d33-48a0-8b42-a1de59c78e8b"},{"objectId":"5e709395878c28a0473ad57d","name":"Renata","lastName":"Dwornicka","uuid":"95F832C1A7D560437CBCEA01B85B890D68AF428C8BF8A1C9411A5B80D4F9B926670DCA7D710EE64DA2180FD0DBA99338050ABB45348B5BA51BCB806B02686583","orcidId":"0000-0002-2979-1614","documentHash":"088c60d7-e061-4eda-8af7-3bfeed078e47"},{"objectId":"5e709203878c28a04738e95a","name":"Robert","lastName":"Ulewicz","uuid":"65F25B2A755434C89ED22D41275C0C7C63FB366B419C011ADF5F7B0DA5E36DFD03F8EC3172AB8DC180A9EEA85C30D4D4F2B20A28D21C789722AB65B4B7DCD601","orcidId":"0000-0002-5694-4284","documentHash":"8e6a405c-6064-4729-81c4-cb93ff32e168"},{"objectId":"5e7091f7878c28a04738dcb9","name":"JAN","lastName":"BUJNAK","uuid":"CA7106116E5A4938BDD77C61886D833ED184E53F2725F39C2AD841C25C350594DC139DE6C97A536F9B7EC3E9B19CA9F8FA221E8A62DA974652000D069131368F","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9e3732a2-61cd-4ae5-8861-920d48e47e71"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15010323"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918d878c28a04737e1d5","uid":"bJAF3J7gD1iEjREYkfNvHfQ","uuid":"9ab5d088-ab1d-4ba8-8cf3-3b1ed670a267","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wydział Nowych Technologii i Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70942e878c28a0473b7b71","62054b372467f04219d2422c","5e7092a5878c28a047399ccb"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Detection of Organosulfur and Organophosphorus Compounds Using a Hexafluorobutyl Acrylate-Coated Tapered Optical Fibers","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479331","mniswId":"16369","title":"POLYMERS","doi":null,"issn":"2073-4360","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"75c28aac-8cdb-4fcc-8756-104cf361c90b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620549422467f04219d23f38","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092a5878c28a047399ccb","5e70942e878c28a0473b7b71","62054b372467f04219d2422c"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents the results of a study on the possibility of detecting organosulfur\nand organophosphorus compounds by means of polymer-assisted optical fiber technology.

The changes taking place in rural areas mean that not all inhabitants of these areas are involved in agricultural activities, and there are new people looking for an idyllic life in the countryside. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of complaints concerning odour emissions from agricultural sources. The aim of the study was to compare odour emissions from selected livestock buildings for various animal species in the Great Poland Voivodeship. The assessment of odour concentrations was made in accordance with EN 13725: 2003 using the TO 8 olfactometer in the accredited olfactometric laboratory of the Institute of Technology and Life Sciences National Research Institute in Poznań. The fattening house showed the highest odour burden for the surroundings (mean odour concentration and odour emission factor: 450 ouE·m3 and 0.419 ouE·s−1·kg−1, respectively).

The emission factor for poultry (0.232 ouE·s−1·kg−1) was 22% higher than that for dairy cows (0.190 ouE·s−1·kg−1).

Little is known about the relationship between the physical characteristics of lignite substrate and cucumber yield. The study analyzed the effect of bulk density and water holding capacity of lignite substrate in comparison to mineral wool and EC of nutrient solution on plant morphological parameters, yield and fruit quality of greenhouse cucumber. A positive relation was found between the bulk density of lignite mats and the increase in the number of leaves per week, shoot diameter as well as leaf length and leaf area (calculated as the product of leaf length × width) in cucumbers grown in this medium. Bulk density of lignite growing mats also affected the macro- and micro-nutrient content of cucumber leaves. The physical properties of the substrate and the high EC of the medium had a significant effect on the hardness, color and lutein content of cucumber fruits. The content of biologically active compounds in cucumber fruits depended on the water holding capacity of the medium and the water readily available to plants; these parameters were lower in the lignite medium compared to mineral wool. However, when the lignite substrate was used in hydroponic cucumber cultivation, for a period of 51 days after planting (DAP) there was an increase of more than 23% in the bulk density of the substrate and an increase of nearly 55% in the water readily available compared to the new lignite mats"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111232","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"4480","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/9/4480","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602e509d9543c7410626f0b7","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Łaźny","uuid":"5179453DE13F8A30B17B7CCB92D133CA37285EE827710BE963D4B9EC35AA9F20E4984FACD278DFED2C2792FECD5A9AF8C9D23963CC919503BA5543AD9B21E35A","orcidId":"0000-0001-5922-8016","documentHash":"a02b7918-4066-4d89-b859-0eb6d82cba88"},{"objectId":"5e7094a1878c28a0473c0b52","name":"Monika","lastName":"Niedzińska","uuid":"6CEAC5D5630F948F2D6D51206D212AFB6DD30984C4F4727E038D5A404435E67D30829B078F861A3292BB6490790AABFB7AC1E564198AA10B07AB8120689DFDE7","orcidId":"0000-0003-2170-5221","documentHash":"80d20d96-c6fd-4bd3-a914-093716c03fef"},{"objectId":"5e709401878c28a0473b4bea","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kunka","uuid":"84861EC524B8EFBC25A04C44C98FBD38A2D6FB696844F98D8D20C895391B445BE5947A00E9515DD062C039AD8823A450D64C1785953C0CA8FE06CE36A1B8CBC9","orcidId":"0000-0002-9878-0310","documentHash":"245abf54-db9b-4aa3-befe-595aa3538073"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397f69","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"9E538886BAEC63D822291227462DC5326050A9D565F74EE2E32A6843C2F96B70C99B1D2881EF31E6974EAE0A6A97C1906FBC6D71B47EC440D61916F795BADDB5","orcidId":"0000-0002-5962-936X","documentHash":"95877ed5-692d-4970-9e1d-6384aba950fc"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d85","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"3897AF5C7E4FAAF35F404A9BC0F9A8CC22B535BAEF573567F51A2A1A784D9620935E656E73521A53CD02CED856407343E2833BC3E064485F8738EE7724777E10","orcidId":"0000-0002-1473-9207","documentHash":"93393335-9114-4927-8bda-c788c468a09e"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923b7","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Mirgos","uuid":"DECA988361EA69CF7C50F6DD6DC4DBBAFBD4F3B6BD64C009708BE59FAA9720C7AAEB72EF30BBA5AE5EE16A4291F98677DADC939A6C119F709EB4E359DEC518A3","orcidId":"0000-0003-2940-7771","documentHash":"eb666088-7a98-4cb9-99aa-1aeab6536153"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923b0","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kowalczyk","uuid":"5E24C8B8B82DF92592988E62BA167E1795C7030CAA13FBF43C8E3E309E47D2B063B2A06E7D1E473EB259EC2EA2D331879136BA5359B07A5F51FFFD5960C5042F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5282-7331","documentHash":"6d722aee-6cf4-4a44-abc1-e7b73aedf070"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a047392360","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Przybył","uuid":"916B830365DBE2ACC0F901844157A461A9EC440885E084CEC646E87D58AB1DDE59E325561362273D6B2B01F78E259A5B0FF966BA0A733A2DEEFA1B6D70E8068A","orcidId":"0000-0003-0959-184X","documentHash":"172369e8-7957-4c4b-ba60-e93aa185365a"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a04739235e","name":"Janina","lastName":"Gajc-Wolska","uuid":"0B5E2326A0561B418D8D4A7D2B65BDF17E21FC131E2F6F649B8381CCF8263C0A7A87C0003711CD0A9049BCEDF2DFB6D847C77C725C765F9C251FB130C60F212A","orcidId":"0000-0003-4237-5575","documentHash":"d6286f62-1a01-4ee9-b07d-dfdd41c12ebb"}],"doi":"10.3390/app12094480"},{"mainLanguageName":"rosyjski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"rus","keywords":["Пушкин, «Цыганы», Бахтин, континуум, хронотоп, топос, локус, Бессарабия, табор, Алеко, судьба"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Pushkin, “The Gypsies”, Bakhtin, continuum, chronotope, topos, locus, Bessarabia, tabor, Aleko, fate"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df19","uid":"bNru5UXF46oIVhoU8B4twJg","uuid":"a45d9e85-5adc-4064-be47-41866570b73d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Lingwistyki Stosowanej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093d5878c28a0473b1830"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Пространственно-временной  континуум   бессарабской поэмы А.

М. Бахтина. Бессарабия, представленная поэтом в различных аспектах (территория «долгой брани», страна «русской славы», среда обитания «младенствующего» народа, хранительница поэтических преданий, овеянных именем Овидия, место собственного недобровольного пребывания А. Пушкина), выступает в качестве доминантного реально-географического, историко-эпохального и собственно поэтического хронотопа поэмы. Рассмотренный пространственно-временной континуум произведения включает характерные топосы и локусы, обусловливающие как кочевое бытие цыганского табора в целом, так и индивидуальные судьбы персонажей в частности. Отмечена сюжетообразующая роль «скитаний» Алеко как процесс поиска, обретения и в результате утраты самого себя. Неприятие героем цивилизации предопределило его нравственную гибель: личность оказалась не способна выжить в природном мире вне форм культуры и морали. В конечном итоге сложно структурированный конститутивный бессарабский континуум оказался во власти авторского хронотопа с его пессимистической идеей неотвратимого рока, который, в свою очередь, обусловлен романтической моделью мира, утвердившейся в философско-художественном сознании пушкинской эпохи."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article attempts to identify the significant components of the chronotopical continuum of the  poem  “The  Gypsies”  based  on  the interpretation of the chronotope as a  phenomenon  of M.  Bakhtin’s  historical poetics. Bessarabia, represented by the poet in various aspects (the territory of the “long battle,” the country of “Russian glory,” the habitat of the “infant” people, the keeper of the  poetic  traditions  steeped  in  the  name  of  Ovid,  the  place  of  A.  Pushkin’s own  involuntary  stay)  acts  as  the  dominant  real-geographical,  historical  epochmaking  and actually  poetic  chronotope  of  the  poem. The  examined  space-time continuum of the work includes the distinctive topoi and loci that determine both the nomadic life of the gypsy camp in general and the individual fates of the  characters  in  particular.  The  plot-forming  role  of  Aleko’s  “wanderings”  is described as a process of searching, gaining and, as a result, a loss of himself.

Since the mentioned oxides are largely utilized by industry, there is no doubt that the presented studies are important from an environmental point of view. On the basis of the textural studies (dynamic light scattering DLS, low temperature nitrogen adsorption, X-ray diffraction analysis XRD, scanning electron microscopy SEM) it was proved that the properties of the hybrid materials differ from the pure components of the system. Moreover, the advanced thermal analysis (TG-DTG-DSC) combined with the evolved gas analysis using Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and mass spectrometry were applied to describe the thermal decomposition of fucoidan, oxides and hybrid materials. It was found that the interactions between the polymer and the oxides results in the formation of the hybrid materials due to the functionalization of the nanoparticles surface, and that their thermal stability increased when compared to the pure substrates. Such findings definitely fill the literature void regarding the fucoidan based hybrid materials and help the industrial formulators in the preparation of new products."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111252","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e579c92467f0034f10b860","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"23","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"b1078b89-a408-4c2f-8ca0-ee3b3d3a31b7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/2/805/htm","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"658f150e4097076c145d7ac7","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Matusiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b89e6062-09e7-4d4c-a882-a591e252ade9"},{"objectId":"658f150e4097076c145d7ac6","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Sternik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1fbdd279-4394-4cab-9f8e-ab833c025d01"},{"objectId":"658f150e4097076c145d7ac5","name":"Eiżbieta","lastName":"Grządka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"79868fcf-53d9-43d3-b57d-45d35d2508cc"},{"objectId":"658f150e4097076c145d7ac4","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Maciołek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"05ff92f2-1abb-4d34-bc57-b91aac0930c3"},{"objectId":"658f150e4097076c145d7ac3","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Orzeł","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e870404b-0809-4651-a4cd-1df378fc2ea5"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b5a9","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kosińska-Pezda","uuid":"5E344E68E96A753D6668D2A99A478187A45E9A93A38F45C8B8CD121AA90143198B2EDF728F31CAC96E766CD4A524D54F574AF7E4C06D7DA09EC4F8603DD14E73","orcidId":"0000-0002-2623-4740","documentHash":"72c23d55-1ce5-4f9e-8af2-2de8a764a7c7"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms23020805"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Kolagen","Analiza widmowa","Spektroskopia fluorescencyjna"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Collagen","Cross-links","Excitation spectra","Emission spectra","Fluorescence spectroscopy"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Fluorescent spectroscopy of collagen as a diagnostic tool in medicine","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a069","mniswId":"200344","title":"Journal of Medical Science","doi":null,"issn":"2353-9798","eissn":"2353-9801","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"86df4aa4-a4e3-471a-aa83-9a8f5e55bc02"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY_NC","releaseDate":"2022-01-20","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620cec702467f01217ae22aa","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709349878c28a0473a6737","5e70938a878c28a0473ac441"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Medicine continuously needs to improve the existing diagnostic solutions or introduce new ones. Despite the fact that collagen is a well described protein, collagen-related diseases represent the disorders requiring improvement particularly in terms of research tools. These diseases include connective tissue diseases, keratoconus, where a change in the structure of collagen is observed causing a deformation of the cornea, as well as neoplasms, in which the amount of collagen is multiplied in cells.Fluorescence spectroscopy constitutes a highly sensitive, non-invasive research method, thus, its use in medicine can contribute to the development of excellent diagnostic methods. This method allows to determine the changing amount of the tested fluorophores, as well as the change of the pH of the environment in which these fluorophores are located. Until now, numerous studies on collagen have been performed using fluorescence spectroscopy. However, a detailed analysis of the literature revealed some discrepancies which have been summarized in this paper.The collected experimental results allowed to conclude that the discrepancies in the obtained fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of collagen may result from the structural richness of collagen. Another reason for the variability of the results is the different experimental conditions, i.e. the excitation and detection of collagen fluorescence at different wavelengths. Therefore, it should be emphasized that collagen spectroscopy constitutes an extremely promising method, although the determination of the exact conditions of the experiment and their standardization are required in the research on the diagnostic use of this technique."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111257","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"91","pagesFromTo":"64-72","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://jms.ump.edu.pl/index.php/JMS/article/view/584","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70938a878c28a0473ac441","name":"Roland","lastName":"Wesołowski","uuid":"A9BA8B205C6BA0899809D82B6E6911598E434510181DD7586AEC6619D2FE272417D1FC194A523B8B114C7953F464C20A97BE79402286A01AF41F7DB6EAB9A6E7","orcidId":"0000-0003-2673-8313","documentHash":"6a4bc7c2-9872-4867-bb5c-52668e3d9f44"},{"objectId":"5e709349878c28a0473a6737","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Saletnik","uuid":"3D335899294DEE86BDD1FBD623CD9644787D8A730854DDBF97D5A1751A216DD2D9909ABDBC7F3F4528685EAB4FCB5F5A3D5DFA4293D2B54B86CDD9DDD61EEFBC","orcidId":"0000-0001-7847-4351","documentHash":"3c7307a3-d607-4e16-812b-44afbdf67cdb"}],"doi":"10.20883/medical.e584"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Ezoteryka","Romowie","Magia"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6278fb424097077547ea26be","doi":null,"title":"Fenomeny.

Nevertheless, satisfying both goals require the implementation of new methods. The present assessment was based on over 190 scientific publications. Forecasts from the beginning of the 21st century showed that the increase in temperature and CO2 concentration would improve the productivity of crops by extending the growing season and allow for the cultivation of new species. However, this beneficial effect may be limited by the increasing intensity of the extreme weather phenomena such as: rainstorm, droughts, early frosts, storms etc. Here, we review more recent studies which indicate, however, that this beneficial effect of climate change will not be permanent and, consequently, will significantly reduce crop yields. Climate change is forcing the agronomy sector to implement adaptive methods for minimizing possible crop losses consisting, inter alia, (i) using crop species/varieties that are less sensitive; (ii) optimizing water management; (III) improving pest, disease and weed control efficiency. The pressure on the agriculture sector to increase food production due to the increase in the human population and the present hunger in specific regions run counter to the need to reduce the adverse climate impacts of agriculture. The current state of knowledge indicates that despite the implementation of new technologies, agricultural measures will not be able to significantly reduce climate change. Indeed, these approaches will not replace the need to reduce greenhouse gas\nemissions in other sectors. However, without the participation of agronomy in reducing GHG emissions by increasing carbon sequestration, the goals of the 2015 UN Climate Change Conference in Paris will not be achieved."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111273","journalIssue":{"objectId":"620662082467f04995f3b4c0","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"212","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"cf465582-4a76-47d1-af07-65a6d9d9347e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"212","pagesFromTo":"106089","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0341816222000753?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62135cfe2467f012be9166a2","name":"Aneta H.","lastName":"Baczewska-Dąbrowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4aa4306f-40bb-4776-a440-1dcb49249e51"},{"objectId":"5e709259878c28a0473941b4","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Gworek","uuid":"CD07A5811B39278AB015C6528FA562CD8FFE27FCB12F33F5FD8FF17EA9411F6631D046C4082D4BD7260E695C986ECAE69B05640953BB58EE97AC1E84B7FD9180","orcidId":"0000-0002-2368-5888","documentHash":"890f6d4d-4f68-4e6d-bb20-4cb0ab35b9f0"},{"objectId":"5e709257878c28a047394115","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Dmuchowski","uuid":"C53E26D436B1BA66B93ACCBB2E007019404B6AA2DC1B8D1E5A9B550D98A9402CC0689CEDB4E578CEA483F786977024BAFF13124DB5D73BEFF97E1E50B21D6557","orcidId":"0000-0003-0092-365X","documentHash":"139274e2-acf8-4683-91d9-e9bf9b260b4f"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.catena.2022.106089"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ℓ1-predual","homeomorphism","Banach–Mazur distance","homotopy","path metric"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df71","uid":"bVfQitUiCXefHxSrzVxWFmQ","uuid":"6b4ab5b8-ee21-43a7-a91e-148512c57a44","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Matematyki, Fizyki i Informatyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093df878c28a0473b24cc","5e7092f5878c28a0473a0011"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Some topological and metric properties of the space of ℓ1-predual hyperplanes in c","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477720","mniswId":"4022","title":"Colloquium Mathematicum","doi":null,"issn":"0010-1354","eissn":"1730-6302","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b5e85cfe-f1f8-425b-aab6-89e24c3b92d3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6278d2274097077547e849b3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093df878c28a0473b24cc","5e7092f5878c28a0473a0011"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We study topological and metric properties of the space (H, d), where H is the set of all `1-predual hyperplanes in the space c of convergent sequences, d denotes the Banach–Mazur distance and we identify hyperplanes that are almost isometric.

We provide optimal lower bounds for the distortions ‖T ‖ ‖T −1‖ of isomorphic embeddings T from an arbitrarily chosen element of H into an infinite-dimensional L1-predual X such that (ext BX∗ )′ ⊂ rBX∗ for some r ∈ [0, 1).

The chapter shows the foundations of changes in the world thanks to the dynamically growing demography, the change of political and economic power centers, and the megatrend of globalization. Dynamically growing developing countries are gaining in importance, and for companies, from a strategic point of view, this has many consequences for the consumer. The chapter also discusses the megatrend of sustainable development, showing how it fits into the global economy, corporate strategies, and the lives of consumers, especially in the context of the phenomenon of shrinking natural resources in the world.

This Australian cartoon has proven extremely popular worldwide with its primary recipients, that is children, and has also received significant attention and positive evaluation from parents, who – we suggest – offer a metarecipient perspective on the series as they tweet about it, both voicing their own opinions and serving as their children's mouthpiece. Proposing the notion of a distributed fandom affinity space, we explore parents’ discourse on Twitter around the commonly adopted hashtag #Bluey and discern several fundamental categories of posts that provide insight into child and metarecipient parent fandom in the #Bluey affinity space. The tweets revolve around the concepts of parenting, family life, education and language that arise from watching Bluey, which both parents and children evaluate in positive terms. Overall, the distributed fandom affinity space realised through the #Bluey hashtag highlights the capacity for user engagement in popular culture offered by Twitter outside dedicated fandom accounts."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111281","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"92","pagesFromTo":"1 - 13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304422X22000055?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"656da6f740970749a862ce74","name":"Andrew S.","lastName":"Ross","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c578a3e6-2722-4a11-b82c-981f89df4c21"},{"objectId":"5e70939e878c28a0473adda0","name":"Marta","lastName":"Dynel","uuid":"28819324EBDF46AEC93F15638DB745AC70772DF58A27696B9666EBD55AAACEF413E7E3156C0BEFE8E5D86B612F89E8E32AF332EDB44D248A5F1B8E18091B9A25","orcidId":"0000-0003-4647-946X","documentHash":"8fba2d55-969f-4609-a834-1d2716217495"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.poetic.2022.101648"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Additive manufacturing","management","online platforms","innovation","COVID-19","pandemic","3D printing","recycling"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709302878c28a0473a105b"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","uid":"bnV99khMVeG3t9dh4evZESg","uuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","parentUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2b","rootUuid":"b26a6014-ae33-445c-9ff8-49216dbc5587","name":"Politechnika Koszalińska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ae878c28a04739a836","60c351229543c723365444dc","5e7092ae878c28a04739a9a7"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Additive Production Management in COVID-19 Pandemic","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dc39","mniswId":"22361","title":"European Research Studies Journal","doi":null,"issn":"1108-2976","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e13ec1b4-9fe9-4c4d-9da5-bd3082096ed5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"FEBRUARY","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6203c26d2467f03b33814234","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["60c351229543c723365444dc","5e7092ae878c28a04739a9a7","5e709302878c28a0473a105b","5e7092ab878c28a04739a535","5e7092ae878c28a04739a836"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose: The article aims to discuss the authors’ own experiences and literature review on the topic of small communities of additive production in COVID-19 conditions and propose an improvement of emergency procedures in situations of global threat.

Until now, tracing the origin of splash water was a highly error-prone, or impossible, task. We propose a method for tracking splash water by means of stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) analysis. We tested the method on a water-water model, checking the effect of drop height, water layer thickness and the effect of water evaporation. It turns out that the drop height and the thickness of the water layer have practically no effect on the origin of the water in the splash, and all the water comes from the vessel, not from the drops. The only exception is when a thin layer of water is impacted with a drop, in which case 23% of the water also comes from the drop.

The electron backscattered diffraction map made for the alloy with 0.2% Co addition showed numerous twin boundaries with distances between them in the range from 10 to 100 µm. The addition of cerium was located in the grain boundary area. Cerium also gave rise to the formation of two types of particles, i.e. Al4Ce and Al-Ce-Fe-Si. The Al-Ce-Fe-Si phase is a nucleation site for the Al4Ce phase, which forms eutectic plates. The results showed that the introduction of additives increases the mechanical properties of the cast materials. The 99.9% cast aluminium has a hardness of 16.9 HB. The addition of 0.2% by weight of Mg, Co, Ce increases this hardness to 21.8 HB, 22.6 HB and 19.1 HB, respectively"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111291","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"303-309","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.imim.pl/files/archiwum/Vol1_2022/41.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"620a0ae02467f06a1eda080a","name":"M","lastName":"Ożóg","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4a6f0ebc-357d-401b-b067-749e6842b47b"},{"objectId":"620a0ae02467f06a1eda0806","name":"Ł","lastName":"Wodziński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b1068886-08f3-45e9-98fa-dad50499d63e"},{"objectId":"5e7092c5878c28a04739c55a","name":"PAWEŁ","lastName":"KOPROWSKI","uuid":"B3F66C713D6662D211102B7A4F8C4A40B633796906DD6CB0468C1837567EE0A3AD857CE857E711E699C80E7A251E922104B0BDE0156FC04875B7911FCF00642E","orcidId":"0000-0002-2336-1787","documentHash":"7dd3499a-497d-442f-8c0e-6c72e1303c3b"},{"objectId":"5e7092ac878c28a04739a68b","name":"Bogusław","lastName":"Augustyn","uuid":"010332A424AE82E5411B20C750D7738E4F2E22FFDF47AE3A54C8434FE9B5C5FA7273AD26785FDE50699133470BF49FC819B909603CC29F24FD72CE658558E8B0","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d2c642b0-8d36-4794-bfb9-314c6cd76842"},{"objectId":"5e7092a8878c28a04739a0b9","name":"Sonia","lastName":"Boczkal","uuid":"28FEC7EE535EE2A6E655EC59AB7C2B5F1E2E5B16B79D2813829F56BC1F7727372C68DC330667D46DF06EB72290272D9AE054055CB8DEF3149867C15D934973A9","orcidId":"0000-0002-3421-4723","documentHash":"8ac68165-2633-40b1-a512-d5d5a8768814"},{"objectId":"5e7092a8878c28a04739a086","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Lech-Grega","uuid":"7EE923354F46463BA18D248A9572C188FF9A31F68444FE89D80D451129EE88C7BC2BCC757EEA8CBFB9ABA3706AE0D94A4A4A794F0B8625682A71C5D0D5787722","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f7d7b9bd-9500-476a-b54b-72eedfde9695"},{"objectId":"5e709213878c28a04738f8b8","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Uliasz","uuid":"AB7728CDD29B8F8253FB24A91F31A026AA0521317FBA35A7EFF5BC8847FF939D94991E3D741D8B054FE19086120F9C84FF618DA787F17A3657454BA8677DF0DC","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"35567e27-5273-48fb-bb34-9c3e3bc35575"}],"doi":"10.24425/amm.2022.137756"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["gas-bearing layers","extractive reserves","volumetric method","finite-element-difference method","distribution of reservoir pressure"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61a60a842467f0269e83ce71","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"National University «Yuri Kondratyuk Poltava Polytechnic»","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["627529974097075854f99caa"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Gas reserves calculation based on the results of reservoir pressure distribution modeling","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a5c9","mniswId":"1002078","title":"Technology audit and production reserves [ Технологический аудит и резервы производства ]","doi":null,"issn":"2226-3780","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b2ddb9ee-c11c-4559-bf8e-ac90b931d78e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"627529974097075854f99ca8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["627529974097075854f99caa"]},"issue":"1(63)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The object of this study is the gas-bearing layer B-26 of the Zakhidne-Radchenkivsʹke gas condensate field (Ukraine). A bottleneck in the process of exploration and experimental and industrial operation of the Zakhidne-Radchenkivsʹke gas condensate field was the ambiguous data on extractive reserves (values that were calculated by different authors range from 14 thousand to 424 million m3). At present, the field is mothballed, which is why the use of a new approach to calculating the initial gas reserves could be useful for deciding to start developing a single productive layer B-26.\n\nDuring the study, such theoretical research methods were used as the system analysis of the information used, numerical modeling based on the combined finite-element-difference method, the methods of visual representation of the information received, as well as analytical methods. The method of calculating gas reserves proposed in this work combines a volumetric method and the simulation of filtration processes using a combined finite-element-difference method. The latter makes it possible to take into consideration the structure of the reservoir, which is heterogeneous in terms of permeability, and to adequately, at the quantitative level, to describe the distribution of non-stationary reservoir pressure around the extractive well. By applying an analytical formula based on the values of average reservoir and downhole pressures, the radii of the well's feed circuit at different stages of the reservoir development have been calculated. Thus, the active area (and volume) of the reservoir can be determined, according to which the extractive reserves of the deposit are calculated. The mining reserves of the Zakhidne-Radchenkivsʹke field, estimated in this way, amount to 174 million m3 of gas.\n\nThe method for calculating reserves proposed in this study could prove useful for deciding on the further development of the Zakhidne-Radchenkivsʹke gas condensate field. Combining the volumetric method with the results of modeling filtration processes is an operational method for calculating the reserves of the reservoir, opened by one mining well. In this case, the application of the combined finite-element-difference method makes it possible to take into consideration the complex heterogeneous structure of the reservoir and predict the distribution of reservoir nonstationary pressures around the extractive well.\n\nThe current study that used the Zakhidne-Radchenkivsʹke gas condensate field in Ukraine as an example is interesting when calculating the reserves of layers of complex structure all over the world, whereby the productive reservoir is opened by a single mining well."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111293","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623b0d692467f02a86c5ae0e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"1 (63)","doi":"","documentHash":"94cb98b8-d391-4d94-a798-46a8e3483f68"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"30-35","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/tarp/article/download/253109/250822","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"627529974097075854f99caa","name":"Oksana","lastName":"Zakharchuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4229-1964","documentHash":"d8232bd6-4bef-4af0-93c8-7da58c3e078b"}],"doi":"10.15587/2706-5448.2022.253109"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biostimulator; fungal diseases; mycotoxins; pesticides"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee9","uid":"btl1TUFZ-RmtE1VFT09EDlQ","uuid":"f68cdefe-93d4-402f-94e1-bd2ef1f8616a","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee9","parentUuid":"f68cdefe-93d4-402f-94e1-bd2ef1f8616a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee9","rootUuid":"f68cdefe-93d4-402f-94e1-bd2ef1f8616a","name":"Instytut Ochrony Roślin - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b9878c28a0473afd0b","5e7093b9878c28a0473afc79","5e7094a8878c28a0473c119e","5e7093e2878c28a0473b28e4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Impact of Diversified Chemical and Biostimulator Protection on Yield, Health Status, Mycotoxin Level, and Economic Profitability in Spring Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)

The aim of this four-year spring wheat field experiment was to assess the effectivity of using herbicide, mixed fungicides protection, and a humic biostimulator. The following treatments were tested: biostimulator (S), sulfosulfuron (H), H + S, H + propiconazole + cyproconazole/spiroxamin + tebuconazole + triadimenol (H + F1 + F2), and H + F1 + F2 + S. Evaluations of wheat yield and fungal diseases (Septoria tritici blotch, eyespot, sharp eyespot, Fusarium spp.) were performed using visual and qPCR methods. Thirteen mycotoxins were analyzed by LC–MS/MS. Infestations of six weeds were examined visually. Temperatures and precipitation data of the vegetative seasons were monitored. Precipitation most affected the occurrence of leaf diseases despite the same chemical/biostimulator treatments (up to 48% Septoria tritici blotch severity for the S treatment). The highest mean yield was obtained for H + F1 + F2 + S (5.27 t ha−1), while the lowest level of mycotoxins was obtained for H + F1 + F2 (221.68 µg kg−1). For H + S, a greater reduction of mycotoxins was determined compared to the H treatment (27.18%), as well as a higher severity of eyespot (18%) and sharp eyespot (24%). In 2017-2020, the most effective reduction of weed infestation and Fusarium spp. DNA on ears was indicated for H + F1 + F2 (16 g and 0.88 pg g−1 DNA, respectively).

The oil palm tree is one of the greatest economic assets a nation can have, provided its importance is realized and fully harnessed. After the oil extraction of palm oil from the palm fruits, virtually all methods involved in palm kernel nut cracking both in traditional and small-scale exist in scattered or separate units of operations. Hence, this research focused on designing a palm nut kernel cracking unit incorporating a separator in form of a screen to separate cracked palm kernel nut shell from kernel. The result shows that there were significant difference (p≤0.05) among the moisture content of the palm nuts, shaft speed of the machine and weight (feed rate), having a significant difference between:\n\n– moisture content of the palm nut and the shaft speed of the cracker;\n\n– moisture content and feed rate;\n\n– shaft speed and feed rate.\n\nThere exist interaction between cracked, uncracked shell, damaged, undamaged kernel, and palm kernel nut breakage ratio. While, there was no significant difference among interaction between moisture content, shaft speed and feed weight. The result also indicated that for the highest speed of 1,800 rpm at a feed rate of 700 kg/h for all moisture contents, the cracking efficiency was between10 to 90 %, which implies that the kernel cracking efficiency increases with an increase in machine speed. However, it was observed that higher cracking efficiency was at the cost of higher kernel damage for all cracking speeds and feed rates, which is a problem. The kernel breakage ratio ranged from 1.040–7.85 for all feed rates and moisture contents. The kernel breakage ratio increased with moisture content and cracking speed but decreases with feed rate

In this review, we summarize both the historic records and recent findings on the occurrence and incidence of babesiosis in 20 European countries located in southeastern Europe (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia), central Europe (Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Switzerland), and northern and northeastern Europe (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Iceland, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and Norway), identified in humans and selected species of domesticated animals (cats, dogs, horses, and cattle). Recorded cases of human babesiosis are still rare, but their number is expected to rise in the coming years. This is because of the widespread and longer seasonal activity of Ixodes ricinus as a result of climate change and because of the more extensive use of better molecular diagnostic methods. Bovine babesiosis has a re-emerging potential because of the likely loss of herd immunity, while canine babesiosis is rapidly expanding in central and northeastern Europe, its occurrence correlating with the rapid, successful expansion of the ornate dog tick (Dermacentor reticulatus) populations in Europe. Taken together, our analysis of the available reports shows clear evidence of an increasing annual incidence of babesiosis across Europe in both humans and animals that is changing in line with similar increases in the incidence of other tick-borne diseases. This situation is of major concern, and we recommend more extensive and frequent, standardized monitoring using a “One Health” approach."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111315","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"945 (1-41)","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/10/5/945","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6278f1fb4097077547e9c467","name":"Julia","lastName":"Walochnik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8f332c6b-ed9f-469e-9cef-cdf92b461c76"},{"objectId":"6278f1fb4097077547e9c466","name":"Christina","lastName":"Strube","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9093-1006","documentHash":"1858497b-7aa9-446c-9f4a-cebb20f8639d"},{"objectId":"6278f1fb4097077547e9c465","name":"Andrea","lastName":"Springer","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0051-9086","documentHash":"35d253be-77d7-4607-aada-219624af692e"},{"objectId":"6278f1fb4097077547e9c464","name":"Manuela","lastName":"Schnyder","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6523-7952","documentHash":"c050cbfb-a2fa-43f1-93d8-9a01af01be63"},{"objectId":"6278f1fb4097077547e9c463","name":"Renate","lastName":"Ranka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b1ddc7db-adbd-4ecb-bb3b-4a4d0e85a9c6"},{"objectId":"6278f1fb4097077547e9c462","name":"Jana","lastName":"Radzijevskaja","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f2751914-fb1e-4352-9246-bbc87a433b70"},{"objectId":"6278f1fb4097077547e9c461","name":"Algimantas","lastName":"Paulauskas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"24789327-3e95-4fd3-a00b-fbd2a731a8c9"},{"objectId":"6278f1fb4097077547e9c460","name":"Valentina","lastName":"Oborina","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d87bb045-ebf0-4682-955a-2e17309e8d76"},{"objectId":"6278f1fb4097077547e9c45f","name":"Michael","lastName":"Leschnik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"766d4fba-1144-4858-9ce8-2a50db687c17"},{"objectId":"6278f1fb4097077547e9c45e","name":"Pikka","lastName":"Jokelainen","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3035-5094","documentHash":"a481e22d-6c92-4e9f-ba7a-d6f28a0f5605"},{"objectId":"6278f1fb4097077547e9c45d","name":"Mike","lastName":"Heddergott","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4536-5508","documentHash":"f0ad0162-b309-4b84-b2c8-c7443201489e"},{"objectId":"6278f1fb4097077547e9c45c","name":"Hans-Peter","lastName":"Fuehrer","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4178-0133","documentHash":"be4e9534-6592-45a6-9156-86ce4cea3e68"},{"objectId":"6278f1fb4097077547e9c45b","name":"Róbert","lastName":"Farkas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"79fe0040-dde2-4035-a0b1-6187c3c2c3f2"},{"objectId":"6278f1fb4097077547e9c458","name":"Ramon M.","lastName":"Eichenberger","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9337-9616","documentHash":"3829edd3-d024-47e1-b25f-3624262eb50f"},{"objectId":"6278f1fb4097077547e9c456","name":"Jerzy M.","lastName":"Behnke","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-9396-2572","documentHash":"8d0f49c5-2750-490f-a41d-04bc66eb23a0"},{"objectId":"6278f1fb4097077547e9c455","name":"Relja","lastName":"Beck","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5304-2875","documentHash":"a962687c-a743-4f67-947b-5439d2062b45"},{"objectId":"6278f1fb4097077547e9c454","name":"Ana","lastName":"Beck","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"02b6c234-f481-4452-a730-a1adc53dd9eb"},{"objectId":"5e70936e878c28a0473a962f","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Dwużnik-Szarek","uuid":"F11D0F98C11C94ED8FF3F89062C87CF2E840C8E5E65B9CBA84F8E329560A023E96307E1E579C1C475D1F53D06CF0B22A16B4AF73B1CDFE21F417EE0A471D88C8","orcidId":"0000-0003-2264-8345","documentHash":"b870ddc6-53dd-4bdd-8c24-6eb99b31f2c1"},{"objectId":"5e70936e878c28a0473a95df","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Tołkacz","uuid":"CDAF72C3EDE886250662615CBE80400D74DF78F2AE51E3B51EA0828FB22FB380BFBC1D236BDAA1213297027C4F5A7C4E1160E8B853DE64099C60F0AB6EE30464","orcidId":"0000-0002-8578-3870","documentHash":"c60652fb-150e-4af2-af80-fb2a0894a475"},{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7b27","name":"Anna","lastName":"Bajer","uuid":"CFABF0F0670A3951C164D446A05687F43D50517386E9CE8D94202C83A71899872438A3F8AF2E9DC6580568DE4AA89D59DCF3C66F8EB29BEB53F5E095BAB33B50","orcidId":"0000-0001-6199-8458","documentHash":"c42c126b-502c-4c00-8b3b-3d0b29d0f4b1"}],"doi":"10.3390/microorganisms10050945"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["podatek od nieruchomości, uchwały podatkowe, stawki podatkowe"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Różnicowanie stawek podatku od nieruchomości w uchwale rady gminy - glosa do wyroku NSA z dnia 11 sierpnia 2017 r.

NSA decided that the very fact of owning the objects of taxation by the taxpayer involved in this kind of the activity does not decide about burdening them wholly with the higher rate."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111325","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"251","pagesFromTo":"37-43","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://taxpress.pl/czasopisma/5264-przegl-d-podatkow-lokalnych-i-finansow-samorz-dowych-1-251-2022","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709210878c28a04738f6a5","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Dowgier","uuid":"00F1B2D9F75C092AA37FF33E08167DFEEE0994EB756707510534CF7A61CB4A090FDDF54B937C4BACCC90B1B0BB15602EB3EED5E7CF81020EC6586B53EA62D066","orcidId":"0000-0003-1583-086X","documentHash":"60c2f31e-862a-48e2-87dc-694ed3b9b2f8"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4b","uid":"bbnwounKOU-G0A35qUoTjRg","uuid":"f3b17ba6-8d96-4eee-a245-737a6775d82d","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4b","parentUuid":"f3b17ba6-8d96-4eee-a245-737a6775d82d","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4b","rootUuid":"f3b17ba6-8d96-4eee-a245-737a6775d82d","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Foreign trade activities are becoming a major factor in economic development, manifested in the growth of international trade, the liberalization of trade relations and the active participation of countries in the processes of international economic integration. In these circumstances, it is particularly important to carry out qualitative systemic studies designed to analyze the current state, trends and structural changes of national economies under the influence of foreign trade. Such studies require objective statistics and methodological support. The purpose of the paper is to analyze the benefits of the trade cooperation between Ukraine and Middle East and North African (MENA) countries and to determine the possibilities of the use of results in a development of fundamentals of Ukrainian trade policy. The approaches of international organizations to the classification of MENA countries considering the characteristics of the region driven by historical, political and cultural factors are investigated. The comparison analysis of indicators reflecting the foreign trade policy and countries' attitudes towards improving export support in Ukraine and MENA countries is made. The trade complementarity index was calculated for the period 2013 – 2020 in order to determine sectoral priorities for foreign trade cooperation between countries."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111337","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6276c1ac409707083994cfa1","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"3","number":"2","doi":"10.46656/access.2022.3.2","documentHash":"6e007bec-0af3-416c-a987-4a6ef6641ba8"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"3","pagesFromTo":"147-158","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journal.access-bg.org/journalfiles/journal/issue-3-2-2022/5-assessment_of_the_effectiveness_of_ukraine's_foreign_trade_policy_with_the_middle_east.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6276cb85409707083994e961","name":"Hossein Zonfali","lastName":"Omran","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8227-0607","documentHash":"a00ed7e4-f4e0-4055-8c47-2c43831bc912"},{"objectId":"6276cb85409707083994e960","name":"Ganna","lastName":"DUGINETS","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3708-3666","documentHash":"259d1921-5349-4af5-bd09-03045f3c0b02"}],"doi":"10.46656/access.2022.3.2(5)"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["unstructured textual data","business intelligence","NLP (Natural Language Processing)","text mining","text extraction","text summarization","clustering","text categorization","text retrieval"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737fa54","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Шуменски университет \"Епископ Константин Преславски\" (Konstantin Preslavsky University of Shumen)","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6276c7ab409707083994e41d","6276c7ab409707083994e41e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Business demands for processing unstructured textual data – text mining techniques for companies to implement","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5ed25714ad49b36afe56c5ee","mniswId":null,"title":"ACCESS: Access to science, business, innovation in digital economy","doi":null,"issn":"","eissn":"2683-1007","websiteLink":"https://journal.access-bg.org/","metadataSource":"USER","editor":null,"documentHash":"c93e61c6-b067-4588-982d-5e5d98510d16"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-17","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6276c7ab409707083994e41b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6276c7ab409707083994e41d","6276c7ab409707083994e41e"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The rapid development of technology has caused a pervasive change in the way people and businesses live.

Of particular value is the continuous flow of textual information that is generated every minute around the world in a different form (unstructured textual data). This is also the subject of this article. The aim of the article is to provide an analytical overview of the main methods of word processing that are applicable for pragmatic analysis of information flows from companies, such as: extraction, summarization, grouping and categorization of text. Some methodologies are based on NLP (Natural Language Processing), others on Bayesian logic and statistical theory and practice. From the review of various publications on the topic, conclusions are proposed for their practical applicability. This allows for an objective choice of appropriate tools for processing unstructured information and business intelligence.

Physical activity (PA) is often recommended as part of the management of CLBP, but to date, no one particular exercise has been shown to be superior. Vibrating exercise equipment (VEE) is widely available and used despite little scientific evidence to support its effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of musculoskeletal problems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of using VEE compared with sham-VEE in women with CLBP. Methods: A randomized (1:1 randomization scheme) single-blinded sham-controlled intervention study was conducted. Through simple randomization, 92 women aged 49–80 years were assigned to one of two groups: VEE (the experimental group) and sham-VEE (the control group). The VEE and sham-VEE intervention consisted of aerobic exercises with specific handheld equipment. Both groups performed physical activity twice weekly for 10 weeks. The erector spinae muscles’ bioelectrical activity (using an eight-channel electromyograph MyoSystem 1400L), lumbar range of motion (Schober’s test) and pain intensity (visual analog scale) were measured in all participants at baseline and after 10 weeks. Results: There was a significant decrease in the bioelectrical activity of the erector spinae muscles during flexion movement (left: Me = 18.2 before; Me = 14.1 after; p = 0.045; right: Me = 15.4 before; Me = 12.6 after; p = 0.010), rest at maximum flexion (left: Me = 18.1 before; Me = 12.5 after; p = 0.038), extension movement (right: Me = 21.8 before; Me = 20.2 after; p = 0.031) and rest in a prone position (right: Me = 3.5 before; Me = 3.2 after; 0.049); an increase in lumbar range of motion (Me = 17.0 before; Me = 18.0 after; p = 0.0017) and a decrease in pain intensity (Me = 4.0 before; Me = 1.0 after; p = 0.001) following a program of PA in the VEE group. Conclusions: No significant changes were found in intergroup comparisons. The beneficial changes regarding decreased subjective pain sensation in the VEE and sham-VEE groups may be due to participation in systematic physical activity. However, PA with vibrating exercise equipment could be a prospective strategy for increasing lumbar range of motion and for decreasing pain and erector spinae muscle activity in people with CLBP."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111344","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"art.268 [17 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-7737/11/2/268/htm","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630c80d4097076263e7ca62","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Halski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7eaf2e7c-7fb0-416d-87bd-b2174ca9a945"},{"objectId":"6630c80d4097076263e7ca61","name":"Gerda","lastName":"Delaunay","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1251901b-27a3-4569-b295-ad6f84404df9"},{"objectId":"6630c80d4097076263e7ca60","name":"Agata","lastName":"Mroczek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b640d454-42b8-40b5-bdc3-091ebaffd903"},{"objectId":"6630c80d4097076263e7ca5f","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Dobrowolska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4bc2e39e-4c21-4df7-bf71-89329eb81c13"},{"objectId":"6630c80d4097076263e7ca5e","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Kasper-Jędrzejewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3538cb42-5165-4f6c-bf4a-121706d16949"},{"objectId":"6630c80d4097076263e7ca5d","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Żurek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"61c4977d-0cbe-47de-8d24-7a040e9d45c8"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a11f9","name":"KUBA","lastName":"PTASZKOWSKI","uuid":"1C292C496FF8444FD6243B44B1193A35C8FB54CE8DDED3A8DC1C9EB071F180C83BCEE750AD2D9C1503B4B8F17B69C89936371CA378B3749EDDEB455A6CD48CEE","orcidId":"0000-0002-5690-5226","documentHash":"97e6dbeb-2c84-4541-b596-464b8bacacce"}],"doi":"10.3390/biology11020268"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Annealing temperature","Ag/TiO2","thin film","microstructure","optical properties"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70926a878c28a047395462"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Microstructural studies of Ag/TiO2thin film; effect of annealing temperature","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c2851454771a4","mniswId":"1678","title":"Archives of Metallurgy and Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1733-3490","eissn":"2300-1909","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"31465388-e059-45ef-8709-2d30e94e9e8e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"FEBRUARY","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"620634ec2467f04995f27d4d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70926a878c28a047395462","6735aabdfdbe83034964ac21","6735aabdfdbe83034964ac22","6735aabdfdbe83034964ac23","6735aabdfdbe83034964ac24","6735aabdfdbe83034964ac25","6735aabdfdbe83034964ac26","6735aabdfdbe83034964ac27","6735aabdfdbe83034964ac28","6735aabdfdbe83034964ac29"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Microstructures are an important link between materials processing and performance, and microstructure control is essential for any materials processing route where the microstructure plays a major role in determining the properties. In this work, silver- doped titanium dioxide (Ag/tio2) thin film was prepared by the sol-gel method through the hydrolysis of titanium tetra-isopropoxide and silver nitrate solution. The sol was spin coated on ito glass substrate to get uniform film followed by annealing process for 2 hours. The obtained films were annealed at different annealing temperatures in the range of 300°C-600°C in order to observe the effect on crystalline state, microstructures and optical properties of Ag/tio2 thin film. The thin films were characterized by X-Ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (sem), and uV-Vis spectrophotometry. it is clearly seen, when the an- nealing temperature increases to 500°C, a peak at 2? = 25.30° can be seen which refers to the structure of TiO2 tetragonal anatase.\nThe structure of Ag/tio2 thin film become denser, linked together, porous and uniformly distributed on the surface and displays the highest cut-off wavelength value which is 396 nm with the lowest band gap value, which is 3.10 eV\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058111348","journalIssue":{"objectId":"640ef069409707703509b131","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"67","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"93fe92c8-5f0f-4b35-8ce1-bc5819eff1fd"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"67","pagesFromTo":"241-245","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6735aabdfdbe83034964ac29","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Nabiałek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c0a41a60-91f3-4783-a2e0-69745e884073"},{"objectId":"6735aabdfdbe83034964ac28","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Jeż","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f9c79975-c50a-4315-960c-3cd24f8a8973"},{"objectId":"6735aabdfdbe83034964ac27","name":"Varistha","lastName":"Chobpattana","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"37f58d73-b995-4751-893a-97eeebe4f4f5"},{"objectId":"6735aabdfdbe83034964ac26","name":"N.","lastName":"Mahmed","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f9ffaf59-1ac2-4d18-b033-1c16abe69a5f"},{"objectId":"6735aabdfdbe83034964ac25","name":"Mustafa","lastName":"Mohd","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7c3d3534-5b60-4904-afb0-7637ef16b2ba"},{"objectId":"6735aabdfdbe83034964ac24","name":"A.B.A. Mohd","lastName":"Mustafa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f821fdc9-6608-405c-a0ef-8c773d1e0ae0"},{"objectId":"6735aabdfdbe83034964ac23","name":"A.","lastName":"Azliza","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3eb01f0b-71ea-4e13-8ab2-dd9ddc81a624"},{"objectId":"6735aabdfdbe83034964ac22","name":"C.H.
