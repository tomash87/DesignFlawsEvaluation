As the solar magnetic field is modulated by the 11 yr dynamo cycle, our goal is to perform a theoretical exploratory study to assess the difference of propagation of an ICME in typical minimum and maximum activity backgrounds. We define a median representative CME at 0.1 au, using both observations and numerical simulations, and describe it using a spheromak model. We use the heliospheric propagator EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting Information Asset to inject the same ICME in two different background wind environments. We then study how the environment and the internal CME structure impact the propagation of the ICME toward Earth, by comparison with an unmagnetized CME. At minimum of activity, the structure of the heliosphere around the ecliptic causes the ICME to slow down, creating a delay with the polar parts of the ejecta. This delay is more important if the ICME is faster. At maximum of activity, a southern coronal hole causes a northward deflection. For these cases, we always find that the ICME at the maximum of activity arrives first, while the ICME at the minimum of activity is actually more geoeffective. The sign of the helicity of the ICME is also a crucial parameter, but at the minimum of activity only, since it affects the magnetic profile and the arrival time up to 8 hr."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739468","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"955","pagesFromTo":"1-23","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/acec6f","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65a11c954097076c14504195","name":"Florian","lastName":"Regnault","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eb39d9c8-ed58-4928-8bc2-0124eae36c87"},{"objectId":"65a11c954097076c14504194","name":"Pascal","lastName":"Démoulin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"85dd9799-fdc0-4285-8afa-76d150e7320c"},{"objectId":"65a11c954097076c14504193","name":"Brigitte","lastName":"Schmieder","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7255dbc3-e761-41a2-9bf4-10862979778d"},{"objectId":"65a11c954097076c14504192","name":"Barbara","lastName":" Perri","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"23a14749-c9c0-4ee5-b78c-224b1f8553b4"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2b","name":"Stefaan","lastName":"Poedts","uuid":"E30515B6831744043DFF6116308CAADF77B5F0C972E5A368DB49146E9779BB06976217A98AF4D837221C3ED8E97238836204CBB8C77804B509343F88AD17DDF9","orcidId":"0000-0002-1743-0651","documentHash":"c635d010-d0a5-4637-8a13-98fc1c24e343"}],"doi":"10.3847/1538-4357/acec6f"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Data-driven Modeling of a Coronal Magnetic Flux Rope: From Birth to Death","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547723b","mniswId":"1990","title":"Astrophysical Journal","doi":null,"issn":"0004-637X","eissn":"1538-4357","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b6dd4b52-08ee-4b62-b195-3b6207fef891"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65d5e4b540970762631b9114","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65d5e4b540970762631b9115","65d5e4b540970762631b9116","65d5e4b540970762631b9117","65d5e4b540970762631b9118","65d5e4b540970762631b9119","6325312975234038513dfa2b","65d5e4b540970762631b911a","65d5e4b540970762631b911b","65d5e4b540970762631b911c","65d5e4b540970762631b911d","65d5e4b540970762631b911e"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\r\n               <jats:p>Magnetic flux ropes are a bundle of twisted magnetic field lines produced by internal electric currents, which are responsible for solar eruptions and are the major drivers of geomagnetic storms. As such, it is crucial to develop a numerical model that can capture the entire evolution of a flux rope, from its birth to death, in order to predict whether adverse space weather events might occur or not. In this paper, we develop a data-driven modeling that combines a time-dependent magnetofrictional approach with a thermodynamic magnetohydrodynamic model. Our numerical modeling successfully reproduces the formation and confined eruption of an observed flux rope, and unveils the physical details behind the observations. Regarding the long-term evolution of the active region, our simulation results indicate that the flux cancellation due to collisional shearing plays a critical role in the formation of the flux rope, corresponding to a substantial increase in magnetic free energy and helicity. Regarding the eruption stage, the deformation of the flux rope during its eruption can cause an increase in the downward tension force, which suppresses it from further rising. This finding may shed light on why some torus-unstable flux ropes lead to failed eruptions after large-angle rotations. Moreover, we find that twisted fluxes can accumulate during confined eruptions, which would breed the subsequent eruptive flares.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739470","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"961","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad088dZhong","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65d5e4b540970762631b911e","name":"Y.","lastName":"Guo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"925eccff-1b1b-4736-b319-c6d8a2098a7c"},{"objectId":"65d5e4b540970762631b911d","name":"P.F.","lastName":"Chen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e79d34c2-f3aa-4ed4-a601-14d08e1a22e6"},{"objectId":"65d5e4b540970762631b911c","name":"F.

Water contamination has become a major threat due to its devastating impacts on the entire ecosystem. Relatively great danger for aquatic microorganisms is posed by organic micropollutants, which are a consequence of progressing urbanization and industrialization. This review focuses on laccase of mainly fungal and bacterial origin, which provides an eco-friendly strategy for the transformation of these harmful pollutants to less or non-toxic compounds, as it acts oxidatively on the aromatic ring of a wide range of compounds, releasing water as the only by-product. Laccase alone or with the use of mediators has been used successfully to remove micropollutants from wastewater, including pharmaceuticals and personal care products, biocides, endocrine disrupting agents, steroid hormones, and microplastics. Even though the potential of an LMS (laccase–mediator system) is tremendous, the selection of an appropriate mediator and the persistent monitoring of toxicity after treatment are critical and should be performed routinely. Hence, further research is still needed for the optimization of degradation processes to improve our understanding of the different interactions of laccase with the substrate and to develop sustainable advanced water treatment systems."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739478","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/15/21/3770","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092f8878c28a0473a045a","name":"Anna","lastName":"Pawlik","uuid":"EA58E63896E067C4B4398A886D08CCECF1771FAD3133345F8E712141A147A4A6358EC0665795E8408FDD9C8F414A728DE41FE52D374B385058985BBC112E31DE","orcidId":"0000-0002-2991-758X","documentHash":"b8e4597d-24a4-4cc5-81c7-f0eed65c9920"},{"objectId":"5e7092f8878c28a0473a0456","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Janusz","uuid":"A981EA5068C4D446849CC911214B76A4BF288128E65EED393385A7AB3A722B0232FC8A7D2E991903822AE003158E57F3FCE6587CAC20930F0E09609BBCCC50BF","orcidId":"0000-0002-2046-2806","documentHash":"c263bf9e-c8e4-45b2-a0e7-e6edb24b9ace"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a00ae","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Skwarek","uuid":"F4B4F341A862B223B07676F9DAEE29101F80823A6B9F55086BB829C78744BD0E51FB1A67977D371E57D77BCA891B4EBB2302FF937A389AFF7A3FAF1E7746372F","orcidId":"0000-0003-4721-8704","documentHash":"a12325ea-7eea-465e-ad67-ce968fcd25d5"}],"doi":"10.3390/w15213770"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hybrid injection-moulded parts","natural fillers","low-density polyethylene","solvent"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Assessment Study on the Solvent Resistance of Low-Density Polyethylene with Pumpkin Seed Hulls","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1944","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-12-23","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63b56e1a4097076e4798a043","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709349878c28a0473a66b8","5e7092f7878c28a0473a024a","659fc1874097076c144aa617"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"When designing products that are made of composite materials and that contain natural fillers, it is particularly important to consider the long-term exposure of these materials to caustic liquids and substances (concentrated acids, bases), and to ensure that these products meet strict requirements for reliability and operational safety. This study investigated the effects of different solvents on the mass, mechanical, thermal, surface, and structural properties of polymer composites containing natural fillers in the form of pumpkin seed hulls. Experiments were conducted using four different filler contents (5, 10, 15, and 20 wt%) and grain sizes ranging from 0.2 to 0.4 mm and 0.6 to 0.8 mm. Hybrid injection-moulded pieces were immersed in distilled water (H2O), 1% NaOH solution, acetone (C3H6O), and toluene (C7H8) for 84 days. After that, their mechanical and thermal properties as well as their structure geometries were analysed statistically. Changes in the properties of the tested composite materials were assessed depending on the solvent type, and the statistical significance of these changes were determined. The results showed that the nature of degradation depended on the applied solvent type. It was observed that the polymer matrix of the toluene-immersed samples absorbed the liquid to a significant extent first and then underwent a gradual degradation with time. In contrast, the samples immersed in water showed a slight increase in their mass. It was found that all tested properties of the composite samples deteriorated irrespective of the solvent type."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739480","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/1/138/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"659fc1874097076c144aa617","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Głogowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6eaa8982-1742-4bd0-b5f6-b3d72670b2df"},{"objectId":"5e709349878c28a0473a66b8","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Pączkowski","uuid":"05035E8110F71DA2DC226BA1854573E0314E23FBCEB6344FFD9EF29F28F04330D10CED55974F14B2FB95E1EC14EEA9406BB0E7304B753434BDB1C7164207076B","orcidId":"0000-0002-1704-1648","documentHash":"32f553f0-6d16-42eb-91be-acf1d2235b21"},{"objectId":"5e7092f7878c28a0473a024a","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Gawdzik","uuid":"C4B74D3BF33004B2725EB34F13815A09BA040961B7430DA69071AAAF1CBCF92F75C63545FF16A7939F9D6F7EDC2B36701091345991BB1E9558A481F45B6F67DE","orcidId":"0000-0003-4856-0309","documentHash":"a076f907-38ac-4995-8dbf-f8f15c428928"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma16010138"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","uid":"bWyeXRlH0huS_TwqiYk7m5Q","uuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","parentUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de51","rootUuid":"28f45cd0-ed86-4162-baf8-d0add700e59f","name":"Uniwersytet

advancements in encryption technology, the issue of covert data transmission remains relevant. Researchers are actively enhancing established methods of concealing information with software tools that utilize mathematical models and developing new data entry methods. Steganographic techniques can be used with cryptographic methods to enhance the confidentiality of information within a container or as a standalone software tool. This article examines the steganographic integrity of concealing confidential information within audio files. The steganographic technique was selected as the phase coding method, which involves substituting the audio element's phase with the secret message's relative phase. An implementation of the chosen method was developed for the experiment. During the experiment, secret data of varying lengths were used to assess the impact of the length of the concealed information on the distortion of the audio file that may be perceptible to the listener. The study also investigated the resilience of the concealed information to noise attacks, allowing for the determination of the threshold of its robustness.

Solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) can catch up and interact with preceding CMEs and solar wind structures to undergo rotation and deflection during their propagation.\r\nAim. We aim to show how the interactions of a CME in the corona and heliosphere can play a significant role in altering its geoeffectiveness as predicted at the time of its eruption. To do so, we consider a case study of two successive CMEs launched from the active region NOAA 12158 in early September 2014. The second CME was predicted to be extensively geoeffective based on the remote-sensing observations of the source region. However, in situ measurements at 1 au recorded only a short-lasting, weak negative Bz component followed by a prolonged positive Bz component.\r\nMethods. We used the EUropean Heliosphere FORecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA) to perform a self-consistent 3D magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) data-driven simulation of the two CMEs in the heliosphere. First, the ambient solar wind is modelled, followed by the time-dependent injection of CME1 with the LFF spheromak and CME2 with the Flux Rope in 3D (FRi3D) model.\r\nThe initial conditions of the CMEs are determined by combining observational insights near the Sun, which are fine-tuned to match the in situ observations near 1 au, with additional numerical experiments related to each individual CME.\r\nResults. By introducing CME1 before CME2 in the EUHFORIA simulation, we modelled the negative Bz component in the sheath region ahead of CME2 whose formation can be attributed to the interaction between CME1 and CME2. To reproduce the positive Bz component in the magnetic ejecta of CME2, we had to initialise CME2 with an orientation determined at 0.1 au and consistent with the orientation interpreted at 1 au instead of the orientation observed during its eruption.\r\nConclusions. EUHFORIA simulations suggest the possibility of a significant rotation of CME2 in the low corona in order to explainthe in situ observations at 1 au. Coherent magnetic field rotations with enhanced strength (potentially geoeffective) can be formed in the sheath region as a result of interactions between two CMEs in the heliosphere even if the individual CMEs are not geoeffective."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739492","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"675","pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2023/07/aa45902-23/aa45902-23.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65a10f594097076c14503c77","name":"Brigitte","lastName":"Schmieder","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"03b54c9a-2d80-4991-b4a5-cc3b83fe2967"},{"objectId":"65a10f594097076c14503c76","name":"Camilla","lastName":"Scolini","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6daa613e-8db9-44ce-bc90-325e981c9332"},{"objectId":"65a10f594097076c14503c75","name":"Anwesha","lastName":"Maharana","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e941378f-9fe5-445f-b455-0c78a6fde41b"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2b","name":"Stefaan","lastName":"Poedts","uuid":"E30515B6831744043DFF6116308CAADF77B5F0C972E5A368DB49146E9779BB06976217A98AF4D837221C3ED8E97238836204CBB8C77804B509343F88AD17DDF9","orcidId":"0000-0002-1743-0651","documentHash":"c635d010-d0a5-4637-8a13-98fc1c24e343"}],"doi":"10.1051/0004-6361/202345902"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Dynamika

We present new insights into impulsively generated Alfvén and magneto-acoustic waves in the partially ionized two-fluid plasma of the solar atmosphere and their contribution to chromospheric heating and plasma outflows.\r\n\r\nAims. Our study attempts to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for chromospheric heating and excitation of plasma outflows that may contribute to the generation of the solar wind in the upper atmospheric layers. The main aim of this work is to investigate the impulsively generated waves by taking into account two-fluid effects. These effects may alter the wave propagation leading to attenuation and collisional plasma heating.\r\n\r\nMethods. The two-fluid equations were solved by the JOint ANalytical Numerical Approach (JOANNA) code in a 2.5-dimensional (2.5D) framework to simulate the dynamics of the solar atmosphere. Here, electrons + ions (protons) and neutrals (hydrogen atoms) are treated as separate fluids, which are coupled via ion-neutral collisions. The latter acts as a dissipation mechanism for the energy carried by the waves in two-fluid plasma and may ultimately lead to the frictional heating of the partially ionized plasma. The waves in two-fluid plasma, which are launched from the top of the photosphere, are excited by perturbations induced by localized Gaussian pulses in the horizontal components of the ion and neutral velocities.\r\n\r\nResults. In the middle and upper chromosphere, a substantial fraction of the energy carried by large amplitude waves in the two-fluid plasma is dissipated in ion-neutral collisions, resulting in the thermalization of wave energy and generation of plasma outflows. We find that coupled Alfvén and magneto-acoustic waves are more effective in heating the chromosphere than magneto-acoustic waves.\r\n\r\nConclusions. Large-amplitude waves in the two-fluid plasma may be responsible for heating the chromosphere. The net flow of ions is directed outward, leading to plasma outflows in the lower solar corona, which may contribute to the solar wind at higher altitudes The primary source of wave energy dissipation in the current paradigm comes from collisions between ions and neutrals."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739497","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"681","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2024/01/aa45638-22/aa45638-22.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65bcc32f40970762630370bc","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Kilpua","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"562defaf-81ed-4a28-a43a-9a6fc2a9894e"},{"objectId":"65bcc32f40970762630370bb","name":"Błażej","lastName":"Kuźma","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e575de72-806a-41da-9cf0-c4a2d97cb8c4"},{"objectId":"65bcc32f40970762630370ba","name":"Luís Henrique Sinki","lastName":"Kadowaki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3d8bef86-0e6e-4851-8da5-cbada092a40a"},{"objectId":"65bcc32f40970762630370b9","name":"Mayank","lastName":"Kumar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"00fd5d9d-21fd-43a9-9c7f-812544e69d3b"},{"objectId":"5e7092f7878c28a0473a022c","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Murawski","uuid":"A878EC132011084718EB86B059D373BC0154C2D5670CF599327846DE9880901B9B8AFD7504EF4CE9F697DE838EC0A65F1498456259B35B03DAB14AF888D5B6F7","orcidId":"0000-0002-0184-2117","documentHash":"487d0310-a2c3-4100-977d-7052b9b864e2"}],"doi":"10.1051/0004-6361/202245638"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Zeolite‐based catalysts for conversion of oxygenated polymer waste by use of Positron Annihilation","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775bf","mniswId":"3459","title":"ChemCatChem","doi":null,"issn":"1867-3880","eissn":"1867-3899","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"1f21c9a1-7561-427a-b91d-d5589a35fbee"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65b8c40d4097073e10aa1caf","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65b8c40d4097073e10aa1cb0","65b8c40d4097073e10aa1cb1","65b8c40d4097073e10aa1cb2","65b8c40d4097073e10aa1cb3","5e7092f7878c28a0473a0202","65b8c40d4097073e10aa1cb4","65b8c40d4097073e10aa1cb5","65b8c40d4097073e10aa1cb6","65b8c40d4097073e10aa1cb7"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS) has been employed to investigate the catalysts HZSM-5 and MESO−Y, which play a pivotal role in catalyzing and upgrading plastics, with a primary focus on oxygenated polymers, thereby transforming existing plastic materials into simpler, higher-quality value-added products. In this study, PALS was systematically compared with other complementary analytical techniques. The research outcomes have successfully demonstrated the efficacy of PALS in elucidating the morphology and topology of zeolites at micro/meso-meter scales.\r\n\r\nThe first experiment focuses on H-ZSM-5 zeolite subjected to treatments involving polyurethane and polypropylene. The second experiment delves into H-ZSM-5 zeolites with varying Si/Al ratios, both before and after conversion. The third experiment investigates Y zeolites that are surfactant templated to induce meso-porosity, examining their fresh state as well as their post-conversion condition.\r\n\r\nThe PALS analysis was supplemented by BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) analysis and NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectroscopies. Notably, PALS exhibits superior sensitivity, at the sub-nanometer scale, suggesting its potential as a preferred complementary method for catalysis studies. In conclusion, the integration of PALS into the repertoire of analytical tools enhances our understanding of catalyst behavior and catalytic processes, offering valuable insights for the advancement of plastic recycling and catalysis research."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739498","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/cctc.202301282","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65b8c40d4097073e10aa1cb7","name":"Xuemin","lastName":"Li","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"34975450-cc74-49cc-9b22-35d63a6a22a5"},{"objectId":"65b8c40d4097073e10aa1cb6","name":"Andrew","lastName":"Jaeshke","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a1e9d5b9-9dac-4798-a659-cf37b853bd1b"},{"objectId":"65b8c40d4097073e10aa1cb5","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Katz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"324563b5-dabf-4e84-ad3b-e300667bfc90"},{"objectId":"65b8c40d4097073e10aa1cb4","name":"Jochen","lastName":"Lauterbach","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"09215a03-4120-4d39-9672-a57b594425a3"},{"objectId":"65b8c40d4097073e10aa1cb3","name":"Abraham","lastName":"Martinez","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"99c6d5ab-1d2e-4df4-b4a5-e2bc6f955909"},{"objectId":"65b8c40d4097073e10aa1cb2","name":"Anne","lastName":"Gaffney","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3e1bfcb1-5fcd-4fdf-8f99-5e021154e727"},{"objectId":"65b8c40d4097073e10aa1cb1","name":"Kanan","lastName":"Shikhaliyev","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c79d594b-1728-4c1f-b1ad-c95ebdc09bbb"},{"objectId":"65b8c40d4097073e10aa1cb0","name":"Jagoda","lastName":"Urban-Klaehn","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f9e46635-5021-43db-bb52-f05ba01e8b62"},{"objectId":"5e7092f7878c28a0473a0202","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Zaleski","uuid":"34B25F44EBD637AB52F4D593FB1469634CFB9B7042188EAB861775255F5C63D84A02BB1BF7FBBBBE58426223AC0129E744FBAA431413F8D8CD5EDB98BFE47D2B","orcidId":"0000-0002-7227-8189","documentHash":"a4dd6cc3-85b4-4b94-a544-faad3b6c3336"}],"doi":"10.1002/cctc.202301282"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sol–gel method","ethylenediamine groups","polysiloxanes","polysilsesquioxanes","metal\nion adsorption"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Diamine Groups on the Surface of Silica Particles as Complex-Forming Linkers for Metal Cations","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":null,"issn":"1420-3049","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"85ea3d3d-2670-4384-98ee-1b5b44edab21"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-01-03","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"657043fb4097071b8e60cb54","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f5878c28a0473a00a7","659fc1fc4097076c144aaaa4","659fc1fc4097076c144aaaa5","659fc1fc4097076c144aaaa6","659fc1fc4097076c144aaaa7"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Novel spherically shaped organosilica materials with (propyl)ethylenediamine groups were obtained via a modified one-pot Stöber co-condensation method. The porosity of these materials was tuned with the controlled addition of three silica monomers acting as structuring agents (tetraethoxysilane and bridged silanes with ethylene and phenylene bridges). The morphologies and structures of the synthesized materials were studied by SEM, DRIFT spectroscopy, CHNS elemental analysis, low-temperature nitrogen adsorption–desorption, and electrokinetic potential measurements. Their sizes were in the range of 50 to 100 nm, depending on the amount of structuring silane used in the reaction. The degree of the particles’ agglomeration determined the mesoporosity of the samples. The content of the (propyl)ethylenediamine groups was directly related with the amount of functional silane used in the reaction. The zeta potential measurements indicated the presence of silanol groups in bissilane-based samples, which added new active centers on the surface and reduced the activity of the amino groups. The static sorption capacities (SSCs) of the obtained samples towards Cu(II), Ni(II), and Eu(III) ions depended on the porosity of the samples and the spatial arrangement of the ethylenediamine groups; therefore, the SSC values were not always higher for the samples with the largest number of groups. The highest SSC values achieved were 1.8 mmolCu(II)/g (for ethylene-bridged samples), 0.83 mmolNi(II)/g (for phenylene-bridged samples), and 0.55 mmolEu(III)/g (for tetraethoxysilane-based samples). © 2023 by the authors."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739500","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"28","pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/28/1/430","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"659fc1fc4097076c144aaaa7","name":"Iryna","lastName":"Melnyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2250f1c7-1ff5-4582-85ab-3f9f056323f0"},{"objectId":"659fc1fc4097076c144aaaa6","name":"Olha","lastName":"Semeshko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"24ff6112-40c2-403c-a8f7-d4bfe801efdc"},{"objectId":"659fc1fc4097076c144aaaa5","name":"Nataliya","lastName":"Stolyarchuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9dc57e8a-ba69-44d1-a2c6-f1ccc2535d8d"},{"objectId":"659fc1fc4097076c144aaaa4","name":"Veronika","lastName":"Tomina","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ea94181d-b98b-40a0-b3e6-797ddad2c2bc"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a00a7","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Barczak","uuid":"C3D55FC85B9DAE6EB6D1DA5CEE5E0347A329EB7F452B7A1F8982762F2545C2AF851143E7F210E1BBCAAE79E6F8608384BDF088C4DAA3D0811F7BB066DD9F9978","orcidId":"0000-0002-1177-7267","documentHash":"3a8c3e8c-0610-4f4b-88f5-9cf9aad09b85"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules28010430"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","uid":"brxjSi7UqeOCMt2Da6QQ-GA","uuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","parentUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea9","rootUuid":"511f81bf-1097-4e3d-905f-7df8bf7a67c5","name":"Instytut Geofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709359878c28a0473a7c28","62c796a8752340480571c972","5e70936c878c28a0473a93e2"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df15","uid":"bR42jPDMRkKGHv60Y9Q25kQ","uuid":"9b699ae6-6e42-406f-ab02-2d5c171b6c86","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Fizyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61c29bb87523404d4a91b186","5e709358878c28a0473a7b61","5e70935e878c28a0473a82ef"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Combined sun-photometer–lidar inversion: lessons learned during the EARLINET/ACTRIS COVID-19 campaign","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547724f","mniswId":"2028","title":"Atmospheric Measurement Techniques","doi":null,"issn":"1867-1381","eissn":"1867-8548","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b1414007-a87e-47a0-b712-3f04757e74e8"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"659ff79940970707a130d761","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659ff79940970707a130d763","659ff79940970707a130d764","659ff79940970707a130d765","659ff79940970707a130d766","659ff79940970707a130d767","62c796a8752340480571c972","5e70936c878c28a0473a93e2","5e709359878c28a0473a7c28","659ff79940970707a130d768","659ff79940970707a130d769","659ff79940970707a130d76a","659ff79940970707a130d76b","659ff79940970707a130d76c","659ff79940970707a130d76d","659ff79940970707a130d76e","659ff79940970707a130d76f","659ff79940970707a130d770","659ff79940970707a130d771","659ff79940970707a130d772","659ff79940970707a130d773","659ff79940970707a130d774","659ff79940970707a130d775","659ff79940970707a130d776","659ff79940970707a130d777","659ff79940970707a130d778","659ff79940970707a130d779","659ff79940970707a130d77a","659ff79940970707a130d77b","659ff79940970707a130d77c","659ff79940970707a130d77d","5e70935e878c28a0473a82ef","61c29bb87523404d4a91b186","5e709358878c28a0473a7b61","659ff79940970707a130d781","659ff79940970707a130d782","659ff79940970707a130d783","659ff79940970707a130d784","659ff79940970707a130d785","659ff79940970707a130d786","659ff79940970707a130d787","659ff79940970707a130d788","659ff79940970707a130d789","659ff79940970707a130d78a"]},"issue":"24","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The European Aerosol Research Lidar Network (EARLINET), part of the Aerosols, Clouds and Trace gases Research Infrastructure (ACTRIS), organized an intensive observational campaign in May 2020, with the objective of monitoring the atmospheric state over Europe during the COVID-19 lockdown and relaxation period. Besides the standard operational processing of the lidar data in EARLINET, for seven EARLINET sites having collocated sun-photometric observations in the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), a network exercise was held in order to derive profiles of the concentration and effective column size distributions of the aerosols in the atmosphere, by applying the GRASP/GARRLiC (from Generalized Aerosol Retrieval from Radiometer and Lidar Combined data – GARRLiC – part of the Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties – GRASP) inversion algorithm. The objective of this network exercise was to explore the possibility of identifying the anthropogenic component and of monitoring its spatial and temporal characteristics in the COVID-19 lockdown and relaxation period. While the number of cases is far from being statistically significant so as to provide a conclusive description of the atmospheric aerosols over Europe during this period, this network exercise was fundamental to deriving a common methodology for applying GRASP/GARRLiC to a network of instruments with different characteristics. The limits of the approach are discussed, in particular the missing information close to the ground in the lidar measurements due to the instrument geometry and the sensitivity of the GRASP/GARRLiC retrieval to the settings used, especially for cases with low aerosol optical depth (AOD) like the ones we show here. We found that this sensitivity is well-characterized in the GRASP/GARRLiC products, since it is included in their retrieval

of this research was to investigate ball milling of biochar from various feedstocks (willow, rice husk, oilseed rape, sewage sludge) under different pyrolysis conditions (500 and 750 °C, N2 and CO2 atmosphere) on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metals content. A significant reduction in both total (Ctotal Σ16) (1.1 to 2.4-fold decrease) and freely available (Cfree Σ16) (1.1 to 2.9-fold decrease) PAHs in nanobiochar (n-BC), particularly in sewage sludge (SSL)-derived n-BC was observed. The changes in biochar surface characteristics induced by ball milling, such as surface area, pore volume, and hydrophilicity, contribute to the decreased PAHs content. Mechanisms involving mechanochemical degradation, free-radical reactions, and defects on the biochar surface may explain the decrease of PAHs. The n-BC showed lower log Kd values for PAHs (reduced by 14 to 41 %) compared to bulk biochar (b-BC), indicating reduced effectiveness in immobilizing PAHs. The ball milling significantly reduced also metal contents by 37 to 55 %, especially in willow pellets and agricultural residue (rice husk and oilseed rape straw) with optimal reduction (by 55 %) observed for WL-derived n-BC produced at 650 °C. Importantly, no metals were detected in the aqueous phase after ball milling, ensuring environmental safety of these materials. Reduction mechanisms of metals during ball milling include stable aggregate formation, enhanced defects in crystalline structures, and irreversible adsorption onto new surfaces. The results demonstrate that the application of an eco-friendly ball milling method allows for the production of materials characterized by reduced contamination levels, which is crucial from an environmental protection viewpoint."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739507","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"937","pagesFromTo":"173372","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969724035198","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6711f38bfdbe831eab26afc6","name":"Yong Sik","lastName":"Ok","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f13859d2-ab77-43e5-8602-c347f6030ffd"},{"objectId":"6711f38bfdbe831eab26afc5","name":"Ondřej ","lastName":"Kácha ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4e6f7688-7de1-4e2e-b22c-4b17a12c2772"},{"objectId":"6711f38bfdbe831eab26afc4","name":"Monika Stefania","lastName":"Raczkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2a321d68-8f47-4fdd-866a-15b65f867880"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390aff","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Oleszczuk","uuid":"4FCF45750A5D33DB0E506D0634C8E83F1F567E71FDA182424BC16D3A9B7D6C806B3E751DD8DEB8A95F81EFA82B94E668B6604C0E4D9479D418440B46FFBD3060","orcidId":"0000-0001-8546-7299","documentHash":"de8bb1e3-4bc1-43e6-aba8-d51f467ca81f"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.173372"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["inżynieria rekonstrukcyjna","digitalizacja","EinScan SE","GOM Scan 1 MV400"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["reconstruction engineering","digitization","EinScan SE","GOM Scan 1 MV400"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65c606324097076263b9231b","doi":null,"title":"Przegląd osiągnięć dydaktycznych dyplomantów i promotorów.

However, designing and controlling them without using chemicals so that the produced ZSM-5 can have strongly enhanced catalytic properties and more importantly can be applied at industrial scale have still been a big challenge up to now. The present study employed the 10 MeV electron beam (EB) generated from an industrial linear accelerator to introduce both the O-vacancy rich mesopores and stable triad-silanol nests in ZSM-5. The structural modification of irradiated ZSM-5 samples was explored by using SEM and FTIR combined with positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) including positron annihilation lifetime (PAL), Doppler broadening (DB) of electron–positron annihilation energy and electron momentum distribution (EMD). Obtained results indicated that EB irradiation could recover the defective-crystal structure as well as intensively modify the structures of ZSM-5. In particular, the mechanism for the solid-state crystallization and the formation of the O-vacancy rich mesopores (maximum size of 4.5 nm) in ZSM-5 under the combined EB irradiation (10110 kGy) and calcination (600 °C) was, for the first time, proposed. The mechanism for the formation of stable triad-silanol nests in the channels of irradiated and calcined ZSM-5 zeolites was also explored. The present study, therefore, opens a new research path of applying both EB irradiation and calcination to produce ZSM-5 with novel features for industrial catalytic application at large-production scale."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739512","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"9","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468217923001156","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65aa67894097071977e4c544","name":"Luu

The samples were composed of polymer molecules with molecular weight 30 000 amu and 2% of branched carbon atoms. The calculations were carried out using various force fields i.e. Amber pairwise additive force field and four types of many body reactive force fields like AIREBO, AIREBO-M, ReaxFF and ci-ReaxFF. For each force field the material properties of the samples were determined i.e.: Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, yield strength and share modulus using the determined stress–strain curves. The samples were subjected to mechanical cleaving by applying an external forces in order to generate surfaces of LDPE. These surfaces were analyzed in terms of their chemical composition and number and types of radical ends formed on the surfaces. Additionally, the samples were subjected to shock compression in order to produce more deeper chemical transformations which should be more representative to naturally degraded nanoplastics. We conclude that the CHO ReaxFF force field is the most reliable for generating degraded LDPE surfaces which can be next used in standard molecular dynamics involving interaction of nanoplastic with proteins or lipid membranes, for instance. © 2023 The Author(s)"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739517","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6502c0c340970730edc7b7e1","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"230","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"3c8c097f-066b-4352-9424-703792b71e9f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"230","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927025623005165","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a00a6","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Nieszporek","uuid":"CE187BADC1005F63DC0E7BA3B2A4A2BB98F060B4A50222EF56C8FF659D0A0992C8B611C779729E1EE0BD2FD8040D27DC4C32565497829CD1EE13811A4A59FF0E","orcidId":"0000-0002-4132-5499","documentHash":"dbbec7d2-d2a2-48de-9c4d-36dc2e907047"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397d90","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Pańczyk","uuid":"90D6997DB09C17A04ECF3311796BFF9B31C9DE33CFD8FAADE8C740B2683DB8ED48CA084D87E4709CF0C8B066B2A4EA62D9D6FF0DEF796D2453408182F37A534A","orcidId":"0000-0002-5487-119X","documentHash":"fd9d3a6f-ca1a-4fb5-bba9-ca0ea8f7ca09"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.commatsci.2023.112522"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["adsorption","chromium ion","resins","ion exchange","water treatment"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Cr(III) Exchange Mechanism of Macroporous Resins: The Effect of Functionality and Chemical Matrix, and the Statistical Verification of Ion Exchange Data","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479a9a","mniswId":"20224","title":"Water (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":"2073-4441","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f45dfe6a-c51f-4cba-a665-a984d2f35671"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"657043df4097071b8e60c87a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["657043df4097071b8e60c87b","657043df4097071b8e60c87c","657043df4097071b8e60c87d","657043df4097071b8e60c87e","657043df4097071b8e60c87f","657043df4097071b8e60c880","657043df4097071b8e60c881","657043df4097071b8e60c882","657043df4097071b8e60c883","5e7092f5878c28a04739feb2"]},"issue":"20","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>This study focuses on investigating and comparing the influence of the surface functional groups and chemical matrices of macroporous resin on the Cr(III) exchange mechanism. The results discussed herein indicate that sulfonic resin removed Cr(III) ions with faster kinetics than carboxylic resin. Equilibrium was established within 15 and 7 min for the carboxylic and sulfonic resins, respectively, with a 99.5% removal efficiency at 333 K. The Langmuir exchange capacity was observed to be higher for the sulfonic resin (1.5 mmol∙g−1) than the carboxylic resin (0.80 mmol∙g−1) at 333 K. The adsorption isotherms obtained for the carboxylic and sulfonic resins were H and S types, respectively, representing a higher affinity of the carboxylic resin for Cr(III) removal at a low metal ion concentration. Additionally, it was noted that the carboxylic resin preferentially co-sorbed H+ and Cr(OH)2+ ions below Cr(III) concentrations of 6–8 mmol.L−1. The H+ ions co-sorption was almost negligible, whereas the Cr(III) exchange was 87 and 34.5% for the carboxylic acid resin and sulfonic acid resins, respectively. The data of the concentration studies were evaluated using non-linear forms of Freundlich, Langmuir, and Dubinin–Radushkevich adsorption isotherm models, and the kinetic data were analyzed using pseudo-Ist- and pseudo-IIst-order kinetic models. The activation energy Ea for Amberlite IRC-50 (Na+) was greater (22.4 kJ∙mol−1) than that of Amberlyst-15 (Na+) 17 kJ∙mol−1, indicating a higher energy barrier for the ion exchange reaction on carboxylic resin. As per the findings of a statistical error analysis (RMSE and SSE) and absolute average relative distribution (AARD) statistical model, a close agreement between the experimental and theoretical values suggested that the Langmuir isotherm was well-fitted to the current adsorptive investigations. The interaction of the COO− and SO3− functional sites of the resins for the exchange of Cr(III) ions was validated through an FT-IR analysis. The macroporous resins used in the current study for Cr(III) exchange showed promising performances compared to other resins. The current investigations revealed valuable insights for choosing macroporous resins as adsorbents in water filtration

thiol–ene and disulfide–ene photopolymerizations and their utility in materials applications such as shape fixation, photolithography, and holographic recording were explored. Though thiol–ene and disulfide–ene reactions are both radical-mediated and share a common reactive group, the fact that they have several orders of magnitude difference in the reaction rate was utilized to form two-stage photopolymers with high specificity in a sequential and semiorthogonal manner. While the faster thiol–ene reaction was utilized to form a first-stage matrix, the disulfide–ene reaction was then initiated to break cross-links via disulfide cleavage and subsequently form twice as many thioether bonds as new cross-links. As such, sequential bond breakage and formation, enabling the dynamic behavior in the second stage of a single network, were explored and applied in various scenarios. Combining a remarkable difference in mechanical properties between the two stages, the dynamic photopolymer materials were capable of enabling shape fixation by initiating the second-stage polymerization while being strained and deformed. Photolithography was then utilized to quantify shape retention in deformed samples, revealing a fidelity of approximately 95% following the second-stage cure. Additionally, polarized light microscopy was used to understand better how these mechanisms affect the mechanical properties of the material when stress is applied. Finally, taking advantage of the integrated network in the two-stage system, the photopolymers were employed to record a holographic grating with a refractive index modulation (Δn) of 0.0022 and functionally nearly zero haze."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739526","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"56","pagesFromTo":"9778-9786","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.macromol.3c01728","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"659fc23c4097076c144aadce","name":"Christopher N.

Despite continuous efforts, no good agreement between observed waveperiods and theory or numerical simulations was found. Our objective is to investigate the magnetoacoustic cutoff effect in the partially ionized solar atmosphere, factoring in the two-fluid effects. We developed a two-fluid MHD numerical model and used it to simulate a quiet region of the Sun from the top of the convective zone to the low corona. Our findings show that the ongoing granulation excites a wide range of waves propagating into the upper atmospheric layers. The cutoff waveperiods strongly depend on the height. Two-fluid waveperiods obtained with numerical simulations reproduce the recent observations at a very good level of compliance. Furthermore, direct comparison with strongly coupled cases that imitate the single-fluid approximation have shown that the waveperiod propagation pattern is only present in fully two-fluid simulations. We conclude that the presence of neutrals and therefore collisional terms change the dynamics of the magnetized plasma, in comparison with the single-fluid approximation. This effect is more prominently seen in the upper photosphere and chromosphere."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739528","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"382","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rsta.2023.0218","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6645e479409707626368effc","name":"Xueshang","lastName":"Feng","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6e67427f-0c80-4c86-b00e-630f6b6588d1"},{"objectId":"6645e479409707626368effb","name":"D.","lastName":"Yuan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"be2d3af7-25ab-4bc7-844f-58ce17d55888"},{"objectId":"6645e479409707626368effa","name":"Z.

into account the great practical importance of the surface tension of the aqueous solution of multicomponent surfactant mixtures their adsorption at the water-air interface and the composition of the adsorbed monolayer were considered. For this consideration the mixture of the p-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl) phenoxypoly(ethylene glycol) Triton X-165 (TX165) and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) with FC6EO14 as well as with FC5EO10 was applied. The surface tension of the studied solution at the constant CTAB and TX165 binary mixture concentration corresponding to its solution surface tension equal to 60 and 50 mN/m and changing fluorocarbon surfactant concentration was measured. The obtained results were described by the exponential function of the second order and predicted by the modified Fainerman and Miller equation. To solve the Fainerman and Miller equation the fraction of adsorbed mixed monolayer at the water-air interface occupied by particular surfactants was determined. For its determination, the contribution of particular surfactants in the mixture to reduction of water surface tension was taken into account. The fraction occupied by the given surfactant in the mixed monolayer was compared to that determined using the Hua and Rosen equation obtaining good agreement between them. The fraction of the mixed monolayer occupied by a given surfactant was also successfully used to solve the Gibbs and Frumkin equations for determination of surface concentration of a particular surfactant in the mixed monolayer. Based on the isotherms of the surface excess concentration as well as the Hua and Rosen theory the packing of the mixed monolayer and the presence of the synergetic effect in the reduction of water surface tension were deduced. This effect was also reflected in the standard Gibbs free energy of adsorption of surfactant mixtures at the water-air interface. It was found that this energy can be predicted based on this energy for particular surfactants of the mixture and Gibbs free energy of mixing."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739532","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"345","pagesFromTo":"1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167732221025575","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67c6dac1fdbe830b4ec32b33","name":"Bronisław","lastName":"Jańczuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"27c06a11-e6c0-4d3d-97bb-5932bb3ef441"},{"objectId":"5e7092f7878c28a0473a0243","name":"Anna","lastName":"Zdziennicka","uuid":"F8C0DC28A008B8526074A64F1787C03185333C48B4000E5FD1A6942DF4B7B6468C16A5C586FFBB48E47889F1D126B77577A7815C39E0F03728A574086370BD90","orcidId":"0000-0002-7450-8507","documentHash":"642e63d3-5eca-424e-b2d6-f82290568534"},{"objectId":"5e7092f7878c28a0473a023e","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Szymczyk","uuid":"FA29CA85D01DB27BDBD7C4FA49DD6D294B9FF76902DE36E11C1D9770357E61F77BA7DA8D81139D9EB0D10F42405FAC36A61C64C3FD557BE4ABB931FEB2A0F524","orcidId":"0000-0003-1791-2893","documentHash":"e07b37a3-45d5-4cf5-a850-326a5c9d9002"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.molliq.2021.117832"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["aesthetic dentistry","biomechanics","composites","flexural strength","photopolymerization","restorative dentistry."]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a2878c28a0473c0bee","5e7092f5878c28a0473a00c2"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"How the Duration and Mode of Photopolymerization Affect the Mechanical Properties of a Dental Composite Resin","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1944","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"651682444097070ba4d9c0cb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094a2878c28a0473c0bee","5e7092f5878c28a0473a00c2","67c6db28fdbe830b4ec3393a","67c6db28fdbe830b4ec3393b","67c6db28fdbe830b4ec3393c"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:p>Composite materials are the most common materials in use in modern dentistry. Over the years, the methods of photopolymerization of composite materials have been improved with the use of various devices, such as quartz tungsten halogen lamps (QTHs), light-emitting diode units (LEDs), plasma-arc lamps and argon-ion lasers. This study aimed to compare the mechanical properties of a composite material, depending on the time and mode of photopolymerization. One hundred and forty rectangular specimens (25 × 2 × 2 mm) and forty-two disc-shaped samples (5 mm diameter and 2 mm thickness) were prepared from shade A2 Boston composite resin. Samples were cured using the following seven photopolymerization protocols: four fast-cure modes (full power for 3, 5, 10, and 20 s), two pulse-cure modes (5 and 10 shots of 1 s exposures at full power), and one step-cure mode (soft start with a progressive cycle lasting 9 s). Specimens were subjected to a flexural strength test, Vickers microhardness test, and FTIR spectroscopy test. A 2-factor ANOVA and post-hoc tests were carried out to assess the differences in the flexural strength parameter between the tested groups of samples before and after aging. A mixed-model ANOVA was carried out to assess the differences in the Vickers microhardness parameter between the tested groups of samples before and after aging. The lowest values of flexural strength (p &lt; 0.001) and Vickers microhardness (p &lt; 0.001) were obtained for the 3 s mode for the pre- and post-aging groups. The FTIR mapping tests showed a much more homogeneous chemical structure of the composite after 20 s of continuous irradiation, compared to the sample irradiated for 5 s in the continuous mode. The mode and cure time affects the mechanical properties of the composite resin. Appropriate selection of the cure mode and time ensures better mechanical properties of composite resin. This suggests that the survival of dental restorations within the oral cavity could be extended by using longer photopolymerization durations.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739533","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"113","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36614452/#full-view-affiliation-1","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67c6db28fdbe830b4ec3393c","name":"Ingrid

Limonene epoxides are used as monomers to obtain polymers used in various industries. Development of an environmentally friendly and cheap process of chemoenzymatic epoxidation of limonene is important due to the need to replace petroleum-derived polymers. The lyophilized mycelium of psychrophilic Cladosporium cladosporioides 01 has been found to be an efficient biocatalyst for green chemoenzymatic epoxidation of (R)-(+)-limonene in ethyl acetate. The mathematical optimization of the main process variables with RSM methods is described herein. Modelling of the reaction parameters (temperature, H2O2, biocatalyst, substrate concentration and stirring speed) contributed to an approximately 5-fold increase in the efficiency of epoxidation, compared to that of the non-optimized process. After 4 hours at 55 °C without stirring, 99.8% oxidation of limonene to limonene 1,2-epoxide (56.3%), limonene 8,9-epoxide (0.3%) and diepoxide (43.2%) was achieved using 232.7 μl of H2O2, 88 μl of acetic acid, 284 mg of a biocatalyst and 57.6 μl of limonene. Modelling of epoxidation depending on the limonene : biocatalyst ratio was also performed. The time of achievement of the maximum yield of 1,2-epoxide and limonene diepoxide was determined, which makes it possible to design the process rationally to obtain the desired product. For the first time, the profitability of the green biotechnological method of obtaining limonene epoxides with the use of a new biocatalyst was calculated. Using 2.45 grams of (R)-(+)-limonene, the predicted gain for 20 hours of epoxidation is about 223.5 USD, making this process very advantageous for use on an industrial scale."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739538","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2024/GC/D3GC02141F","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"659fc2924097076c144ab2ab","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Świca","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"acbb4d9b-228f-44bf-b187-c073e9343fa5"},{"objectId":"659fc2924097076c144ab2aa","name":"Edward","lastName":"Kozłowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e8a70468-0043-4de6-b415-526f930861e4"},{"objectId":"5e7093de878c28a0473b23ae","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Kutyła","uuid":"FEAB5690018F793E8CF237DDE61E3B5FE5F6C0D2390454FC0205ED911E3E6610A7FA5FF1FF85822FBF5F085F7D3B90FCB3B7426755B47F595ADB07E2321C31FD","orcidId":"0000-0002-1171-897X","documentHash":"bbaea569-646e-4b17-91d3-d51fcfd183a3"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a0063","name":"Marek","lastName":"Stankevič","uuid":"ECC1A8C99A521D17608321F183AEBC3AE2007DEB55AB10D8341BA75A209E5D251F18A09B39A03F335232A160A03B332B711AD78DE4E74AB10BA6EA4AF93CB01D","orcidId":"0000-0003-2917-6774","documentHash":"7087ed1e-079f-45f3-97b0-4ddacaa8792f"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a04739ff63","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Trytek","uuid":"983C9A7864211DC29E5759E944D34935AACA816C03F6DF04FDF108BD24C2E9FB3DFF70971273A59BE068665722B607848B1C87542967E0D23B8C9CBDAD98F91C","orcidId":"0000-0002-4656-7737","documentHash":"59926515-7bdf-4123-ab1e-e0aa53359849"}],"doi":"10.1039/d3gc02141f"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Plasmas","Instabilities","Solar wind"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df71","uid":"bVfQitUiCXefHxSrzVxWFmQ","uuid":"6b4ab5b8-ee21-43a7-a91e-148512c57a44","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Matematyki, Fizyki i Informatyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"About the effects of solar wind suprathermal electrons on electrostatic waves","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547723f","mniswId":"1994","title":"ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE","doi":null,"issn":"0004-640X","eissn":"1572-946X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b3f0c5f5-25c4-41a3-a449-564abf1d406c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6364e5924097070e8727d516","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6364e5924097070e8727d518","6364e5924097070e8727d519","6364e5924097070e8727d51a","6325312975234038513dfa2b"]},"issue":"10","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Electrostatic (ES) waves generated in space plasmas, e.g., Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves, are subject to multiple applications, such as plasma diagnosis, generation of radio emissions, and the acceleration and heating of resonant populations. The dispersion properties of these waves are well known for idealized plasmas, i.e., with Maxwellian distributions, but in the solar wind and terrestrial magnetosphere plasma particles exhibit Kappa distributions with high energy tails enhanced by suprathermal populations. This paper proposes a realistic analysis of these populations and their influence on ES waves, which often is hindered by a misinterpretation of Kappa distributions. Of particular importance in the analysis of ES waves is the Debye wavelength, the correct derivation of which shows, as expected, an increase (and not a decrease) in the presence of suprathermal electrons. Based on these new evaluations, we show how the suprathermal electrons selfconsistently modify the properties of ES waves. For Langmuir waves, the positive slope of the frequency increase with the wave-number is markedly enhanced, involving more resonant particles from the high-energy tails, and thus leading to enhanced damping rates. In contrast, ion-acoustic waves are supported by suprathermal electrons, which increase the kinetic energy contrast between electrons and protons, and thus reduce the damping rate of ion-acoustic waves. Obviously, suprathermal protons do not affect Langmuir waves, but inhibit ion-acoustic modes. The present results provide both the methodology and the theoretical tools necessary to understand the physical processes involving these waves in non-ideal plasmas from space."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739542","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6364e5924097070e8727d517","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"367","number":"10","doi":null,"documentHash":"ba00e57a-789b-4e6c-af41-299adde43029"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"367","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10509-022-04116-8.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6364e5924097070e8727d51a","name":"R.

The two best-performing materials were found titanate nanotubes and nanocores of anatase surrounded by amorphous titanium hydroxide phase. The results obtained by scavenger tests on top of the DFT calculations led us to conclude that various reactions and active species are responsible by a complex way for materials’ photoreactivity.

The novel aspect of this research is a comprehen- sive approach presenting a new curing agent for the CR/BR blends to increase their cross-linking density and final properties, including non-flammability and low fire hazard. This is due to the need to find an alternative to zinc oxide, which is the standard curing agent for chloroprene rubber. The regulations of the European Union enforce a significant limitation on the use of this compound in elastomer technology, due to its harmful effect on aquatic organisms. In this paper, the CR/BR composites were cured with zinc and filled with natural silica fillers (sillitin or chalcedonite) or synthetic silica filler (aerosil). The investigation focused on the morphology characterization of the obtained compounds, their cross-linking degree, swelling, mechanical and dynamic properties, fire hazard and toxicity. The structure of cured CR/BR blends was characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The fire resistance studies were performed using cone calorimetry or oxygen index methods, whereas toxicity tests were performed with the use of the FB-FTIR (fluidized bed reactor coupled with FTIR analyzer) method. The results showed that obtained CR/BR products were characterized by satisfactory final properties. The properties determined by the oxygen index and cone calorimetry methods, including the behaviors of the tested CR/BR vulcanizates in fire conditions, showed that the produced compounds were characterized by a low fire hazard and can be classified as non-combustible rubber products. However, the toxicity of the decomposition products, determined at 450, 550 and 750 °C, was very high."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739552","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"[1-19]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/3/1240","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6783f400fdbe831a38f9026a","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Rybiński","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8aadb539-2c2a-4bab-98ff-fd70100657d0"},{"objectId":"6783f400fdbe831a38f90269","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Smejda-Krzewicka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"254fda24-c4be-4ef7-b792-4712032ffe19"},{"objectId":"5e70939a878c28a0473ad92b","name":"Witold","lastName":"Żukowski","uuid":"C5612A628521DDDAC713A318C46D2EBF797E1C6ECA9452862CF6986001953563B8D77FC9749F4D35AECEF592487A390E07A4300D6249DB79805A24F912C57BCD","orcidId":"0000-0002-1898-1236","documentHash":"d223a36b-13f9-4089-8187-4ce99fbb7eda"},{"objectId":"5e7092c5878c28a04739c56e","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Bradło","uuid":"E154B96A8CD4BDB5A5B35ECBCC501A8D85B21B157541A5706012B73B5715F2420018328DE2B5E20B78DEB57AF284B38CFD13863AF7D99E2F2CCE977505EF1DB1","orcidId":"0000-0002-8085-799X","documentHash":"31dced1c-4843-4ea7-99eb-48a64a3f8316"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma16031240"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs)","Sun: corona","solar wind","Sun: magnetic fields","methods: numerical","magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df71","uid":"bVfQitUiCXefHxSrzVxWFmQ","uuid":"6b4ab5b8-ee21-43a7-a91e-148512c57a44","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Matematyki, Fizyki i Informatyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Self-consistent propagation of flux ropes in realistic coronal simulations","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477233","mniswId":"1982","title":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","doi":null,"issn":"0004-6361","eissn":"1432-0746","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f677d31f-f33f-4fa2-b4f3-7cca75d47be5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-04-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65a1049d4097076c145012fb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65a1049d4097076c145012fc","65a1049d4097076c145012fd","65a1049d4097076c145012fe","65a1049d4097076c145012ff","65a1049d4097076c14501300","65a1049d4097076c14501301","6325312975234038513dfa2b","65a1049d4097076c14501302"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the possible use of the new coronal model COCONUT to compute a detailed representation of a numerical CME at 0.1~AU, after its injection at the solar surface and propagation in a realistic solar wind, as derived from observed magnetograms. We present the implementation and propagation of modified Titov-Démoulin (TDm) flux ropes in the COCONUT 3D MHD coronal model. The background solar wind is reconstructed in order to model two opposite configurations representing a solar activity maximum and minimum respectively. Both were derived from magnetograms which were obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) satellite. We track the propagation of 24 flux ropes, which differ only by their initial magnetic flux. We especially investigate the geometry of the flux rope during the early stages of the propagation as well as the influence of its initial parameters and solar wind configuration on 1D profiles derived at 0.1~AU. At the beginning of the propagation, the shape of the flux ropes varies between simulations during low and high solar activity. We find dynamics that are consistent with the standard CME model, such as the pinching of the legs and the appearance of post-flare loops. Despite the differences in geometry, the synthetic density and magnetic field time profiles at 0.1~AU are very similar in both solar wind configurations. These profiles are similar to those observed further in the heliosphere and suggest the presence of a magnetic ejecta composed of the initially implemented flux rope and a sheath ahead of it. Finally, we uncover relationships between the properties of the magnetic ejecta, such as density or speed and the initial magnetic flux of our flux ropes.

Phosphor-derivative-modified diatomite adsorbents were synthesized by the three-route procedures: polymerisation (DIT-Vin-PAin), covalent (DIT-Vin-PAcov), and non-covalent (DIT-PA) immobilization of the functional groups. The effects of the diatomite modification have been studied using powder XRD, solid state NMR, FTIR spectroscopy, electronic microscopy, EDX, acid–base titrations, etc. The maximum adsorption capacities of DIT-Vin-PAcov, DIT-PA, and DIT-Vin-PAin samples were 294.3 mg/g, 253.8 mg/g, and 315.9 mg/g, respectively, at pH0 = 9.0. The adsorption amount of U(VI) ions using the prepared DIT-Vin-PAin was 95.63%, which is higher compared with that of the natural diatomite at the same concentration. The adsorption studies demonstrated that the phosphonic and hydroxyl groups on the surface of the diatomite played pivotal roles in the U(VI) adsorption. The U(VI) ions as a “hard” Lewis acid could easily form bonds with the “hard” donor P-containing ligands, so that the as-prepared DIT-Vin-PAin sample had excellent adsorption properties. The monolayer adsorption of the analyte on the surface of the raw diatomite and DIT-PA was observed. It was found from the thermodynamic parameters that the uptake of the U(VI) ions by the obtained adsorbents was a spontaneous process with an endothermic effect. Findings of the present work highlight the potential for using modified diatomite as effective and reusable adsorbents for the extraction of U(VI) in the waste, river, and tap waters with satisfactory results.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739558","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"5263","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/16/15/5263","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"659fc24b4097076c144aae9b","name":"Valentyn A.","lastName":"Tertykh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4cc1bb35-d9fe-4546-ab07-79b35ee89a20"},{"objectId":"659fc24b4097076c144aae9a","name":"Oksana","lastName":"Dudarko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4ddf4f0c-499a-4d0e-ba6b-e3483e7fb748"},{"objectId":"659fc24b4097076c144aae99","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Kobylinska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"92089fab-d762-4f47-836b-7a9e9d33bfbb"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a04739feb3","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Gładysz-Płaska","uuid":"AC94B515E131EEC1071959646C04D037097D8B21B585DE2EF734099E53E31967BC295BB65E4E78C52F9944D6A0D282F00D4A4F8487003E14DA966CC8F3A6E53E","orcidId":"0000-0002-0560-4925","documentHash":"0ef932aa-ff0c-4d52-bc77-e09afdcbb53e"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a04739feae","name":"Marek","lastName":"Majdan","uuid":"8FE8A04F71ADAFA27466123DF8CD258E3C94B3FACE19E74D37A0AE988ED5C17A73B77E407191ECBBBF179A53FA9A9B5774772EFD06C486F223AB9184428148FB","orcidId":"0000-0003-3498-9526","documentHash":"8318702c-13be-4e6f-a959-147e40184891"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma16155263"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cognitive linguistics"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dc86","uid":"b53mJQrrydfOeTNm01VB6ZQ","uuid":"7da28615-12f7-408a-8cc0-b1bc42b85990","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Orientalistyczny","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709355878c28a0473a7869","5e709359878c28a0473a7cda"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Derivation and semantic autonomy: A corpus study of Polish <i>głowa</i> “head” and its diminutive <i>główka</i>","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781bf","mniswId":"8769","title":"International Journal of Corpus Linguistics","doi":null,"issn":"1384-6655","eissn":"1569-9811","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"160336fd-9681-4bcb-9adb-1ff216b5ece3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-21","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64dcaf5740970718870844e0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709355878c28a0473a7869","5e709359878c28a0473a7cda"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article focuses on the polysemy and usage patterns of the Polish lexeme głowa “head” and its diminutive główka.

Analytical parameters of the procedures presented in the paper are collected in tables. The subsequent chapters are devoted to a detailed discussion of potential inorganic and organic interfering factors. The possibilities of simultaneous determination of several lanthanides in one sample and the influence of other lanthanides on the determined rare earth element were also discussed. Finally, the applications of the voltammetric procedures to the determination of rare earth metals in real samples with miscellaneous matrix is described. All analytical results were tabulated in order to compare the analytical suitability of the proposed procedures.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739563","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"28","pagesFromTo":"1-29","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/28/23/7755","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"659fc1a94097076c144aa75f","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Wlazlowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1d9524b0-e81e-4ea3-8ad8-173dd3e44fc9"},{"objectId":"5e7093de878c28a0473b23b9","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Fiałek","uuid":"B0C36011873C531DA2E4BFDEDAD9BEB2EA0D85B3BAFDC3A2068A80774838F7480C3027CB846B851E8202EC2BA7DE68DF81DACDC376EB59C90D5BA9BC9D7CEED3","orcidId":"0000-0002-7567-9199","documentHash":"7d84abb5-a201-4d71-a811-67256a1208a2"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a0473a0091","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Grabarczyk","uuid":"B24CA952A822B53951AFA8FB42C4AAAA19C20217D30BF175CB1E27B117BD67A558DBEB2697443412DDCA9B076AF269484D2A19009FEE5C2DFAC78A6079BE7DF1","orcidId":"0000-0002-0952-050X","documentHash":"f05882f9-1693-420a-8371-c9cbefccea17"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules28237755"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df71","uid":"bVfQitUiCXefHxSrzVxWFmQ","uuid":"6b4ab5b8-ee21-43a7-a91e-148512c57a44","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Matematyki, Fizyki i Informatyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6325312975234038513dfa2b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Interplay between Anisotropy- and Skewness-driven Whistler Instabilities in the Solar Wind under the Core–Strahlo Model","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547723b","mniswId":"1990","title":"Astrophysical Journal","doi":null,"issn":"0004-637X","eissn":"1538-4357","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b6dd4b52-08ee-4b62-b195-3b6207fef891"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-09-06","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"657c50e44097076c14aa65b8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6325312975234038513dfa2b","65a11bf54097076c14504183","65a11bf54097076c14504184","65a11bf54097076c14504185","65a11bf54097076c14504186"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Temperature anisotropy and field-aligned skewness are commonly observed nonthermal features in electron\r\nvelocity distributions in the solar wind. These characteristics can act as a source of free energy to destabilize different electromagnetic wave modes, which may alter the plasma state through wave–particle interactions.\r\nPrevious theoretical studies have mainly focused on analyzing these nonthermal features and self-generated\r\ninstabilities individually. However, to obtain a more accurate and realistic understanding of the kinetic processes in the solar wind, it is necessary to examine the interplay between these two energy sources. By means of linear kinetic theory, in this paper we investigate the excitation of the parallel propagating whistler mode, when it is destabilized by electron populations exhibiting both temperature anisotropy and field-aligned strahl or skewness.\r\nTo describe the solar wind electrons, we adopt the core–strahlo model as an alternative approach. This model offers\r\nthe advantage of representing the suprathermal features of halo and strahl electrons, using a single skew–kappa\r\ndistribution already known as the strahlo population. Our findings show that when the electron strahlo exhibits an\r\nintrinsic temperature anisotropy, this suprathermal population becomes a stronger and more efficient source of free energy for destabilizing the whistler mode. This suggests the greater involvement of the anisotropic strahlo in processes conditioned by wave–particle interactions. The present results also suggest that the contribution of core\r\nanisotropy can be safely disregarded when assessing the importance of instabilities driven by the suprathermal\r\npopulation. This allows for a focused study, particularly regarding the regulation of the electron heat flux in the\r\nsolar wind.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739564","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"954","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ace973/meta","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65a11bf54097076c14504186","name":"Adolfo F.","lastName":"Viñas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2c1efd1c-06d6-4a07-b49d-c2694b070e26"},{"objectId":"65a11bf54097076c14504185","name":"Marian","lastName":"Lazar ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0a1a2f66-9fb5-48ff-b0a9-cca2c68c0d1f"},{"objectId":"65a11bf54097076c14504184","name":"Pablo S.","lastName":"Moya","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"123dfaa3-98e6-4e6b-a9d3-3ca636592b5b"},{"objectId":"65a11bf54097076c14504183","name":"Bea","lastName":"Zenteno-Quinteros","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"abb1334d-57ed-4f9e-a4e2-5858d76c2f09"},{"objectId":"6325312975234038513dfa2b","name":"Stefaan","lastName":"Poedts","uuid":"E30515B6831744043DFF6116308CAADF77B5F0C972E5A368DB49146E9779BB06976217A98AF4D837221C3ED8E97238836204CBB8C77804B509343F88AD17DDF9","orcidId":"0000-0002-1743-0651","documentHash":"c635d010-d0a5-4637-8a13-98fc1c24e343"}],"doi":"10.3847/1538-4357/ace973"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"662676404097071fab4ec435","doi":null,"title":"Żydzi w kulturze muzycznej Galicji, t. 2, Galicja - pamięć i przeszłość","year":2023,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-8277-135-0","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://katalogi.bn.org.pl/permalink/48OMNIS_NLOP/1aot9i7/alma9913706346105606","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"97696743-afcb-43ca-8be7-defa283dfbfa","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb905","mniswId":"61200","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","documentHash":"0910bc42-8a05-4bbf-9592-67ba04fce425"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","uid":"bBJgJA3sajKPZSP7n_sxiEw","uuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","parentUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de23","rootUuid":"50d13b6e-9320-4240-898f-6aca15728a1f","name":"Uniwersytet Rzeszowski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709228878c28a047390da5"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Amalia Kasprowicz- mistrzyni dyskretnego komizmu","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"66267eab4097071fab4f4b16","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709228878c28a047390da5"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060739566","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"27- 48","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://katalogi.bn.org.pl/permalink/48OMNIS_NLOP/1aot9i7/alma9913706346105606","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709228878c28a047390da5","name":"Jolanta","lastName":"Wąsacz-Krztoń","uuid":"1CB83DBDC22B0444E7A0A97A54144D4FA90269F7FDD81A25FEFD5287C691ADCB10778DC0C1BBB0448833188789EADD18BFBFFAE63B9F40DA0D924C614E717F2E","orcidId":"0000-0001-6487-8291","documentHash":"3ab28b2b-0afb-43ae-82dd-3747a79a45f2"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Increased concentration of PAH derivatives in biochar-amended soil observed in a long-term experiment","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547874d","mniswId":"11283","title":"Journal of Hazardous Materials","doi":null,"issn":"0304-3894","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"35b1142c-1a06-4ac0-a9e2-0d7d9a6b8059"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"659fc23f4097076c144aade1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["659fc23f4097076c144aade2","5e7092f5878c28a0473a007b","5e709349878c28a0473a6698","5e709227878c28a047390aff","5e7092f5878c28a0473a00c3"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"During biochar preparation or application some toxic substances may be formed.

Constructing the relevant magnetic field lines from active region modelling data is crucial to understanding the underlying instability mechanisms that trigger the corresponding eruptions.\r\n\r\nAims. We present a magnetic flux rope (FR) extraction tool for solar coronal magnetic field modelling data that builds upon a recent methodology. The newly developed method is then compared against its previous iteration. Furthermore, we apply the scheme to magnetic field simulations of active regions AR12473 (similar to our previous study) and AR11176. We compare the method to its predecessor and study the 3D movement of the newly extracted FRs up to heights of 200 and 300 Mm, respectively.\r\n\r\nMethods.The extraction method is based on the twist parameter Tw and a variety of mathematical morphology (MM) algorithms, including the opening transform and the morphological gradient. We highlight the differences between the methods by investigating the circularity of the FRs in the plane we extract from. The simulations for the active regions are carried out with a time-dependent data-driven magnetofrictional model (TMFM). We investigate the FR trajectories by tracking their apex throughout the full simulation time span.\r\n\r\nResults. Comparing the newly developed method to the previous extraction scheme, we demonstrate that this upgrade provides the user with more tools and less a priori assumptions about the FR shape, which in turn leads to a more accurate set of field lines. Despite some differences, both the newly extracted FR of AR12473 and the FR derived with the old iteration of the method show a similar general appearance, confirming that the two methods indeed extract the same structure. The methods differ the most in their emergence and formation stages, where the newly extracted FR deviates significantly from a perfectly circular cross-section (which was the basic assumption of the initial method). The propagation analysis yields that the erupting FR from AR12473 indeed shows stronger dynamics than the AR11176 FR and a significant deflection during its ascent through the domain. The modelling results are also verified with observations: AR12473 is dynamic and eruptive, while AR11176 only features an eruption outside of our simulation time window.\r\n\r\nConclusions. We implemented a FR extraction method, incorporating mathematical morphology algorithms for 3D solar magnetic field simulations of active region FRs. This scheme was applied to AR12473 and AR11176. We find that the clearly eruptive FR of AR12473 experiences significant deflection during its rise. The AR11176 FR appears more stable, though there is still a notable deflection. This confirms that at these low coronal heights, FRs undergo significant changes in the direction of their propagation even for less dynamic cases."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739571","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"683","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2024/03/aa48113-23/aa48113-23.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e8648f4097076263147aaa","name":"R.","lastName":"Gafeira","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c227c7c4-3c0c-49d7-9e04-3b6e2d0c6798"},{"objectId":"65e8648f4097076263147aa9","name":"O.","lastName":"Oliveira","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"52562c37-ad74-4fd7-a073-ab52f5baafe8"},{"objectId":"65e8648f4097076263147aa8","name":"R.","lastName":"Erdélyi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e8794e6c-8ae9-48cd-9ae3-0847e84126dd"},{"objectId":"65e8648f4097076263147aa7","name":"T.","lastName":"Barata","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"26045218-0b82-4132-8711-65216bf16528"},{"objectId":"65e8648f4097076263147aa6","name":"J.","lastName":"Pomoell","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"afd05501-9a00-4139-8029-3146aee8d95a"},{"objectId":"65e8648f4097076263147aa5","name":"A.","lastName":"Kumari","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"55b56b9f-720f-48b6-8239-13c0ef7c6d70"},{"objectId":"65e8648f4097076263147aa4","name":"D.J.","lastName":"Price","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ddd5013c-4a27-471e-a8a1-f790b7501013"},{"objectId":"65e8648f4097076263147aa3","name":" Ranadeep","lastName":"Sarkar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a10bbf46-6fa8-4fc9-ae0e-c2fb53cdd9e8"},{"objectId":"65e8648f4097076263147aa2","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Kilpua","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3f61ee98-a389-4b56-9ca7-5681762c6941"},{"objectId":"65e8648f4097076263147aa1","name":"S.

The purpose of this work was to verify the CSM ability to cross-link with iron(II,III) oxide (Fe3O4) and to produce flame retardant materials. During the first series of tests, three types of CSM were used, differing in the content of bound chlorine (29–43%). The results showed that the CSM with 43% bound chlorine (Hypalon 30, CSM43) was the most advantageous type of chlorosulfonated polyethylene in terms of its properties. It exhibited a short vulcanization time, a high degree of cross-linking, and very good mechanical properties. In the next stage, the CSM composites with various fillers (talc, arsil, kaolin, chalcedonite, or carbon black) were prepared, because filled rubber materials are of the greatest practical importance. The cross-linking kinetics, equilibrium swelling, mechanical and dynamic properties as well as flammability were studied. It was found that the addition of fillers led to a decrease in the degree of cross-linking, an increase in the vulcanization time (in the case of talc, arsil, or kaolin), an increase in the overall mechanical strength (in the case of carbon black, arsil or talc). All filled vulcanizates proved to be non-flammable, as the specific oxygen index value exceeded 37.5%. © 2022 by the

the present study, the diffusion of magnesium in gallium nitride was investigated. In order to ensure high structural quality and purity of the analyzed material, bulk crystals, grown by Halide Vapor Phase Epitaxy on ammonothermal native seeds, were used. Samples of polarity (0001), (10-10) and (11–20) were prepared from them and implanted with magnesium ions with fluence of 1 × 1016 cm−2 and 230 keV energy. X-ray diffraction was used to assess the structural quality of the samples at each stage of the study. Ultra-high-pressure annealing was carried out in the temperature range of 1250–1450 °C to activate the dopant and remove post-implantation damage. Diffusion of the implanted species was a consequence of the annealing process. Secondary ion mass spectrometry was used to assess the in-depth concentration of magnesium in the annealed samples. Strong diffusion anisotropy was observed for the crystallographic directions analyzed, with [000–1] being the most susceptible to diffusion and [10-10] being the most resistant. Using the finite element method for numerical analysis of the measured profiles, the diffusion coefficients were determined. Substitutional diffusion involving gallium vacancies was found to be the dominant mechanism in the analyzed samples. The temperature-independent diffusion coefficient was calculated. Its value was 1.7 × 10−4 cm2/s for the [0001] direction and one order of magnitude less for non-polar directions. The activation energy was similar for all cases studied and ranged from 2.26 eV to 2.38 eV."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739589","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65ad42384097072172c1fbbf","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"171","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"2ed0d7f7-1ae3-41e7-afe9-6c62eee284d5"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"171","pagesFromTo":"108022","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369800123007151","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"66e25228ece3980cc87d9e45","name":"Arianna","lastName":"Jaroszyńska","uuid":"24CA45F36608CE27AB7518191B501995B3E65F52F8E80D97128CCA7EAA5F24FD033E9DB4D2B5F2E103D4F12142126045ED7806617402E80846D53CD5979CDAF4","orcidId":"0000-0002-6753-095X","documentHash":"a6d55433-3cdc-40c2-b69b-a8681f672449"},{"objectId":"65aa74444097071977e4c6fe","name":"Katharina","lastName":"Lorenz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d3e7d970-30fd-4234-bdbc-589b981f8989"},{"objectId":"5ffd5482085dcb6be6b60aad","name":"Kacper","lastName":"Sierakowski","uuid":"810B8E2D3914D3769951AF32282697540FE3E3E145221ECC7CD8BD4129D609CD107025D0B5A66E66EC2634138301B221E1C2B797B6EB99E1857587D6B603B067","orcidId":"0000-0002-9447-1182","documentHash":"90d71694-610e-4588-a91d-32144ad892ca"},{"objectId":"5e7094ad878c28a0473c1749","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Jakieła","uuid":"4312580C0D99AA655A5E9F1A5754C38568BB830071E6F06886D0EB8128F44D4E22C6B41915112E9E7AEB07093BE121A5C05C37E62784AABEFF81CF59FEE06EDF","orcidId":"0000-0002-4984-1519","documentHash":"46b78764-90d7-4283-890d-e2e53be77f69"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473beaba","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Iwińska","uuid":"72AC5066C16851CB54B256DA3CC808116D85F98520CC6062D3DA06938911DEF4745CA0F0F42B0222783DA63391E92B7E5F9503884E22DC86D9E5D1121308CF9C","orcidId":"0000-0002-9138-6724","documentHash":"98442c0d-a652-486c-9f1d-528220a75eeb"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473beab9","name":"Michał","lastName":"Fijałkowski","uuid":"09726801C479B7F258311564FFA23D20B2506C3BEC029AA32D25E5A6DB4A58B6F21854DC37194628D678D8C30986AA9B80B09C62796E81DEC5217CB3E7A9838E","orcidId":"0000-0002-1237-3942","documentHash":"54866a54-c5a5-4411-8267-4df03542d8f1"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473bea6d","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Sochacki","uuid":"7303B29677B6FFFEEE827B637EAE14071D04A7C79FD9218D6D3C32115F9D575E22DA5445FE57B79249C0BC9EBA49D4A157E359F79FC777E599D4CB1B4A0A923D","orcidId":"0000-0001-7112-341X","documentHash":"ebcb523b-c4b4-41c1-9d76-b12623cf4734"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5989","name":"Michał","lastName":"Boćkowski","uuid":"18E0485511ABDB0D41DB7F6F59E9E4626BB139E8F890BB7F1D72DE93FF779111D716976B750D1B02005018F23E408247F07044DC9DD6FE84870F35A167D66175","orcidId":"0000-0003-1616-685X","documentHash":"6f2bcbbc-7ec5-4a12-aa2e-323154ef506b"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a04739ffa0","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Turek","uuid":"A13A5FEF6C711E01E53C4D81EC226883A79F4D658BE801E04C0E7CC43F2D2EA2537D32E77E8AB241EBFCD2CCA32557E8FBD01F059506E29563DF810B63D674AD","orcidId":"0000-0001-8577-6032","documentHash":"00f8d1c7-e8cf-4cb7-9960-0713096dc287"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.mssp.2023.108022"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["slide burnishing","X6CrNiTi18 stainless steel","surface roughness 3D","topography","microhardness","residual stress","positron mean lifetime"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Influence of Slide Burnishing Parameters on the Surface Layer Properties of Stainless Steel and Mean Positron Lifetime","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1944","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-16","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63b56ffb4097076e4798b9ae","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f7878c28a0473a0202","5e70945e878c28a0473bba16","640736db40970770355d433b","640736db40970770355d433c","640736db40970770355d433d","640736db40970770355d433e"]},"issue":"22","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents the results of an experimental study on the impact of slide burnishing on surface roughness parameters (Sa, Sz, Sp, Sv, Ssk, and Sku), topography, surface layer microhardness, residual stress, and mean positron lifetime (τmean).

Instead, clinicians rely on brief pro-\r\ncedure notes and still frames to manage bladder pathology. Preserving discarded data via 3D reconstructions, which are convenient to review, has the potential to improve patient care. However, many clinical videos are collected by fiberscopes, which are lower cost but induce a pattern on frames that inhibit 3D reconstruction. The aim of our study is to remove the honeycomb-like pattern present in fiberscope-based cystoscopy videos to improve the quality of 3D bladder reconstructions.\r\n\r\nApproach: Our study introduces an algorithm that applies a notch filtering mask in the Fourier domain to remove the honeycomb-like pattern from clinical cystoscopy\r\nvideos collected by fiberscope as a preprocessing step to 3D reconstruction. We produce 3D reconstructions with the video before and after removing the pattern, which we compare with a metric termed the area of reconstruction coverage (ARC), defined as the surface area (in pixels) of the reconstructed bladder. All statistical analyses use paired t -tests.\r\n\r\nResults: Preprocessing using our method for pattern removal enabled reconstruction for all (n ¼ 5) cystoscopy videos included in the study and produced a statistically significant increase in bladder coverage (p ¼ 0.018).\r\n\r\nConclusions: This algorithm for pattern removal increases bladder coverage in 3D reconstructions and automates mask generation and application, which could aid\r\nimplementation in time-starved clinical environments. The creation and use of 3D reconstructions can improve documentation of cystoscopic findings for future surgical navigation, thus improving patient treatment and outcomes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739593","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-medical-imaging/volume-11/issue-03/034002/Fiberscopic-pattern-removal-for-optimal-coverage-in-3D-bladder-reconstructions/10.1117/1.JMI.11.3.034002.full#_=_","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"66ffdcf3fdbe831eab76cac6","name":"Audrey K.","lastName":"Bowden","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"05ca5402-ff46-48c2-a92a-a990a8361ac3"},{"objectId":"66ffdcf3fdbe831eab76cac5","name":"Kristen R.","lastName":"Scarpato","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"43df5cce-c56c-405d-852b-899fa3c15363"},{"objectId":"66ffdcf3fdbe831eab76cac4","name":"Rachel","lastName":"Eimen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a2e6c446-6bf7-4adb-b990-bc92aaef7782"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a04739ff9f","name":"Halina","lastName":"Krzyżanowska","uuid":"84C8722442E4A069B2230DB03E4DB3CFEFB76B1CE40DAA415550A159B647A6D326959ADABC7B0BA401582D91DA5D8362FB5DF9194FD32CECB27711A8F959D288","orcidId":"0000-0003-1006-3868","documentHash":"e3d16f57-2935-4b2b-b329-5f9345d70b6d"}],"doi":"10.1117/1.jmi.11.3.034002"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Clostridioides difficile infection in patients after organ transplantation -

We demonstrate that for quenches where the initial and final Hamiltonian belong to different phases always result in DQPTs, irrespective of the intermediate quench and dynamics or the time of the second quench. However, if the initial and final Hamiltonian belong to the same equilibrium phase then the intermediate Hamiltonian must belong to a different phase. In this case, the second quench time in relation to the critical times of the first quench becomes crucial to the existence of DQPTs."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739596","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"25","pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ad016e","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65b3a09840970719779ace8e","name":"Hadi","lastName":"Cheraghi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4c614571-9049-4c1d-80cd-13955f73880b"},{"objectId":"5e7094e0878c28a0473c5d7a","name":"Nicholas","lastName":"Sedlmayr","uuid":"ED7E07F043D312185C176EE0F4B3679C8429E3DA6157D38F338E9C403BD12AC5FE6B6A9B1F835A9FAC3E0C9548C8261A36F2B0F83869AD848518BA4103533D97","orcidId":"0000-0002-8166-7485","documentHash":"64ad43bb-8772-4e5b-9ea7-d904e73a4504"}],"doi":"10.1088/1367-2630/ad016e"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62c572654097074de2275f6d","doi":null,"title":"Nauka i przemysł – metody spektroskopowe w praktyce, nowe wyzwania i możliwości","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-227-9602-3","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/146-w9xvVY8efa_EDHVp21FGfJW2aTvDN","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"b8197b6f-caef-4990-9f05-bcf5fc5303ed","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb8f4","mniswId":"59500","name":"Uniwersytet Marii Curie-Skłodowskiej w Lublinie","documentHash":"d938889a-f872-4771-bf34-8062ee136ee9"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6d","uid":"bt1ISJYriBkZV3APeT1aIeg","uuid":"c94ad5bf-1260-4eb8-b89a-f23fe688dc8c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f8878c28a0473a02eb"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Wpływ pH na kinetykę i równowagę procesu adsorpcji herbicydów na węglu aktywnym","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6454aba34097076a7ad6e288","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f8878c28a0473a02eb"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747060739597","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"416-419","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://bazawiedzy.umcs.pl/info/article/UMCSa7e881f280d240a5b8b8d9d7635918ea/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092f8878c28a0473a02eb","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Błachnio","uuid":"9E695AD6887C15E10A5BC7B76856E3747B78EC3C83F8AFDE38815EEB6CEC9580FF23DA1D2BF02240DF032CFC8DB1C9D36C4DF0C97BCE5309FB6C63EF9771E0E0","orcidId":"0000-0002-6281-9084","documentHash":"ced6f953-45ba-4712-ba96-3cfb334ed7e8"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["calcium phosphate-based pellets","sprinkle formulations","MUPS","rosuvastatin calcium"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Use of Calcium Phosphate-Based Starter Pellets for the Preparation of Sprinkle IR MUPS Formulation of Rosuvastatin Calcium","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceed","mniswId":"15947","title":"Pharmaceuticals","doi":null,"issn":"1424-8247","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"56669e7d-d4d7-4326-aa65-87a9099a9b18"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-06","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"659fc2534097076c144aaf1d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65cb323d409707626357bbbe","65cb323d409707626357bbbf","65cb323d409707626357bbc0","65cb323d409707626357bbc1","65cb323d409707626357bbc2","5e7092ee878c28a04739f55c","65cb323d409707626357bbc3","65cb323d409707626357bbc4","65cb323d409707626357bbc5","65cb323d409707626357bbc6","65cb323d409707626357bbc7"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Sprinkle formulations represent an interesting concept of medicinal products aimed at the steadily growing population of patients suffering from swallowing difficulties (dysphagia).

Phenothiazine-based metal-free organic dyes having highmolar extinction coefficient values and compatible HOMO−LUMO levels have the potential to replace dyes based on rareearth metals. A series of simple donor−acceptor phenothiazinedyes, differing in anchoring unit structure and N-alkyl chain length,were synthesized, characterized, and tested in dye-sensitized solarcells. Additionally, the effect of TiO2 layer thickness on thephotovoltaic response of fabricated cells was analyzed. Thethermal, optical, and electrochemical properties of the synthesizeddyes with cyanoacrylic acid or ethyl 2-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl) acetatewere investigated using DSC, UV−vis, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and cyclic and differential pulse voltammetry, respectively.Based on density functional theory, the frontier molecular orbital structures and energy levels as well as the adsorption energy of thedyes on the TiO2 surface and its size were estimated. The selected dye was applied with N719 for the preparation of tandem dye-sensitized solar cells. The effects of both anchoring unit and N-alkyl chain length as well as TiO2 thickness on device performancewere demonstrated. The devices with TiO2 layer thickness of about 9 μm, sensitized with the PTZ dyes bearing cyanoacryclic acidanchoring unit, showed better photovoltaic performance. The modification of device structure involved utilization of 2-cyano-3-(10-ethyl-10H-phenothiazin-3-yl)acrylic acid (PEC) dye, blocking layer, and coadsorbent (CDCA), and the fabrication of tandemDSSCs resulted in an increase of photovoltaic efficiency to 7.34% as compared to simple (before modification) DSSCs with powerconversion value of 3.73%."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739603","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67446d22fdbe832ec1ef5649","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"63","number":"46","doi":null,"documentHash":"f0fff4d5-4851-451a-b330-8aa272bfc0f4"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"63","pagesFromTo":"19994-20008","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.iecr.4c02229","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67446d22fdbe832ec1ef564c","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Schab-Balcerzak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5421c1a8-dca2-4ead-852b-37c2b0baf0bc"},{"objectId":"67446d22fdbe832ec1ef564b","name":"Sonia","lastName":"Kotowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aaeaf2f3-4d2a-4be0-ac98-5073b0daba4e"},{"objectId":"67446d22fdbe832ec1ef564a","name":"Jan Grzegorz","lastName":"Małecki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fc812b99-d11f-4d5c-a760-f1c7e6a8f00c"},{"objectId":"625635a87523402df0a0ac69","name":"Muhammad","lastName":"Amin","uuid":"EFBE3A804075ACE2EF501D375905C25F9D5667D0EFD41234F9463E5ECA6236F8F1CD4A98E6CE9E032DBC6AFF9599A1765DA1A8A70CD971EDB06EB39ACA91EEF5","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7341bd50-2b8c-44fe-b732-0c2943f619c7"},{"objectId":"602b760d9543c7410626dd7b","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Pająk","uuid":"FAA4DC81C231DD183D1D20305AA3EEFC7E34C5B25E81314B1908A5FE5C1EA34CF7E23A8620B933BDA811B235728AE2A991D88F10BAD5BE74B5E0D59ECE55FF8D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f82f92c6-fb2b-4484-ab22-c437a29fc84d"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473bea73","name":"Mariola","lastName":"Siwy","uuid":"9E75D24BB89D92A73EF36FB91C4A5EA99CD208058AC3F21F40B021ADD7E504F44C54B6F5B86891F1B2F0D6351A17453DCFDD1D621271AE9E0C23336FCE42A45D","orcidId":"0000-0002-4341-1315","documentHash":"af9c7a11-e70d-4b16-9835-0634e4ac4b72"},{"objectId":"5e709424878c28a0473b706b","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Gnida","uuid":"031B4512B3AF20E132B74365FF89A8B765817C9204E3EB7EA07863C6B20C15C1303E72AC74F7E2014C394DBF77771B6AFC7ACD57452364B4C7BC2800F0943DDE","orcidId":"0000-0003-3350-9383","documentHash":"cdcfa514-bae9-4562-a550-5b2ac3024eeb"}],"doi":"10.1021/acs.iecr.4c02229"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Rayleigh-Taylor instability","laboratory plasma","electromagnetic radiation pressure","fluid model"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Rayleigh-Taylor instability in an adiabatic-radiative rare plasma","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479257","mniswId":"16067","title":"Physica Scripta","doi":null,"issn":"0031-8949","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"10810440-e084-497f-a45f-28e9431ffb56"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64218b824097077da598adea","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6325312975234038513dfa2b","6582c6f84097076c14bb8b4b","6582c6f84097076c14bb8b4c","6582c6f84097076c14bb8b4d","6582c6f84097076c14bb8b4e"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Considering the particle nature of photons, the impact of electromagnetic radiation pressure is examined on the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) in a non-uniform rare magnetoplasma. For low-density and high-temperature rare plasma, the RTI with radiation pressure is revisited in the adiabatic limit. The growth rate conditions and propagating modes are derived using the framework of a developed fluid model. For specific values of ion temperature, the cut-off values of propagation of the fringing instability is found to be temperature dependent. A numerical comparison of the present results with previous work Maryam N, Rozina C and Ali S (2021, IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science 49 1072-1078) is displayed in table 1. It is found that the radiative acoustic speed is increased due to electromagnetic radiation pressure in rare plasmas as compared to radiative acoustic speed in dense plasmas. However, the growth rate of RTI increases comparatively as function of radiation pressure in rare plasmas. The present findings reveals that the consequences of RTI are remarkably concerned with the choice of electromagnetic radiation pressure either in dense (astrophysical) or rare (laboratory) plasmas. These findings are relevant to the observations of long-lived irregularities for explaining the gravitational instability in laboratory plasmas, e.g. in fusion devices like tokamaks. © 2023 IOP

recurrent dredging of marine sediments needs the use of ex–situ technologies such as sediment washing (SW) to effectively remove polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Notwithstanding, the large volumes of generated spent SW effluents require adequate treatment by employing highly–efficient, inexpensive and environmentally–friendly solutions. This study proposes the phenanthrene (PHE) desorption from sediments using Tween® 80 (TW80) as extracting agent and the treatment of the resulting spent SW solution in a biochar (BC) immobilized–cell bioreactor. The SW process reached the highest PHE removal of about 91% using a surfactant solution containing 10,800 mg L−1 of TW80. The generated amount of spent PHE–polluted SW solution can be controlled by keeping a solid to liquid ratio of 1:4. A PHE degradation of up to 96% was subsequently achieved after 43 days of continuous reactor operation, aerobically treating the TW80 solution in the BC immobilized–cell bioreactor with a hydraulic retention time of 3.5 days. Brevundimonas, Chryseobacterium, Dysgonomonas, Nubsella, and both uncultured Weeksellaceae and Xanthobacteraceae genera were mainly involved in PHE biodegradation. A rough economic study showed a total cost of 342.60 € ton−1 of sediment, including the SW operations, TW80 and BC supply and the biological treatment of the SW solution. © 2022 Elsevier

In particular, wetting/dewetting of hydrophobic nanoporous materials is crucial due to their broad applicability for molecular separation and liquid purification; energy storage, conversion, recuperation, and dissipation; for catalysis, chromatography, and so on. In this work, a rapid, orchestrated, and spontaneous dipole reorientation was observed in hydrophobic nanotubes of various pore sizes d (7.9–16.5 Å) via simulations. This phenomenon leads to the fragmentation of water clusters in the narrow nanopores (d = 7.9, 10 Å) and strongly affects dewetting through cluster repulsion. The cavitation in these pores has an electrostatic origin. The dependence of hydrogen-bonded network properties on the tube aperture is obtained and is used to explain wetting (intrusion)–dewetting (extrusion) hysteresis. Computer simulations and experimental data demonstrate that d equals ca. 12.5 Å is a threshold between a nonhysteretic (spring) behavior, where intrusion–extrusion is reversible, and a hysteretic one (shock absorber), where hysteresis is prominent. This work suggests that water clustering and the electrostatic nature of cavitation are important factors that can be effectively exploited for controlling the wetting/dewetting of nanoporous materials."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739613","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"7604-7616","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsami.3c17272","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6279ce2975234056eb6981c6","name":"Yaroslav","lastName":"Grosu","uuid":"57708255467094751109382FDBF32F6AA0FDBF8EB4D4D7AADDDD8FB613A2E5F154900598445B4BAF48CDBBA82F4A531AE7FFDED17C1B7A2CFEF067B46C381036","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e9b9cf17-2a42-4053-ab52-f17562e5cefa"},{"objectId":"5f9be1e1085dcb3b6122be31","name":"Yuriy","lastName":"Bushuev","uuid":"8F7437FD55E170C4359A1918373EACCC7A8E241DA8564E42E4ABB9DF6E64799A3112E22350318059BD6367BB3CA87EC24AB2BFD3168E6A0B007244F752A67ACF","orcidId":"0000-0001-9463-8627","documentHash":"41f325e5-9cd4-4d05-888f-da10479675eb"},{"objectId":"5e7092ec878c28a04739f44b","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Chorążewski","uuid":"608E0020DDB96BDB1CFFC0484C2BF49E01CF682E442C8F2046CAA67EBEBA5F86FFD1F7FB95A4919742A06AF7840A621C547F82E02CD2803C65F367BA44855548","orcidId":"0000-0002-8912-9024","documentHash":"ba3177d7-c142-4d41-b1c1-dabb1b88289c"}],"doi":"10.1021/acsami.3c17272"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Sebastian Petrycy z Pilzna","zapomniane zasługi do zbadania","pierwsze polskie przekłady Arystotelesa"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["forgotten merits to be explored","Sebastian Petrycy of Pilzno","Aristotle’s first translations into Polish"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de6d","uid":"bIyN9cy073sy-77ulzW-Vmw","uuid":"bafdd534-9afd-4d8d-9412-30dc2d48ab6b","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de6d","parentUuid":"bafdd534-9afd-4d8d-9412-30dc2d48ab6b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de6d","rootUuid":"bafdd534-9afd-4d8d-9412-30dc2d48ab6b","name":"Akademia im.

For general orientation and to recognize a certain taste of Petrycy’s style, we cite his more important declarations in this original attempt to popularize philosophy in Polish. He taught at the Krakow Academy, from which he was unfortunately removed, hence he dedicated his books with translations of Aristotle and Horace to his powerful patrons. Underestimated properly by his contemporaries, he has only been recognized in research since the 20th century, and not only as a pioneering translator, but also as an original thinker on a wide range of fields and issues. As for his extensive translation and adaptation of Aristotle in the formation of Polish philosophical terminology, there is still much to be studied."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739615","journalIssue":{"objectId":"652fcce440970713969df723","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"2 b","number":"26","doi":null,"documentHash":"053dc557-0ce0-40e3-a719-6e57a7b6f83e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2 b","pagesFromTo":"363 - 381","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"Sebastian Petrycy of Pilzno - Initiator of Polish -language Philosophy"}],"publicUri":"https://jezyk.religia.tozsamosc.ajp.edu.pl/resources/html/article/details?id=613412","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092f2878c28a04739fbd3","name":"Marian","lastName":"Wesoły","uuid":"EC92E14A9FBFD91847F7D5BB9DF718CB369B8AAAA4D91EA7D55DA332178DC70982EE623665BD871D83150DC26175A90DBF0D5E625C34C04F7D4B42E07D9972FA","orcidId":"0000-0002-5418-8913","documentHash":"1a5b06a0-ee8e-493e-afc4-180e2a5781c2"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","uid":"bQp8ITDzg_V-1GFpvOVvvtg","uuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","parentUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de30","rootUuid":"8c8aabb6-fc72-4e4e-bb15-218703aa9f43","name":"Politechnika Opolska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709221878c28a0473905e9","5e709222878c28a04739063b","5e709237878c28a047391d09"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Słownik fizjoterapeuty.

Numerous experimental variables are optimized, including the composition of the supporting electrolyte and its pH, as well as activation and accumulation conditions. Under optimized measurement conditions, the method shows high sensitivity, permitting a very low limit of detection equal to 7 × 10−10 mol L−1 to be achieved in a short accumulation time of 50 s. The performance of this microsensor was investigated against numerous interference factors and its good anti-interference capability was demonstrated. A series of voltammetric experiments were carried out and they proved that the miniaturized sensor is characterized by very good accuracy and precision as well as long-term stability. The solid bismuth microelectrode displays a good voltammetric response in the analysis of diverse samples with a complex matrix and demonstrates a good recovery

aim of the study was to produce new elastomeric materials containing butyl rubber (IIR) filled with silica and phyllosilicates (vermiculite, montmorillonite, perlite or halloysite tubes) with enhanced hydrophobicity and barrier properties and reduced chemical degradation. It was found that the filler type had a significant impact on the degree of cross-linking of butyl rubber and the properties of its vulcanizates. The highest degree of cross-linking and the highest mechanical strength were achieved for IIR composites filled with Arsil with perlite or halloysite tubes. The highest surface hydrophobicity (119°) was confirmed for the IIR vulcanizates with Arsil and montmorillonite. All tested samples showed high barrier properties because both the gas diffusion rate coefficient and the permeability coefficient reached low values. Both unfilled and filled IIR vulcanizates retained chemical resistance in contact with methanol for 480 min. Hour-long contact of a polar solvent (methanol) with each of the vulcanizates did not cause material degradation, while the presence of a non-polar solvent (n-heptane) worsened the mechanical parameters by up to 80%. However, the presence of fillers reduced the chemical degradation of vulcanizates (in the case of cured IIR filled with Arsil and halloysite tubes by 40% compared to the composite without fillers)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739622","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65f307a140970775cd351764","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"29","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"281fc3e7-9098-45f0-8ed2-8c01a27809d9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"1306-1333","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67334e91fdbe830349a2ca27","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Litwicka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"917bbb75-5791-47f0-add4-77da07fa3bd6"},{"objectId":"67334e91fdbe830349a2ca26","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Adamus-Włodarczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9f3b4bb1-ab27-43f2-863f-12a12b957442"},{"objectId":"67334e91fdbe830349a2ca25","name":"Konrad Rafał","lastName":"Mrozowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e878afe9-c7d7-4027-bb40-f513c24ed30c"},{"objectId":"67334e91fdbe830349a2ca24","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Irzmańska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1d0404b8-28f8-49c6-8991-b68afced0d54"},{"objectId":"5e709273878c28a047395eb7","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Strzelec","uuid":"CA3DF0A988D35CDDB870A48E4228B3BB379A963B578580F28AB429F58FF2F4350816043AD2C9E7E08DA8DB19241B1708085D0321F00EB7A1FF6986BBE9FED87E","orcidId":"0000-0001-6450-4337","documentHash":"a0170a18-aa16-4d90-986b-9df0fce04eec"},{"objectId":"5e709269878c28a04739542e","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Szynkowska-Jóźwik","uuid":"0B84FFF3A71D987E1144E785C518BCB48368552A3E898B2C4B9C6E1C32D72870E7A0EF30926A3F12E5833A9125269203534DA47868CEFCFF51C1D05E28D8D439","orcidId":"0000-0003-1959-3849","documentHash":"67bc494a-7e56-4420-8016-3a190991ea83"},{"objectId":"5e709269878c28a047395419","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Smejda-Krzewicka","uuid":"800CD1C98551201034A00E4EAB8E9FDDFD789ADAA4B67061EA67C4192023835752A57A912C35E8724A4333E9EC35808D23ADF07D2E978F59E3CC0B35016A546A","orcidId":"0000-0001-7720-1773","documentHash":"25dcbb75-2a74-4309-81ef-8f37429bcbfc"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules29061306"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f82d","uid":"baM7_bWGivADreGHZOXP9TA","uuid":"f30e0713-62f4-48d4-adfd-229566974a34","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","parentUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de15","rootUuid":"d0155bd9-09cf-474a-b10c-51a4b46c9d57","name":"Wydział Chemii (od 1.10.2019 r.)","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709211878c28a04738f728"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Amine-catalyzed substitution in CpFe(CO)<sub>2</sub>I by phosphine and bisphosphine ligands","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454778f6","mniswId":"4868","title":"Dalton Transactions","doi":"10.1039/c5dt","issn":"1477-9226","eissn":"1477-9234","websiteLink":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/journals/journalissues/dt","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"c732c991-2fb1-492e-935e-34e08a72105a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6698f256fdbe83588aacd6c3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6698f256fdbe83588aacd6c5","6698f256fdbe83588aacd6c6","6698f256fdbe83588aacd6c7","5e709211878c28a04738f728","6698f256fdbe83588aacd6c8","6698f256fdbe83588aacd6c9","6698f256fdbe83588aacd6ca"]},"issue":"23","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We have found that amines significantly accelerate iodide substitution in CpFe(CO)2I (1) (Cp = η5-cyclopentadienyl) with phosphines and allow the synthesis of new complexes that are not available through reactions carried out without an amine. The reaction of equimolar amounts of 1 and triphenylphosphine in toluene containing DIPA afforded [CpFe(CO)2PPh3]+I− within 5 min at room temperature in 72% yield (90% after 24 h). DIPA and pyrrolidine gave the highest yields of the tested amines. We performed a similar reaction using model bisphosphines 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (dppe) and 1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf). The products depended on the reagent ratio and bore the CpFe(CO)2 moiety coordinated to one or two phosphine phosphorus atoms. Chelates [CpFe(CO)(dppe)]+I− (4) and [Cp2Fe2(CO)4(dppe)]2+2I− (5) were formed in 72% and 98% yield, respectively. We also performed the DIPA-catalyzed reaction of 1 with triethyl phosphite and obtained the product of an Michaelis–Arbuzov-like rearrangement, CpFe(CO)2[P(O)(OCH2CH3)2] (11). All complexes were characterized with spectroscopic analysis by NMR, FT-IR, and ESI-MS, and by XRD for three complexes. To clarify the reaction mechanism, we performed theoretical calculations of the intermolecular interactions between 1 and amine molecules. We propose two possible reaction mechanisms to explain the formation of products."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739624","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6698f256fdbe83588aacd6c4","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"53","number":"23","doi":null,"documentHash":"45efb8f2-1529-4a8d-85c8-7d1b511b75be"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"53","pagesFromTo":"9732-9740","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2024/DT/D4DT00416G","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6698f256fdbe83588aacd6ca","name":"Bogna","lastName":"Rudolf","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1be49bc4-a6bb-4c75-8216-231c7a466420"},{"objectId":"6698f256fdbe83588aacd6c9","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Zakrzewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"27b2f9a6-b7e2-4731-bb5a-ac11d6b3d59f"},{"objectId":"6698f256fdbe83588aacd6c8","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Palusiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f35ff06e-9022-46d4-a303-04fd4bca951e"},{"objectId":"6698f256fdbe83588aacd6c7","name":"Agnieszka J.","lastName":"Rybarczyk-Pirek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f9626297-2802-4aeb-948b-f616c7175cfc"},{"objectId":"6698f256fdbe83588aacd6c6","name":"Daria","lastName":"Jamroz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"83ace88b-c861-4a7b-95ce-77293042fa71"},{"objectId":"6698f256fdbe83588aacd6c5","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Kosińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"41bbf9ef-66bd-465c-84a4-f74320f983cc"},{"objectId":"5e709211878c28a04738f728","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Wojtulewski","uuid":"E635AE8B1C4350BF58A4BEE7986E1A405608C7F144AC89CF658DF5BDF5758F209A588483DA87B7D2D10E3BEABE1B6BF4167C0EA7532D8D9D075B5FFB1C25F4F7","orcidId":"0000-0001-5535-4525","documentHash":"b017475c-4240-4a47-a5d0-4fcccf6558bf"}],"doi":"10.1039/d4dt00416g"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["whey protein isolate","erythritol","aerated foods","macarons","rheology","texture","surface properties","Turbiscan","sportsmen nutrition"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Effect of Erythritol on the Physicochemical Properties of Reformulated, High-Protein, and Sugar-Free Macarons Produced from Whey Protein Isolate Intended for Diabetics, Athletes, and Physically Active People","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"Foods","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2304-8158","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"0f59a8f0-a1f9-45c0-ba10-cec780ad3d19"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"646748bc4097076e9cc0129d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f7878c28a0473a023c","659fc1f84097076c144aaa6d","659fc1f84097076c144aaa6e","659fc1f84097076c144aaa6f","659fc1f84097076c144aaa70","659fc1f84097076c144aaa71"]},"issue":"7","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study reports the possibility of obtaining sugar-free WPI-based macarons with erythritol addition. The whey protein isolate (WPI) solution (20%, w/v) was whipped, and erythritol was added to the foam at concentrations of 20, 40, and 60 g, with 125 g of almond flour. The rheological properties (τ, G′, G″, and tan (δ)) and stability of the macaron batters before baking were evaluated. In order to produce the macarons, the batters were solidified at 147 °C for 12 min. The textural and surface properties (roughness and color), as well as the microstructures and water activities, were determined for the macarons. It was feasible to produce macarons over the entire range of the tested erythritol content. Even the smallest amount of erythritol (20 g) facilitated the preservation of the macaron structure. The medium erythritol concentration (40 g) improved the stability of the batters and their rheology and was the most effective for air pocket stabilization during baking; however, its largest addition (60 g) resulted in an increase in the final macaron volume. The increased erythritol addition improved mechanical properties and shelf life, producing a smoothing effect on the macaron surfaces and having a significant effect on their color co-ordinates. © 2023 by the authors."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739627","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85152787463&amp;doi=10.3390%2ffoods12071547&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=fef1dc5006cd585b967ab31daa049df3","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"659fc1f84097076c144aaa71","name":"Salvador ","lastName":"Peréz-Huertas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ab7ec22c-b099-4c77-a171-457c7ddd14a5"},{"objectId":"659fc1f84097076c144aaa70","name":"Igor B.","lastName":"Tomasevic","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b23cbf2c-9e4a-4c1d-b48b-dc10ac912890"},{"objectId":"659fc1f84097076c144aaa6f","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Kucia","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5a3364c9-f49d-4a0c-9c27-af905ebc7471"},{"objectId":"659fc1f84097076c144aaa6e","name":"Bartosz G.","lastName":"Sołowiej","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e7e59d83-e4db-46b3-9394-3da927bcba60"},{"objectId":"659fc1f84097076c144aaa6d","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Nastaj","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b315a9c8-eaf4-422e-bde0-0623ad1f1231"},{"objectId":"5e7092f7878c28a0473a023c","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Terpiłowski","uuid":"BB5CF56156DBC508342880DFD126F84136435238AC56C16DE5ABCFA8E04CDECAD1B5DED736FBFDD392229837A11BD2FB2D8EFB86342E5E3EA7F99C500F87FBE3","orcidId":"0000-0002-8078-3644","documentHash":"f494b4f1-1288-46a2-a462-c905489859e7"}],"doi":"10.3390/foods12071547"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Amphiphilic Janus Particles Confined in Symmetrical and Janus-Like Slits","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b800","mniswId":"138","title":"ACS Omega","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2470-1343","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"57270abb-002d-49b4-aeb7-392938e42e1b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64afba0b4097071386f07783","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f8878c28a0473a0300","5e7092f8878c28a0473a0302","5e709442878c28a0473b9157","657043654097071b8e60bc37"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the behavior of Janus spheres composed of attractive and repulsive parts confined between two parallel solid surfaces.

In RPM, the non-linear Korteweg–de Vries equation is derived using stretched co-ordinates in the reference frame of the wave phase speed, considering the dispersion to be a higher-order effect that balances the non-linearity to produce a solitary structure. The maximum amplitude |Φm| of the non-linear solitary wave turns out to be larger than one that contradicts the small amplitude approximation. In the presence of negative ions, the maximum amplitude satisfies the condition |Φm|&amp;lt;1. To elaborate these points, the results have been applied to an experimental plasma consisting of positive ions of xenon (Xe+) and negative ions of fluorene (F−) along with electrons. The amplitude and width of the solitary structures depend upon the ratio of the electron to positive ion density (ne0ni0).

The UTM or instability is calibrated via axial and azimuthal wave numbers, wind speed, and its growth essence. The qualitative and quantitative anatomy of the instability threshold is also predicted.

The use of lignin resulted in numerous advantages including an increased number of functional groups, satisfactory biocompatibility, low toxicity, and high carbon content. The major benefit of lignin is associated with the reduced carbon footprint of the manufactured product. Lignin can be classified as a natural flame-retardant agent owing to the high amount of char formed during combustion. In turn, TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> exhibits high chemical stability and low operating costs and is considered a non-toxic and environmentally friendly material. During the experiments, commercial TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> in anatase crystallographic form, TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> synthesized from titanyl sulfate hydrate, and kraft lignin as well as organic–inorganic hybrid materials composed of these materials were evaluated as functional additives in epoxy-resin-based polymer coatings (Epidian 601) and their properties were investigated in detail. The cone colorimetry test confirmed that the obtained hybrids are effective flame-retardant additives for polymer coatings, with a notable fire hazard reduction observed for samples containing a synergistic system of titanium oxide and lignin. The coating with lignin was the most effective in fire suppression processes. The conducted thermal and mechanical investigations confirmed good performance properties of the coatings indicating thermal resistance up to 360 °C and Shore D hardness in a range of 80.36–86.28°Sh, accordingly. Optical profilometry investigations show that the lignin/TiO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> hybrids exhibit a stable topological surface shape as well as good dispersion and uniformity in the polymer matrix.

The study allows finding the wave period cut-offs and their variations in the solar atmosphere, as well as establishing the role of these cut-offs in determining the wave propagation conditions. The atmosphere is permitted by a uniform vertical magnetic field. We perform numerical simulations in the framework of a one-dimensional (1D), two-fluid model in which plane waves are exited by a harmonic driver in the vertical ion and neutral velocities, operating at the bottom of the solar photosphere. We observe excitation of waves with cut-off wave periods in addition to waves set directly by the driver. We also see that some waves exited by that driver can reach the solar corona. Despite of its limitations such as the lack of non-adiabatic and non-ideal terms and a simple 1D structure, the developed two-fluid model of the solar atmosphere sheds a new light on the role of cut-offs in setting up the wave propagation conditions in the solar atmosphere and finding periods of waves that may carry their energy from the solar surface to the corona."}],"lastRefresh":"1747060739644","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"518","pagesFromTo":"4991-5000","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/518/4/4991/6769822?login=true","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"640b064940970770359949c5","name":"Z.

The most optimal electrolyte concentrations were determined to be 0.4 M HCl and 6.3 × 10−5 M Cu(II). The optimal parameters for voltammetric stripping measurements are as follows: an accumulation potential of −0.7 V; an accumulation time of 120 s; and a pulse amplitude and pulse time of 120 mV and 2 ms, respectively.

The phase composition of the powders, the structure, physical and mechanical properties of the Al2O3 - YSZ ceramics were studied taking into account the YSZ concentration and the pressing pressure. We have found that various crystallization processes occur during the sintering of ceramics and two types of structure are realized: aggregate-hardened and disperse-hardened, depending on the HHP value.

We use all 20 available magnetic maps of the solar photosphere covering the date of 2019 July 2, which corresponds to a solar eclipse on Earth. We use the same standard preprocessing on all maps, then perform coronal MHD simulations with the same numerical and physical parameters. We conclude by quantifying the performance of each map using three indicators from remote-sensing observations: white-light total solar eclipse images for the streamers’ edges, EUV synoptic maps for coronal holes, and white-light coronagraph images for the heliospheric current sheet. We discuss the performance of space-weather forecasting and show that the choice of the input magnetic map has a strong impact. We find performances between 24% and 85% for the streamers’ edges, 24%-88% for the coronal hole boundaries, and a mean deviation between 4° and 12° for the heliospheric current sheet position. We find that the HMI runs perform better on all indicators, with GONG-ADAPT being the second-best choice. HMI runs perform better for the streamers’ edges, and GONG-ADAPT for polar coronal holes, HMI synchronic for equatorial coronal holes, and the streamer belt. We especially illustrate the importance of the filling of the poles. This demonstrates that the solar poles have to be taken into account even for ecliptic plane previsions. © 2023. The Author(s).
