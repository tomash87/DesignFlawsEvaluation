Moreover, the density and technical condition of forest roads affect the effectiveness of forest protection and disaster prevention measures. The average density of the road network in Polish forests corresponds to the densities known from some other European countries. The main problem is the high spatial variation of this parameter and the low share of roads with paved surfaces. In Poland, a significant percentage of roads are unpaved, with often very low bearing capacity parameters. Once the optimisation of the road network is completed, these roads should be reconstructed as a priority. A wide range of road investments requires the development of fast and reliable methods for assessing the quality of construction; high hopes in this regard are associated with the development of road surface standards and the use of light falling−weight deflectometers (LFWD). Geosynthetic materials being introduced into forest road construction deserve even greater promotion. They make it possible to construct forest roads on a very weak subgrade while limiting the amount of material required to achieve the desired road parameters. By delaying the process of surface deformation, they can extend the durability of the surface many times over, thus reducing road maintenance costs and extending the periods between successive repairs. The problems to be solved in the near future are (1) the development of effective and fast techniques to inventory the engineering condition of road networks, and (2) the development of empirical linear models that allow the results of LFWD tests to be used to evaluate the value of the deformation modulus of the second static plate load."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138719","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"166","pagesFromTo":"123-140","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.26202/sylwan.2022006","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a0473907f7","name":"Sylwester","lastName":"Grajewski","uuid":"6B4ABFF7DD7AECF3FA475A37CFA019083DBDAE105101A6475C5F91C9D2F8606EF9A591D7EE1D1DA252CD84292B616F548E9E5B2604B9BFBA7697B21AA6C23D7C","orcidId":"0000-0002-3425-1460","documentHash":"53938c3a-f234-453a-b6e1-b6e1243df644"}],"doi":"10.26202/sylwan.2022006"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["family firms","internationalization","innovation","SME","export determinants","non-family management"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet Warszawski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709359878c28a0473a7d21"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Comparative analysis of export determinants in Italian and Polish firms: The moderating role of non-family management","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a025","mniswId":"10978","title":"Journal of Entrepreneurship Management and Innovation","doi":null,"issn":"2299-7075","eissn":"2299-7326","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e80a6783-3d72-46d0-be00-2dfba80222f7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62b44a0c4097070c593bc099","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62b44a0c4097070c593bc09b","5e709359878c28a0473a7d21"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"PURPOSE: The paper analyses the determinants of exporting from a cross-country perspective, comparing Italy and Poland. It focuses on three objectives: i) investigating if age and size influence the firm’s probability to export; ii) if there are differences between family and non-family management; iii) if and how non-family management positively moderates the relationship between age, size, and the firm’s probability to export. METHODOLOGY: Microeconometric analysis using probit regressions on two surveys carried out in Italy and Poland on representative samples of manufacturing SMEs (1,100 for Italy and 680 for Poland). We control for several factors, such as innovation, geographical location, economic sector, and banks relationship. FINDINGS: In both countries, the larger firms have a higher probability to export, with a higher significant effect in Italy than in Poland. Business experience proves to be a factor affecting the likelihood of exporting only in Italy (in a positive sense: older firms are more likely to export) and not in Poland. External (non-family) management is a driver for the internationalization of family-owned firms, especially for younger firms in Italy and for smaller firms in Poland. All these findings are confirmed by robustness check analyses on the subsample of family-owned firms. IMPLICATIONS: i) the role of corporate governance can differ between countries with reference to a firm’s competitiveness; ii) favoring management openness to external managers for family-owned firms; iii) small firms require greater support in encouraging exporting behavior; iv) the need to consider jointly the issues of innovation, internationalization and corporate governance modes (familynon-family management) in the agenda of the firm’s competitiveness. ORIGINALITY AND VALUE: The paper contributes to the literature on the determinants of exporting by simultaneously studying some firm’s characteristics related to size and age with others related to corporate governance, which are usually addressed separately. Furthermore, this paper tries to fill a gap concerning a lack of cross-country studies focusing on European countries other than those more advanced."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138720","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b44a0c4097070c593bc09e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"18","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"e7117160-5440-4e6c-8f70-098df486a1b9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"18","pagesFromTo":"41-67","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://jemi.edu.pl/vol-18-issue-2-2022/comparative-analysis-of-export-determinants-in-italian-and-polish-firms-the-moderating-role-of-non-family-management","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62b44a0c4097070c593bc09b","name":"Marco","lastName":"Pini","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9053fb78-892d-4f73-bc63-eaede0a0c2f8"},{"objectId":"5e709359878c28a0473a7d21","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Tchorek","uuid":"E8A9AB76511ED6C1EC4ED7222098CF7138AEED9FFD917F266AA22839C51B33405E57BA4014382F7C2F6DB21A373DFA79656929E03A4FEBA51FCCBBBCC8F464D0","orcidId":"0000-0003-0307-7639","documentHash":"6100293e-6556-48b3-97e4-e85bc75187f1"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["soilless tomato cultivation wastewater","nutrient removal","bioelectrochemical reactor (BER)","rotating electrochemical disk contactor (RECDC)","rotating electrobiological disk contactor\n(REBDC)","technological parameters"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70921c878c28a0473900bb","5e709429878c28a0473b7652","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b56","5e70921c878c28a0473900e0"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Technological Parameters of Rotating Electrochemical and Electrobiological Disk Contactors Depending on the Effluent Quality Requirements","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-3417","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ff202409-59bf-494e-82ae-6802b8fb2444"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62b453174097070c593bff1c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70921c878c28a0473900bb","5e709429878c28a0473b7652","5e70921c878c28a0473900e0","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2b56","5e70939b878c28a0473ad9cd","5e709437878c28a0473b83db"]},"issue":"11","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Soilless tomato cultivation wastewater, with typically low COD, high concentrations of phosphorus, and oxidized forms of nitrogen, may be effectively treated in a rotating electrochemical disk contactor (RECDC) and in a bioelectrochemical reactor (BER), such as a rotating electrobiological disk contactor (REBDC). The aim of this study was to determine the technological parameters of both reactors, i.e., electric current density (J) and hydraulic retention time (HRT), depending on the effluent quality requirements. The study was conducted with four one-stage RECDCs and with four one-stage REBDCs, at four hydraulic retention times, i.e., 4, 8, 12, and 24 h, and electric current densities of 0.63, 1.25, 2.50, 5.00, and 10.00 A/m2. It was demonstrated that soilless tomato cultivation wastewater could be effectively treated in electrochemical and electrobiological disk contactors, and then discharged to sewage system facilities. In a RECDC, the highest denitrification (53.4%) and dephosphatation (99.8%) performance was achieved at J = 10.0 A/m2 and HRT = 24 h. If the effluents are to be discharged to natural reservoirs, their effective treatment is only feasible in a REBDC. The bioelectrochemical disk contactor ensured over 90% dephosphatation effectiveness. At HRT = 24 h and all electric current densities studied, the concentrations of pollutants in the effluent met requirements set for industrial wastewater discharged into natural waters and the ground. By applying J = 2.5 A/m2 and HRT = 24 h in the REBDC, it was possible to achieve a phosphorus concentration below 3.0 mg P/L and concentrations of ammonia nitrogen and nitrites lower than the permissible levels for treated industrial wastewater introduced to waters and to the ground. Given the nitrate concentration (exceeding 30 mg N/L), an external carbon source is recommended to aid a treatment process that uses a technological system with a REBDC. Technological schemes were proposed for wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with a RECDC and a REBDC, for discharging treated wastewater to natural waters, the ground, and sewage

During both years of the experiment, there was a treatment in which Trichoderma fungi were not used (control), and in another treatment, plants were treated with these fungi. After five weeks of cultivation, when leaf apexes were visible above the surface of the substrate, each plant was irrigated with a suspension (20 mL) of mix of Trichoderma spp. (T. viride Schumach-Tv14, T. harzianum Rifai-Thr2, T. hamatum/Bonord/Bainier-Th15). The treatment of the plants Trichoderma-spp. improved their uptake of macro- (P, K and Ca) and micronutrients (Zn, Fe and B), and increased the chlorophyll a + b and carotenoids in their leaves. Trichoderma spp. accelerated the flowering of Gladiolus hybridus L. ‘Advances Red’ by 10–14 days. The fungi stimulated the elongation of inflorescence shoots and inflorescences, in which the number of flowers increased, but flower diameter did not change. Trichoderma spp. improved the nutrients uptake, chlorophyll a + b and carotenoids, and flowering; hence, Trichoderma spp. treatment is suggested for enhancing inflorescence and inflorescence shoots in Gladiolus hybridus."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138725","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b1db46409707603916163d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"8","doi":null,"documentHash":"58090a1f-172f-480c-b8fd-cf13d8448987"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"4576","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/8/4576/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093c8878c28a0473b0ab3","name":"Roman","lastName":"Andrzejak","uuid":"C03B1B64D7384A43734DEF7AF59DB92118625022DDBAEB35F694DD17755D22F3B0097C577320B6CEC1C0F74774A2177DB8C3BEBCAC67FC703BC81A155EE9D514","orcidId":"0000-0002-5546-0560","documentHash":"6416afda-e553-4221-9fba-adea3e31986f"},{"objectId":"5e709346878c28a0473a62e8","name":"Beata","lastName":"Janowska","uuid":"1EF98A2889CDD342B58B8F1446C228F9A13CD31C59748DDA9B491A5032D6C6BDF3A64A0886B811FAC874D9472E0B3E3036FCEED561E3240E81D3A3C3A3CC926D","orcidId":"0000-0002-6871-9316","documentHash":"7e2e7aed-ec52-405b-8388-35f0857d8bd8"}],"doi":"10.3390/su14084576"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62b33fa1409707737cf8ed6e","doi":null,"title":"Wiedza

the increasing consumer demand for raw, nonprocessed, safe, and long shelf-life fish and seafood products, research concerning the application of natural antimicrobials as alternatives to preservatives is of great interest. The aim of the following paper was to evaluate the effect of essential oils (EOs) from black pepper (BPEO) and tarragon (TEO), and their bioactive compounds: limonene (LIM), β-caryophyllene (CAR), methyl eugenol (ME), and β-phellandrene (PHE) on the lipolytic activity and type II secretion system (T2SS) of Pseudomonas psychrophila KM02 (KM02) fish isolates grown in vitro and in fish model conditions. Spectrophotometric analysis with the p-NPP reagent showed inhibition of lipolysis from 11 to 46%. These results were confirmed by RT-qPCR, as the expression levels of lipA, lipB, and genes encoding T2SS were also considerably decreased. The supplementation of marinade with BPEO and TEO contributed to KM02 growth inhibition during vacuum packaging of salmon fillets relative to control samples. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provided insight into the spoilage potential of KM02, proving its importance as a spoilage microorganism whose metabolic activity should be inhibited to maintain the quality and safety of fresh fish in the food

this article, we present the possibility of using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to detect trace, ppm-level (%wt.) concentrations of admixtures in 95-octane lead-free gasoline in straightforward time-of-flight (pulse-delay) measurements performed directly in the liquid. The method was tested on samples containing 75–0.0125% of isopropanol and 0.3–0.0250% of water. The detection limits for isopropanol and water content were determined to be 125 ppm and 250 ppm, respectively, approaching the limits of much more complicated and time-consuming methods (like spectroscopy of the vapor phase). The measured pulse delays were compared with theoretical calculations using the modified Gladstone-Dale mixing rule for the solutions. The comparison demonstrated good agreement for gasoline-alcohol mixtures and large discrepancies for gasoline-water mixtures, suggesting that gasoline-water mixtures cannot be considered idealized binary mixtures. Our results clearly show that the pulse time delay measurement by THz-TDS is a fast and sensitive method of gasoline contamination detection and, as such, can be easily integrated with industrial online real-time quality control applications."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138735","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1629","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/app12031629","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebee16f752340254fc4380b","name":"Valeri","lastName":"Mikhnev","uuid":"41A2CCFB53DF1580000876C8F8E48209EDAA08A98C8F686708258CD5DB43D5B853BA4D310927F3CAEDCF75A79B8FF8B82A4C72BD8BC8CCAD35E44154A05E5E13","orcidId":"0000-0003-3282-6985","documentHash":"3f4d43c8-d6b8-4280-bd29-aaf4cf8e9723"},{"objectId":"5e7094f5878c28a0473c7f30","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Stelmaszczyk","uuid":"46F1FC53D2B992A9EFA9F23698334FAA74309A8A48304F0DDF64F596FA048BFEE706EDDAB246087E5D0B4B9C6532960E90ADDCEBE6CDC1C52C0887A7F766F670","orcidId":"0000-0003-1229-0626","documentHash":"29501d98-45e4-40fb-be15-13e8ba5c05c9"},{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473bea45","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Cywiński","uuid":"5A3E35D6581F0764F21F7B16B792C20B93382572A31937BB324D60316BE5562AB082D2F6242A49BED876D8C0816B4AFD9FD122AEADB3C2A269DC68DD906BCEB0","orcidId":"0000-0003-3616-8756","documentHash":"18c0cdf1-c8b0-4eb5-9e2c-202de5aec80a"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be674","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Skotnicki","uuid":"5549C9FFB312F8D64C315CA7A3612FF405E8966877BC647CA22B23A29ABB9721CAB398BC62D02859D00A1B7732A133F7420202BCFB139085DBBE2A47CFE8DA9B","orcidId":"0000-0001-7573-1201","documentHash":"bc8ecde1-1a67-454f-989c-f8b73af72361"},{"objectId":"5e7093b9878c28a0473afb80","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Knap","uuid":"56F0F50CB115EEA844C366F628E7D74C856D5D7F035268C3DEA62C7174157948E96D0020C699F807912B72A3ED8EDB9D8279F9B89C769600158FFF63CB819BAB","orcidId":"0000-0003-4537-8712","documentHash":"c0153190-15ec-4152-9603-1b839fabf2da"},{"objectId":"5e70936e878c28a0473a96e7","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Karpierz-Marczewska","uuid":"35D26ED0730041A5872D2244E1AA968FB43796FDA13937E2A558C85609C5097B5883079E92C42C0B6373B9587307399267E5AF197273BBE64BDE1F341DDB165D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aa70bdf0-42a8-48c5-84db-39de1f50e3e8"}],"doi":"10.3390/app12031629"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["broń palna","muzea","pozwolenie na broń","bezpieczeństwo"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["the Act on weapons and ammunition","the Act on Museums","firearms","Museums","firearms license","Security"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Broń palna w muzeach prywatnych","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a55b","mniswId":"200424","title":"STUDIA PRAWNOUSTROJOWE","doi":null,"issn":"1644-0412","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"3e5cd034-dc50-4e53-8c3c-ab5485e3bedb"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62b48d224097070c593d4f4a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70939e878c28a0473adc6d","656da93940970749a862d3f6"]},"issue":"56","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W obecnym stanie prawnym funkcjonuje bardzo duża swoboda i dowolność dotycząca gromadzenia broni palnej, w tym kategorii A, w muzeach prywatnych.

Specifically, epidemiologic studies in Western populations have shown adverse effects of selenium exposure at low levels, sometimes below or slightly above selenium intakes needed to maximize selenoprotein expression and activity. In addition, three recent lines of evidence in molecular and biochemical studies suggest some potential drawbacks associated with selenoprotein maximization: 1) the possibility that selenoprotein upregulation is a compensatory response to oxidative challenge, induced by selenium itself or other oxidants; 2) the capacity of selenoproteins to trigger tumor growth in some circumstances; and 3) the deleterious metabolic effects of selenoproteins and particularly of selenoprotein P. The last observation provides a toxicological basis to explain why in humans selenium intake levels as low as 60 μg/day, still in the range of selenium exposure upregulating selenoprotein expression, might start to increase risk of type 2 diabetes. Overall, these new pieces of evidence from the literature call into question the purported benefit of selenoprotein maximization, and indicate the need to reassess selenium dietary reference values and upper intake level. This reassessment should clarify which range of selenoprotein upregulation follows restoration of adequate selenium availability and which range is driven by a compensatory response to selenium toxicity and oxidative stress."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138740","journalIssue":{"objectId":"624aa7bd2467f01ec7fbbb47","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"211","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"e55672f6-6a55-4ed7-8031-0d9bada5c83b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"211","pagesFromTo":"113092","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0013935122004194?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"624aa7bd2467f01ec7fbbb45","name":"Lauren A.","lastName":"Wise","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2138-3752","documentHash":"b4a80926-6857-4e7d-afe8-fd28036bb802"},{"objectId":"624aa7bd2467f01ec7fbbb44","name":"Yoshiro","lastName":"Saito","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0559-5889","documentHash":"cc5ba881-a429-46b0-9111-0b1d677b2352"},{"objectId":"624aa7bd2467f01ec7fbbb42","name":"Tommaso","lastName":"Filippini","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2100-0344","documentHash":"fd103f36-90a4-4e6d-8f7a-e66c19bf1c77"},{"objectId":"624aa7bd2467f01ec7fbbb41","name":"Marco","lastName":"Vinceti","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0551-2473","documentHash":"a82ded59-3f67-4043-b829-c2e78868e685"},{"objectId":"5e709407878c28a0473b50e5","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Jabłońska","uuid":"3051360813E75DF1390B7AA83BB031CB19A6FCA3E134665B78EAE20FCC4457E2D497B806A0D64052B99C5AD6BBC5B637EC7F86230400D2C2DFF1B62769544DA9","orcidId":"0000-0002-3946-3964","documentHash":"3619f5e5-10fa-4232-b24b-96913d7909fb"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.envres.2022.113092"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62b2bd6a409707737cef9d47","doi":null,"title":"Z pogranicza pedagogiki ogólnej i teorii wychowania społecznego.

The response of major cell subpopulations in the draining lymph nodes to skin infection with Staphylococcus epidermidis was assessed using the rat model. After massive subepidermal infection, a cytometric evaluation showed an increase in cytotoxic and helper T lymphocytes and major subpopulations of the innate immune response. Three weeks later, signs of inflammation reduction with an increase in the content of memory T helper lymphocytes and effector memory T cytotoxic lymphocytes were observed. After skin re-infection, a rapid response of cytotoxic, helper, and memory T lymphocytes, memory B lymphocytes and plasmablasts, and macrophages was detected. In addition, a reduction in the number of naïve B lymphocytes, activated MHC class II+ cells, and some cells of the innate immune system was observed. T regulatory lymphocyte response after the initial and secondary S. epidermidis skin infection was not detected. The morphometric evaluation showed significant changes in the main cell subpopulations in each functional zone of the node and then confirmed the efficient elimination of the administered antigen, as evidenced by the observations on day 28. Notably, after re-infection, the cellular response did not exceed the level after the initial infection and was reduced in many cell subpopulations. Understanding how the lymph nodes eliminate S. epidermidis can provide valuable insights into creating immunological therapies against infections with saprophytes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138747","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62a3213c4097075196c24bae","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"10","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"e1d64323-2bd7-45c0-a9c7-7db49b7287f3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"1021","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/5/1021/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70948e878c28a0473bf84a","name":"Marta","lastName":"Cąkała-Jakimowicz","uuid":"F60F3513430DD98D83137538C0BDFECAA773592C74279CFDF3E5E7D4476240867DEFAB79D2BD5DA35EE7D58C2D7E9D4AF690751939BE753817FE7DED076967A7","orcidId":"0000-0002-7090-4641","documentHash":"a31bc60e-2f40-4554-bbc1-c254e133947f"},{"objectId":"5e7092d8878c28a04739df45","name":"Monika","lastName":"Puzianowska-Kuźnicka","uuid":"11D9DB5B15FBBEC623AC84A2C729C5FC9D79BFAB69EA22AEF87CCE5CFF634F57BD4FD830BDE696B0F4DA325CD96D559F3816751003B8F88DBE621E4B61AFE861","orcidId":"0000-0001-5295-3848","documentHash":"b563ef37-0f1d-432e-9bd3-38f8d92f26a8"}],"doi":"10.3390/biomedicines10051021"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["data processing and storage","data warehouse","database","data mart","triggers"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b6878c28a047385f0e","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Sumy State University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62b44a4e4097070c593bc333","62b44a4e4097070c593bc337","62b44a4e4097070c593bc334","62b44a4e4097070c593bc335"]},{"id":"5f99d94c2467f06b5e42422f","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Sumy National Agrarian University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62b44a4e4097070c593bc336"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Aggregation of multidimensional data for the decision support process for the management of microgrids with renewable energy sources","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a5c9","mniswId":"1002078","title":"Technology audit and production reserves [ Технологический аудит и резервы производства ]","doi":null,"issn":"2226-3780","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b2ddb9ee-c11c-4559-bf8e-ac90b931d78e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-04-30","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62b44a4e4097070c593bc330","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62b44a4e4097070c593bc333","62b44a4e4097070c593bc334","62b44a4e4097070c593bc335","62b44a4e4097070c593bc336","62b44a4e4097070c593bc337"]},"issue":"2(64)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The object of research is the process of processing and storing data when making decisions on managing the life cycle of electricity generation and consumption in microgrids with renewable energy sources. The prospects of the study are due to the fact that in order to provide a full-fledged decision support process in the management of microgrids with renewable energy sources, it is necessary to consolidate and manipulate multidimensional data in multithreading and online information processing. To solve the problem, the theoretical methods of analysis, abstraction, induction and deduction were used. To ensure multidimensionality and multithreading of data processing, it is proposed to develop a data warehouse based on the snowflake data model. Efficiency of information processing in real time is provided by an operational database built on the principle of OLTP. The organization of the joint work of the data warehouse with the operational database, the consolidation and manipulation of data is provided by triggers.\n\nThe result of the work is a data warehouse that will be used in the decision support system for managing energy microgrids, which will improve the efficiency of data processing and storage. This is achieved by combining the work of a centralized data warehouse with an operational database, as well as the use of a separate data mart for each user of the system. The practical significance of the work lies in the fact that the data warehouse will become part of the decision support system for processing information about the life cycle of energy in the management of energy infrastructure. Compared to using a single database for a decision support system, this approach ensures the speed of working with data and allows differentiating between the use of a data warehouse for analytics and data manipulation operations.\n\nThe data warehouse was deployed in a cloud environment on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform and the Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) web service. Secure access to client data is implemented using data marts."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138748","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b448494097070c593bb3c2","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"2(64)","doi":"","documentHash":"59c06ab9-6e53-48b2-bbea-ee0eef6b884b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"16-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/tarp/article/download/255957/253185","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62b44a4e4097070c593bc337","name":"Yaroslava","lastName":"Bielka","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5952-658X","documentHash":"ccceaa47-37f8-40c1-adbe-fb140ce31e52"},{"objectId":"62b44a4e4097070c593bc336","name":"Sergii","lastName":"Shendryk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2034-7920","documentHash":"c00d4392-f7e3-40d4-8115-5b9639c202f8"},{"objectId":"62b44a4e4097070c593bc335","name":"Olha","lastName":"Boiko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8557-2267","documentHash":"fef75130-b073-48ed-aabe-74db56d79fc2"},{"objectId":"62b44a4e4097070c593bc334","name":"Yuliia","lastName":"Parfenenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4377-5132","documentHash":"4d468397-1db1-48d7-8149-532f55eb96da"},{"objectId":"62b44a4e4097070c593bc333","name":"Vira","lastName":"Shendryk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8325-3115","documentHash":"6279decc-982d-473c-bc19-cde20be6e6f9"}],"doi":"10.15587/2706-5448.2022.255957"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df13","uid":"bKtjZT6qPD3d_ou1lCI-Heg","uuid":"64e6c5a1-1be6-4917-9d49-9dec59ed1713","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział

issue that we aim to investigate in this paper is related to the design of lexical resources which Polish university students use in the process of writing an academic text in French. In the course of the research, we concentrate on the transdisciplinary lexis composed of, on the one hand, cross-disciplinary terminology typical of scientific writings, and, on the other hand, of abstract, non-specialised vocabulary. In this regard, special focus is given to transdisciplinary collocations referring to scientific objects and procedures. The research is conducted on a corpus consisting of BA and MA theses written by Polish university students of French in Romance philology and applied linguistics faculties.The work progressed as follows. Firstly, the types of transdisciplinary collocations present in students’ theses were identified. They were then juxtaposed with the lexical resources gathered in the corpus of scientific texts in French (Corpus Écrits scientifiques en français). Finally, the manner in which students used the investigated collocations was analysed so as to identify the possible difficulties faced by non-native students of French. The objectives of this research are linguistic and didactic at the same time. Specifically, it aims to inventorystudents’ lexical resources, their scope and, as a result, to consider pedagogical solutions intended to enrich transdisciplinary vocabulary used in the process of writing scientific texts in university context. The analysis performed shows a weak presence of collocations containing scientific names. The students’ repertoire of lexical resources is relatively poor and not very varied. It is necessary to undertake more indepth work on the linguistic correction of the items mobilized.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138754","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"49","pagesFromTo":"57-71","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70927a878c28a047396531","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Sowa","uuid":"14BFF3AC06D7F9156F9A8C2528D492C9FF53B6E1E9201EB64EB3161A676FB7E31B842842D4B45B815CAEACF28669B1DA49F0E42013138390F67BA2AEAFBE2F47","orcidId":"0000-0002-9571-8693","documentHash":"4e5d885e-f17a-4434-9c59-dae0b081e4fd"}],"doi":"10.14746/strop.2022.492.005"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Instability","Multiclass queueing networks","Simulation","Size-based scheduling","SJF","SRPT"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df71","uid":"bVfQitUiCXefHxSrzVxWFmQ","uuid":"6b4ab5b8-ee21-43a7-a91e-148512c57a44","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Matematyki, Fizyki i Informatyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709460878c28a0473bba73","5e7092f5878c28a0473a0014"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Instability of SRPT, SERPT and SJF multiclass queueing networks","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4f878c2851454794a3","mniswId":"16955","title":"Queueing Systems","doi":null,"issn":"0257-0130","eissn":"1572-9443","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"90c9a0cd-d92e-4363-8e6b-d7e72a5ee098"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62b1b868409707603914c419","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f5878c28a0473a0014","5e709460878c28a0473bba73"]},"issue":"1-2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"We provide two examples of strictly subcritical multiclass queueing networks which are unstable under the shortest remaining processing time (SRPT) service protocol.

Using the fast rising photometric observations, spanning from the UV to NIR wavelengths, a pseudo-bolometric light curve was constructed and compared to several other well-observed Type IIb supernovae (SNe IIb). SN 2020acat displayed a very short rise time reaching a peak luminosity of $mathrm{{\rm Log}_{10}}(L) = 42.49 pm 0.17 , mathrm{erg , s^{-1}}$ in only ~14.6 ± 0.3 d.

The optical spectra of SN 2020acat display hydrogen signatures well into the transitional period (≳ 100 d), between the photospheric and the nebular phases. The spectra also display a strong feature around 4900 Å that cannot be solely accounted for by the presence of the Fe II 5018 line. We suggest that the Fe II feature was augmented by He I 5016 and possibly by the presence of N II 5005. From both photometric and spectroscopic analysis, we inferred that the progenitor of SN 2020acat was an intermediate-mass compact star with an M<SUB>ZAMS</SUB> of 15-20 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138760","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"513","pagesFromTo":"5540-5558","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.513.5540M","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62b5715d4097077f6d5a68be","name":"M.","lastName":"Newsome","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e470fc27-8826-4f12-9c9f-f87b6f29cb7d"},{"objectId":"62b5715d4097077f6d5a68bd","name":"P.","lastName":"Charalampopoulos","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4cac714b-396f-4580-a1e2-7224bfe7f04d"},{"objectId":"62b5715d4097077f6d5a68bc","name":"P.

Otrzymane odpowiedzi pozwoliły opracować wnioski, do wykorzystania zarówno przez nauczycieli, jak i przez producentów środków dydaktycznych. Na podstawie wcześniejszych analiz przeprowadzonych badań stwierdzono, że potrzebne są działania badawcze w jednym z najbardziej aktualnych obszarów, czyli temacie kompetencji cyfrowych w edukacji szkolnej, także w kontekście proksemiki. Badanie przeprowadzono, ale w okresie pandemii. Wyniki stanowią ciekawy materiał do dalszych dociekań relacji interpersonalnych w kontekście proksemiki w odmiennych warunkach czasowo-przestrzennych. We współczesnej szkole, mimo trudności związanych z pandemią, należy tak działać, by stała się ona miejscem, w którym uczniowie dobrze się czują, pomagają sobie oraz darzą szacunkiem i zaufaniem nauczycieli.

The received responses allowed for the development of conclusions to be used by both teachers and producers of teaching aids. The previous analyzes of the conducted\nresearch indicated that it is advisable to conduct research in one of the most current areas, i.e. the topic of digital competences in school education, also in the context of proxemics. The study was conducted, but during the pandemic period. The results of this study are interesting material for further investigations of interpersonal relations in the context of proxemics in different time-space conditions. In a modern school, despite the difficulties associated with the pandemic, it is necessary to act in such a way that it becomes a place where students feel good, help each other and give respect and trust to teachers. Every effort should be made to shape proper relations between their individual entities. And the research carried out with preliminary results, we indicate which distances are most often adopted in the course of educating digital competences."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138763","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"142-168","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"IMPLEMENTATION OF DIGITAL COMPETENCES IN THE EDUCATION PROCESS IN THE CONTEXT OF PROXEMICS DURING A PANDEMIC – A FEW REMARKS"}],"publicUri":"http://www.ers.byd.pl/id,1/strona-glowna","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62b411d84097070c59397a01","name":"Kazimierz","lastName":"Mikulski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"94fbb4ae-4842-40e4-aedc-9c30c2e123f1"},{"objectId":"62b411d84097070c59397a00","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Mikołajczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f7c709c2-37e8-4b78-950a-7397011f4fec"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a9a7","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Królikowski","uuid":"F8C1C3F17D842D6F57F4B096BB0E6E864C1D4002F5B184CAACD3D8413CA7E4A849354D006ADF10130E4FFD85B680266842E946C70C23E066C76997FE62145593","orcidId":"0000-0003-0247-6478","documentHash":"38adad5d-e413-455b-b73d-d92d6d2d0715"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Online-only Learning During the COVID-19 Pandemic : What Determines Accounting Students' Engagement?","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d54878c28514547a753","mniswId":"200221","title":"Zeszyty Teoretyczne Rachunkowości","doi":null,"issn":"1641-4381","eissn":"2391-677X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b84ad150-ca9f-442d-a9ca-f7b73a1063ae"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-03-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AFTER_PUBLICATION","months":1},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6247336c2467f01c21e72f2f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709207878c28a04738ec82","5e709207878c28a04738ecb4","5e7093c6878c28a0473b09a7","6247336c2467f01c21e72f33"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058138769","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ztr.skwp.pl/resources/html/article/details?id=228684","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6247336c2467f01c21e72f33","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Zarzycka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d1f9fe51-719e-4f9e-9e56-7e70b37edb94"},{"objectId":"5e7093c6878c28a0473b09a7","name":"MONIKA","lastName":"TUREK-RADWAN","uuid":"90483662B352AB6DDE797A5CCE2DA019DC761DEF0EA99108108DC9E20529754669C00899B8426B7ED5DD5D9C916C91CEB13E485A5AE7DED47037410400749B37","orcidId":"0000-0002-5166-7476","documentHash":"05eb8e6b-d89f-4404-a7a9-8f5c7b6964c8"},{"objectId":"5e709207878c28a04738ecb4","name":"ANNA","lastName":"MAZURCZAK-MĄKA","uuid":"4F6793DAE462B8A4F8AB22B3BBEE46D67F86E557A2DC6DDDAF3C173BC162BCD9388DFC894023964CCBFA39D5A6DF164F2D76D9195C2646441CE2A37ACD72532E","orcidId":"0000-0003-1723-5167","documentHash":"c635ef4d-4cd9-4331-89f5-48c6c46aafa5"},{"objectId":"5e709207878c28a04738ec82","name":"JOANNA","lastName":"KRASODOMSKA","uuid":"81D9DAFC2A219B5A6B2B7BACE79ADB827E7D93A63ED5287A1FF7D7765557BD4521865E50DE59F9144078D43ED5917A8E4FF33C8A2754B452B6352A419FBB3358","orcidId":"0000-0001-8423-678X","documentHash":"10f1220d-742a-4b5f-bc94-07eed4e7c559"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62b31646409707737cf67161","doi":null,"title":"Odkrywanie tajemnic polszczyzny biblijnej.

Precise magnetotransport measurements are here implemented to achieve carrier mobility distribution that gives insight into types and characteristics of carrier species. ITO thin films with various sheet resistance of ≈10, 75, and 350 Ω sq−1, respectively, are examined at near-room temperature. Unimodal mobility distribution is revealed in ITO films, independently on their resistivity, with no evidence of unseparated contributions from surface or interface states. The electron mobility varies depending on ITO's resistivity, ranging from 36.8 to 47.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 300 K. Importantly, no minority hole conduction is present. The ITO thin films exhibit solely bulk-like conduction with an absence of parallel conductions. In addition, the existence of single-type electron population in ITO that can be viewed as an important validation of exclusively donor-type defects and/or impurities contributing to total ITO conductivity is experimentally confirmed. These results indicate that ITO can be viewed as an integrated counterpart for photonic metadevices."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138777","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"2200170","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/pssr.202200170","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094ef878c28a0473c73f7","name":"Alessandro","lastName":"Pianelli","uuid":"B69027FCBB06A5ABC23B5F41FEFFBFFFA5D342E0DD4BA7436A1B9574ADBB7669DF2F8BDEADDDECB8B5E729A4830ED3DCDA98BEF1613DB1FC8E631FA0852B11FE","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b06d1b15-fba5-4482-8e38-562732ee13b8"},{"objectId":"5e7094d6878c28a0473c4ecf","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Złotnik","uuid":"184AEB8256C2E4D5B5629E419591475CDCAF0301837DAA18DE691902D0BB118FE5F90E69CB097D094657B0C8293E3A2BC41B96F9F13620A9D6421127EC267C80","orcidId":"0000-0003-3891-5209","documentHash":"3aeda084-072d-46ac-92fd-b9dfdc5b9eee"},{"objectId":"5e709451878c28a0473ba617","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Boguski","uuid":"9FCC323CD9BE39C185B39C9C0E5886E4F9DFBB816F4D99705BEB0A0A37F3AEDA8854B8CCF0A9916EBB304A67FA7F22D7312C3237B733632529D926AA4603D513","orcidId":"0000-0001-8643-4894","documentHash":"d16b1cd1-3fe3-4e8e-9277-4eaa85c8a2c2"},{"objectId":"5e709428878c28a0473b74c1","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Wróbel","uuid":"F82B0F03B1050CB4395CA27AD5F12FD365DA151278ADD2A84CA06391AE837337D5E609AC10DBCBAEDB08EBD62020559269D07AD616DB95BA2542428213D3ADB1","orcidId":"0000-0002-6385-3399","documentHash":"2c124a17-0b12-4ac5-9de6-8bbe30dd2eb3"},{"objectId":"5e7092a8878c28a04739a162","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Moszczyński","uuid":"881D1467ADB701EF5589FB95D0DCC603F90E2E7FA193D649E2CCE13031576C9E37D700BD69F162FDB09F0EEB8BC6A03784C8D9A65E03CE9BFD3DF401B0DE4D83","orcidId":"0000-0001-9034-0698","documentHash":"bb2a7e8a-f497-42eb-b16c-0cff3ac014aa"},{"objectId":"5e7092a8878c28a04739a146","name":"Marek","lastName":"Kojdecki","uuid":"E6FDDB7DD72B4B1D1590DD9F9D7CF9D6FFD16A1C6F479532AEE3F281967F00C68185E8296ADC8E0BC14C66BAD6D5A70A73ADA8B40351DCE4FD87BD4079CCE2F0","orcidId":"0000-0002-4044-0591","documentHash":"17e9470b-0984-4d5f-955b-0b6994567849"},{"objectId":"5e7092a5878c28a047399cbc","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Parka","uuid":"22AB51D91377C3782B6DF789C0C2BA33A76A0B461B18E4585AFEA25AF41AFBC68C2E8F67EC9E0E0EFB2EC08A0C22C22BDF63F49A1A839F68578ACE73FB585870","orcidId":"0000-0003-2140-0452","documentHash":"f2a23eb3-1831-4c09-867f-4cdbff0aa623"}],"doi":"10.1002/pssr.202200170"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["wetlands","bioremediation","bacteria","underground coal gasification (UCG)","industrial wastewater"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decd","uid":"bDVT6eE951oVevqx9vwsANA","uuid":"52307719-d5a8-4e16-8c65-acc1f011e9bb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decd","parentUuid":"52307719-d5a8-4e16-8c65-acc1f011e9bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decd","rootUuid":"52307719-d5a8-4e16-8c65-acc1f011e9bb","name":"Główny Instytut Górnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a2878c28a0473ae2d1","5e7093bd878c28a0473afee0"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Are Wetlands as an Integrated Bioremediation System Applicable for the Treatment of Wastewater from Underground Coal Gasification Processes?","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1073","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-17","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62b16e3c409707603911494c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70937f878c28a0473ab0eb","5e7093a2878c28a0473ae2d1","5e70937d878c28a0473aaf73","5e7093bd878c28a0473afee0","62b16e3c4097076039114952"]},"issue":"12","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Underground coal gasification (UCG) can be considered as one of the clean coal technologies. During the process, the gas of industrial value is produced, which can be used to produce heat and electricity, liquid fuels or can replace natural gas in chemistry. However, UCG does carry some environmental risks, mainly related to potential negative impacts on surface and groundwater. Wastewater and sludge from UCG contain significant amounts of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, phenols, ammonia, cyanides and hazardous metals such as arsenic. This complicated matrix containing high concentrations of hazardous pollutants is similar to wastewater from the coke industry and, similarly to them, requires complex mechanical, chemical and biological treatment. The focus of the review is to explain how the wetlands systems, described as one of bioremediation methods, work and whether these systems are suitable for removing organic and inorganic contaminants from heavily contaminated industrial wastewater, of which underground coal gasification wastewater is a particularly challenging example. Wetlands appear to be suitable systems for the treatment of UCG wastewater and can provide the benefits of nature-based solutions. This review explains the principles of constructed wetlands (CWs) and provides examples of industrial wastewater treated by various wetland systems along with their operating principles.

this paper, the problems of development of associations of territorial communities in the tourism direction of economic development are considered.\n\nThe object of research is the improvement of territorial communities on the example of Ukraine. One of the most problematic places is the lack of funds for the development of existing large tourist complexes and the creation of new ones.\n\nThe study uses the idea that tourism development has a direct stimulating effect on the development of a number of important economic sectors. The use of a mathematical apparatus is also considered, which allows to analyze the main factors influencing the development of the tourism industry of territorial communities. A comprehensive solution of economic, social and environmental issues of sustainable tourism development is impossible without the development of mathematical models and supporting tools that allow predicting the main indicators of sustainable tourism development. The paper considers PLS-PM modeling using such internal consistency criteria as Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient, Dillon-Goldstein coefficient ρ, model reliability, mean variance. The purpose of the PLS-PM model is to obtain estimates of latent variables for further forecasting procedures for the development of the system. The processes taking place in the tourism industry are characterized by a complex interaction of economic, environmental and social factors. Their influence should be taken into account for the implementation of the sustainable tourism development strategy. The analysis of the model was also carried out with the help of a single coefficient of quality of the correspondence of the data model, which characterizes the quality of the internal and external models of the system.\n\nThanks to the listed tools, the statement is formed that the regulation of key factors of the tourism sector of the economic sector can have a positive impact on the development of national culture and economy in the united territorial communities. The created mathematical model clearly forms the conclusion that the development of tourism in local communities can become the engine of their sustainable economic development, given the available regional conditions."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138787","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b448494097070c593bb3c2","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"2(64)","doi":"","documentHash":"59c06ab9-6e53-48b2-bbea-ee0eef6b884b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"21-30","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/tarp/article/download/254273/251692","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62b44b584097070c593bc76f","name":"Nazar","lastName":"Oleksiv","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7821-3522","documentHash":"77b6e996-e57e-4277-bc42-df3ebd28ade4"},{"objectId":"62b44b584097070c593bc76e","name":"Vasyl","lastName":"Lytvyn","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9676-0180","documentHash":"e9b874ad-cd2d-43c3-9426-2412f6945bd3"},{"objectId":"62b44b584097070c593bc76d","name":"Roman","lastName":"Bihun","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4363-4532","documentHash":"30c1243c-c925-43a7-b551-02ddbb0fa89f"}],"doi":"10.15587/2706-5448.2022.254273"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Przemysł lotniczy"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","uid":"bABmAiyO82JgMB2LqzOepAg","uuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","parentUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","rootUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","name":"Akademia Sztuki Wojennej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70926d878c28a04739588e","5e709481878c28a0473bea7c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Tools of Corporate Social Responsibility in Aviation Industry","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":{"objectId":"62441d212467f070c45d6207","doi":null,"title":"XIII Eurasian Conference on Language and Social Sciences : Proceedings Book","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-605-71031-4-7","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://sin.akademia.mil.pl/publications/details/i7196","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"284d5581-6343-4220-9ea7-4945b24ef64c","publisher":null,"openAccess":null},"_version":4,"objectId":"62454d7a2467f01551373ad5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":"624410c82467f070c45d19c4","mniswId":null,"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"fullName":"Eurasian Conference on Language and Social Sciences","shortName":"ECLSS2022a","city":null,"country":null,"website":"https://www.eclss.org/","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"fd0a0ac1-c021-4b23-9b46-4098890e6083"},"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70926d878c28a04739588e","5e709481878c28a0473bea7c"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058138789","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"62441dd62467f070c45d6355","mniswId":null,"startDate":"2022-02-05","endDate":"2022-02-06","fullName":"13th Eurasian Conference on Language and Social Sciences","shortName":"13th ECLSS","city":"Daugavpils","country":"LV","website":"https://www.eclss.org/","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"d6609541-1b3c-4914-b3b0-cc1c7f9ceb86"},"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"827 -

The academics raised and educated abroad are often perceived as a key nexus in the knowledge transfer and innovative economy in the global academic supercenters, such as the USA, Canada, or Germany. On the contrary, this paper argues that in Eastern Europe, the role of foreign-born academics is very different. Due to structural factors such as a limited number of potential entrepreneurs, the traditional academic entrepreneurship in the form of spin-offs and start-ups is virtually nonexistent. Some academics, however, get involved in academic entrepreneurial activities in the broader sense of this term. Based on 140 individual in-depth interviews and selected success stories, the paper argues that in Poland and Slovakia, special circumstances have created characteristic forms of entrepreneurship (e.g., the “academization” of industrial knowledge).

aim of this study was to determine the impact of the introduction of Pinus sylvestris on the mesofauna of the forest floor in the Central European oak-hornbeam forest, using gastropods as a model group. Data on terrestrial gastropods and environmental variables were collected in 2012–2014 from 25 study plots (14 without pine and 11 with pine) at 14 localities scattered across Wielkopolska province in mid-western Poland. Forty-two species (34 of snails and 8 of slugs) were recorded, with significantly lower numbers of individuals and species in plots with pine. The negative effect of the presence of pine trees was most evident at the level of gastropod abundance. The species composition of gastropod assemblage was also significantly different between plots with and without pine. The symptoms of the assemblage’s reduction, impoverishment and trivialization thus suggested a long-term effect of the introduced pine on natural mesofauna. However, gastropod assemblage was shaped not by one dominating factor, but by a multifactorial combination of interacting variables, particularly related to herbaceous vegetation and to the tree- and shrub layer. Herb layer cover, moisture (reflected in the herbs), fertility (reflected in the herbs), and locally also the amount of calcium in the soil and insolation were found to be significant for the structure of gastropod assemblages. More environmental variables were significant at the sample level (i.e. within forest) than at the plot level (i.e. between forests), which is likely to be due to greater variation in the conditions within a rich forest as opposed to lower variation between forests. This highlighted the importance of using a two-scale approach to understand the conditions affecting gastropod assemblage structure in a habitat that is seemingly homogenous on the macro scale, but diversified and mosaic in the micro scale. The negative effects of pine introduction and the positive significance of the multifactorial combination of habitat factors at the macro- and micro level appear as important guidelines for favourable biodiversity management in the Central European oak-hornbeam forest and in other broadleaved forests."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138804","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"507","pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64098ecd40970770356bebfa","name":"Anna","lastName":"Jankowiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c7f5ccdc-85ef-4969-af07-6aeefd4bd765"},{"objectId":"5ffebd42085dcb0e357dcd28","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Rawlik","uuid":"650EDCAF2566F3DE1BDC37442DBC9D74B15FD23887DB7ED9EFE77D05491E679A821EF507C11DB1262954B13D6343B9A5F3574D11A868F347318E7F2D4360FB8D","orcidId":"0000-0003-4177-7396","documentHash":"dbc9cf78-2bde-47af-a3ff-184635d49a17"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a64de","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Gołdyn","uuid":"06229BFBCDB039E0CE857168DC136E029ECC4C7FDD6337836C395D6119F434AD6BCC1DBAF07B03705D90891F93926061D61A2197D6E020452444BAF6DD4E2528","orcidId":"0000-0002-5470-6709","documentHash":"749a0247-825d-4b6a-aaf8-53e894eb5b12"},{"objectId":"5e7092ef878c28a04739f7af","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Bernard","uuid":"06D4113F7AC58BB7AC0E4AE037CFB5DAAF516B15F139100248C03ED9C3BED15370395B235065348C70AC9ED87DFA4C1223395860F636D1E0F4D806AF7EB940F4","orcidId":"0000-0001-7167-262X","documentHash":"084bfc98-535c-4225-8fa4-c6d8464b0911"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.foreco.2021.119981"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Pływanie","Prędkość","Fizjologia człowieka","Cykle treningowe","Wysiłek fizyczny","Obciążenie treningowe","Sportowcy 14-15 r. ż.","Testy"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Swimming velocity","Body physiology","Training macrocycle","Stationary bicycle","Effort","Training load"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","uid":"bqEBivGW4eOgmsFFDSCuw-g","uuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","parentUuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de48","rootUuid":"8e6fd560-b45b-4671-9450-14036044949b","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego i Sportu im.

The reason is that each of them uses different indirect energy sources and uses different percentage proportions of ST to FT muscle tissues. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of 5-months training macrocycle on physiological parameters of swimmers aged 14,6±0,89 years. All of chosen competitors trained swimming in the same team in the same sports club. They underwent physiological test evaluating mostly their cardiovascular and respiratory parameters and maximum velocity swimming test on 200m freestyle distance. The swimming velocity test took place during Polish Junior Swimming Championships. The subjects made an effort at Monark stationary bicycle. On the basis of obtained results the following was observed: different correlation level between the swimming velocity and individual researched values, lowering the average recovery rate and increasing the average BFmax value on the statistically significant levels. The competitors after the training period on average shortened their recovery time. It is caused most probably by the improvement of work of blood buffers. Swimmers in competitions have to swim in numerous races at a short period of time. Carried out research shows the direction of many features and competitors’ current training level. The recovery rate has changed.

The article investigates the dynamic models of the information protection system in social networks taking into account the clustering coefficient, and also analyzes the stability of the protection system. In graph theory, the clustering factor is a measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to group together. The available data suggest that in most real networks, and in particular in social networks, nodes tend to form closely related groups with a relatively high density of connections. It is probability is greater than the average probability of a random connection between two nodes. There are two variants of this term: global and local. The global version was created for a general idea of network clustering, while the local one describes the nesting of individual nodes. There is a practical interest in studying the behavior of the system of protection of social networks from the value of the clustering factor.\n\nDynamic systems of information protection in social networks in the mathematical sense of this term are considered. A dynamic system is understood as any object or process for which the concept of state as a set of some quantities at a given moment of time is unambiguously defined and a given law is described that describes the change (evolution) of the initial state over time. This law allows the initial state to predict the future state of a dynamic system. It is called the law of evolution.\n\nThe study is based on the nonlinearity of the social network protection system. To solve the system of nonlinear equations used: the method of exceptions, the joint solution of the corresponding homogeneous characteristic equation. Since the differential of the protection function has a positive value in some data domains (the requirement of Lyapunov's theorem for this domain is not fulfilled), an additional study of the stability of the protection system within the operating parameters is required. Phase portraits of the data protection system in MatLab/Multisim are determined, which indicate the stability of the protection system in the operating range of parameters even at the maximum value of influences."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138811","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b448494097070c593bb3c2","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"2(64)","doi":"","documentHash":"59c06ab9-6e53-48b2-bbea-ee0eef6b884b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"31-37","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/tarp/article/download/255962/253244","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62b450974097070c593be9ab","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Akhramovych","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6174-5300","documentHash":"bc2025a0-c019-4f0a-9f98-903e17d93555"}],"doi":"10.15587/2706-5448.2022.255962"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["termografia","lifting twarzy","temperatura twarzy"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["thermography","facelifting","rhytidectomy","face temperature"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f904","uid":"b-dVC0u-RjNqrAsvGpjkhlQ","uuid":"3348e621-0eba-4caf-8fab-743d1175a23f","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","parentUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","rootUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","name":"Instytut Nauk o Kulturze Fizycznej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928f878c28a047397e78"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The use of thermography as an auxiliary method for monitoring convalescence after facelift surgery : a case study","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e9","mniswId":"8892","title":"International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","doi":null,"issn":"1661-7827","eissn":"1660-4601","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e236e16e-7430-4ac3-800c-033637860e22"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-20","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"624be9682467f040ca9a5076","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092a7878c28a047399f9d","5e70928f878c28a047397e78","6661a1204097074fa1bcc59b","5e70928f878c28a047397e72"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Although IR thermography is widely used in medical diagnostics, there are no reports that describe the use of IR thermography in the evaluation of post-plastic-surgery regeneration processes.

During the study and in order to monitor the convalescence process, the patient had a series of face thermograms performed before surgery and up to the 6th week after it. The healing process after surgery was multidirectional for the contralateral areas of the face, leading to thermal asymmetry lasting up to the 3rd week of convalescence. The lowest Tmean values for ROIs were recorded in week 3 of the study and then they gradually increased, in week 6 after surgery, to the following values: chin = 33.1 ± 0.72 °C; cheek left = 33.0 ± 0.26 °C; cheek right = 33.2 ± 0.51 °C; ZFL = 33.8 ± 0.45 °C; ZFR = 33.6 ± 0.74 °C; ZLL = 32.6 ±0.55 °C; ZLR = 32.3 ± 0.32 °C.

In the acclimatization and invasion of alien tree species, the crucial role is played by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. We tested ECM fungi associated with Quercus rubra and Carya trees that are alien to Europe. Quercus rubra is among the most invasive tree species in Europe, and the Carya species are not considered invasive. Both form ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, and in their native range in North America, coexist in oakhickory forests. Six study stands were located in Kórnik Arboretum: three for Q. rubra and three for Carya trees. Ectomycorrhizal fungi were assessed by molecular identification of ECM roots. We identified 73 ECM fungal taxa of 23 ECM phylogenetic lineages. All identified ECM fungi were native to Europe. Similar richness but different composition of ECM taxa were found on Q. rubra and Carya roots. Phylogenetic lineages /tomentella-thelephora, /russula-lactarius, and /genea-humaria were most abundant on both Carya and Q. rubra roots. Lineages /tuber-helvella and /entoloma were abundant only on Carya, and lineages /pisolithus-scleroderma and /cortinarius were abundant only on Q. rubra roots. Analysis of similarities revealed a significant difference in ectomycorrhizal assemblages between invasive Q. rubra and non-invasive Carya.

For 81 athletes-wrestlers (men) (19.41±1.66 years), the parameters of the tone of paravertebral muscles (TPM) of the reflexogenic vascular zones of С3-Тh8 segments and the indices of spirometry at rest, after presentation of a vestibular load (Series-1), after the combined action of active traction rotational muscle relaxation (ATRM) and vestibular load (Series-2) were studied. It was shown that vestibular loads increase the tone of the cervical muscles in wrestlers by 4.72-11.54% (p<0.05). After the combined action of ATRM with vestibular loads, there was a significant decrease in myotonus at the VG15 point: up to 19.12% (p<0.001). In Series-2, the constants of the respiratory system significantly increased: vital lung capacity (VC) by 4.55% (p<0.01), maximum lung ventilation (MVV) by 6.55% (p<0.01) with a decrease in frequency respiration RR by 26.41% (p<0.001) and an increase in respiratory volume by 15.19% (p<0.01), which indicates an increase in the efficiency and effectiveness of breathing under conditions of vestibular loads. The method can be used in training process, sports medicine and physical rehabilitation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138826","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b2e751409707737cf24939","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"c1e696fe-e26e-4ae0-8841-7cb846c7a82c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"41-44","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.tpfk.ru/index.php/TPPC/article/view/205/177","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62b2e751409707737cf24936","name":"N.

Wynikają one z lokalizacji na niewielkich działkach, konieczności uwzględnienia zaleceń konserwatorskich, a także konieczności indywidualnego projektowania konstrukcji budynków celem dostosowania do sąsiadującej zabudowy. Celem artykułu jest określenie swoistych cech kształtowania budynków plombowych oraz znaczenia urbanistycznych i konserwatorskich uwarunkowań ich projektowania w śródmiejskiej strukturze miast na Górnym Śląsku."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138830","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63a4254240970710a6dad4fc","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"294","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"8f66d226-4202-44e9-b238-dfb0463d6a58"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"294","pagesFromTo":"16-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5604/01.3001.0015.5821","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d8878c28a04739e0c3","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Grzybowski","uuid":"5C6F097F525F42E1362D9DCE57303A8A2AB473CC8C08969F22810F99EFE9EDCFBC85626D18A14491EF81B309D0531F3845EB898D06F68019C050F38BFF2A6F88","orcidId":"0000-0002-6048-6562","documentHash":"ba55f565-8102-4866-923a-b36bfaf0f349"}],"doi":"10.5604/01.3001.0015.5821"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62b2bd6a409707737cef9d47","doi":null,"title":"Z pogranicza pedagogiki ogólnej i teorii wychowania społecznego.

Internet and mobile technologies have changed our way of both doing business and dealing with our daily routine activities. Researchers have increasingly focused on the impact of the level Internet, i.e. mobile Internet level on national economies. Mobile Internet rapidly been integrated not only into people’s daily lives, but also into the daily lives of companies, organizations, administration. The aim of the present research is to perform a statistical study and assessment of the level of mobile Internet development in Latvia in the context of the EU countries in the period from 2014 to 2019 years. The Mobile Connectivity Index measures performance of 150 countries according the four key enablers of mobile Internet connectivity: infrastructure (i.e., the availability of high-performance mobile internet network coverage), affordability (i.e., availability of mobile services and devices at price points that reflect the level of income across a national population), consumer readiness (i.e., citizens with the awareness and skills needed to value and use the internet) and content (i.e., availability of secure online content and services accessible and relevant to the local population). The study analyzes the impact of the Mobile Connectivity Index on the Latvian economic growth, makes recommendations for improving the Internet and mobile technologies as an endogenous factor of economic development."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138836","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6235d1ab2467f02da152c4e5","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"9","number":"3","doi":"","documentHash":"48537cc0-8854-46bb-89fd-aca5ab897107"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"9","pagesFromTo":"369-383","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.9770/jesi.2022.9.3(22)","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6246a4242467f0368b88e6da","name":"Oleg","lastName":"Rybalkin","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7310-4594","documentHash":"d381694f-7251-44f9-8508-087c96d94b44"},{"objectId":"6246a4242467f0368b88e6d9","name":"Vladimir","lastName":"Menshikov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-9988-8588","documentHash":"8d05ad86-5342-45b0-8571-6c07f2250e85"},{"objectId":"6246a4242467f0368b88e6d8","name":"Alina","lastName":"Danileviča","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2749-2725","documentHash":"52bb5883-4424-4abc-a44b-cd92419dbaf1"},{"objectId":"6246a4242467f0368b88e6d7","name":"Svetlana","lastName":"Ignatjeva","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3608-8409","documentHash":"3c3bb94b-a5b4-40c7-a8b6-6c9ca2178f33"},{"objectId":"6246a4242467f0368b88e6d6","name":"Olga","lastName":"Lavrinenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7383-3749","documentHash":"4a5d15aa-020c-4ebe-968d-dd5cb6199b39"},{"objectId":"5e70927a878c28a04739655f","name":"Alina","lastName":"Betlej","uuid":"B64F8303957275F9620B7B98599C187949F041E48DAB80FFC0F8500305AF5570AADA461FD510B6C642AF68C2ABD5550AB36943F6501E9D465D06428E625120DC","orcidId":"0000-0002-2729-6564","documentHash":"55f2cc70-f578-4c62-878b-fd42d1de8b92"}],"doi":"10.9770/jesi.2022.9.3(22)"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62469db52467f0368b88d83c","doi":"10.4324/9781003081562","title":"The Experiences of International Faculty in Institutions of Higher Education: Enhancing Recruitment, Retention, and Integration of International Talent","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"9781003081562","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781003081562","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"84c349b3-56e3-4442-9382-4150f966e027","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb75f","mniswId":"2100","name":"Routledge","documentHash":"e0fe2ae4-db98-48bc-8602-82536879acfd"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","uid":"bLDwoyIU1jG5BHqZ9HzVPQg","uuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","parentUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","rootUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","name":"Wyższa Szkoła Informatyki i Zarządzania z siedzibą w Rzeszowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929a878c28a047398dc6"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"International Scholars in Academic Semi-Peripheries A Sign of Research Excellence or a Remedy for Staff Shortages?","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62469e712467f0368b88da63","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70929a878c28a047398dc6","62469e712467f0368b88da66"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this chapter, we hypothesize that foreign-born employees in Poland are often not a sign of internationalization or research excellence, but rather a remedy for staff shortages experienced by smaller and less prestigious universities. The study is based on an analysis of register data on employees of Polish universities. This chapter is a follow-up to our previous study on the role of international scholars in European semi-peripheries. We identify factors related to a higher share of foreign-born scholars and discuss these in the context of our qualitative research based on semi-structured interviews. The study has demonstrated that academic migrants to Poland are employed more often by universities with a lower academic prestige and located outside the national academic centers. Thus, academic migration patterns in Central Europe are different from these revealed in the studies focused on North America and Western Europe."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138841","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"121-134","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003081562-12/international-scholars-academic-semi-peripheries-kamil-luczaj-miloslav-bahna","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62469e712467f0368b88da66","name":"Miloslav","lastName":"Bahna","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9a912eb5-8a30-422c-b0ef-e7a4e1343085"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398dc6","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Łuczaj","uuid":"752A8636C1B802B60B97E008BBD46A79E6671BF83A47D1AEA80F25DE09ACD96F475A2D4188C0F8F7FECEC29F3E41325A5DC3F8E3F04ADDAB966A2FB7B0E16954","orcidId":"0000-0002-1603-3259","documentHash":"1e707e0d-330c-4fc3-9a76-af30c564b91f"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dimethylpyridine","1","3","4-oxadiazole","cyclooxygenase","cytotoxicity","molecular docking"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

collection of objects associated with prehistoric metallurgy, including casting moulds, a casting core, and a\r\nfragment of a tuyere, were found in three metallurgists’ graves in the Late Bronze Age cemetery in Legnica,\r\nsouth-west Poland. The finds from these graves presented an opportunity for a scientific investigation of several\r\naspects of Bronze Age metallurgy in this region by applying various analytical procedures to characterise the\r\nremains of metals inside the casting moulds. We also analysed metal used for the repair of one of the moulds, and\r\nthe razor from one of the graves that could have been cast in a mould discovered in another grave. One of the\r\naims of this research project was to establish a possible provenance of the metal used by the population buried in\r\nthese so-called metallurgists’ graves using the chemical and lead isotope analysis. The casting moulds had clear\r\nwear marks providing proof of their use. In two cases, the moulds had thick greenish-black layers possibly\r\nrepresenting remains of a corroded metal. The chemical compositions of these layers and metal from two other\r\nartefacts was investigated using ED XRF and SEM EDS. These analyses showed the diversity of the metals used for\r\ncastings. Lead isotope analyses using MC ICP MS provided information about the possible origin of lead in the\r\nremains from the moulds. The most likely source of this lead is from the ores in the Erzgebirge, in eastern\r\nGermany, a few hundred kilometres south west from the site of the graves. The provenance of lead from the razor\r\nand from the repair of the mould can be either from the Erzgebirge or Slovak Ore Mountains, or a mixture of\r\nthese ores."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138847","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"42","pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352409X22000566","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65e5c8984097076263d160bb","name":"Beata","lastName":"Miazga","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a4f4bd6d-169f-4feb-9d57-d35289e04dff"},{"objectId":"65e5c8984097076263d160ba","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Stolarczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b8b345d1-81ec-44e7-979c-237037740c63"},{"objectId":"65e5c8984097076263d160b9","name":"Zofia","lastName":"Stos-Gale","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"41783b21-2f93-4f78-9c7a-763bc0b7c140"},{"objectId":"618c8e397523400e636f7143","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"473B7F677637F96933469980A710CE3C1D256926799796707821997F216B09098F3EDCFBC5D85793540EF63028D013C32F1A3C10FA5990C6A72AB36CE7A04EEE","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"63c72f06-7e6e-4636-82cb-665934a5dd7a"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jasrep.2022.103393"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["apple orchard","evapotranspiration","hydrothermal index","irrigation","rainfall efficiency","soil moisture"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70928b878c28a0473979a2","5e709295878c28a0473986e0","5e709479878c28a0473bdde0","5e709400878c28a0473b4a21"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Assessment of rainfall efficiency in an apple orchard","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a0a5","mniswId":"24534","title":"Journal of Water and Land Development","doi":null,"issn":"1429-7426","eissn":"2083-4535","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"a4c28353-5629-4ead-811e-faca8a6d47ac"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-06-08","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62b2b4c3409707737cef39c8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709295878c28a0473986e0","5e70928b878c28a0473979a2","5e709400878c28a0473b4a21","5e709479878c28a0473bdde0"]},"issue":"IV-VI","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Atmospheric precipitation is the major input to the soil water balance.

The subject of research is models that describe electrical processes in muscles during contraction. The work is aimed at building an analytical model of the skeletal muscle electrical signal, which makes it possible to calculate the spectral density of this signal for further analysis.\n\nResearch methods are methods of mathematical modeling, theory of random processes and signals, methods of spectral analysis, methods of mathematical analysis.\n\nThe model of the electrical signal of the muscle as the sum of random impulse signals corresponding to the signals of motor units is studied in the work. In this regard, a signal is analyzed, which, in contrast to the Gaussian process, is formed by summing a limited number of pulse signals. It is shown that the voltage distribution law of such a signal is expressed by the sum of Gaussian functions. In the course of the study, the structure of the electromyographic signal spectrum was obtained, presented as a sum of periodic pulses shifted in time relative to each other. The relationship between the statistical properties of a random phase difference and the type of signal power spectrum has been analytically established. The obtained theoretical relations make it possible to calculate the spectral density of the electromyographic signal depending on the number of motor units and various phase shifts between them, as well as depending on the chosen law of distribution of random variables. The results of a numerical experiment are presented for a different number of motor units and different ranges of time shifts in the case of a distribution of gauss of the probability density. The results obtained can be used in assessing the degree of dysfunction of skeletal muscles in various injuries (for example, in trauma, atrophy, etc.), as well as in choosing the optimal individual parameters of electrical stimulation during rehabilitation procedures or training processes for increasing muscle mass in athletes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138857","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b448494097070c593bb3c2","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"2(64)","doi":"","documentHash":"59c06ab9-6e53-48b2-bbea-ee0eef6b884b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"38-43","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/tarp/article/download/254566/252226","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62b45a204097070c593c4716","name":"Igor","lastName":"Prasol","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2537-7376","documentHash":"a4a473e8-7559-4d7f-a7a6-8ef44a39158b"},{"objectId":"62b45a204097070c593c4715","name":"Olha","lastName":"Yeroshenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6221-7158","documentHash":"4ce81750-8afe-4475-8768-8b04ef8b2ce6"}],"doi":"10.15587/2706-5448.2022.254566"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Siły powietrzne","Siły zbrojne","Sytuacja kryzysowa","Wojska inżynieryjne","Zarządzanie kryzysowe"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Air forces","Armed forces","Crisis management","Crisis situation","Engineer troops"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","uid":"bABmAiyO82JgMB2LqzOepAg","uuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","parentUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","rootUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","name":"Akademia Sztuki Wojennej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709256878c28a047393f7d","5e7094b8878c28a0473c27a3"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Formacje inżynieryjne Sił powietrznych w systemie zarządzania kryzysowego Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej - diagnoza i propozycje zmian w świetle badań własnych","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa83c9aff2974850cd66","mniswId":"498372","title":"Wiedza Obronna","doi":null,"issn":"0209-0031","eissn":"2658-0829","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"f18b3ba3-3330-475e-ac6d-7cd74569c8ad"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"624aee192467f01ec7fe422e","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709256878c28a047393f7d","5e709285878c28a0473973b6","5e7094b8878c28a0473c27a3"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Artykuł zawiera ocenę obecnego stanu i możliwości wykorzystania formacji inżynieryjnych Sił Powietrznych Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej w ramach zarządzania kryzysowego oraz propozycję ich antycypacyjnego wykorzystania w przedmiotowym zakresie.

These fungi are a frequent cause of infections in humans and animals. Since subterranean ecosystems are inhabited by various animals and are a great tourist attraction, the goal of our research was to provide the first report of keratinophilic and keratinolytic fungal species isolated from three caves in Tatra Mts., Slovakia (Brestovská, Demänovská Ľadová and Demänovská Slobody). Speleomycological investigation was carried out inside and outside the explored caves by combining culture-based techniques with genetic and phenotypic identifications. A total of 67 fungal isolates were isolated from 24 samples of soil and sediment using Vanbreuseghem hair bait and identified as 18 different fungal species. The study sites located inside the studied caves displayed much more fungal species (17 species) than outside the underground (3 species), and the highest values of the Shannon diversity index of keratinophilic and keratinolytic fungi were noted for the study sites inside the Demänovská Slobody Cave. Overall, Arthroderma quadrifidum was the most common fungal species in all soil and/or sediment samples. To the best of our knowledge, our research has allowed for the first detection of fungal species such as Arthroderma eboreum, Arthrodermainsingulare, Chrysosporiumeuropae, Chrysosporiumsiglerae, Keratinophytonwagneri, and Penicillium charlesii in underground sites. We also showed that the temperature of soil and sediments was negatively correlated with the number of isolated keratinophilic and keratinolytic fungal species in the investigated caves."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138870","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/app12031455","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6245712c2467f01c21db24b8","name":"Zuzana","lastName":"Višňovská","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"37dbc598-4ec8-432f-912e-ef4b96d0dca3"},{"objectId":"5e70944a878c28a0473b9c08","name":"Agata","lastName":"Piecuch","uuid":"CFB81A39BECDEE4BA74FE9F7B4F84AAF83025A66EC2219DB034BD7C1B29B071C0E62A948087656DA14709186DC032309F02A06959CFC54F556A6790F4D84488C","orcidId":"0000-0001-7791-8379","documentHash":"16768a6e-b591-4fc3-8e0c-9fab6511d408"},{"objectId":"5e70944a878c28a0473b9bfd","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Przywara","uuid":"3CA73C61C84FB8BC29BC95083C7DFF5232EA02972E20DEDC68B8ED103ADA4E05BD2857C160165D824E4B4D0C52A28855D59AFF91805E435BCFC505FFE81F4154","orcidId":"0000-0003-4482-4784","documentHash":"53343756-bb48-4c37-93e4-c28c7a6d2ddf"},{"objectId":"5e709442878c28a0473b90fe","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Ogórek","uuid":"DC58D14F534EB280F14F1306B53621E4D0E7ECDCE08FFDFC0A9A321A1FAA5FA1DC0542F75EB5E46B86467ECAF6789C2098BEE74A8CE82E7F275B3332638A130C","orcidId":"0000-0003-0564-7797","documentHash":"dd3ad912-238d-4680-b2e9-ba1df0fb1389"},{"objectId":"5e709392878c28a0473acfff","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Suchodolski","uuid":"10895BEF0045ACAFC0D14ED10FFBD94D8228451799024D1CD563E6A329D9633B7BFDDF92B675939A5EFB067320B08182D5A6617D6689DC24059B198D2C35C767","orcidId":"0000-0002-3442-638X","documentHash":"5cee78fd-9cef-4986-9556-d7200ba3a5af"}],"doi":"10.3390/app12031455"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["media, information security, COVID-19, coronavirus, sense of security of individuals, information"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6249f1be2467f07bede1a82a","doi":null,"title":"Information, Security and Society in the COVID-19 Pandemic","year":2023,"volume":null,"isbn":"9781032314426","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://www.routledge.com/Information-Security-and-Society-in-the-COVID-19-Pandemic/Moch-Wereda-Stanczyk/p/book/9781032314426#","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"3f98f985-bdd6-4f7f-aa97-09160f1ca449","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb75f","mniswId":"2100","name":"Routledge","documentHash":"64cc346c-fb88-4618-a71a-f3105e672a66"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b6878c28a047385e24","uid":"bITc4cttztoiiv973rXfccw","uuid":"9d48cae3-39ad-462a-8216-ad67ec5520ed","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wydział Bezpieczeństwa, Logistyki i Zarządzania","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709460878c28a0473bbb9f","5e70929a878c28a047398e84"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"The role of media in providing information, recommendations and human informational security","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6249f3ce2467f07bede1b32d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709460878c28a0473bbb9f","5e70929a878c28a047398e84"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The chapter aims to determine the contribution of the media in providing information and recommendations during the COVID-19 pandemic as a factor decisive for human information security. \nGermane to achieve the purpose is the examined empirical data correlating primary research utilizing the survey method and the survey technique, and the secondary data employing the desk research.\nHuman information security is the capacity to obtain the right quality information and protect it from loss. Especially the first issue takes on special significance in crises. The COVID-19 pandemic emphasizes the importance of a globalized world in which the media, especially virtual ones, become the primary source of information and a relay of recommendations for dealing with threats situations. High dynamics of growth of information from media, which we deal with during a pandemic, the appearance of contradictory information, and so-called fake news can generate difficulties in knowing which information is relevant. As a consequence, in turn, negatively affects the sense of information security of the individual.\nThe efficiency of the media's role as an information relay and recommendations in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic on human information security has not yet been entirely determined. In the information society era, in which data and information and communication technologies play a significant role in shaping the sense of security of individuals, there has not yet been a crisis on such a large scale. Meanwhile, in the current situation, it is the media that play an essential role in increasing the awareness of people around the world about the threat of a coronavirus pandemic and will probably play one of the most critical roles in helping people adapt to the new post-pandemic reality."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138874","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.routledge.com/Information-Security-and-Society-in-the-COVID-19-Pandemic/Moch-Wereda-Stanczyk/p/book/9781032314426#","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709460878c28a0473bbb9f","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Moch","uuid":"7B7F5A5DDF9D4F94D7018BD4686E549F2AD95109E5EF78B4A3DDAA4E91B2E37A4DD8CA53CD828ADD0C5ADD8C4E87888711882451CE6FB1FA79ECC74DF73704C8","orcidId":"0000-0003-2177-0883","documentHash":"0374ee30-ef6e-411f-9a08-aac00d44976b"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398e84","name":"Wioletta","lastName":"Wereda","uuid":"B5848E54465D0916DAB7421C3CFA86A5A5FD26597B22E0D6F06A7A6516BF4D8592DA63BE60E589502DCAADB26E780BCED4FFD7C9995147619418BA06669260AB","orcidId":"0000-0002-6948-0239","documentHash":"46c8b0bc-2b48-475e-97c8-937615472852"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-66951-27-3","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70921c878c28a0473901c1"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Z pogranicza pedagogiki ogólnej i teorii wychowania społecznego.

It has multiple implications\r\nas single individuals often live and behave diferently than those living in relationships. Marital status and socioeco‑\r\nnomic status may also be signifcant quality of life factors for single persons. The aim of this study is to identify rela‑\r\ntionships between quality of life and selected indicators of socioeconomic status in single and married respondents\r\nfrom the Wrocław metropolitan area in Poland.\r\nMethods: 4460 respondents took part in the study (1828 single, 2632 married). The study was cross-sectional based\r\non a diagnostic survey. Data was gathered on respondents’ sex, age, education, marital status, occupational status and\r\nfnancial situation as well as their quality of life and perceived health condition. Frequencies (f ) and relative frequen‑\r\ncies (rf ) of categories of dependent and independent variables were determined. The chi-squared test (χ2\r\n) and odds\r\nratio (OR) statistics were applied. The level of statistical signifcance was set at α=.05.\r\nResults: A stochastic dependence (p≤.05) between marital status and perceived health condition and quality of life\r\nin the social domain was found among the respondents. Male sex, higher education, being an entrepreneur, college\r\nstudent or white-collar worker, and good fnancial status were associated with the highest assessments of quality of\r\nlife and perceived health condition. The directions of quality of life modifcations determined by socioeconomic status\r\nwere similar in single and married urban respondents; however, the strength of these modifcations was greater in the\r\nlatter.\r\nConclusions: It is recommended to target respondents with public health programs aimed at lifestyle improvement,\r\ntailored to the needs of single and married individuals. Public policies directed at improving education and material\r\nsituation of respondents are also worth considering, as they may be essential for modeling their quality of life. In addi‑\r\ntion, research on quality of life should be continued, which is particularly relevant in a pandemic situation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138877","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65c3583c4097074c89db97f6","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"20","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"d616be3f-64f3-4b7f-9559-da559d2363f7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"20","pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6580a3504097076c14b1fb3f","name":"Marek","lastName":"Bugdol","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e47bd9cb-5cfe-4ce2-a95e-c1b6c87e5f56"},{"objectId":"5e709309878c28a0473a18cb","name":"Michał","lastName":"Rozpara","uuid":"6D0CEA798A4AA651EAADB8D8CCD68310F928D94C6F0C972E34010E78EC508796D8919037ADFF7F8A74BD5893167EBF414275E27C7EE19C05CFCCB9413B13A66C","orcidId":"0000-0003-3571-6677","documentHash":"a6696782-3b9e-4cc0-840e-322fc7ec0015"},{"objectId":"5e70927d878c28a0473969a3","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Mróz-Gorgoń","uuid":"0B8F84721C5DF20E9863E3236FD43E7515033F86AA95B04F7439D8F174A97C52D44805A0FEE358CF5956BA41F9ED0D569DB0D34A68BDCDDA4E75876DB6136404","orcidId":"0000-0001-9116-485X","documentHash":"05c44b03-ae91-4c77-9283-d6baf94a21be"},{"objectId":"5e70920f878c28a04738f37a","name":"Daniel","lastName":"Puciato","uuid":"9A0386B9437B7F09BE237EEF749980D8BAC7F884B83D05E3DF0B5F98430621D48F3103BEB247054AA8EDC7DD84DF80B697A5FF2061F2D5FDE34B9F88B70394D7","orcidId":"0000-0002-2390-6038","documentHash":"a6a7d357-6af8-4cfb-b71d-20fbb1119d44"}],"doi":"10.1186/s12955-022-01966-2"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Alumino-silicate glasses","Ce3+/Tm3+ ions","Sol-gel method","Optical materials","Radiation resistance"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922e878c28a047391444"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Influence of Ce3+ ion on optical properties and radiation resistance in Ce3+/Tm3+-co-doped alumino-silicate glasses.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d62878c28514547f320","mniswId":"28377","title":"Optical Materials: X","doi":null,"issn":"2590-1478","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"3097944a-d56d-42a4-97bb-1adb9764d878"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2021-11-12","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62b571df4097077f6d5a7c75","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70922e878c28a047391444","62b571df4097077f6d5a7c77","62b571df4097077f6d5a7c78","62b571df4097077f6d5a7c79","62b571df4097077f6d5a7c7a","62b571df4097077f6d5a7c7b","62b571df4097077f6d5a7c7c","62b571df4097077f6d5a7c7d"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Several Ce<sup>3+</sup>/Tm<sup>3+</sup>-co-doped alumino-silicate glasses with various Ce<sup>3+</sup>/Tm<sup>3+</sup> ratios were prepared by a sol-gel method combined with vacuum sintering. To determine their radiation resistance, the glasses were exposed to 1 and 100 kGy γ-ray. The effect of the Ce<sup>3+</sup>/Tm<sup>3+</sup> ratio on the absorption, emission and fluorescence lifetime of the glasses under investigation, was examined before and after irradiation. The Ce<sup>4+</sup> and Ce<sup>3+</sup> cations were detected and the nature of Si-E′ and AlOHC color centers caused by irradiation was identified by radiation-induced absorption (RIA) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy.

aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of a two-dose approach in the administration of tocilizumab in patients with SARS COVID19\n\nMaterial and methods. The study was carried out on the basis of the Odrex Medical House in 2000-2021. The total sample included 4,112 patients hospitalized in a specialized department with coronavirus pneumonia. Of this sample, 150 patients were prescribed tocilizumab at a dose of 8 mg/kg of patient weight, including 36 (24.0 %) cases when tocilizumab was administered in a two-dose regimen. In the case of a two-dose regimen, the second dose was administered no earlier than 24 hours after the first one.\n\nAll patients were examined according to the current clinical protocols. The hemogram, the content of CRP, ferritin, interleukin-6 were assessed. All patients received dexamethasone intramuscularly at a dose of at least 6 mg per day.\n\nStatistical processing was carried out by methods of analysis of variance using the software Statistica 13.0.\n\nResults. After the use of tocilizumab, the patients had a decrease in body temperature and a decrease in the need for oxygen support. At the same time, the normalization of indicators of the activity of the systemic inflammatory response was observed.\n\nMortality after the use of tocilizumab was 29.3 %; in all cases, the deaths had an extremely severe course of coronavirus infection and a significant comorbid background. There were no manifestations of anaphylaxis and cases of secondary infection after the appointment of tocilizumab.\n\nConclusions. The use of tocilizumab could significantly improve the condition of patients with SARS COVID19. There were no signs of anaphylaxis and cases of secondary infection after the administration of tocilizumab.

In a number of production mechanisms, machines and aggregates of various industries, synchronous rotation of several electric motors connected to each other mechanically, electrically or technologically is needed. This requires the use of more complex methods of controlling electromechanical systems, since two or more electric motors must work in concert for one load, which, in turn, entails the use of a new element base, power and control, allowing to implement these technological cycles of work.\n\nThe object of research is a three-motor electromechanical system interconnected and operating according to the “electric working shaft” (EWS) system. The main fundamental difference from earlier works is that they consider a system of coordinated rotation of only two asynchronous motors, respectively, only one misalignment angle between two asynchronous motors was taken into account. At the same time, the conclusions of the moments and currents of the motors were significantly simplified.\n\nIn the proposed study, the number of consistently (synchronously) rotating motors from three and above is taken into consideration. In this case, the number of misalignment angles is assumed to be equal to the number of engines, that is, three involved in rotation.\n\nThe analytical expressions of the basic electromechanical relations of the “electric working shaft” system with the regulation of the supply voltage are developed. A method is proposed for calculating the statistical characteristics of the regulated EWS system, which is easy to use and allows calculations in a wide range of rotor misalignment angles at various engine loads"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138888","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6244751d2467f070c45ec500","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"8 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"4806d56c-475c-4a20-906a-da8cd5995357"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"46-54","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/251232/249419","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6244785a2467f070c45ecd53","name":"Zhanat","lastName":"Issenov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2388-602X","documentHash":"8e690730-6dc3-411b-bc63-8aeb45eef05b"},{"objectId":"6244785a2467f070c45ecd52","name":"Kazhybek","lastName":"Tergemes","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4798-2817","documentHash":"cf9f9198-ce42-43ea-9a5e-c065310f404e"},{"objectId":"6244785a2467f070c45ecd3b","name":"Ruslan","lastName":"Iskakov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5948-2636","documentHash":"ac6152cc-f795-4569-a320-f046a26500f2"},{"objectId":"6244785a2467f070c45ecd33","name":"Sultanbek","lastName":"Issenov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4576-4621","documentHash":"5aea7f5d-9faf-49d7-91e8-20bb2133f981"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2021.251232"},{"mainLanguageName":"francuski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"9782753582811","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Utérus.

the study of oscillatory motion has a long history, going back four centuries, it is still an active subject of scientific research. In this review paper prospective research directions in the field of mechanical vibrations were pointed out. Four groups of important issues in which advanced research is conducted were discussed. The first are energy harvester devices, thanks to which we can obtain or save significant amounts of energy, and thus reduce the amount of greenhouse gases. The next discussed issue helps in the design of structures using vibrations and describes the algorithms that allow to identify and search for optimal parameters for the devices being developed. The next section describes vibration in multi-body systems and modal analysis, which are key to understanding the phenomena in vibrating machines. The last part describes the properties of granulated materials from which modern, intelligent vacuum-packed particles are made. They are used, for example, as intelligent vibration damping devices."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138905","journalIssue":{"objectId":"622f0f532467f016697bce5d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"70","number":"1","doi":"10.24425/bpasts.2021.139393","documentHash":"f3d49375-94f6-40d8-9727-b7fb96800a32"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"70","pagesFromTo":"Brak","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/dlibra/publication/140351/edition/122480/content","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6735f352fdbe832d85a494b3","name":"Michal","lastName":"Sofer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7cfa3e81-f9e0-400c-96c1-9b4b0ea6c6d7"},{"objectId":"6735f352fdbe832d85a494b2","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Ostrowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aef34bd4-c383-4567-ba3c-e750ca413b90"},{"objectId":"6735f352fdbe832d85a494b1","name":"Pawel","lastName":"Kwiaton","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"28c1b1e1-fdff-4b25-858e-f6a0bcc09806"},{"objectId":"6735f352fdbe832d85a494b0","name":"Anna","lastName":"Jaskot","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"057f3d61-d6fb-44e5-b0e4-9878471cd9ba"},{"objectId":"6735f352fdbe832d85a494af","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Sochacki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e86d6877-53a2-4432-a8b1-2ecc881fd159"},{"objectId":"6735f352fdbe832d85a494ae","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Błachowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c7381e06-f505-4904-b995-aca74d00aab2"},{"objectId":"6735f352fdbe832d85a494ad","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Garus","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0f092b76-1991-46f5-aa95-fde54d54b27f"},{"objectId":"5e70926a878c28a0473954a4","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kapitaniak","uuid":"9B60F8090803FDE545A9AB67675838BE2103D0B62F134643012D2E4A2914D83C69DDA928DE6FE366F9B756A3385A7FD4C6C87C7BEF17F9B8B9E5F4BE1809654E","orcidId":"0000-0001-9651-752X","documentHash":"0d96a52a-dbb4-44e0-8f5b-3c42335a53fa"}],"doi":"10.24425/bpasts.2022.140351"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"624585c52467f01551386b55","doi":null,"title":"Uwarunkowania produkcji żywności.

To enable development of functional materials there is a need to acquire basic information about the effect of morphology and grain size on spectroscopic properties. So, we investigated a series of Nd<sup>3+</sup>-doped LuPO<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles prepared with task-specific ionic liquid as the reactant and in-situ stabilizer. Thus, fast and facile preparation of the desired well-crystallized single-phase phosphate nanomaterials was possible. The XRD patterns and TEM analysis revealed the influence of the synthesis conditions on the morphology and nanoparticles size, which is reflected in their spectroscopic properties.

The pattern of noise reduction imposed by the short inlet duct on the axial flow cooling fan under variable working conditions was experimentally and numerically examined. A 2-cm inlet duct was found to reduce tonal noise. As the tip Mach number of the fan increased from 0.049 to 0.156, the reduction in the total average sound pressure level at 1?m from the fan increased from 0.8?dB(A) to 4.3?dB(A), and further achieved 4.8?dB(A) when a 1-cm inlet duct was used. The steady computational fluid dynamics (CFD) showed that the inlet duct has little effect on the aerodynamic performance of the fan. The results of the full passage unsteady calculation at the maximum flow rate showed that the duct has a significant influence on the suction vortexes caused by the inlet flow nonuniformity. The suction vortexes move upstream to weaken the interaction with the rotor blades, which significantly reduces the pulsating pressure on the blades. The sound pressure level (SPL) at the blade passing frequency (BPF) contributed by the thrust force was calculated to reduce by 36?dB at a 135?deg observer angle, reflecting the rectification effect of the duct on the nonuniform inlet flow and the improvement in characteristics of the noise source. The proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of the static pressure field on the blades verified that the main spatial mode is more uniformly distributed due to the duct, and energy owing to the rotor-inlet interaction decreases. A speed regulation strategy for the cooling fan with a short inlet duct is proposed, which guides the application of this noise reduction method."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138912","journalIssue":{"objectId":"624aab632467f01ec7fbd388","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"144","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"4df61eb1-617a-4ee3-adf8-7a62c0e1e97a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"144","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/gasturbinespower/article-abstract/144/2/021008/1119564/Noise-Reduction-Analysis-of-Electronic-Device","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6735f7b7fdbe832d85a49c65","name":"Hua","lastName":"Ouyang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c8aaabf0-e728-4463-aa9f-250df3d33a86"},{"objectId":"6735f7b7fdbe832d85a49c64","name":"Zhaohui","lastName":"Du","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"66b15afa-8d35-480d-8cb2-cbb970d6cfb1"},{"objectId":"6735f7b7fdbe832d85a49c63","name":"Jie","lastName":"Tian","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"730a0f25-e86d-4221-97fb-9f88230a08d4"},{"objectId":"6735f7b7fdbe832d85a49c62","name":"Zonghan","lastName":"Sun","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6306926f-197c-4f1a-a24c-081757b8a9c4"},{"objectId":"5e709433878c28a0473b80c3","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Liśkiewicz","uuid":"DB7EE0C7BCDEA5ACC7118A0FF63AF29256E1979EBBC955F3EB47C2939A30391C576E3677E995693EF3B3A076FE5A9F4260B19BD219CC86DE605143CC5C349011","orcidId":"0000-0002-9435-0794","documentHash":"ed8e16bd-0351-465a-9108-ff63f60a6e9b"}],"doi":"10.1115/1.4052429"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cost

Nonetheless, it is important for studying factors enabling species’ survival in a changing climate and understanding current species distribution. Niches of two mountain species: Cotoneaster integerrimus Medik and Valeriana tripteris L., were analyzed in a specific area of limestone hill Góra Zborów, which can be treated as a model of topographically differentiated area located outside mountains. The area constitutes a regional center of biodiversity and is protected as a nature reserve. C. integerrimus and V. tripteris are considered to have relic localities there. The aim of the study was a multifaceted fine-grain comparison of Cotoneaster integerrimus and Valeriana tripteris niches: 1) according to variables derived from high-resolution topographical model of the study area; 2) according to direct site characteristics; 3) according to species coexisting with the analyzed taxa.\r\n\r\nDuring the field studies, the data regarding abiotic conditions and plant cover were gathered from sites of the selected species. To better characterize these sites against the surrounding environment, a topographical model of the entire Góra Zborów was also used. Niche modelling was conducted by multivariate analysis in environmental space, with the usage of PCA and DCA ordinations. Also step regression models were used to identify the predominant co-occurring plant species. The results of different computational methods suitable for different kinds of variables were compared.\r\n\r\nThe results of all analyses remained consistent with the field observations. ‘Heat load’ combined with ‘Aspect’, and ‘Wetness’ combined with ‘Slope’ variables accurately explained the environmental differentiation of the area derived from topography characteristics. The overlap of the species’ niches was significant; however, the niches were not identical. C. integerrimus could grow in more insolated habitats characterized by higher cover of ground vascular flora, in which case significant positive relations with several herb taxa co-occurrence were identified.

Subsequently, a research-based project, Falling Birds, a poetic experiment by Helena Hunter that materialises Natural History Museum specimens in the context of environmental change and species extinction, will be discussed. In this way, the chapter addresses the question of how artistic practices contribute to the revisions of knowledge production and support cross-disciplinary practice-based research that embraces relations to times, material, political territories, and our more-than-human entanglements. As I will indicate, the re(situation) of more-than-human knowledge in the practices enables us to acknowledge both the peripheries and the depths of our wordily entanglements with the intensive dynamics of the nonhuman world and thus negotiate inequalities that we all share. In this sense, the artistic process is seen as the reconfiguration of knowledge through material practices of engagement that require from us—in the idiom of Karen Barad—the employment of an ethico-onto-epistemological approach"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138953","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"60-79","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003230922-4/re-situating-human-knowledge-justyna-st%C4%99pien%C5%84?context=ubx&refId=c62d9c0a-24de-4888-83e3-450d1ce95cd4","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af108","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Stępień","uuid":"FB10ED96C067A61E6E275818D641953F86889023381CDF375B80C1F6BBA0E4F6BD192E51D8944ACF3CF92ECA319345974E9C2BF444FE47C8BBCBA3EA5084CB2B","orcidId":"0000-0003-2893-3593","documentHash":"ef6f2284-1863-484f-94ad-47b6eb33cc23"}],"doi":"10.4324/9781003230922-4"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["extracellular vesicles","microvesicles","Cutibacterium acnes","lipid analysis","protein analysiS","SDS-PAGE","TLC","MALDI-TOF MS","TEM"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dead","uid":"byot1zGR6DaDBaUruYE9Eyg","uuid":"264294d6-d6d7-4b7e-93b6-8f267f0a455e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dead","parentUuid":"264294d6-d6d7-4b7e-93b6-8f267f0a455e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dead","rootUuid":"264294d6-d6d7-4b7e-93b6-8f267f0a455e","name":"Instytut Immunologii i Terapii Doświadczalnej im.

Determination of EVs composition allows for a deep understanding of their role in the bacterial community and communication among them. Cutibacterium acnes, formerly Propionibacterium acnes, are commensal bacteria responsible for various infections, e.g., prosthesis, sarcoidosis, soft-tissue infections, and the most known but still controversial—acnes lesion. In C. acnes, three major phylotypes represented variable disease associations. Herein, for the first time, we present a comparative analysis of EVs obtained from three C. acnes phylotypes (IA1, IB, and II) to demonstrate the existence of differences in their protein and lipid composition. In the following work, the morphological analysis of EVs was performed, and the SDS-PAGE protein profile and the lipid profile were presented using the TLC and MALDI-TOF MS methods. This study allowed us to show major differences between the protein and lipid composition of C. acnes EVs. This is a clear indication that EVs released by different phylotypes of the one species are not identical to each other in terms of composition and should be separately analyzed each time to obtain reliable results."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138966","journalIssue":{"objectId":"629da36f4097073d58651a87","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"23","number":"10","doi":null,"documentHash":"e1fe4926-8ba9-4330-8787-c535d1a8d2db"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"5797","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/10/5797/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"60c34c9e9543c723365443f7","name":"ANNA","lastName":"CHUDZIK","uuid":"D6DEC819200801891DCF4619A989A989B9FB128A5790168E32B08E9B9A1FFA3A262F186E05014DCC402879867170FA039082330211A353908D297447A16BCD89","orcidId":"0000-0003-2789-8300","documentHash":"9d564fc5-31c2-4d31-9bba-1de948e89afe"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6d3c","name":"PAWEŁ","lastName":"MIGDAŁ","uuid":"110DC254D575C19CBCA7973E3546494393459D1CCF182CF3F41BB7BB0158A925344E6CCEC89961AB9EDD70AE9915EEB73D8F4B22D5D26626C628367F43B83F6C","orcidId":"0000-0002-2615-9760","documentHash":"f23a5f30-184f-4038-ac14-e35feb264bff"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397e14","name":"Mariola","lastName":"Paściak","uuid":"A2BAF3634E752A44C0AF89B37901C49F3EF0F23C47C9116D76BF4AD48469D79BE28E6106A99A352340D4B68B3AD574731700D63722C1C705DD18D2D781A5FD15","orcidId":"0000-0002-2603-4634","documentHash":"94ef8c56-4f19-4206-8b4b-8e9bf9156879"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms23105797"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Supply Chain Management System","Supply Chain System","Success and Completion of Projects","Project Management"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"62b418254097070c5939a536","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Al-Zaytoonah University of Jordan","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62b418254097070c5939a539","62b418254097070c5939a538","62b418254097070c5939a537"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Key Role of the Dimensions of Supply Chain Management on the Success of the Project Completion Process","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"61b9ac02ad204581b62ebb23","mniswId":"201198","title":"Logistics and Transport","doi":null,"issn":"1734-2015","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WCN","editor":null,"documentHash":"58e8f936-66fe-48b6-904f-83f5b74b386b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"OTHER","releaseDate":"2022-06-06","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62b418254097070c5939a535","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62b418254097070c5939a537","62b418254097070c5939a538","62b418254097070c5939a539"]},"issue":"1-2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"From studies, reports, and information, we can see that the Supply Chain\nManagement System (SCMS) has a major impact on project success. The Supply\nChain Management (SCM) plays an important role in achieving potential cross-company\nsuccess because the SCMS allows us to control the development, design, management\nand identification of the most effective and efficient inputs, information\nand other resources required to complete the project. An effective SCMS is of\nessential importance for the strength of the competition and for the success of the\nentire organization. Therefore, the competitive advantage in this new environment\nno longer depends on the company’s performance, but also on the entire supply\nchain partners, including competitors.\nThe main objective of this research is to conduct the relationship between the supply\nchain management system, project success, project performance, to identify, and\nto determine the potential impact of SCM on project completion and success. In\nthis study, a random sample was drawn from a population made up exclusively of\nconstruction companies, and project departments from other companies in Amman,\nthe capital of Jordan. As a tool for data collection, we chose a questionnaire. Based on this, many statistical analyzes were carried out and the hypotheses of this study\nwere tested.\nAs a result of this test, we found out that in general there is a clear and positive relationship\nbetween supply chain management and project completion. The dimensions\nof supply chain management (knowledge, skills, and tools) have different effects\non the project closure process.

Currently (year 2021) the Baikal-GVD is composed of 2304 optical modules divided to 8 independent detection units, called clusters. Specific neutrino interactions can cause Cherenkov light topology, referred to as a cascade. However, cascade-like events originate from discrete stochastic energy losses along muon tracks. These cascades produce the most abundant background in searching for high-energy neutrino cascade events. Several methods have been developed, optimized, and tested to suppress background cascades."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138975","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"ICRC2021","pagesFromTo":"1114","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pos.sissa.it/395/1114","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62b46fea4097070c593cd033","name":"D.

In many publications dealing with such devices, the increasing of RUPD stiffness by applying innovative design solutions or using high-strength materials has been considered; in some designs, additional RUPD components are introduced to absorb the impact energy. In this paper, a review of the RUPD designs is presented and some of them are analyzed, where their characteristics that are essential for the compliance with normative market requirements are indicated.

Instead, we observe surrogate variables indicating whether or not the target variables are labelled. The presence of a label means that the corresponding variable is positive. The absence of the label means that the variable can be either positive or negative. We analyze embedded feature selection methods based on two weighted penalized empirical risk minimization frameworks. In the first approach, we introduce weights of observations. The idea is to assign larger weights to observations for which there is a consistency between the values of the true target variable and the corresponding surrogate variable. In the second approach, we consider a weighted empirical risk function which corresponds to the risk function for the true unobserved target variables. The weights in both the methods depend on the unknown propensity score functions, whose estimation is a challenging problem. We propose to use very simple bounds for the propensity score, which leads to relatively simple forms of weights. In the experiments we analyze the predictive power of the methods considered for different labelling schemes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138984","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b1cf2a409707603915b1cc","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"32","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"26d87254-eb52-47cc-9cb8-d0f33958de77"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"32","pagesFromTo":"311-322","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a5fb7","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Teisseyre","uuid":"98230A988A72EEFC2FC0B8A181FA3E9FEA0795B80FBCA677A29C8D84E1B176AA92B63F58D5C7126C7C560D014849423C640B677C1B1B38733CDC393E71592D2D","orcidId":"0000-0002-4296-9819","documentHash":"52f77a18-2fa2-49f4-9a1e-080e99024fe4"}],"doi":"10.34768/amcs-2022-0023"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-1-64997-251-4","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Research on International Anti-COVID-19 Pandemic","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":330,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62b438564097070c593afb07","editors":[{"objectId":"62b438564097070c593afb0a","name":"Fuyong","lastName":"Jiao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ce300283-6da3-49ff-bd98-e9f3938e1189"},{"objectId":"62b438564097070c593afb09","name":"Meng","lastName":"Wang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"95f155f1-3fb7-49a7-a267-a177b1297cb9"},{"objectId":"62b438564097070c593afb08","name":"Hao","lastName":"Wen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d7e3a736-b8ca-42a0-a802-55085f4576aa"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["62b438564097070c593afb08","62b438564097070c593afb09","62b438564097070c593afb0a"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058138986","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5ebff5f7ad49b31ccec2b9bb","mniswId":null,"name":"Scientific Research Publishing","documentHash":"2f1918be-f73d-431c-96ae-0b54a3a042cb"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.scirp.org/book/detailedinforofabook.aspx?bookid=2859","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cadmium","Breast cancer","Oestrogen signaling","Oxidative stress","Metallothioneins","Epigenetics"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Cadmium and breast cancer – Current state and research gaps in the underlying mechanisms","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479972","mniswId":"19609","title":"Toxicology Letters","doi":null,"issn":"0378-4274","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"999278dd-0a59-45e9-b5ed-750dae1129e4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"624aa0ca2467f01ec7fb936f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092db878c28a04739e487","5e70940c878c28a0473b5663","5ebed4c7752340254fc3ffc2","5e7092d8878c28a04739df75","5e709407878c28a0473b50e6","5e70940c878c28a0473b5755","5e7093d1878c28a0473b144c","5e709407878c28a0473b50e5"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cadmium (Cd), a heavy metal with strong carcinogenic properties has been linked with breast cancer risk. Epidemiological data on the association between Cd exposure and breast cancer are not consistent and suggest that this relationship may be modulated by a number of different factors. The mechanisms of action underlying the molecular effects of Cd, especially in terms of its carcinogenicity, are generally not well understood. Specifically, in the mammary gland, the effects of Cd are considered to be related mainly to its oestrogenic potential, however, several other mechanisms have also been suggested, such as epigenetic alterations, inhibition of DNA repair pathways, induction of oxidative stress, interference with metallothioneins, cadherins and integrins, as well as interactions with xenobiotics. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge in this field, including potential mechanisms of action of Cd in breast cancer initiation and progression, as well as possible ways of protection against its toxicity. Importantly, there are many research gaps in this area since limited evidence is available from experimental studies. Important issues to be further investigated concern exact molecular mechanisms of Cd accumulation in the tissues and Cd-induced activation of eostrogen receptors. Impact on DNA damage and epigenome upon Cd exposure in breast cancer development remains still highly unexplored area and should gain more interest."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138991","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"361","pagesFromTo":"29-42","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378427422000650?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebed4c7752340254fc3ffc2","name":"Kateryna","lastName":"Tarhonska","uuid":"311CB74145B8A1EB83A299B3F3811E975E3D8DDA89901FF479BB83188A0FAB1B84711CCB45D2731F960B3BD3C3292259B10E21CB48BBED50167B006D79D2D1CD","orcidId":"0000-0003-2940-0449","documentHash":"e365812a-6da4-448f-84ea-968fd79ec519"},{"objectId":"5e70940c878c28a0473b5755","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Roszak","uuid":"2FFAFAA480B6DA3C1F1EC411848E9C96EAF6E750FEAD726D696013199A8D48324E04115AEB8576AAF55E36082A74F4B50396EADEC3453AA3D15F28F0DAC76DAC","orcidId":"0000-0002-0739-9443","documentHash":"0c4c6747-b813-4315-be0f-abab13facdcf"},{"objectId":"5e70940c878c28a0473b5663","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Kołacińska-Wow","uuid":"DA51D223D1160DB71750F9C2C0366BA66C3FB9F21E20CB834ECC2C343ECF84AE8B2BD1D1C7ED8448B946F27BFE0C89F28CABFC01630C46D9BE85C17449C5E4DE","orcidId":"0000-0001-8707-0877","documentHash":"5b1aa285-1800-4f19-962b-9c875cedaf06"},{"objectId":"5e709407878c28a0473b50e6","name":"Beata","lastName":"Janasik","uuid":"2C42C953A9E20744F4FB4DC00B3035FA0E2CD12E1AD604263E02FE7659DE3111062102D23AD6C2890C7AE8A5B7A3E4CACCAB34FBA497CA99E252E42AC775A444","orcidId":"0000-0002-0904-9869","documentHash":"6a46a9b9-2e57-47c2-978b-9035a2070ac5"},{"objectId":"5e709407878c28a0473b50e5","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Jabłońska","uuid":"3051360813E75DF1390B7AA83BB031CB19A6FCA3E134665B78EAE20FCC4457E2D497B806A0D64052B99C5AD6BBC5B637EC7F86230400D2C2DFF1B62769544DA9","orcidId":"0000-0002-3946-3964","documentHash":"3619f5e5-10fa-4232-b24b-96913d7909fb"},{"objectId":"5e7093d1878c28a0473b144c","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Reszka","uuid":"002A9210731CFB2978601B559431AA6634BE72816E2070C7E61414D04725B6D1D8FBB85542CF44BE7314B6E5E44C892E76727EF80F03E74F122B565BA718B923","orcidId":"0000-0003-2153-4864","documentHash":"ca04b08f-ab70-4167-9c86-d439cee6a164"},{"objectId":"5e7092db878c28a04739e487","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Braun","uuid":"4362C3BD6F5C4B7880DB9ADA36261C30A52BAA5312920056E3E36AFDC661DD1206AF22B2931B5C40C6A2601EFCD3999713CFACDFED06AB6F75E9E227BB5E9E18","orcidId":"0000-0003-3804-7042","documentHash":"bc691c66-b511-4b97-9db4-84b47e9846b3"},{"objectId":"5e7092d8878c28a04739df75","name":"Monika","lastName":"Lesicka","uuid":"5A88EEB38DF765F96B5838CCB163455DC8269C46778266C8B877CD8E72291D9FEEF8AB8126AD25F3D513FEF4FFC3A9CD1CDF5F5F5B01658A6219ADA2D63D1118","orcidId":"0000-0003-2095-8681","documentHash":"d1ec059b-f425-4894-85c0-9596c97a7c88"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.toxlet.2022.03.003"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Prawa człowieka","Prawa i wolności obywatelskie","Stan wyjątkowy","Stany nadzwyczajne","Polska"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Human rights","Personal freedom","State of emergency","Poland"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","uid":"bABmAiyO82JgMB2LqzOepAg","uuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","parentUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8b","rootUuid":"fea43f3f-0e69-4f13-aaa3-d651e479abf8","name":"Akademia Sztuki Wojennej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094b9878c28a0473c27d9"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Wybrane aspekty proceduralne stosowania stanów nadzwyczajnych w Polsce","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa83c9aff2974850cd66","mniswId":"498372","title":"Wiedza Obronna","doi":null,"issn":"0209-0031","eissn":"2658-0829","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"f18b3ba3-3330-475e-ac6d-7cd74569c8ad"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"624bfda52467f040ca9a7c4f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094b9878c28a0473c27d9"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W artykule autor odniósł się do wybranych aspektów proceduralnych stosowania stanów nadzwyczajnych w Polsce.

In the context of geopolitical transformation, globalization and quarantine restrictions of Covid-19, it is important to predict the development of the migration movement of countries that are developing. Therefore, the article is aimed at modelling migration changes according to alternative scenarios using the example of Ukraine. The theoretical and methodological basis of the research is formed by a number of scientific works of leading scientists from different countries, statistical information on migration processes and socio-economic indicators of Ukraine’s development, economic, mathematical and scenario methods. In the course of the study, the main factors were identified that more affect the migration processes of Ukraine, taking into account the trends in the impact of Covid-19 on them. These include population size, life expectancy, GDP per capita, average monthly wages, and the volume of remittances from individuals to Ukraine. With the help of correlation-regression analysis, a multivariate econometric model of migration growth (reduction) has been built. This made it possible to study the absolute and relative influence of factors on the magnitude of the migration increase (decrease), determine the potential reserves for its increase (decrease), evaluate them using a comparative analysis and carry out predictive calculations of the volume of migration increase (decrease) in Ukraine."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058138999","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6245b00b2467f01551390500","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"5a756483-aac5-40da-8dac-31d12cdcb6b0"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"58 - 71","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.iki.bas.bg/Journals/EconomicStudies/2022/2022-1/04_Britchenko-4.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62c645297523404805717d63","name":"Maryna","lastName":"Demianchuk","uuid":"A8F66E7BFDC59E6217E6938F2E5F3788A16F27AB41178194EB11CF1110912EF0B5C5CFAEE35A0ADD351D906BB70B59938F94571769D6113B7F6277077FAE48EE","orcidId":"0000-0002-3907-3464","documentHash":"f051d971-cc10-4cb2-acb0-65d7281a286b"},{"objectId":"6245b00b2467f015513904fe","name":"Maksym","lastName":"Bezpartochnyi","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3765-7594","documentHash":"c7f58c9c-74a3-4dc5-8d7d-bd1e6c7388d7"},{"objectId":"6245b00b2467f015513904fb","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Maslii","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3472-5646","documentHash":"2b104761-e70d-48d0-97f1-77d7e0c3e31e"},{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c131a","name":"Igor","lastName":"Britchenko","uuid":"6FAB28D9E3F09D59E19BF9BB643EDC41844196ADC1AD31ABAB1E673CF04B12FFA9B6CA7112B6D9D784D4A3A38753D3EB226D31B0C8B99047F06A387576149BFB","orcidId":"0000-0002-9196-8740","documentHash":"ca873fdd-6479-4c57-b62f-12ade9b34f0d"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["metalinguistic","alian onomastics","scientific terminology","anthroponomastics","toponomastics","context","collocation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Metalinguistic Significance of Basic Italian Onomastic Terminology: a Corpus-Based Study","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547cb92","mniswId":"13580","title":"Lege Artis-Language Yesterday Today Tomorrow","doi":null,"issn":"2453-8035","eissn":"2453-8035","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"fd228f29-95d9-4e1d-9ed4-a2e593dffc12"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62b015f340970732b7007e87","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709243878c28a047392a60"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper addresses the metalinguistic conceptualisation of basic Italian onomastic\r\nterminology.

The effect showed a high impact of a long-term pre-oxidation process and a high content of Cr in the metal matrix of the exposed steels. The steel with a lower Cr content showed spallation of the oxide scale under the oxidation process in the air, and only the steel with 25 wt.% Cr showed no spallation of the oxide scale in both conditions: air and steam.
