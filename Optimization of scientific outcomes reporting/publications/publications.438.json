Treshchenok’s meditations were founded on the historiography of Mikhail Koyalovich, a West-Russian ideologue and the inspirer of the policy of memory of the Russian state in the so-called ‘Western territories’. During the Soviet period, the memory of Koyalovich and his heritage was largely forgotten, but has gained a particular popularity in Belarus in recent years. His West-Russian views were given a new interpretation, fertilising both academic and political meditations. Their aim, however, was not purely academic: they transformed into the ‘neo-West-Russia’ ideology, which was, for a time, a crucial part of President Lukashenko’s policies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589309","journalIssue":{"objectId":"642299ad4097072924c1cb25","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"36","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"e3241da4-b47e-4eea-85a1-673b5f7208bf"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"36","pagesFromTo":"1-32","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://arts.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0012/4385784/ASEES-36.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70923e878c28a0473925f5","name":"Norbert","lastName":"Morawiec","uuid":"DF9E5FC3132D61C8F8459EC267574AC0D004179225F6005818375843DAFA24B8DB434B87FED876464720245B8A6792390B1971B59370DD30F8332EF309DDC069","orcidId":"0000-0001-5025-5528","documentHash":"73cc4555-2d13-4637-bed8-0c7cf8c1682c"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19","Blockchain","supply chains","smart contracts"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"640ef9b44097074fd7365cb7","doi":null,"title":"COVID 1 - Implications for the economy","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-7205-374-9","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://www.wydawnictwo.wsb.pl/node/602","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"a4a4ca64-9a5c-40be-9ace-c1e936ff12f8","publisher":{"objectId":"5d3ef7ef878c2809a72ec5a7","mniswId":"76100","name":"Wydawnictwo Wyższej Szkoły Bankowej w Poznaniu","documentHash":"880c4bad-d452-4fb6-aaf2-963e256a1583"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcb0","uid":"b0r66eP7HoJMHsuBaW-45aQ","uuid":"add982ff-1e14-4375-84f5-07977f9fd994","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcb0","parentUuid":"add982ff-1e14-4375-84f5-07977f9fd994","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dcb0","rootUuid":"add982ff-1e14-4375-84f5-07977f9fd994","name":"Uniwersytet WSB Merito w Poznaniu","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927d878c28a0473969b9"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Blockchain technology in health care – lessons and implications from the COVID-19 pandemic","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"64219cac4097077da599f2ce","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70927d878c28a0473969b9"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this article is to investigate possible applications of blockchain technology in the fight against the pandemic, which, among other negative consequences, has disrupted global supply chains.

The author shows how blockchain-based smart contracts can help improve the functioning of the health service in general, how they can be used to optimize treatment methods and make social insurance more efficient. After reviewing the key features of blockchain technology and tracking the stages of its development, from the creation of the Bitcoin virtual currency to its use in smart contracts and other applications in combination with artificial intelligence in many spheres of the economy and social life, the presentation focuses on the use of blockchain in the management of medical records and its role in securing the stability of supplies of medicines and medical equipment."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589313","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"77-91","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.wydawnictwo.wsb.pl/10.58683/9788372053749.04","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70927d878c28a0473969b9","name":"Jan","lastName":"Rymarczyk","uuid":"E28235C0DBFDAD5745C495232BF7BBD2865F79938D777B88BF155FFC52AC1CC782573EC3BEFC08A92E58B0CD24CFC62A013A69206CAFE1C4BCC3BB7983CF550B","orcidId":"0000-0003-4701-439X","documentHash":"cc50ea1b-9bdc-44a3-ac71-b87eb62fc72d"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"63bfb4bb40970702a6626c2e","doi":null,"title":"Encyklopedia bezpieczeństwa.

The macroinvertebrate taxa differed in their responses to the fish presence and in mesohabitat preferences. The density and species richness of water mites were greater in fish-containing ponds, while no differences were found between littoral and open-water habitats. In contrast, beetles were far more numerous and species-rich in fish-free ponds and in littoral vegetation. Total densities of aquatic bugs were non-significantly higher in fish-containing ponds, and they preferred littoral areas, but species richness was independent of fish presence and mesohabitat. No statistical interactions between fish presence and the densities of individual macroinvertebrate groups in the littoral habitat were detected, indicating that their use of emergent littoral vegetation was not an antipredator response to fish. The assemblages of the three macroinvertebrate taxa exhibited nested structures of a different order, consistent with their species richness patterns. Our research stresses the importance of littoral vegetation for the distribution and abundance of aquatic insects; however, high fish presence may not affect or may even benefit ecologically important macroinvertebrate groups, such as water mites or bugs."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589322","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"85","pagesFromTo":"25","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00027-022-00922-y","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092f7878c28a0473a0225","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Kloskowski","uuid":"77C7669082914543ABA8648BF4D6951D70E29EBB32334ECEE40B851F606AD6A9E0A9A101859BD5561C8A0066D68FDCC266A5FD489CA1F0E1E9B97C562E08D9A4","orcidId":"0000-0002-0525-2421","documentHash":"57f412bd-8208-475c-bb0a-210931d10835"},{"objectId":"5e7092f5878c28a04739ff28","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Buczyński","uuid":"871A0EF9A17D6E8156C63769087A04408F7F8E552BC7E329A3D2C20D797698912B04EA7A7595D55F3878080F2E87652B940A52A787750C1A7CBE2B9B71C1D6B0","orcidId":"0000-0003-4009-1755","documentHash":"65165ef1-2b9c-4c87-a92a-f2da0cb7acff"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390b62","name":"Marek","lastName":"Nieoczym","uuid":"CFAF7156B1B15E1D86DF5E2CEC88A545CDE98C24CCB8AE9D7BC1DBB1FA06AAE595F145747FA1D13D37DF866017370D493FC7654272A5E5C429067D95E8B0E674","orcidId":"0000-0003-1670-358X","documentHash":"44a4346e-a42e-47e5-8d5f-1a57905f08a3"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390b09","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Płaska","uuid":"15C6FBA935D2A68840291C402A74E18FD6B672347AA009215E01AC799C141B08EF4F7DE04F41431190AC7787664C91F7BA7564D05A8BF1D9917B1F48B5AA7808","orcidId":"0000-0002-5483-0566","documentHash":"4d3548a3-4d04-4354-b5c5-bdbe9b4e3e46"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a047390a00","name":"Robert","lastName":"Stryjecki","uuid":"3232757A9B0D9444876201856069DD0EBD0CBCCC1693F7FF2788E71C080A1681F383C7598B73B4D4EC7173B988E2C4D57270F54D264ABF8E6CA81FDA6CFC7606","orcidId":"0000-0003-0397-8517","documentHash":"8a90496e-08e6-4a03-9a34-e1f25b24d6a7"}],"doi":"10.1007/s00027-022-00922-y"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["śmieszność","uznanie","humor","Tadeusz Różewicz","Rita Felski"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ridiculousness","recognition","humour","Tadeusz Różewicz","Rita Felski"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Sumienne oglądanie.

Lastly, we outline quantitative analysis steps of the epithelial response."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589345","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"3","pagesFromTo":"101683-101683","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5fb3e020085dcb64f926a053","name":"Damian","lastName":"Zaremba","uuid":"F33C5C900714DDE927262AC0A3A4A6A5E446F4D9CB0638EA08E8BBEC21DF048C8D545DF57FDC146E3B1B455368BED805B2C84E2DE53FBEA9335C31F6092A03FC","orcidId":"0000-0001-9055-4960","documentHash":"1aaf0c01-5a6e-44d3-93e1-4f6cdbe0bf91"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396a6c","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Błoński","uuid":"8D06F70DB9A77B72B2042E4491146CA8CAD8D63A94D9BDEB0386C719E48101F99D4FECE957B559E92EFD671094453295C80E492D2DD6A0537A7334B66B177FC6","orcidId":"0000-0002-6998-8198","documentHash":"74dad8ee-31d0-411a-8169-4839c39b8529"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.xpro.2022.101683"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hypoxia","Hemanext","erythrocyte","hemoglobin","oxidative stress","microfluidics"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Metabolic reprogramming under hypoxic storage preserves faster oxygen unloading from stored red blood cells","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547bb8b","mniswId":"2584","title":"Blood Advances","doi":null,"issn":"2473-9529","eissn":"2473-9537","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"c2ac3be0-ca8b-46f4-91e9-8f0ded9c6e58"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6422afa34097075f21b923d0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70927e878c28a047396a6c","5fb3e020085dcb64f926a053","5e7092d3878c28a04739d79d"]},"issue":"18","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Stored red blood cells (RBCs) incur biochemical and morphological changes, collectively termed the storage lesion. Functionally, the storage lesion manifests as slower oxygen unloading from RBCs, which may compromise the efficacy of transfusions where the clinical imperative is to rapidly boost oxygen delivery to tissues. Recent analysis of large real-world data linked longer storage with increased recipient mortality. Biochemical rejuvenation with a formulation of adenosine, inosine, and pyruvate can restore gas-handling properties, but its implementation is impractical for most clinical scenarios. We tested whether storage under hypoxia, previously shown to slow biochemical degradation, also preserves gas-handling properties of RBCs. A microfluidic chamber, designed to rapidly switch between oxygenated and anoxic superfusates, was used for single-cell oxygen saturation imaging on samples stored for up to 49 days. Aliquots were also analyzed flow cytometrically for side-scatter (a proposed proxy of O2 unloading kinetics), metabolomics, lipidomics, and redox proteomics. For benchmarking, units were biochemically rejuvenated at 4 weeks of standard storage. Hypoxic storage hastened O2 unloading in units stored to 35 days, an effect that correlated with side-scatter but was not linked to posttranslational modifications of hemoglobin. Although hypoxic storage and rejuvenation produced distinct biochemical changes, a subset of metabolites including pyruvate, sedoheptulose 1-phosphate, and 2/3 phospho-d-glycerate, was a common signature that correlated with changes in O2 unloading. Correlations between gas handling and lipidomic changes were modest. Thus, hypoxic storage of RBCs preserves key metabolic pathways and O2 exchange properties, thereby improving the functional quality of blood products and potentially influencing transfusion outcomes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589346","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"6","pagesFromTo":"5415-5428","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5fb3e020085dcb64f926a053","name":"Damian","lastName":"Zaremba","uuid":"F33C5C900714DDE927262AC0A3A4A6A5E446F4D9CB0638EA08E8BBEC21DF048C8D545DF57FDC146E3B1B455368BED805B2C84E2DE53FBEA9335C31F6092A03FC","orcidId":"0000-0001-9055-4960","documentHash":"1aaf0c01-5a6e-44d3-93e1-4f6cdbe0bf91"},{"objectId":"5e7092d3878c28a04739d79d","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Korczyk","uuid":"AD02C5DA330028429C1AA514AB6D789A3AE2875EAE2F09A11927AA7D74011336CAFA394E60C6BCC240D7BE48355F15296605336610F56FB167E87AB69BC56CD3","orcidId":"0000-0002-5445-7933","documentHash":"9ea6d230-aa20-4848-8e62-2eba51ce89f6"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396a6c","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Błoński","uuid":"8D06F70DB9A77B72B2042E4491146CA8CAD8D63A94D9BDEB0386C719E48101F99D4FECE957B559E92EFD671094453295C80E492D2DD6A0537A7334B66B177FC6","orcidId":"0000-0002-6998-8198","documentHash":"74dad8ee-31d0-411a-8169-4839c39b8529"}],"doi":"10.1182/bloodadvances.2022007774"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd1a","uid":"bGDdnoGeYlQVMW3iXacEQlQ","uuid":"f57eaa80-c7eb-4bdc-9019-d15ca95543bc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd1a","parentUuid":"f57eaa80-c7eb-4bdc-9019-d15ca95543bc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd1a","rootUuid":"f57eaa80-c7eb-4bdc-9019-d15ca95543bc","name":"Wyższa

Cooling Jacket (KCJ) preserves the kidney graft, wrapped in the jacket, against the too fast time of temperature rise during the operation of connecting a cooled transplant to the patient’s bloodstream. The efficiency of KCJ depends on the stationarity of the fluid flow and its spatial uniformity. In this paper, the fluid velocity field inside the three different KCJ prototypes has been measured using the 20 MHz ultrasonic Doppler flowmeter. The simplified 2D geometrical model of the prototypes has been presented using COMSOL-Multiphysics to simulate the fluid flow assuming the laminar flow model. By comparing the numerical results with experimental data, the simplified 2D model is shown to be accurate enough to predict the flow distribution of the internal fluid velocity field within the KCJ. The discrepancy between the average velocity measured using the 20 MHz Doppler and numerical results was mainly related to the sensitivity of the velocity measurements to a change of the direction of the local fluid flow stream. Flux direction and average velocity were additionally confirmed by using  ommercial colour Doppler imaging scanner. The current approach showed nearly 90% agreement of the experimental results and numerical simulations. It was important for justifying the use of numerical modelling in designing the baffles distribution (internal walls in the flow space) for obtaining the\nmost spatially uniform field of flow velocity.

This study addresses an empirical gap in the literature concerning the determinants of high hospital costs in a group of older patients in Europe. The objective of the study is to examine the association of patient health status with in-hospital costs among older people across European countries. We used the data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) database. The analysis included 9671 patients from 18 European countries. We considered socio-demographic, lifestyle and clinical variables as possible factors influencing in-hospital costs. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine the determinants of in-hospital costs. To benchmark the hospital costs across European countries, we used the cost-outlier methodology. Rates of hospital cost outliers among older people varies from 5.80 to 12.65% across Europe. Factors associated with extremely high in-patient costs differ among European countries. In most countries, they include the length of stay in the hospital, comorbidities, functional mobility and physical activity. The treatment of older people reporting heart attack, diabetes, chronic lung disease and cancer are more often connected with cost outliers. The risk of being a cost outlier increased by 20% with each day spent in the hospital. We advocate that including patient characteristics in the reimbursement system could provide a relatively simple strategy for reducing hospitals’ financial risk connected with exceptionally costly cases."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589359","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"20","pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/2/1418","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6447d26f4097076e1e8b0bac","name":"Chris","lastName":"Pyke","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0ee4306b-cf9b-409e-afef-3febf9b795df"},{"objectId":"6447d26f4097076e1e8b0bab","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Cygańska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e577b009-879d-42f9-9e0c-3f69f4128017"},{"objectId":"5e709309878c28a0473a18b9","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Kludacz-Alessandri","uuid":"F3BA5B3A46CA27159A10DF64F36B30C4034C28275F1A05FF8A0B05D6A96BE867E09328A297933D739BD0002FD469960CD65B3B50C769204C743A944BB5248C86","orcidId":"0000-0002-7011-2302","documentHash":"f936f818-df28-4d68-a52c-daa1e6f238bd"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph20021418"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Digital image correlation (DIC)","Kolmogorov-Sinai metric entropy","Mechanical properties","Glass fibre composites"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Metric entropy and digital image correlation in deformation dynamics analysis of fibre glass reinforced composite under uniaxial tension","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478dd6","mniswId":"14078","title":"Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation","doi":null,"issn":"0263-2241","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"066c10ef-6b87-4756-9477-5fcd8dff8d12"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6422b0e94097075f21b924be","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709401878c28a0473b4b61","5e709489878c28a0473bf290","5e70927e878c28a047396aca"]},"issue":"112196","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper proposes a combined method for the mechanical properties assessment of composite materials based on the analysis of the internal dynamics of raw data from uniaxial tensile tests.

The proposed DCGEU method is based on synthesis of several subsequent B-mode frames acquired with certain time intervals (30 ms in this study) followed by the visualization of differential beamformed radio frequency (RF) echoes, which yielded the images of the scatterers moving slowly in the vessel and suppressing the static echoes outside the vessel. In order to extract small backscattered echoes from the vessel area we took an advantage of improved sensitivity of the complementary Golay coded sequences (CGCS).\nThe validation of the proposed DCGEU method was carried out in two stages. In the first one, we compared the flow images in small tubes with a diameter of 1 mm and 2.5 mm, reconstructed from numerically simulated acoustic data for the standard transmission of short pulses and 16-bits long CGCS signals. In the second stage of the research, the experimental data were acquired in a flow phantom with silicone tubes with an internal diameter of 1.5 mm and 4.5 mm and a fluid flow velocity of 0.9 cm/s. The experiments were carried out using preprogrammed Verasonics Vantage™ research ultrasound system equipped with ALT L12-5/50 mm MHz linear array transducer with 7.8 MHz center frequency.\nIt was evidenced both in simulations and experiments that the DCGEU provided a good flow image along the entire length of tubing with virtually angle independent detection in comparison with the conventional short pulse interrogation.\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589363","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"126","pagesFromTo":"1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396bf6","name":"Ihor","lastName":"Trots","uuid":"C7C7BCC800F76195908F98061FF2B27771784932D7927C48AC4E6B7CC702DB7A0382E6BB40DB5FC6E843C2EF9D7863FB22F8289DC9C8BD123811BB8216A66FCF","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fbbb8aa6-dacc-415b-af62-45c33904548f"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396be3","name":"Jurij","lastName":"Tasinkiewicz","uuid":"B5C67282497F5F725695D44559B79C7DB2EDDDF419A4AEB3888D540404A1E064203E57E9D45DA643A00F79BF32BFB94B30704E38AE0AE72D4D6AAEE92E12F9B6","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"983ee025-ee77-46e3-b777-28415aafaba5"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396b32","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Nowicki","uuid":"E75D4D4C851DA12DEFC69404819DF0F313B8DA1C205183F9FDE24222D1E4027C5D6F463E8DC56E70C2C82425992E9D64D102442BDA73FFEC24D9FB304EC4966C","orcidId":"0000-0002-9260-8237","documentHash":"e2d916f0-a88c-4202-affc-f3afdef4cec7"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ultras.2022.106825"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["supercapacitor","activated carbon-silver composite","gel polymer electrolyte","electrochemical studies"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Surface modification of activated carbon with silver nanoparticles for electrochemical double layer capacitors","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547c7f0","mniswId":"10948","title":"Journal of Energy Storage","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2352-152X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"88509d5b-4f5f-4c93-ae1c-6fa8b98a3f00"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6422afa34097075f21b923bb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094e5878c28a0473c6569","5e7093df878c28a0473b2491","5e70942c878c28a0473b7910"]},"issue":"","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In the present work, we report the synthesis of surface modified activated carbon (AC).

The locally heat-treated AISI 9310 steel specimen was prepared by using a laser surfacing process to imitate three different grinding burns. These burn marks were characterized in terms of changes in microstructure and hardness on the surface and cross-section of the specimen. On such a basis, the depth of the heat-affected zone caused by the grinding tool was examined. Subsequently, the specimen was subjected to the EC measurements for the quantitative description of the signal from each of the defects by using a commercial NORTEC 600D flaw detector working in specimen scanning mode and with a pencil probe. The changes in the amplitude and the phase angle of the signal from three defects indicate the possibility to identify burns along with their quantitative description and subsequent estimation of their depth. The differences in the phase angle value, related to the local changes in the stress state, serve as an effective indicator of the specimen overheating degree in the area of the EC induction."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589373","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6392fc7a4097077716c37441","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"12","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"16330903-e1ea-43ee-8c1b-d7a081a65f35"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1046-1050","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/eng-2022-0382/html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"658f1b464097076c145da685","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Kopec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"534a47c7-2d69-441e-867a-bb8c61c6d74f"},{"objectId":"658f1b464097076c145da684","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Kukla","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d5a21d57-64f9-4074-a72f-9abb594bc8bf"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b746","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Gradzik","uuid":"972224633B2907FFF730B28311D920D620936DD788EE9D9470E27A7882E70172D2BBC743EA5F2E3E0BAB03936121EC4926F1AE16628BF69FEE8F8BA5562DBD19","orcidId":"0000-0003-0491-8890","documentHash":"d765d9f6-5a4e-46a7-8919-34b6958f4ace"}],"doi":"10.1515/eng-2022-0382"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-67567-22-0","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","uid":"bUD9SiLi4D9CSv6IIg7PEOg","uuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","parentUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defd","rootUuid":"e36574a3-f5a3-409e-975d-2179e994fbe7","name":"Państwowy Instytut Geologiczny -

Multiplicity of infection experiments in cell cultures are conventionally used for the characterization of viral infection by the number of viral plaques and the rate of their growth. We describe this process with a delay reaction-diffusion system of equations for the concentrations of uninfected cells, infected cells, virus, and interferon. Time delay corresponds to the duration of viral replication inside infected cells. We show that infection propagates in cell culture as a reaction-diffusion wave, we determine the wave speed and prove its existence. Next, we carry out numerical simulations and identify three stages of infection progression: infection decay during time delay due to virus replication, explosive growth of viral load when infected cells begin to reproduce it, and finally, wave-like infection progression in cell culture characterized by a constant or slowly\ngrowing total viral load. The modelling results are in agreement with the experimental data for the coronavirus infection in a culture of epithelial cells and for some other experiments. The presence of interferon produced by infected cells decreases the viral load but does not change the speed of infection progression in cell culture. In the 2D modelling, the total viral load grows faster than in the 1D case due to the increase of plaque

First, the full-vehicle model was introduced. Then, vehicle modal parameters were identified using the consequent free responses of a vehicle passing over bumps. Second, the expression of the vehicle frequency response function (FRF) with respect to the wheel contact point was derived from the vehicle equation of motion, and a road roughness estimation method based on the vehicle FRF was developed. Third, field tests in which the vehicle passes over bumps were performed for vehicle model identification. Finally, field tests for road roughness estimation were carried out using a calibrated vehicle to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589395","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"199","pagesFromTo":"111348-1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396aa0","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Jankowski","uuid":"89DC7A2ED0D795689EA87C298C87385DE00178610260A051E43EDBF9A5CAB238F36DB84948CE001D169D1075C9FEB63E5EF76B22CC155074909A8B13B689958F","orcidId":"0000-0002-9773-0688","documentHash":"d3709e31-7ad5-46da-89a6-7d2c3512ea04"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.measurement.2022.111348"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2c","uid":"blTedeK8fuVutIuS0UC1hLA","uuid":"7a7e1b21-0684-43f6-a0d6-5404df34ac74","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2c","parentUuid":"7a7e1b21-0684-43f6-a0d6-5404df34ac74","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2c","rootUuid":"7a7e1b21-0684-43f6-a0d6-5404df34ac74","name":"Politechnika Krakowska im.

We found that RSV induces higher levels of interferon beta (IFN-β) production than IAV and that IFN-β priming confers higher-level protection against infection with IAV than with RSV. Consequently, we focused on the sequential infection scheme of RSV and then IAV. Using A549 wild-type (WT), IFNAR1 knockout (KO), IFNLR1 KO, and IFNAR1-IFNLR1 double-KO cell lines, we found that both IFN-β and IFN-λ are necessary for maximum protection against subsequent infection. Immunostaining revealed that preinfection with RSV partitions the cell population into a subpopulation susceptible to subsequent infection with IAV and an IAV-proof subpopulation. Strikingly, the susceptible cells turned out to be those already compromised and efficiently expressing RSV, whereas the bystander, interferon-primed cells are resistant to IAV infection. Thus, virus-virus exclusion at the cell population level is not realized through direct competition for a shared ecological niche (single cell) but rather is achieved with the involvement of specific cytokines induced by the host’s innate immune response."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589400","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"96","pagesFromTo":"e01341-22-1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b812f","name":"Marek","lastName":"Kochańczyk","uuid":"4ACDE399411B5F6BEC67AD0827BE76F7D1F5868B60089F0E40C5B575AD08FAB2579CF113F9C8A3E92CF501FC91C5D98BDE2C9F0ED156ACEDD06805642A54F6DC","orcidId":"0000-0003-1215-3920","documentHash":"22ab46ee-4d22-4bb8-890b-22f4f6420056"},{"objectId":"5e7093f1878c28a0473b3bb0","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Czerkies","uuid":"8BD3A07FCCA244FA1F9AA785F88E325EEE0ED5CEC3FDA70B4E2BD929DEFBEAC90B022F354CB3E8F94B79EF680870846B11876C4C18D3464C95EC1F6415054552","orcidId":"0000-0001-9987-0783","documentHash":"8b4c218e-9b78-4eaf-9f73-432a780097df"},{"objectId":"5e7093d4878c28a0473b16f7","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Korwek","uuid":"B7C25DCEABBEAE565ED822DA139328988C2006EDFB6EC84B011015247A0E793FAEB38222B981C1573FD339DBEE10E32219FDE540F3B62FD08E8DEC955F34AF6D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bed447f1-b8c3-4f06-8d56-c47260f7a371"},{"objectId":"5e7093d4878c28a0473b16f5","name":"Wiktor","lastName":"Prus","uuid":"270338A19D26B4B10D349658621E1EE25F843696045711707D3B4DBA71BE1B9084BF00FC552D15AEBD2C02CA83CF5BCD2C7EB30025FC5E403A73E8EBD819090A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"57bc7a7d-f4cf-4e01-a695-477723629234"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396af0","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Lipniacki","uuid":"2984686A8474157A871F8B7F1B004B77AD2CEB66A7DE298D852C3CCB5E0E6A73B36A4C152FFEB0743D3E8706BC5FDB174701136F627A2512B4BA275C3C9DABF3","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ee12edaf-30fc-48cb-bba1-10267e6adac0"}],"doi":"10.1128/jvi.01341-22"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["sprawca wypadku komunikacyjnego, ubezpieczenie OC posiadaczy pojazdów mechanicznych, właściciel (zarządca) drogi, odpowiedzialność in solidum, szkoda spowodowana zanieczyszczeniem jezdni (drogi)"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["perpetrator of a traffic accident, third party insurance of motor vehicle owners, road owner (administrator), in solidum liability, damage caused by the contamination of the road"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd1a","uid":"bGDdnoGeYlQVMW3iXacEQlQ","uuid":"f57eaa80-c7eb-4bdc-9019-d15ca95543bc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd1a","parentUuid":"f57eaa80-c7eb-4bdc-9019-d15ca95543bc","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd1a","rootUuid":"f57eaa80-c7eb-4bdc-9019-d15ca95543bc","name":"Wyższa Szkoła Prawa i Administracji Rzeszowska Szkoła Wyższa z siedzibą w Rzeszowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709277878c28a04739620e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Odpowiedzialność sprawcy wypadku komunikacyjnego i zakładu ubezpieczeń za szkodę wyrządzoną właścicielowi drogi polegającą na zanieczyszczeniu jezdni","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa81c9aff2974850ccd8","mniswId":"201014","title":"Nieruchomości@.

With the Oldroyd-B model chosen as the constitutive model, a globally valid, composite, reduced-order solution is constructed up to the third order. When viscoelasticity is disabled in the model, the resultant solution to the Newtonian flow can be favorably compared with previous experimental, analytical, and numerical investigations. Results show that the elastic effect begins to surface at the third order in our expansion scheme. For the flow field, the model predicts that the viscoelasticity has a positive effect on the growth of the longitudinal velocity and that the viscosity ratio has a negative effect. As the inertial effect increases, the longitudinal velocity increases. The elastic effects exerting on the vorticity distribution in the wake flow are also predicted by the theoretical model. For the conformation tensor field, the model dictates that a larger elastic effect leads to a greater extension of the polymer molecules, but predicts no influence of the viscosity ratio on the polymer extension because the solutions are only expanded till the third order. The reduced-order solutions establish a theoretical guidance for the complex viscoelastic wake flow, which is beneficial for the investigation of the drag reduction in the viscoelastic wake flow past a bluff body."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589404","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"34","pagesFromTo":"033104-1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"60388d2c9543c7410626fd02","name":"Lujia","lastName":"Liu","uuid":"9550AAE4D2ECC5E6DCC7A94E5C9A362F8D6E4DC886ECC51E10941A6C8CF423B80ECCCB775BD787C140884613FB8B0D6CDE28470283C77B72B0361E9CFB3DF45E","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c1159e72-ca19-4f29-8cc2-2fc4f255686c"}],"doi":"10.1063/5.0081672"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["nowelizacja kodeksu","tryb kodeksowy","zasada poprawnej legislacji","odpowiedzialność karna"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["amendment to the code","code procedure","the principle of correct legislation","criminal liability"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63c1150b4097076f2a23e814"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Zmiany w kodeksie karnym z 2020 r. w oparciu o tzw. ustawy covidowe w świetle wyroku Trybunału Konstytucyjnego z 14 lipca 2020 r., sygn. akt Kp 1/19","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a38e","mniswId":"200470","title":"Przegląd Prawa Konstytucyjnego","doi":null,"issn":"2082-1212","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"378862b6-eb2a-42e6-bb7f-4ef88424c81d"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"AUGUST","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63c1150b4097076f2a23e813","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["63c1150b4097076f2a23e814"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Zgodnie z Regulaminem Sejmu dokonywanie zmian w ustawie będącej kodeksem wymaga zachowania specjalnego trybu, którego celem jest to, ażeby zmian tych nie dokonywać zbyt pochopnie.

Polymer matrix composites are currently the most popular composite material in marine applications. Fiberglass composites are practically the main type of fiber composites that are used extensively in marine applications. Due to the aggressive sea environment, composite structural elements of ships are exposed to damage due to the phenomenon of osmosis. This damage is also favored by defects that result from impacts and technological errors during the production of these elements. Non-destructive testing methods are necessary to detect damage in the internal structure of the composite. The paper presents a numerical analysis of the possibility of using vibrothermography in the detection of defects in glass–fiber reinforced laminates in marine applications. Numerical simulations have shown that the most favorable method for detecting defects will be acoustic waves. This is an unusual application because, as a rule, the range of ultrasonic waves is used in vibrothermography. In our further works, it is planned to verify numerical calculations through experimental research. The applicability of the terahertz technique was also assessed. During the experimental testing, all defects in the test sample of the glass–fiber reinforced composite were detected using this technique. The presented results indicate the applicability of the presented methods for the detection of defects in composites used in marine applications."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589419","journalIssue":{"objectId":"642290224097072924c11046","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":"7","doi":null,"documentHash":"ed4efe32-445f-469f-8a3e-680b45c104a9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"4171","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/7/4171/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6157c42a75234017e04d6873","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Strąg","uuid":"5A46461BCF03978DBA8C9F228E65C795CA1E2865022197ACD54305F986BAA7050E254030E59E8D815C120AA63ADDA4E4FFA57415D757A478B3413FAC628E54C6","orcidId":"0000-0002-0118-9971","documentHash":"1d3f82c7-7f63-4b7d-b258-3bf66c2f5ddc"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473aef9a","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Świderski","uuid":"FEF6A366C49B7567A6DF133BD7512FA00630C1ED27523AAFC96941F99F8992299B7FD08766BBCAE766660AD4BA9507F26D0C69C43C046C378AEC34E3B81ED40F","orcidId":"0000-0003-4040-2197","documentHash":"bf607b05-9569-42de-91f7-21ec61551ca8"}],"doi":"10.3390/app13074171"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cavitation erosion","Austenitic steel","Roughness","Hardness"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb2","uid":"b3JwWgz_uDIpMZyMFk3QpAw","uuid":"674b7e57-dd24-4e8d-8949-327fa2f8bc82","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb2","parentUuid":"674b7e57-dd24-4e8d-8949-327fa2f8bc82","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb2","rootUuid":"674b7e57-dd24-4e8d-8949-327fa2f8bc82","name":"Instytut Maszyn Przepływowych im.

In-depth hardness measurements have proven the high ability of austenitic steel to strengthen the surface as a result of cavitation loads. A logarithmic relationship was observed between surface hardening and the maximum value of the Ra parameter. A formula was also proposed to estimate the mass loss of the tested steel on the basis of surface roughness measurements."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589421","journalIssue":{"objectId":"642281634097072924c06d16","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"183","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"ebd8e417-9859-4411-beae-5c2eaf303acf"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"183","pagesFromTo":"108431","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0301679X23002189?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709389878c28a0473ac38c","name":"Artur","lastName":"Marchewicz","uuid":"46A1CC429F047BC72FCB75962EBBDF03040CB4390FE81548F67405E2A7DD60F23742B693A6A40FC35A2611AE9FB63EE8D572C0C09E30397253AE270CD8F15CA5","orcidId":"0000-0002-3611-9674","documentHash":"8b264ed5-a289-4297-93f5-b1ab97f85f28"},{"objectId":"5e709389878c28a0473ac2f6","name":"Marta","lastName":"Buszko","uuid":"2B76BF3073153FCFE1B30B755A146F9B5F001E95A4613D6DB5F903C5B41B16025CE810FC467F809ECA8B6EB165BD5CD3404A0F9B289BF829D5519E6008810C88","orcidId":"0000-0003-1123-8906","documentHash":"ca81b8e3-ce01-4792-88e0-9daf25f87420"},{"objectId":"5e709349878c28a0473a67e7","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Zakrzewska","uuid":"8FD9A2FF21B2711EAE99A0CA637D10B868A050C9D6198086895F8C69831BE38546E79E04D580B5820A310DBC0BE7AA41EDB5EC1F601BE4EFA9F1C7295CC175E7","orcidId":"0000-0001-8143-8909","documentHash":"616d4642-6bd9-4f1a-a5d2-80d10f0e3f3e"},{"objectId":"5e7092b0878c28a04739ab89","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Krella","uuid":"D70EBFF45A2028C98E4EFF7BA2078C4ACF6D5F696AC011A0E2700DB55B547D03E748ED170BE68B8C91B0B7F32686D5AEB058DFEE0E3831E40BCC26404586FA30","orcidId":"0000-0001-5285-310X","documentHash":"83a29e72-e632-4d4d-ac08-50f91e77f19a"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.triboint.2023.108431"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["solids","plasticity","material stability","Lagrangian","slip-system selection","time integration","implicit"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Crystal plasticity algorithm based on the quasi-extremal energy principle","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478153","mniswId":"8558","title":"International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering","doi":null,"issn":"0029-5981","eissn":"1097-0207","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"b2d2add5-bde0-4287-ae9a-45488e256d9c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6422afa34097075f21b923b0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70927a878c28a04739673a","5e70927e878c28a047396ae2"]},"issue":"14","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The direct incremental energy minimization in rate-independent plasticity does not account for the skew-symmetric part of the tangent stiffness matrix. In crystal plasticity, this corresponds to neglecting the asymmetry of the matrix of interaction moduli for active slip-systems. This limitation has been overcome in the recently proposed quasi-extremal energy principle (QEP) applicable to nonpotential problems. In the present article it is shown how to extend QEP to finite increments in the backward-Euler computational scheme. A related constitutive algorithm is proposed which enables automatic selection of active slip systems using an energetic criterion, along any path of large deformation of a rate-independent single crystal with a nonsymmetric slip-system interaction matrix. Numerical examples have been calculated for a fcc single crystal subjected to simple shear or uniaxial tension. The slip system activity predicted by using the QEP algorithm has been found to be more reliable in describing the actual plastic response of metal crystals than conventional rate-dependent modeling in cases where the selection of active slip-systems is essential."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589422","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"123","pagesFromTo":"3285-3316","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396ae2","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kursa","uuid":"D841C5ECEE6FC9C9765C632F9920705D6C50AC30C4D648AF0659D28B08EB7682413B80E92EA82C9ED6997C61FCED6D30FF71C2B868289CF5039DE96C50B507F2","orcidId":"0000-0001-8702-6286","documentHash":"0ec99718-5b01-4459-94c4-ed6686b778ba"},{"objectId":"5e70927a878c28a04739673a","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Petryk","uuid":"22B6178F0F4C507B5DC0B22DF0D538C8AFEA9ABF65DB969D5D914038F021F8B99A662B7DFFDE95CFE5281CF3ACC4A84C992471835AFD56DEE7B77039B24FB554","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1efd49bf-ae3c-4225-ade5-8014bd2e040b"}],"doi":"10.1002/nme.6969"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet

On the other hand, it suffers from poor electronic conductivity and low capacitance. To overcome these disadvantages, modification of the LTO surface is frequently undertaken. Considering this idea, the production of a biomass-derived carbon-coated LTO material (LTO/C) and its application as an anode in LIBs is described in this work. The carbon precursor was obtained from commercial carrot juice, which was degraded using microwaves. According to the UV studies, the carbon precursor revealed similar properties to carbon quantum dots. Then, it was deposited on LTO synthetized through a sol-gel method. The LTO/C electrode exhibited a high specific capacity of 211 mAhg−1 at 0.1 C. Capacity retention equal to 53% of the initial value was found for the charge–discharge rate increase from 0.1 C to 20 C. The excellent electrochemical performance of LTO/C was caused by the carbon coating, which provided (i) short diffusion pathways for the Li+ ions into the LTO structure and (ii) enhanced electronic conductivity. The obtained results indicated that biomass-derived carbon quantum dot-coated LTO can be considered as a promising anode for LIBs."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589432","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"7715-1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709459878c28a0473bafba","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Krajewski","uuid":"DC7972884F63C577796BCA5BB19D3424A4AD09555648F24EA7EE429BC8E5C6837B001364A3C2177A89D4C74D9A7F35285F0891AF6B8111791C488B6495F938E9","orcidId":"0000-0002-4486-2978","documentHash":"017a8bea-9a5f-4713-8b14-3f60a8506f45"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15207715"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2c","uid":"blTedeK8fuVutIuS0UC1hLA","uuid":"7a7e1b21-0684-43f6-a0d6-5404df34ac74","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2c","parentUuid":"7a7e1b21-0684-43f6-a0d6-5404df34ac74","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2c","rootUuid":"7a7e1b21-0684-43f6-a0d6-5404df34ac74","name":"Politechnika Krakowska im.

Infection occurs via the consumption of raw or undercooked meat containing this parasite. Symptoms of the disease manifest as intestinal disorders, followed by facial swelling, fever, muscle pain and other symptoms, eventually leading to neurological and cardiac complications and even death. In Europe, trichinellosis is most often associated with the consumption of meat from wild boars, pigs and horses. In recent years, wild boars that are hunted illegally and not tested for Trichinella spp. have been the most common cause of trichinellosis in humans; however, there have also been cases where infected pigs have been the source of infection. When trichinellosis is suspected in humans, epidemiological measures are taken to identify the source. Similarly, an epidemiological investigation should be initiated whenever Trichinella spp. has been detected in pigs. However, commonly used actions do not provide sufficient data to determine the source of infection for pigs and to prevent further transmission. Therefore, in this article, we propose a scheme for effective epidemiological investigations into Trichinella outbreaks on pig farms that can help trace the transmission mechanisms of the parasite and that takes into account currently available testing tools. The proposed pathway can be easily adopted for epidemiological investigations in routine veterinary inspection work."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589439","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6422ad034097072924c367b8","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"955b979d-c0c2-45e7-86b5-024dea853537"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1320","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/12/6/1320/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63b4f2b975234021979cd4e4","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Bełcik","uuid":"77661344F288929533CF8A7024A5412F3C69BE81B07E6C3DDDFADECC0C99EAEFCB8C3D85174909E18CB495D581F97E71C6C20AA3A805B92F0FFDE5E6E231C6A8","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"40a2e3d1-fc18-4a0f-b2f8-f831313648e7"},{"objectId":"5e7094a4878c28a0473c0d79","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Bilska-Zając","uuid":"CA37D40E9E6221954C0E1F92525EB13B265614DDB637B5261A39B130F380056543A7F0D2E0AE9B7220F35F148187F484510166AABC45E68EC5A47A105D08B099","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fb1618f1-0e83-472f-b325-e0c87f8a8872"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5984","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Korpysa-Dzirba","uuid":"0F6E5299BA1DE2C04CCB23BB69EE8BB0AF924331950608E7B9E07C962AC58BA926288AB7400DBD5FDFA0B8F25E5B3E11F82C54FC732A0E0269E9C0A9EB906901","orcidId":"0000-0002-8266-581X","documentHash":"a20ea112-853c-4a02-89cc-69a1868143b6"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d4a","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Sroka","uuid":"D54BE4B84093A5FF9739FB665CBF54EE2891B37B53478AF0F1029745E62033C7B88C51B2D726FDAE584BE9DC2EE3F8CEA3FA851EB5B8089D8737B1A062F9CDC5","orcidId":"0000-0002-7372-7636","documentHash":"f04c53ae-faa6-4609-a0d2-57b9784ca2da"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b69","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Karamon","uuid":"6FC652281DC3E7CEE5831D48F355BCC0E37B505605D00AA8D389A74796325ECB25D4E136854D3D774EDD0E3C95277099BB6981BCE201CE127F3B8AE5C7651C14","orcidId":"0000-0002-5830-167X","documentHash":"0d343e52-20ea-4cfe-a213-5c134e4fef07"},{"objectId":"5e709341878c28a0473a5b50","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Cencek","uuid":"7D7F433A7A31D1A4D080277B2FE49ED9F5B45115086FAEDA03BCF07F6AB6D09B61EC0E8015CEEA44A992C6D7E5DD06BB406798BF1E7065879BA9ED1F3FC8E8D3","orcidId":"0000-0003-3649-7867","documentHash":"7aa79c92-3af1-40b7-85e2-872b041c4104"}],"doi":"10.3390/foods12061320"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Lavandula × intermedia; Lavandula hybrida; Lavandula angustifolia; cultivars; essential oil;","oil yield; chemical composition"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093cc878c28a0473b0f0d","5e709411878c28a0473b5c3e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Lavandula × intermedia—A Bastard Lavender or a Plant of Many Values?

Despite its prevalence in\ncultivation and on the essential oil market, lavandin has received limited attention from the scientific\ncommunity. Remarkably more attention is paid to Lavandula angustifolia (LA), which is commonly\nregarded as the superior lavender and has been extensively researched. Our goal is to provide a\ncomprehensive review of LI, as none currently exists, and assess whether its inferior status is merited.\nIn the first part, we outline the biological and chemical characteristics of the plant and compare it\nto the parent species. The chemical composition of lavandin oil is similar to that of LA but contains\nmore terpenes, giving camphor notes that are less valued in perfumery. Nevertheless, lavandin has\nsome advantages, including a higher essential oil yield, resulting in reduced production cost, and\ntherefore, it is a preferred lavender crop for cultivation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589440","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6422cba64097075f21b9d12b","year":"2023","publishedYear":2023,"volume":"28","number":"7","doi":null,"documentHash":"8d806f97-de26-44be-8037-8577869babc9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"28","pagesFromTo":"1-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"673488d7fdbe830349024f64","name":"P.","lastName":"Wieczorek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1220e62b-1d88-41eb-b436-bbddb1b3d4b8"},{"objectId":"673488d7fdbe830349024f63","name":"Marta","lastName":"Czarniecka-Wiera","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"200121ed-be03-403e-a231-8ac3e910e285"},{"objectId":"673488d7fdbe830349024f62","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Pokajewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"03ef8922-bdbe-43b3-8571-420d8b6f9924"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5c3e","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Maciejczyk","uuid":"6F88ED4C7BE3F2829A6EA0EFE939EF5699DADBE7C58293452DA09CBE3E1C0888BF61F763760451516E9E9899AF08455C628B7F23A45B2C440E1D0B69A4AB7669","orcidId":"0000-0001-9435-5088","documentHash":"5e184a13-46b4-4b9b-91c8-84288bd6e0bc"},{"objectId":"5e7093cc878c28a0473b0f0d","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Krajewska","uuid":"F5504DD8EBCB7D9341DBA5D9A23B7476B981538963873FB901626FE8E076CCB928484D0F66992A760A361A4573D12761EC21D19310172ADED6285EB09761E4F5","orcidId":"0000-0002-0010-6089","documentHash":"0daf000f-b141-44c0-8f3d-39e9846d17c9"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules28072943"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6c","uid":"bdnPLFswu7CLH3zqfWKU3YA","uuid":"ac18272d-83a2-4141-aa4e-01e904b4a061","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Biologii i Biotechnologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094f3878c28a0473c7c87"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Accumulation of Black Carbon Particles in Placenta, Cord Blood, and Childhood Urine in Association with the Intestinal Microbiome Diversity and Composition in Four- to Six-Year-Old Children in the ENVIRON AGE Birth Cohort","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b03","mniswId":"5821","title":"Environmental Health Perspectives","doi":null,"issn":"0091-6765","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"292cdea0-9b30-4229-ae05-a6c2c856f297"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"642370444097075f21ba7ceb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["642370444097075f21ba7cec","642370444097075f21ba7ced","642370444097075f21ba7cee","642370444097075f21ba7cef","642370444097075f21ba7cf0","642370444097075f21ba7cf1","642370444097075f21ba7cf2","642370444097075f21ba7cf3","5e7094f3878c28a0473c7c87","642370444097075f21ba7cf4","642370444097075f21ba7cf5","642370444097075f21ba7cf6"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background:\r\nThe gut microbiome plays an essential role in human health. Despite the link between air pollution exposure and various diseases, its association with the gut microbiome during susceptible life periods remains scarce.\r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nIn this study, we examined the association between black carbon particles quantified in prenatal and postnatal biological matrices and bacterial richness and diversity measures, and bacterial families.\r\n\r\nMethods:\r\nA total of 85 stool samples were collected from 4- to 6-y-old children enrolled in the ENVIRonmental influence ON early AGEing birth cohort. We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing to calculate bacterial richness and diversity indices (Chao1 richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson diversity) and the relative abundance of bacterial families. Black carbon particles were quantified via white light generation under femtosecond pulsed laser illumination in placental tissue and cord blood, employed as prenatal exposure biomarkers, and in urine, used as a post-natal exposure biomarker. We used robust multivariable-adjusted linear models to examine the associations between quantified black carbon loads and measures of richness (Chao1 index) and diversity (Shannon and Simpson indices), adjusting for parity, season of delivery, sequencing batch, age, sex, weight and height of the child, and maternal education. Additionally, we performed a differential relative abundance analysis of bacterial families with a correction for sampling fraction bias. Results are expressed as percentage difference for a doubling in black carbon loads with 95% confidence interval (CI).\r\n\r\nResults:\r\nTwo diversity indices were negatively associated with placental black carbon [Shannon: negative 4.38 percent−4.38%\r\n(95% CI: negative 8.31 percent−8.31%, negative 0.28 percent−0.28%); Simpson: negative 0.90 percent−0.90% (95% CI: negative 1.76 percent−1.76%, negative 0.04 percent−0.04%)], cord blood black carbon [Shannon: negative 3.38 percent−3.38% (95% CI: negative 5.66 percent−5.66%, negative 0.84 percent−0.84%); Simpson: negative 0.91 percent−0.91 (95% CI: negative 1.66 percent−1.66%, negative 0.16 percent−0.16%)], and urinary black carbon [Shannon: negative 3.39 percent−3.39% (95% CI: negative 5.77 percent−5.77%, negative 0.94 percent−0.94%); Simpson: negative 0.89 percent−0.89% (95% CI: negative 1.37 percent−1.37%, negative 0.40 percent−0.40%)]. The explained variance of black carbon on the above indices varied from 6.1% to 16.6%. No statistically significant associations were found between black carbon load and the Chao1 richness index. After multiple testing correction, placental black carbon was negatively associated with relative abundance of the bacterial families Defluviitaleaceae and Marinifilaceae, and urinary black carbon with Christensenellaceae and Coriobacteriaceae; associations with cord blood black carbon were not statistically significant after correction.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nBlack carbon particles quantified in prenatal and postnatal biological matrices were associated with the composition and diversity of the childhood intestinal microbiome. These findings address the influential role of exposure to air pollution during pregnancy and early life in human health."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589447","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"131","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/EHP11257","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"642370444097075f21ba7cf6","name":"Tim","lastName":"Nawrot","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8e27d10f-02d8-4eda-a420-d993167f09ad"},{"objectId":"642370444097075f21ba7cf5","name":"Jeroen","lastName":"Raes","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a87eb1ef-8238-4c3a-b4bd-051807e0dfb5"},{"objectId":"642370444097075f21ba7cf4","name":"Marcel","lastName":"Ameloot","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b7620ca7-a024-47d8-bae9-4ca422ce705f"},{"objectId":"642370444097075f21ba7cf3","name":"Jonathan","lastName":"Van

It is proved that without the successful functioning of this market it is impossible to ensure the innovative development of the country. The characteristics of the intellectual property market, as well as the factors restraining its development, have been determined. The most important of them are significant volumes of outflow of Ukrainian scientists to foreign countries, low quality of Ukrainian patents, high level of counterfeiting and piracy, corruption pressure on the development and use of intellectual property, insufficient level of material support, etc. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop measures to strengthen the factors that contribute to the development of the intellectual property market and reduce the negative impact of factors on the Ukrainian technological market. To achieve the goal, it is proposed to introduce organizational and legal measures to improve the working conditions of employees of the main scientific institution of the country, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) of Ukraine, the institutes of which produce most intellectual developments, as well as to form special financial and material mechanisms to support innovation at the expense of budget funds.\n\nUsing the example of reforming the institutes of NAS, according to the proposed measures, proposals have been formed to preserve scientific personnel, intensify the cooperation of scientific institutions with business, built on the interest of all parties in the field of technology commercialization. Counteraction to counterfeiting is proposed to be carried out taking into account a more accurate calculation of the commercial risks to which business entities are exposed in the manufacture and use of innovations. It is recommended to strengthen the level of legal protection of exclusive rights. Legislative initiatives on the development of the intellectual property market have been formed, which relate to changes in patent legislation regarding utility models and bringing it to EU conditions"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589471","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6422ed2c4097072924c8c872","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"13 (121)","doi":null,"documentHash":"26577192-c4d5-43e9-88c2-c6a6f701fc9d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"113-124","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/273850/269925","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6422faab4097072924c9d522","name":"Petro","lastName":"Pererva","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"144d4f20-d36f-46e8-99e6-e32ae30aeadb"},{"objectId":"6422faab4097072924c9d521","name":"Mariya","lastName":"Maslak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6ed4c5a5-ab5f-4623-ba32-9a47bb3e9ad0"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2023.273850"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-66579-23-1","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Społeczności schyłkowego eneolitu w południowo-wschodniej Polsce w świetle badań archeologicznych i analiz interdyscyplinarnych","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":448,"publicationPlace":"Pękowice | Kraków","translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63c12ef94097076f2a26afe4","editors":[{"objectId":"65e5dbe14097076263d3cdd2","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Włodarczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"45ae6268-b4ae-44e0-aced-23c8ebfea368"},{"objectId":"65e5dbe14097076263d3cdd1","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Libera","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a2db55ec-748a-43fb-a2e5-4b30ddc4bd26"},{"objectId":"65e5dbe14097076263d3cdd0","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Jarosz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ab71c98c-1eaf-408c-bfdb-be57823813f4"},{"objectId":"65e5dbe14097076263d3cdcf","name":"Anita","lastName":"Szczepanek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"02b0e97b-e370-4228-b54c-3250ee2ff60d"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["65e5dbe14097076263d3cdcf","65e5dbe14097076263d3cdd0","65e5dbe14097076263d3cdd1","65e5dbe14097076263d3cdd2"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058589477","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"610809959543c70b144e7020","mniswId":"84900","name":"Wydawnictwo i Pracownia Archeologiczna Profil-Archeo","documentHash":"cce36ca3-a547-4cff-9beb-338c82bdfa35"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://katalogi.bn.org.pl/permalink/48OMNIS_NLOP/1aot9i7/alma991053069005605066","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["maritime security","strategic analysis","maritime policy","management and quality sciences","normative strategy"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de09","uid":"bFitDBcx4YvxolIt7JKxDiw","uuid":"29483405-4eba-4db1-b6c9-321ff370bdf9","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de09","parentUuid":"29483405-4eba-4db1-b6c9-321ff370bdf9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de09","rootUuid":"29483405-4eba-4db1-b6c9-321ff370bdf9","name":"Uniwersytet WSB Merito w Gdańsku","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b7878c28a04739b447"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"THE APPLICATION OF STRATEGIC ANALYSIS IN MARITIME SECURITY DEVELOPMENT","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a3fd","mniswId":"200015","title":"Rocznik Bezpieczeństwa Morskiego","doi":null,"issn":"1898-3189","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"1c95231e-e84c-4fc9-bc1b-3a8182d17994"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63c129d24097076f2a262412","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b7878c28a04739b447"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The study presented here is of interdisciplinary nature because it combines problems from the field of security sciences with methods and tools applied in management and quality sciences. It proves the functionality of strategic analysis applied to strengthen and develop maritime security of the State. A reference point to the analysis discussed in the study is Poland’s Strategic Concept for Maritime Security which provides a comprehensive definition of numerous notions and problems necessary to perform it. The recommendations provided in the above-mentioned document have been verified on the basis of the result of the strategic analysis. The result, in turn, determines a scope of actions that should be undertaken. The scope should be understood as a strategic option that comes as a stage of a long-term process, the further stages of which result from a periodic revision of the strategic analysis that can come from some possible changes in the environment of the analysed entity/State and from the evolution of its strengths and weaknesses. Resulting from the analysis, the strategic options allow the strategy to be implemented in the forms of programmes for the modernisation of the naval forces, operations undertaken in the field of maritime critical infrastructure, non-military operations undertaken by the State administration and maritime economy to improve maritime security. The results of the particular stages of the strategic analysis come as the outcome of the Author’s original work."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589480","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63bea9944097072058720861","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"XVI","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"4cff5448-da11-4c62-ae02-34e063f01ac6"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"XVI","pagesFromTo":"55-93","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.5604/01.3001.0016.1508","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b447","name":"Bohdan","lastName":"Pac","uuid":"31111F2441D548F3DA08F6C90713B0CCCA00C2D237C8AB22FE8DD4431104D1C25A1A77EA05CBEFD5D7247D827E2066FAA56A00FA519717D71AEAF610304BCBDF","orcidId":"0000-0003-0925-785X","documentHash":"3fa41cce-7d82-4d69-ad83-e612f8527219"}],"doi":"10.5604/01.3001.0016.1508"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["perovskite; perovskite solar cells; photovoltaics"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df12","uid":"bSF86rQ-ANh5a2UJEdITniQ","uuid":"1fe7062c-c4d6-471b-822c-3cafe0470f29","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Chemii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["63c1278d4097076f2a25e08e","5e7093d5878c28a0473b1855"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df15","uid":"bR42jPDMRkKGHv60Y9Q25kQ","uuid":"9b699ae6-6e42-406f-ab02-2d5c171b6c86","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Fizyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709356878c28a0473a791c","602e248a9543c7410626ed30","63c1278d4097076f2a25e08f","5e70947f878c28a0473be91c","5e709355878c28a0473a7697"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Enhanced Performance of Camphorsulfonic Acid-Doped Perovskite Solar Cells","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f11","mniswId":"14587","title":"Molecules","doi":"10.3390/molecules","issn":"1420-3049","eissn":"1420-3049","websiteLink":"http://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"184d7608-03fd-4b64-ac86-b4321a9365f0"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-11-14","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"63c1278d4097076f2a25e08c","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602e248a9543c7410626ed30","63c1278d4097076f2a25e08e","63c1278d4097076f2a25e08f","5e70947f878c28a0473be91c","5e709356878c28a0473a791c","5e7093d5878c28a0473b1855","5e709355878c28a0473a7697"]},"issue":"22","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"High-quality perovskite film with large grains and therefore reduced grain boundaries plays a significant role in improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and ensuring good long-term stability of the perovskite solar cells. In this work, we found that adding camphorsulfonic acid (CSA), a Lewis base, to the perovskite solution results in the crystallization of larger perovskite grains. By varying the concentration of CSA, we found that the optimal concentration of the additive is 1 mg/mL, which leads to an 20% increase in PCE of the cells compared to the reference CSA-free cell. Interestingly, we observed that the PCE of cells with an excess of CSA was initially poor, but may increase significantly over time, possibly due to CSA migration to the hole-transporting layer, leading to an improvement in its conductivity."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589483","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6372941540970735595d1ba9","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"27","number":"22","doi":null,"documentHash":"4f93b840-3d29-49e6-9b23-bed3d4703348"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"27","pagesFromTo":"7850","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/22/7850/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63c1278d4097076f2a25e08f","name":"Aliaksei","lastName":"Bohdan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1644481c-4dba-4a49-aa2b-bfa33a0d14df"},{"objectId":"63c1278d4097076f2a25e08e","name":"Ewelina","lastName":"Wierzyńska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8173042e-fc1c-40f2-9e77-789401681a04"},{"objectId":"602e248a9543c7410626ed30","name":"Adam","lastName":"Wincukiewicz","uuid":"528CBA18872292A216459C7BBE1CD54C1B29F30C5B6C43A40927988400E6C4F53142EEB88523805DB30C183BEE99C1047493ED93C081863A2BDC3F1AFE36B507","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0e3b491c-e4eb-4a43-9390-a8f8d9e523ac"},{"objectId":"5e70947f878c28a0473be91c","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Tokarczyk","uuid":"A6084BCC81B181474FC965C1DAF5A847F585C17ACA7F62F83F180952B6327D466F5F559C8282D1ABD3236920C24EE49E0F74C57CC7B51C867478D95FBB7635AB","orcidId":"0000-0001-7459-9800","documentHash":"23dccd88-1e85-412b-a1cb-0708a4cde2bf"},{"objectId":"5e7093d5878c28a0473b1855","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Skompska","uuid":"9C9FA63F5B482096A6F3AD413D95E0DDF39150E129C4FAFDA9167C54C930443ED3ABFDE594B776922F21DEEBDCD52731878480FABA2A82D33689525FE43C3924","orcidId":"0000-0002-0711-7207","documentHash":"a0dc8a68-e223-491c-b0ba-b797fe4cd660"},{"objectId":"5e709356878c28a0473a791c","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Korona","uuid":"F0AD6DDB1A720576FD77B15CB431301A2EF8AF8BD0AE83AC00709460938E24D9168A8446E29EEA2C3DBDEFD34AD8C6A1FDCD749B32737F173EED137DED236ACA","orcidId":"0000-0002-1698-5129","documentHash":"5160ed24-e976-4678-a6f6-0dff2b8c62cf"},{"objectId":"5e709355878c28a0473a7697","name":"Maria","lastName":"Kamińska","uuid":"A3CA7CF3DB3D654B325109DEA341103AA276841638710C76577D2D78980C39F23232A6AB4913BA75A44AEFD37F3862F1BD6C2182FDEAFCE5D3BA2299304634B2","orcidId":"0000-0003-1639-1862","documentHash":"0d818934-ec44-4f0c-bd93-80bd4e612174"}],"doi":"10.3390/molecules27227850"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["electrospinning","phase change materials","pyroelectric materials","shape memory polymers","thermoelectric materials","thermo-optically responsive materials","thermoresponsive materials"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Thermoactive smart electrospun nanofibers","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d30","mniswId":"13802","title":"Macromolecular Rapid Communications","doi":null,"issn":"1022-1336","eissn":"1521-3927","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"02d2a231-4366-400d-a403-cbb7d7030bd0"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6422ae194097075f21b9226d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70947e878c28a0473be5fd","5e709434878c28a0473b8130"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The recent burst of research on smart materials is a clear evidence of the growing interest of the scientific community, industry, and society in the field. The exploitation of the great potential of stimuli-responsive materials for sensing, actuation, logic, and control applications is favored and supported by new manufacturing technologies, such as electrospinning, that allows to endow smart materials with micro- and nanostructuration, thus opening up additional and unprecedented prospects. In this wide and lively scenario, this article systematically reviews the current advances in the development of thermoactive electrospun fibers and textiles, sorting them, according to their response to the thermal stimulus. Hence, several platforms including thermoresponsive systems, shape memory polymers, thermo-optically responsive systems, phase change materials, thermoelectric materials, and pyroelectric materials, are described and critically discussed. The difference in active species and outputs of the aforementioned categories is highlighted, evidencing the transversal nature of temperature stimulus. Moreover, the potential of novel thermoactive materials are pointed out, revealing how their development could take to utmost interesting achievements."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589485","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"43","pagesFromTo":"2100694-1-35","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70947e878c28a0473be5fd","name":"Chiara","lastName":"Rinoldi","uuid":"2B4E67AD266B51FDB7F638E231ABB133D4686F53BA9144CEBB5E969A8E5878CFB21C9E60BB35DBE10167101FD25CCC8B2B5BB5AC97F8ABF205CCB6A51E1A9146","orcidId":"0000-0002-4028-375X","documentHash":"1379f6e4-1b39-411c-97ba-c9101237ba0e"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b8130","name":"Filippo","lastName":"Pierini","uuid":"FF8426BD2EB318FA4847A23413249D5BDF46E4841219F52D6680DA60B6573E518247A172DE7490958EE7DFE81B5A79B1F1FEE75066DC68EDB873079905A1D7A7","orcidId":"0000-0002-6526-4141","documentHash":"c37b454a-db75-41fa-9e2a-f05a90c792e7"}],"doi":"10.1002/marc.202100694"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2c","uid":"blTedeK8fuVutIuS0UC1hLA","uuid":"7a7e1b21-0684-43f6-a0d6-5404df34ac74","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2c","parentUuid":"7a7e1b21-0684-43f6-a0d6-5404df34ac74","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de2c","rootUuid":"7a7e1b21-0684-43f6-a0d6-5404df34ac74","name":"Politechnika Krakowska im.

Treatment decisions were all determined by the local responsible clinicians.\n\nParticipants: The patients (18 years and over) with newly diagnosed AF had at least 1 investigator-determined stroke risk factor and patients were not required to meet specific thresholds of risk score for anticoagulant treatment.\n\nMain outcomes and measures: Observed 1-year event rates and risk-standardised rates were derived.\n\nResults: Rates of death, non-haemorrhagic stroke/systemic embolism and major bleeding varied more than three-to-four fold across countries even after adjustment for baseline factors and antithrombotic treatments. Rates of anticoagulation and antithrombotic treatment varied widely. Patients from countries with the highest rates of cardiovascular mortality and stroke were among the least likely to receive oral anticoagulants. Beyond anticoagulant treatment, variations in the treatment of comorbidities and lifestyle factors may have contributed to the variations in outcomes. Countries with the lowest healthcare Access and Quality indices (India, Ukraine, Argentina, Brazil) had the highest risk-standardised mortality.\n\nConclusion: The variability in outcomes across countries for patients with newly diagnosed AF is not accounted for by baseline characteristics and antithrombotic treatments. Residual mortality rates were correlated with Healthcare Access and Quality indices. The findings suggest the management of patients with AF needs to not only address guideline indicated and sustained anticoagulation, but also the treatment of comorbidities and lifestyle factors."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589492","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62da5a6b40970752a1f03d2a","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"b41f9313-e738-46c6-a5d1-04b7dfc9579c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"e049933","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://syndication.highwire.org/content/doi/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049933","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64241d1940970754eaf270bb","name":"Ajay K","lastName":"Kakkar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"410effc8-bea0-41b5-9ec7-6e13fead1ead"},{"objectId":"64241d1940970754eaf270ba","name":"Freek W A","lastName":"Verheugt","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f4009e06-7293-4e72-b614-50e7e9a7dbde"},{"objectId":"64241d1940970754eaf270b9","name":"Alexander G G","lastName":"Turpie","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e132d94b-4b70-4076-be6b-2949fb6207c5"},{"objectId":"64241d1940970754eaf270b8","name":"Jitendra Pal Singh","lastName":"Sawhney","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5f783c2a-97c1-4d2b-b98e-9daead900d4d"},{"objectId":"64241d1940970754eaf270b7","name":"Alex","lastName":"Parkhomenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a2862357-4f3d-4bcd-8464-023ce293ed88"},{"objectId":"64241d1940970754eaf270b6","name":"Jonathan P","lastName":"Piccini","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e794b29c-d39e-4826-8b81-3ceb7b3cc6ab"},{"objectId":"64241d1940970754eaf270b5","name":"Seil","lastName":"Oh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f28b64ef-416e-49af-a70a-8cad71d582e3"},{"objectId":"64241d1940970754eaf270b4","name":"Frank","lastName":"Misselwitz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e960c3fa-bdf4-43b2-965b-bd2d00d0825c"},{"objectId":"64241d1940970754eaf270b3","name":"Yukihiro","lastName":"Koretsune","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d5f4eb77-cc2b-43ea-9887-1668a3e0aa63"},{"objectId":"64241d1940970754eaf270b2","name":"Gloria","lastName":"Kayani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bb194e28-4b82-42ec-9cf5-7ec33dc5ce23"},{"objectId":"64241d1940970754eaf270b1","name":"Sylvia","lastName":"Haas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9d1f7dcf-a8a5-43f7-afb2-de0eb7755f66"},{"objectId":"64241d1940970754eaf270b0","name":"Samuel Z","lastName":"Goldhaber","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3855dbbc-ccd0-4b46-a4b7-f178d1acb9c7"},{"objectId":"64241d1940970754eaf270af","name":"Shinya","lastName":"Goto","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cadc9dc9-a8cb-4b9e-9aa7-f73fc8b2eb42"},{"objectId":"64241d1940970754eaf270ae","name":"A John","lastName":"Camm","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7ae94f50-1e93-4661-8ead-e9f2a0d5c32f"},{"objectId":"64241d1940970754eaf270ad","name":"Jean-Pierre","lastName":"Bassand","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"77f88f63-95a9-460d-a3a3-c8d5ed6786af"},{"objectId":"64241d1940970754eaf270ac","name":"Saverio","lastName":"Virdone","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ec763172-e8e7-47f4-b821-0027cee1a3a7"},{"objectId":"64241d1940970754eaf270ab","name":"Keith A A","lastName":"Fox","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"82c60428-3156-4e85-b811-60e8992b2221"},{"objectId":"5e7093bd878c28a0473aff02","name":"Janina","lastName":"Stępińska","uuid":"9726309A414552E51A5E8E888A5FAB0521AF6B2745D88D434C80AC4AB9B7AF83206C81BC70AD96E1021663F2B57B83AE2708220C9CECB29A65FCF832CC3AF755","orcidId":"0000-0001-5687-1292","documentHash":"548aa9ce-8768-48be-b404-cd00577067c9"}],"doi":"10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049933"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"642196a94097077da5996321","doi":null,"title":"Niemcy wobec wojny.

While reaching a critical temperature upon heating MC undergoes a physical sol-gel transition and consequently becomes a gel. The MC has been studied for many years and researchers agree that the MC gelation is related to the lower critical solution temperature (LCST). Nevertheless, a precise description of the MC gelation mechanism remains under discussion. In this study, we explained the MC gelation mechanism through examination of a wide range of MC concentrations via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results evidenced that MC gelation is a multistep thermoreversible process, manifested by three and two endotherms depending on MC concentration. The occurrence of the three endotherms for low MC concentrations during heating has not been reported in the literature before. We justify this phenomenon by manifestation of three various transitions. The first one manifests water–water interactions, i.e., spanning water network breakdown into small water clusters. It is clearly evidenced by additional normalization to the water content. The second effect corresponds to polymer–water interactions, i.e., breakdown of water cages surrounded methoxy groups of MC. The last one is related to the polymer–polymer interactions, i.e., fibril hydrophobic domain formation. Not only did these results clarify the MC crosslinking mechanism, but also in the future will help to assess MC relevance for various potential application fields."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589503","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1810-1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f77eba6085dcb410a25e8aa","name":"Beata","lastName":"Niemczyk-Soczyńska","uuid":"4468F8507AF8D691B84ECA31999D5C483CCD4E9289F0DC78A9F62E8985A2F84798278FF5B25FBFDEEC4252700E989FFAAB347BE7880AD78CF5D853D148F82D00","orcidId":"0000-0002-5836-1015","documentHash":"758dc40f-054b-4eef-a427-910b7a836fc9"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396bad","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Sajkiewicz","uuid":"027B6E117AB9E24FF8801A9B76E350BBBE930F056ADFFFA5EEDD0D1775A1820DA5E4750659BC368EEE6773EEC415C2CA97896565A9A9371018E520D985FA5F6A","orcidId":"0000-0003-4092-9853","documentHash":"a91c953a-9edc-417b-9766-8721302b9d48"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396a92","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Gradys","uuid":"3FFCFC8B5B8C7775C53A960D31E46E3CAB0FD5FE0685FEBCF12437D7B65B38A04D7220CD3B16AE212E40630907FB391F2A6461A409E156179F3B469D916662E6","orcidId":"0000-0002-9489-6236","documentHash":"40679e78-606d-4d2e-ba03-f74df4afc2dd"}],"doi":"10.3390/polym14091810"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["composite material","micromechanics","computational modelling","packing effect","shape effect"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Shape and packing effects in particulate composites: micromechanical modelling and numerical verification","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547718d","mniswId":"1653","title":"Archives of Civil and Mechanical Engineering","doi":null,"issn":"1644-9665","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"3fb19666-075e-4e7b-a7f6-eef4902e6243"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6422ae194097075f21b92272","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093e7878c28a0473b30c2","5e70927e878c28a047396a9e","5e70927e878c28a047396ac8"]},"issue":"","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this study is to analyse the joint effect of reinforcement shape and packing on the effective behaviour of particulate composites.

The influence of gamma irradiation with the dose rate of 4.6 kGy/h on the early strength, pore size distribution and qualitative phase composition of mortar was investigated. The range of investigation comprises the effects selected micro- and nano-additions to Portland cement mortar used to control the kinetic of setting and early hardening of cement. Results show that gamma irradiation of hardening mortar results in the early strength increase of about 56–100%, in reduction of capillary porosity and pore size refinement. The gamma-irradiation sensitivity of early strength of cement mortar is equivalent to increased temperature wet curing. A correlation of heat evolution characteristics of hardening mortar and the temperature-equivalent of gamma irradiation is discussed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589511","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"126","pagesFromTo":"104327-1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b7885","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Dąbrowski","uuid":"B12A0C863970C2379E9EBA73F705A012510F7F7842CD2D07397D67020E26469105A220D6AB7C2B33F91098145913D4D97B8E5C75ECAAA79F41EC3BE598B9B971","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ffe1c190-cf39-4806-a8d5-b5c20c7ed6e6"},{"objectId":"5e7093ea878c28a0473b3195","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Dziedzic","uuid":"433FF332FDF3EAD6BAE3D636A0A8A455390CA6EA74C3AA7951F5393FBBB6808DAECE93B0753A5648156866310E7F389F246772931E376C5B3C04B17A94F3A934","orcidId":"0000-0003-2510-4618","documentHash":"fb1af5f6-2177-4ea8-b997-f32dc200d005"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c4d3","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Brachaczek","uuid":"B6647344F90BFC48B0D56EF96419815AE97335C530BD91243ACDECE6D842EA77D75269EC103E7308EA54D96C2C6177B67881A902E5BACE5AB970B4C9B9EB9F41","orcidId":"0000-0002-8272-4138","documentHash":"777f05cf-f94b-4058-9bdb-7b23e240190c"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396a86","name":"Michał","lastName":"Glinicki","uuid":"9B65CBE6F4F02C82F2113459059C72CABD06D234BAC463C15583BABAD59715CA54797D407EA34693662D0ABE00E8D63E10B24031912E3898DE1B35CEFED93CEB","orcidId":"0000-0001-5604-6954","documentHash":"0982be92-f396-4c7b-9fca-497a4a782c05"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2021.104327"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["słownik","prawosławie","teolingwistyka"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dictionary","Orthodoxy","theolinguistics"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"W.

paper concerns the experimental analysis of the energy conversion process during uniaxial tension of 310S austenitic steel. The plastic work distributions were obtained taking into account the influence of strain rate and plastic anisotropy based on the displacement gradient determined experimentally using Digital Image Correlation (DIC) method. On the other hand, the energy dissipated as heat was obtained by the calculation of heat sources from the transient heat conduction equation basing on both the evolution of the temperature field determined by Infrared Thermography and mechanical field provided by DIC. It was shown that the proportions between the terms of the heat conduction equation and between the particular components of the energy dissipated as heat are significantly different for various process durations. As a measure of energy conversion the energy storage rate was used. At the beginning of the plastic deformation, the values are in the range from 0.4 to 0.6 depending on the strain rate and then decrease monotonically up to the level of around 0.15 with the increasing strain. Moreover, just before the end of the process the values decrease significantly and become close to 0 or even negative, which means that the material loses its ability to store the energy."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589534","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"238","pagesFromTo":"111411-1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61415aa99543c7051ff01c5d","name":"Sandra","lastName":"Musiał","uuid":"25B524D7E316C38148F36B121439AD866C8DB8753A22166C3A4BE4715D6ACE7B2CB61F80503E1CF1D20EA3E4B304C714290016B0A27C9F95F0B55798DFFE0D04","orcidId":"0000-0001-7707-6095","documentHash":"0573c168-edcd-489c-8967-018a56d85b44"},{"objectId":"5e70949e878c28a0473c081b","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Urbański","uuid":"86541C54058306A270D092749E5746E506D7E80872D3A493D72871E715D9AD15A3479B98A2A67510C90C19A19BB17F3D36C64036AF7C57AAF7F37794D5F3EAC1","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ea7a82b4-e865-464d-9f56-786140245526"},{"objectId":"5e70947c878c28a0473be1f9","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"6E25CD0CEDAAA972CB3407D22F71FA83ABE34D399E6E3AB19F46007F712C47289C0DAA24C363586FE6C818EC04ED3E710B19C778E01678C7A6D629AAC7DCF120","orcidId":"0000-0001-7894-2258","documentHash":"0c033673-7793-4688-b796-4939190a544b"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396b14","name":"Michał","lastName":"Maj","uuid":"1C21FF9FA59C7B76D79AB4DB39F8634AF1D90C0E13FFA4C83B6C1AB68CE0064100C68E7C0D2668291DF873AD70FB4629C98228A983354DE51AF9AA035BFFEF79","orcidId":"0000-0002-3745-3674","documentHash":"f7af7f5b-34f3-4234-aaee-ddb0f02cd950"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2021.111411"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs)","hydroxyapatite","nanocomposite","magnetic hyperthermia"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Influence of Experimental Conditions during Synthesis on the Physicochemical Properties of the SPION/Hydroxyapatite Nanocomposite for Magnetic Hyperthermia Application","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5a878c28514547cbf5","mniswId":"13827","title":"Magnetochemistry","doi":null,"issn":"2312-7481","eissn":"2312-7481","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"58ee0187-2cb7-4717-8294-ebd4c898ca6a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6422afa34097075f21b923da","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092ef878c28a04739f843","5e709431878c28a0473b7e90"]},"issue":"8:90","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this work, we report on the fabrication of nanocomposites based on superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) in combination with hydroxyapatite (HAp) as a platform for drug delivery and magnetic hyperthermia application.

Then, the superparamagnetic particles were coated with the hydroxyapatite layer for further loading of anticancer drugs, determining the optimal thickness of the HAp shell. The composite was fabricated by the wet chemical process and was characterized by optimizing the experimental conditions of the wiring synthesis to obtain the superparamagnetic spherical material with a high HAp loading as a platform for drug uptake. SEM and TEM studies confirmed the round shape of the magnetic core up to 15 nm in size with a well-defined HAp shell.

Nothing else exists but information. All the knowledge and experience of humans is based on information and its processing. Although Gospel reads that “In the beginning was the word”, humans as a species found it out much later, similarly as it was the case of the origins of the Universe. From this perspective, in the beginning there was information about creation. At first, information was used to survive. We collected the knowledge of the laws that governed the surrounding nature in order not to be dominated or killed by others, and to obtain food. We learnt to use nature to satisfy our own needs. We learnt that living in a group is safer than living alone. We took control of the matter to the extent that allowed us not only to survive, but to dominate other species as well. This fundamental knowledge was based on information gathered as observations, insights and experience. Simultaneously, we learnt and discovered social relations. With time, and when we mastered the ability to survive, studies on social relations, knowledge and experience gathering started to play yet bigger and bigger role. Evolution of these relations is a perfect example of the significance of information in social life.

According to the philosopher, the colloquial phrase allows you to talk about almost everything, but it distances you from empiricism, from authentic rubbish dumps. The author tests the usefulness of this metaphor by analysing the interactions between its parts. They show two symbolic processes: the desacralisation of the mountains and the ennoblement of rubbish. The article focuses on the first one and asks about the images of the hills of the Anthropocene epoch. By interpreting two literary pictures of the trash mountains, an author examines the functioning of that metaphor. In Miron Białoszewski’s \"Chamowo\", the Warsaw landfill is terrifying and a sign of loss. However, in Zbigniew Rokita’s reportage, entitled \"Kajś. Opowieść o Górnym Śląsku\", an industrial heap that is a mountain made by people, is a deformation of nature that has become a permanent part of the region’s landscape. The metaphor of “trash mountains” opens access to ecological issues and becomes a form of involvement in the analysed works."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589551","journalIssue":{"objectId":"63c1285e4097076f2a2601e9","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"38","number":"1","doi":"","documentHash":"536ddaaa-ee64-4371-8045-ed889402f6f7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"38","pagesFromTo":"69-83","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"eng","title":"The Trash Mountains.

Similar features are also shown by the acoustic shear horizontal Maerfeld-Tournois surface waves propagating at the interface of two semi-infinite elastic media due to the piezoelectric effect that should occur in at least one semi-space.\nThe proposed new shear horizontal acoustic surface waves exhibit also strong formal similarities with the electromagnetic surface waves of the surface plasmon polariton (SPP) type, propagating along a metal-dielectric planar interface. In fact, the new shear horizontal elastic surface waves possess a large number of properties that are inherent for the SPP electromagnetic surface waves, such as strong subwavelength concentration of the wave field in the proximity of the guiding interface, low phase and group velocity etc. As a result, the new shear horizontal acoustic surface waves can find applications in sensors with extremely high sensitivity, employed in measurements of various physical parameters, such as viscosity of liquids, as well as in biosensors, chemosensors, or a near field acoustic microscopy (subwavelength imaging) and miniaturized devices of microwave acoustics."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589554","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"47","pagesFromTo":"363-371","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396ab5","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Kiełczyński","uuid":"D5CD5ED50DE597A53311F28C754DB1B3C8BAA2BEE90F88B6A5F398525C130C301B1F5CA10AA49E105FB9A076B9CEA83CE8A191D7885795082133A067AEA77F3B","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"656fe57f-c62a-49e1-a3ae-052188ff1fd9"}],"doi":"10.24425/aoa.2022.142010"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df1f","uid":"b0noSHIUtJa6Uw08fQ9NYJQ","uuid":"03cbc2ce-336f-4f80-872b-657ea8d2cccc","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Prawa i Administracji","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70936f878c28a0473a97fd"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet Warszawski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70936f878c28a0473a97fd"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"It Never Rains but it Pours.

The DEM can model discontinuous material at micro scale very well, but it cannot represent infinite domains. Hence, coupling with the BEM is proposed. A formulation employing the DEM and BEM in different subdomains of the same body is presented. There is no overlap between the sub-domains, and the system of equations is derived based on strong equilibrium and compatibility conditions at the interface. The proposed coupling scheme is based on monolithic time integration. The conducted numerical experiments of one-dimensional wave propagation show excellent agreement with the analytical solution. Some spurious wave reflections are observed at the interface, but their effect is quantified and deemed not critical for infinite domains, which are of main interest. Even though the applications for one-dimensional wave propagation are of limited practical engineering interest, this work represents a significant theoretical breakthrough. This paper establishes a reference for future coupling schemes for two- and three-dimensional multi-scale analysis."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589561","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"135","pagesFromTo":"26-37","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396b5e","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Rojek","uuid":"AB28281295623D94056C4A2468C98DF1AB46D81398A4E02629C75DA7C4E11C83FD5E068CABC50A8B0470D308DD1A173EEE090BD63990DA348A906A999E35DB27","orcidId":"0000-0002-8709-4059","documentHash":"4843ecc7-6625-4e40-b391-bcc1d61f0c26"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.enganabound.2021.10.017"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["gelatin","aminolysis","surface modification","electrospinning"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Immobilization of Gelatin on Fibers for Tissue Engineering Applications: A Comparative Study of Three Aliphatic Polyesters","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145479331","mniswId":"16369","title":"Polymers","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2073-4360","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"5c4f8b81-6463-4e5b-8c64-d1384b8f9293"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6422afa34097075f21b923e4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f802042085dcb410a25ec32","5e7093fd878c28a0473b4880","5e70927e878c28a047396bad"]},"issue":"19","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Immobilization of cell adhesive proteins on the scaffold surface has become a widely reported method that can improve the interaction between scaffold and cells. In this study, three nanofibrous scaffolds obtained by electrospinning of poly(caprolactone) (PCL), poly(L-lactide-co-caprolactone) (PLCL) 70:30, or poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) were subjected to chemical immobilization of gelatin based on aminolysis and glutaraldehyde cross-linking, as well as physisorption of gelatin. Two sets of aminolysis conditions were applied to evaluate the impact of amine group content. Based on the results of the colorimetric bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, it was shown that the concentration of gelatin on the surface is higher for the chemical modification and increases with the concentration of free NH2 groups. XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) analysis confirmed this outcome. On the basis of XPS results, the thickness of the gelatin layer was estimated to be less than 10 nm. Initially, hydrophobic scaffolds are completely wettable after coating with gelatin, and the time of waterdrop absorption was correlated with the surface concentration of gelatin. In the case of all physically and mildly chemically modified samples, the decrease in stress and strain at break was relatively low, contrary to strongly aminolyzed PLCL and PLLA samples. Incubation testing performed on the PCL samples showed that a chemically immobilized gelatin layer is more stable than a physisorbed one; however, even after 90 days, more than 60% of the initial gelatin concentration was still present on the surface of physically modified samples. Mouse fibroblast L929 cell culture on modified samples indicates a positive effect of both physical and chemical modification on cell morphology. In the case of PCL and PLCL, the best morphology, characterized by stretched filopodia, was observed after stronger chemical modification, while for PLLA, there was no significant difference between modified samples. Results of metabolic activity indicate the better effect of chemical immobilization than of physisorption of gelatin."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589562","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"4154-1-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f802042085dcb410a25ec32","name":"Oliwia","lastName":"Jeznach","uuid":"61104A30C4C81C6FD52C374A8A54299BA6A1CF717AAEB0472C2546A077F6D86865871623A7C25E5A9B4A4CBC960836F946A93D2402A88ECE648A788F311A47D4","orcidId":"0000-0003-1956-7835","documentHash":"978c8dad-4f97-47c7-b98e-880debd938bd"},{"objectId":"5e7093fd878c28a0473b4880","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Kołbuk-Konieczny","uuid":"C52A2427AEF1ECDB0F9B8D2AA45FAEFADBC87A94E770A178817071003E31C1E52202934E384B5C81E1F85CE90E567369C5A256076732050A67F5B89CFE33B535","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"58344ad8-9165-48fd-b5b9-9988b3ccf55a"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396bad","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Sajkiewicz","uuid":"027B6E117AB9E24FF8801A9B76E350BBBE930F056ADFFFA5EEDD0D1775A1820DA5E4750659BC368EEE6773EEC415C2CA97896565A9A9371018E520D985FA5F6A","orcidId":"0000-0003-4092-9853","documentHash":"a91c953a-9edc-417b-9766-8721302b9d48"}],"doi":"10.3390/polym14194154"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["food crisis","virtual water","sustainable development","agricultural sector","military aggression"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61a9fa352467f0525e943a7b","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Ukrainian State University of Chemical Technology","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6422f0df4097072924c90298"]},{"id":"6422f0df4097072924c90299","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Alfred Nobel University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6422f0df4097072924c90295","6422f0df4097072924c90296","6422f0df4097072924c90294"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Determining the impact of virtual water scarcity risk on the global food crisis 2022 as a result of hostilities","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"Eastern-European Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-4061","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"3937afea-5395-4435-850d-06bbeb29d2c9"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-02-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6422f0df4097072924c90293","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6422f0df4097072924c90294","6422f0df4097072924c90295","6422f0df4097072924c90296","6422f0df4097072924c90297","6422f0df4097072924c90298"]},"issue":"13 (121)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The object of this study is the process that forms conceptual foundations for managing the impact of virtual water deficiency risks on the global food crisis. The main idea of the study focuses on determining the consequences of the global food crisis in the world under the influence of a significant reduction in virtual water exports from Ukraine to agri-food markets.\n\nIt is determined that most likely, in the context of the replacement of Ukrainian exports of grain and agricultural products as a result of Russian aggression in Ukraine, the countries of the world will resort to new ways of obtaining effective imports of virtual water from other countries. The study proved that rapid structural changes in the economies of the countries of the world and the reorientation of their national economies towards the development of the agricultural sector under modern conditions of global uncertainty would inevitably lead to certain consequences. Namely, either to the fall in the growth rate of national economies, or to the state of the \"bifurcation explosion\" with the subsequent dispersion of possible states of development.\n\nThe proposed scientific and methodological approach to assessing the sustainability of the systemic development of the territory over time for water-intensive regions makes it possible to take calculated decisions at the national level regarding the scale and prospects for the development of economic activities in the state.\n\nThe described theoretical and methodological foundations of the interdependence of water and food security and the developed fundamental provisions of the economies of countries under the conditions of the global food crisis and the risk of a shortage of virtual water will create the following opportunities. Specifically, they enable state authorities to assess the depth of the specified crisis in the world and its consequences for all countries in 2022–2023. Such an understanding creates the conditions for making effective decisions on the volume of import of virtual water in a particular country"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058589564","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6422ed2c4097072924c8c872","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"13 (121)","doi":null,"documentHash":"26577192-c4d5-43e9-88c2-c6a6f701fc9d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"18-31","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/272950/269917","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6422f0df4097072924c90298","name":"Mykola","lastName":"Savchenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6395fbab-f2ca-46ad-8b96-6b623c4d8b78"},{"objectId":"6422f0df4097072924c90297","name":"Vitalina","lastName":"Komirna","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8c20c7b5-deba-4643-a80a-8a4cff78098b"},{"objectId":"6422f0df4097072924c90296","name":"Iryna","lastName":"Shkura","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eafd2bd8-a8c6-4edc-b6e8-88a4475b31b8"},{"objectId":"6422f0df4097072924c90295","name":"Anatolii","lastName":"Zadoia","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"59797d4b-0d7c-45b8-b4d8-e84849390078"},{"objectId":"6422f0df4097072924c90294","name":"Svitlana","lastName":"Fedulova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cbc1ec29-c53a-4209-b200-bbd0b920c3ab"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2023.272950"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["nonlocal gradient elasticity","constitutive boundary conditions","constitutive continuity conditions","nano-beams","NEMS"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Nonlocal strain and stress gradient elasticity of Timoshenko nano-beams with loading discontinuities","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c2851454781e4","mniswId":"8878","title":"International Journal of Engineering Science","doi":null,"issn":"0020-7225","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"40eb3a35-2ebd-4714-aa9d-bc643986b104"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6422ae194097075f21b92269","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5f34b52575234011c31217af"]},"issue":"","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A unified approach is applied for determining both strain- and stress-driven differential formulations of Timoshenko nano-beams in presence of loading discontinuities. The consequent models can simulate small scale effects with different types of constitutive laws (such as pure nonlocal, mixture of local and nonlocal phases, and nonlocal gradient). A specific novel feature of the proposed models is the ability to consider loading discontinuities, i.e. points of discontinuities for generalized internal forces occurring in presence of external supports, forces, or couples concentrated at internal points of the nano-beam. To this end, novel constitutive continuity conditions (CCCs) are imposed at the beam interior points of loading discontinuities. CCCs contain integral convolutions of generalized forces or displacements over suitable parts of the nano-beam; they represent a valid alternative to Dirac delta function and are different from the well-known constitutive boundary conditions (CBCs) imposed at the end-points of the nano-beam.

Nano silica (NS) was used to activate the hydration of SSC by taking advantage of its ability to regulate silicate and aluminate reactions. The mechanical performance of various mixes was determined, as a function of sulfation degree and NS addition, as pore structure, phase assemblage, hydration degree, and microstructure. Results showed that NS improves the hydration degree of slag, densifies the microstructure, and significantly increases both early- and late-age compressive strength. The enhancement was attributed to its effects on the hydration of slag in SSC: delaying ettringite formation, but promoting C-(A)-S-H precipitation, reducing microporosity.

It is built with Livox Mid−40 lidar with a conic field of view extended by a custom rotating planar reflector. This 3D sensor is compared with the more expensive Velodyne VLP 16 lidar. It is shown that the proposed sensor reaches satisfactory accuracy and range. Furthermore, it is able to preserve the metric accuracy and non−repetitive scanning pattern of the unmodified sensor. Due to preserving the non−repetitive scan pattern, our system is capable of covering the entire field of view of 38.4 × 360 degrees, which is an added value of conducted research. We show the calibration method, mechanical design, and synchronization details that are necessary to replicate our system. This work extends the applicability of solid−state lidars since the field of view can be reshaped with minimal loss of measurement properties. The solution was part of a system that was evaluated during the 3rd European Robotics Hackathon in the Zwentendorf Nuclear Power Plant. The experimental part of the paper demonstrates that our affordable robotic mobile 3D mapping system is capable of providing 3D maps of a nuclear facility that are comparable to the more expensive solution.
