Floods, and flash floods in particular, generate economic, environmental, and social effects. Economic effects include damage to infrastructure, the negative influence upon transportation and communications networks, and an increase in fuel costs, as well as time loss due to traffic delays (congestion) and the necessity of taking alternative routes. It is therefore important to take action both to prevent and to mitigate these effects. In the 21st century there has been a radical change in the approach to the issue of flood protection (as seen in the approach formulated within the 2007 European Floods Directive)—it is no longer believed that there is such a thing as complete protection against floods, but that the damage and loss it inflicts can only be mitigated, and since floods cannot be completely eradicated, societies must learn how to live with them. In the event of a flood, preprepared procedures to counteract and mitigate the effects of the disaster are followed, including the evacuation of people and movable property from affected areas.\r\n\r\nEvacuation planning is meant to reduce the number of disaster-related (including flood) fatalities and material losses. Crucially, this type of planning requires a well-defined, optimum evacuation policy for people and households within flood hazard areas. In addition, evacuation modelling is particularly important for authorities, planners, and other experts managing the process of evacuation, as it allows for more effective relocation of evacuees to safety. Modelling can also facilitate the identification of bottlenecks within the transportation system prior to the occurrence of a disaster; that is, it enables us to determine the impact of flood-related road closures, and to comprehend—among other things—the effects a phased evacuation has on traffic load. Furthermore, not only may the ability to model alternative evacuation scenarios lead us to establish appropriate policies, evacuation strategies, and contingency plans, but it might also facilitate better communication and information flow.\r\n\r\nEvacuation from flood-hazard areas is a major challenge for the field of flood risk management as well as the fields of traffic engineering and transport planning. This is particularly true when the research has to include not only those journeys directly related to escape from hazardous places, but also their reflexive relationship with the total number of journeys made in the “background” of the evacuation itself."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421588","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-42","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://oxfordre.com/naturalhazardscience/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199389407.001.0001/acrefore-9780199389407-e-440","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093c1878c28a0473b03b8","name":"Szymon","lastName":"Wiśniewski","uuid":"112319A1EBC8325C77602824C8BB900F4A0A6EBD023BCDC2EFF3220AF57D5CB92815661530D37E39CA851257AD2FD2287DDA3B4AD6A4FFF92C3692C69EE33583","orcidId":"0000-0001-5488-5949","documentHash":"d3008eff-4e34-4ea8-ad26-3cd2e90a0ff1"},{"objectId":"5e70939e878c28a0473ade85","name":"Marta","lastName":"Borowska-Stefańska","uuid":"6E72B47FB40CA12BD68F7517CFC51B3C725179251529AA38FF5BB02EC33079532DA4D2BE81E5DD3C1776433D9AFB60555EB038FABBA40FB9719C15AC729B80D8","orcidId":"0000-0003-2448-4778","documentHash":"0aa0399e-88e1-4e61-80be-82e13f016464"}],"doi":"10.1093/acrefore/9780199389407.013.440"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":"978-91-89504-20-2","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737ddd9","uid":"brSLXPVso2IWE01FTmuoK5g","uuid":"58bdce52-e319-4ebc-8565-cf242318e51c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737ddd9","parentUuid":"58bdce52-e319-4ebc-8565-cf242318e51c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737ddd9","rootUuid":"58bdce52-e319-4ebc-8565-cf242318e51c","name":"Collegium Civitas w Warszawie","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["671facc0fdbe8307b0c0e9d2"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Queer(y)ing Kinship in the Baltic Region and Beyond","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":355,"publicationPlace":"Huddinge","translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65cc903d4097073ccbc5c3db","editors":[{"objectId":"671facc0fdbe8307b0c0e9d4","name":"Antu","lastName":"Sorainen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"61dc671d-aa23-42af-8113-8d46945dec2d"},{"objectId":"671facc0fdbe8307b0c0e9d3","name":"Uibo","lastName":"Raili","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"15663642-d0be-4041-9ac0-ea9000d7fd3c"},{"objectId":"671facc0fdbe8307b0c0e9d2","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Mizielińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d688bed6-a2fd-4775-85c1-a8c582641c2c"},{"objectId":"671facc0fdbe8307b0c0e9d1","name":"Ulrika","lastName":"Dahl","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aa236285-f77c-4f4b-916c-661b25102a41"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["671facc0fdbe8307b0c0e9d1","671facc0fdbe8307b0c0e9d2","671facc0fdbe8307b0c0e9d3","671facc0fdbe8307b0c0e9d4"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059421593","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":"1","volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5ebff222ad49b31ccebeee45","mniswId":null,"name":"Södertörns högskola","documentHash":"81e4adbc-c929-4357-9be5-dea3290d8fcf"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://bazawiedzy.civitas.edu.pl/info/book/CCWde6907404a19431c9062c86bc2dbc753/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Corporate social responsibility","internal CSR","job satisfaction"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df6e","uid":"bQeipS4MvQr1wvpe3eSfkxA","uuid":"ce9d174a-cb81-4f87-9171-977021bb017c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Ekonomiczny","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927a878c28a047396588"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Is it worthwhile to be responsible?

Three types of post-production wood waste, i.e., ash wood chips, oak chips and medium-density wood fiberboard (MDF), were used in this study. Three different biocomposites were produced for each of these materials, differing in the content of waste to polymer. The biodegradable and compostable bioplastic Mater-Bi (CF05S) was obtained using the pioneering proprietary technologies of Novamont company using starches, cellulose, vegetable oils and their combinations. Mater-Bi was used as the matrix of the composite, which, due to its chemical composition, allows the production of fully biodegradable composites. The physicochemical properties, such as static tensile, impact, water absorption and hardness, were investigated. The results provide the basis for a detailed analysis of the properties of the biocomposites and made it possible to accurately determine their properties. The results show that the optimal solution is the Mater-Bi biocomposite with 20 wt.% oak filler content, which shows the most favorable adhesion strength and water absorption. The research conducted here is in the context of issues related to sustainability and a circular economy, through waste management, as well as through the production of biodegradable construction products."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421608","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65c9f27940970762634a1497","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"16","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"76bc2897-2232-4ee6-8ac5-f481a5909abe"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"1370-1 - 1370-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/4/1370","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65cdd2a840970762636d7e1b","name":"Mariana","lastName":"Pajtášová","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4ff5bc7a-ce5a-4a6c-a154-0b33d594f3ba"},{"objectId":"65cdd2a840970762636d7e1a","name":"Damian","lastName":"Wachowiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e7ed1d8c-31b8-4fea-9b1b-299001541df4"},{"objectId":"65cdd2a840970762636d7e19","name":"Darina","lastName":"Ondrušová","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"59ef860f-948b-4e35-97ec-a7deeebaad3f"},{"objectId":"65cdd2a840970762636d7e18","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Gizelski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a04b65b9-9757-42d8-9cc8-dd7a7c6b6049"},{"objectId":"63520429752340623bbf00ae","name":"Wiktoria","lastName":"Kanciak","uuid":"4AD229BECC318F5E275F799C3FAA73F63F91BDD116658FC0FF0C03ECDE03000963FA59361122E6D793EDA988F2311DD925F6287B332F338535A681196493F0BA","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"74e6c012-6b5f-4cc7-b1cc-28ae2561f8c0"},{"objectId":"5e7092f1878c28a04739fa4d","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Czarnecka-Komorowska","uuid":"80CD3EB83C010532DF6430B0466F5D42A95C3DB1CD20232D38979AF4C15F3A472128392E027128B26F4A0BB451139EFACCDD57DA36E8D523AFB96951F41F6B01","orcidId":"0000-0002-5027-7484","documentHash":"dba239c0-10ee-4bc3-96db-7da8a1eb5de4"}],"doi":"10.3390/su16041370"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

It is the first line of defense against external insults in the skin and in the gastrointestinal and upper and lower respiratory tracts. The steep increase in chronic disorders in recent decades, including allergies and autoimmune disorders, has prompted studies to investigate the immune mechanisms of their underlying pathogeneses, all of which point to a thought-provoking shared finding: disrupted epithelial barriers. Climate change with global warming has increased the frequency of unpredictable extreme weather events, such as wildfires, droughts, floods, and aberrant and longer pollination seasons, among many others. These increasingly frequent natural disasters can synergistically damage the epithelial barrier integrity in the presence of environmental pollution. A disrupted epithelial barrier induces proinflammatory activation of epithelial cells and alarmin production, namely, epithelitis. The \"opened\" epithelial barrier facilitates the entry of the external exposome into and underneath the epithelium, triggering an expulsion response driven by inflammatory cells in the area and chronic inflammation. These changes are associated with microbial dysbiosis with colonizing opportunistic pathogens and decreased commensals. These cellular and molecular events are key mechanisms in the pathogenesis of numerous chronic inflammatory disorders. This review summarizes the impact of global warming on epithelial barrier functions in the context of allergic diseases. Further studies in the impact of climate change on the dysfunction of the epithelial barriers are warranted to improve our understanding of epithelial barrier-related diseases and raise awareness of the environmental insults that pose a threat to our health."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421609","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"131","pagesFromTo":"703-712","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1081120623005884","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e7614097076263e8993f","name":"Cezmi A","lastName":"Akdis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7acd9d8a-7250-467a-af8b-7e0a3c68be3f"},{"objectId":"6630e7614097076263e8993e","name":"Mübeccel","lastName":"Akdis","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cecffa91-b185-4863-a8f8-31e80f616018"},{"objectId":"6630e7614097076263e8993d","name":"Kari C","lastName":"Nadeau","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d3652af7-cd99-4f71-b2d6-cc59ade58124"},{"objectId":"6630e7614097076263e8993c","name":"Ioana","lastName":"Agache","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"818b1803-7ee0-4ff1-9801-6f6cfad2850b"},{"objectId":"6630e7614097076263e8993b","name":"Duygu","lastName":"Yazici","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d028a191-4fd8-4119-b45e-21929df83b20"},{"objectId":"6630e7614097076263e8993a","name":"Yagiz","lastName":"Pat","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d0783e0e-849d-4b56-b5eb-bf674971329b"},{"objectId":"6630e7614097076263e89939","name":"Ismail","lastName":"Ogulur","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"72fdcac8-22e2-4347-a225-a20248204e6c"},{"objectId":"6630e7614097076263e89938","name":"Umut Can","lastName":"Kucuksezer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4cb7cbc6-69c6-4a9e-a052-c5678a90f3e0"},{"objectId":"6630e7614097076263e89937","name":"Cevdet","lastName":"Ozdemir","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"03ea417a-e733-4ad4-a913-1c506c766397"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a128f","name":"Marek","lastName":"Jutel","uuid":"A78748B9708FABEC4F609A25EA33E7A6FC529862CB0F56DFFB4850E30D545C8D8C437618E5BB1B295640D5DE0811C600463703ADACDAB92A595C1DF30A2F11B5","orcidId":"0000-0003-1555-9379","documentHash":"f4fbdcc1-b6e7-48dc-a4e0-8a41369de034"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.anai.2023.08.010"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["body mass index","glucose","insulin","oxidative stress","Down syndrome"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

BMI, BMI SDS, OSI and HOMA-IR were calculated.\r\n\r\nResults: SG vs. CG: BMI - overweight (29,19% vs. 15%), obese (19,05% vs. 5%); TAS (1.92 mmol/l vs. 1.79 mmol/l (p = 0.0015)); TOS (51.52 mmol/l vs. 33.05 mmol/l (p = 0.014)); OSI (2475.02 vs. 1949,75 (p = 0.038)); no significant differences in fasting glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR. Statistically significant correlations in SG: TOS and BMI, BMI SDS, HOMA-IR; OSI and BMI, BMI SDS, HOMA-IR; HOMA-IR and BMI SDS; fasting insulin and BMI PC; in CG: TAS and BMI; fasting glucose and fasting insulin.\r\n\r\nConclusions: The research results indicate differences in metabolic processes between the group of individuals with DS compared to the CG, despite shared environmental conditions. The presence of an additional copy of chromosome 21 may contribute to the occurrence of metabolic disorders. These findings emphasize the need for further research that will lead to a better understanding of these relationships and contribute to the development of effective therapeutic strategies."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421611","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"134-142","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/Comparative-analysis-of-obesity-prevalence-antioxidant-and-oxidant-status-r-nin-children-with-Down-syndrome-a-sibling-controlled-study,138,51495,1,1.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ecc8e237523406a2b8ea62e","name":"Marta","lastName":"Hetman","uuid":"B380E7EEEDD224D1F960626EE67E427C5F210E0E31701A11739743D72F7802118F616772D23EBB56B264C52651518D316FDA78E93C0E549C952CC9C4C43706F5","orcidId":"0000-0002-9051-4296","documentHash":"bf8356b4-bc8a-4ecd-b933-f152d05a42a6"},{"objectId":"5e70930b878c28a0473a1c17","name":"Sylwia","lastName":"Płaczkowska","uuid":"DE2836D8E72BBE1495D849E973C3916E2E2F7DDD0B7E155A8A74334C5B955BC4DCAEE04EADED379B5434ABA9C2C9A7239D925B4D13B36C2DC1289D0522357A84","orcidId":"0000-0002-1466-3820","documentHash":"b80f5d6d-f788-45c1-9b5e-6f428432179e"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1bb9","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Barg","uuid":"A2223320DB3FC3193ABA8BFD1667A4EB09484D732075C73329C9195BA837F4ACA5753B445563B691A2A6D46322B44133036FF4FD017A7B15B40ABD49BF2108D6","orcidId":"0000-0002-7069-5026","documentHash":"c49fc4ef-1db3-491f-b044-bdab9983d560"}],"doi":"10.5114/pedm.2023.131513"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df11","uid":"bRiPKCJaNQKr372welbktQQ","uuid":"7e446936-5132-4a81-99e4-260c9368f588","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Biologii","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["60c2fdd39543c72336543768"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Plant height variation and genetic diversity between <i>Prunus ledebouriana</i> (Schlecht.)

Known as the centroid-based clustering problem, it is mainly addressed by the k-means algorithm and its modifications. As the k-means performance becomes poorer on large datasets, including the dataset shape stretching, the goal is to study a possibility of improving the centroid-based clustering for such cases. It is quite noticeable on non-sparse datasets that the resulting clusters produced by k-means resemble beehive honeycomb. It is natural for rectangular-shaped datasets because the hexagonal cells make efficient use of space owing to which the sum of the within-cluster squared Euclidean distances to the centroids is approximated to its minimum. Therefore, the lattices of rectangular and hexagonal clusters, consisting of stretched rectangles and regular hexagons, are suggested to be successively applied. Then the initial centroids are calculated by averaging within respective hexagons. These centroids are used as initial seeds to start the k-means algorithm. This ensures faster and more accurate convergence, where at least the expected speedup is 1.7 to 2.1 times by a 0.7 to 0.9 % accuracy gain. The lattice of rectangular clusters applied first makes rather rough but effective partition allowing to optionally run further clustering on parallel processor cores. The lattice of hexagonal clusters applied to every rectangle allows obtaining initial centroids very quickly. Such centroids are far closer to the solution than the initial centroids in the k-means++ algorithm. Another approach to the k-means update, where initial centroids are selected separately within every rectangle hexagons, can be used as well. It is faster than selecting initial centroids across all hexagons but is less accurate. The speedup is 9 to 11 times by a possible accuracy loss of 0.3 %.

At younger age, anemia appears to be frequent at diagnosis, but its prevalence and its impact on prognosis are not well known. In the International Registry of Childhood CML, we selected children and adolescents in chronic phase at diagnosis of CML and treated upfront with imatinib. We examined their hemoglobin level at diagnosis according to the WHO grades to assess the prevalence of anemia and its impact on response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Data on 430 patients were included. Anemia at diagnosis was observed in 350 patients (81%), with a mean hemoglobin level of 96.4 g/l (SD 23.6). Among them, 182 patients (52%) presented with moderate anemia and 110 (31%) with severe anemia while 58 (17%) had mild anemia. Compared with mild and no anemia, moderate and severe forms were significantly associated with younger age at diagnosis, asthenia, splenomegaly, and increased leukocyte and basophil counts. Delays in achieving major and deep molecular responses were significantly increased for patients with moderate and severe anemia, and also failure of imatinib treatment was more frequent in these two sub-cohorts. However, hemoglobin level was not significantly associated with survival. Anemia at diagnosis of pediatric CML was frequent and may be considered as a prognostic factor.

The Internet is an accessible source for individuals, medical students, and healthcare professionals to acquire knowledge when searching for health-related information. Access to information has increased with the widespread use of the Internet today. Recognition of sudden cardiac arrest and initiating interventions according to current guidelines can be achieved through education. This study aims to assess the accuracy of BLS and CPR videos on YouTube following the 2020 AHA Resuscitation Guidelines.\r\n\r\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: This study follows a cross-sectional analytical design. The YouTube website was searched using the following keywords for Turkish videos uploaded from October 21, 2020, to September 7, 2023: 'CPR, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, basic life support, CPR, advanced cardiac life support'. October 21, 2020, was chosen as the reference date since it marks the publication date of the 2020 AHA guidelines.\r\n\r\nRESULTS: A total of 265 Turkish videos were evaluated from all videos uploaded to YouTube. The analysis included 130 videos that met the inclusion criteria.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS: Turkish BLS and CPR YouTube videos violate the 2020 AHA criteria for offering basic information to the public and cannot teach healthcare workers advanced medical skills. The greater viewing of anonymous sources' videos suggests that non-experts are submitting videos on hot themes to gain viewers.

The fluorescence spectroscopy showed an association between exe and protein as 4.57 × 104 M−1 (290 K), 3.33 × 104 M−1 (300K) and 2.54 × 104 M−1 (310K) and the number of binding sites were 1.15, 1.09, and 1.02, respectively. The binding process occurred spontaneously and the electrostatic bonds play a predominant role in the gHSA-exe interaction. The affinity drug to gHSA was studied in the presence of metal ions (Ca2+, Cr3+, Zn2+), which are often given as a supplement to the diet. Our study indicates that metal ions have an effect on the increase of the affinity of exenatide to glycated albumin and it is the result of the metal ion-exenatide-albumin interaction. Based on CD spectroscopy it is evident that exenatide has nonsignificant effect on the protein secondary structure, but the changes are visible in the presence of metal ions. Zeta potential measurements indicate instability of the system at lower concentration of the ligand - the effect is desired in point of view of pharmacology."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421634","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"294","pagesFromTo":"art.106948 [8 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301462222001909","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70930b878c28a0473a1c18","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Wiglusz","uuid":"6C9DCC169D82CC2569AEFE3777654D082AE965A163DD351E7867B628D809BD4265410DE7EEBE0D61E405D4E94ECB4EE0C019EFFC4EC5D3CC31F304B5061ADA31","orcidId":"0000-0002-5675-4544","documentHash":"bc637d3e-bebd-491e-9c30-15ab11fab787"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a140f","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Śliwińska-Hill","uuid":"D699833B87AD12D92858030E3665FD4B73FAC97FFB3C3C4D7FD7CAB688C4DA7A148EC24B677EB5F9D8DFB191D7251BC6718D44ED57AC8B70ECD94F6F891BF34B","orcidId":"0000-0002-8484-6470","documentHash":"d8f7c9cc-0e85-4b70-942b-e28261d37d39"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.bpc.2022.106948"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["asthma","children","wheezers","microbiome","wheeze","airways","bacteria"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Caregivers are crucial in ensuring that their relatives with heart failure (HF) reach proper self-care levels. Despite this, the demanding nature of caring for others can lead to poor outcomes and the compromise of own needs, which raises the need for perceived social support. Prior research does not offer a thorough knowledge of how caregivers of people with HF regarded social support and the characteristics that went along with it. Purpose. The aim of this study was to develop a comprehensive understanding of perceived social support and its associated factors among caregivers of individuals with heart failure. Methods. This is a secondary analysis of a convergent mixed-methods design study. The perception of social support, mutuality, anxiety, depression, and quality of life were assessed in 158 heart failure patients and their caregivers (physical and mental dimensions). In 50 caregivers, we also performed semistructured interviews. Results. The mixed analysis and integration of qualitative and quantitative inferences revealed two main factors affecting perceived social support. First, caregivers with strong familial network and greater number of caregivers available for tangible caregiving support and moral support perceived increased sense of social support. Second, caregivers with enhanced mental health had increased sense of social support. Conclusions. Caregiver perception of social support might be influenced by mental well-being status. To improve caregivers' perceptions of social support and community belonging, it is necessary to create and assess community- and individual-based mental health promotion interventions. To strengthen the perception of support in the heart failure caring process, more dyadic strategies should be established to improve patient-caregiver mutuality."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421641","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2023","pagesFromTo":"art.5550987 [11 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.hindawi.com/journals/hsc/2023/5550987/","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e5b24097076263e88c6e","name":"Angela","lastName":"Durante","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"deec988b-f56e-4d79-84a7-5c139d9bb719"},{"objectId":"6630e5b24097076263e88c6d","name":"Alberto","lastName":"Dal Molin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7a684c09-f28a-4472-8210-26693c41ba88"},{"objectId":"6630e5b24097076263e88c6c","name":"Lucinda J.","lastName":"Graven","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5b58e291-09c8-46f0-9fef-9d79f69b95d9"},{"objectId":"6630e5b24097076263e88c6b","name":"Raul","lastName":"Juarez-Vela","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a6ace801-33bb-4c26-bfed-eb635cb3370c"},{"objectId":"6630e5b24097076263e88c6a","name":"Josiane","lastName":"Boyne","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c51890a4-04fe-4d9c-86fa-7e8b32491814"},{"objectId":"6630e5b24097076263e88c69","name":"Bridgette Brawner","lastName":"Rice","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8d7ff867-ebc5-4454-8781-fc1025134ae0"},{"objectId":"6630e5b24097076263e88c68","name":"Angela","lastName":"Cuoco","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e6c78111-ae06-4af8-b69c-41a96f53a06e"},{"objectId":"6630e5b24097076263e88c67","name":"Marco","lastName":"Di Nitto","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7219e0cc-f4e3-47db-b7a2-1228524ca752"},{"objectId":"6630e5b24097076263e88c66","name":"Ahtisham","lastName":"Younas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"39aeea2c-1b7e-4b98-9157-0692cca5c967"},{"objectId":"65f26f3840e3ff25249e6537","name":"Ercole","lastName":"Vellone","uuid":"91787B098D203366D4A79F0CE072972CF0FF112DE7C49487D02D142AC7244C3094A35A905903F5E1DA2383C833910AB53DA4F7379DE97717204DE1AEB0055EE9","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"299b335d-f2d3-45fd-a196-d14098f8c31b"}],"doi":"10.1155/2023/5550987"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["HFpEF","HFrEF","Heart failure","Risk factors","preclinical research","therapy","valvular heart disease"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Results of recent clinical and preclinical investigations aid preventive strategies, diagnostic efforts, and therapeutic interventions, and collectively, they hold promises for a more effective HF care for the near future. Accordingly, currently available information extends the 2021 European Society of Cardiology guidelines and provides a solid background for the introduction of improved clinical approaches in the number of HF-related cases. Elaboration on the relationships between epidemiological data and risk factors lead to better understanding of the pathophysiology of HF with reduced ejection fraction and HF with preserved ejection fraction. The clinical consequences of valvular dysfunctions are increasingly interpreted not only in their haemodynamic consequences but also in association with their pathogenetic factors and modern corrective treatment possibilities. The influence of coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the clinical care of HF appeared to be less intense in 2022 than before; hence, this period allowed to refine coronavirus disease 2019 management options for HF patients. Moreover, cardio-oncology emerges as a new subdiscipline providing significant improvements in clinical outcomes for oncology patients. Furthermore, the introduction of state-of-the-art molecular biologic methods, multi-omic approaches forecast improved phenotyping and precision medicine for HF. All above aspects are addressed in this article that highlights a selection of papers published in ESC Heart Failure in 2022.

Accurate estimation of resting metabolic rate (RMR) allows implementing a proper calorie restriction diet in patients with lipedema. Our study aimed to compare actual resting metabolic rate (aRMR) with predicted resting metabolic rate (pRMR) in women with lipedema and to determine the association between individual body composition parameters, body mass index, and aRMR.\r\nMethods and Results: A total of 108 women diagnosed with lipedema were enrolled in the study. aRMR was obtained by indirect calorimetry (IC) using FitMate WM metabolic system (Cosmed, Rome, Italy). pRMR was estimated with predictive equations and bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA). All body composition parameters were based on BIA. The mean aRMR in the study group was 1705.2 ± 320.7 kcal/day. This study found the agreement of predictive equations compared to IC is low (<60%). Most methods of predicted RMR measurement used in our study significantly underpredicted aRMR in patients with lipedema. Therefore, the most applied equations remain useless in clinical practice in this specific population due to large individual differences among the studied women.\r\nConclusions: IC is the best tool to evaluate RMR in evaluated patients with lipedema.

The presence of bone septum in the maxillary sinus is one of the most common anatomical findings. So-called Underwood septa (US) are an atypical bone formation in the maxillary sinuses. Mostly they are quite easily found in CBCT studies and have major importance in sinus lift procedures in dental surgery. Furthermore, the shape, location, and size of the bony septa are important in each maxillary sinus surgery. Material and methods. A retrospective study of 120CBCT scans from the authors’ own database was conducted. Results. Approximately 37.5% of each CBCT was associated with the occurrence of US, while just 25% had a full septum, and a total of only 14 patients had a half septa. More females have US, while healthy pneumatized maxillary sinus is most commonly found (82.22%). There is no correlation between the occurrence of silent sinus syndrome (p = 0.174), mucosal thickening (p = 0.325), or retention cyst formation (p = 0.272). Most sinuses are without any opacification in CBCT evaluation (91.11%), while other syndromes are not statistically relevant. Conclusions.

Risk factors for SB include among others emotional stress, anxiety, tobacco smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption. Coffee and black tea are among the most commonly consumed beverages worldwide. This study explores the influence of coffee and black tea consumption on bruxism intensity, as observed in polysomnographic examination.\r\n\r\nMethods: Polysomnographic examination with simultaneous camera recording was conducted in 106 adult subjects. The results were evaluated according to guidelines set out by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM). The study group was divided according to habitual stimulant usage, as declared by the participants in a self-reported questionnaire. Four groups were identified: coffee drinkers versus non-drinkers and black tea drinkers versus non-drinkers.\r\n\r\nResults: The bruxism episode index (BEI) was increased in coffee-drinkers as opposed to non-drinkers (4.59 ± 3.44 vs. 2.87 ± 1.50, p = 0.011). Sleep fragmentation, measured according to the arousal index, was comparable in coffee drinkers and non-drinkers. Electrolyte and lipid levels were similar in coffee drinkers and non-drinkers. Habitual black tea intake did not affect sleep architecture or bruxism intensity.\r\n\r\nConclusions: The study showed that habitual coffee consumption is a risk factor for the increased intensity of sleep bruxism. Neither coffee nor tea consumption is related to sleep fragmentation in habitual drinkers. Coffee and tea intake does not affect electrolyte and lipid concentrations. Caution should therefore be recommended in drinking coffee in people with sleep bruxism."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421831","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"9","pagesFromTo":"e16212 [10 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844023034199","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e9864097076263e8a167","name":"Dorian","lastName":"Nowacki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f952a9ff-d5a0-4ff9-bbe4-35b8da0fe2e6"},{"objectId":"6630e9864097076263e8a166","name":"Weronika","lastName":"Frosztega","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c3ade47e-2fcb-457e-a36c-64bee9e4c86c"},{"objectId":"636dc1b87523405a7dd040fd","name":"Gabriella","lastName":"Lachowicz","uuid":"637F0E52EB2EE94BF1D533B7A5009ADBBDA2ED2F48A127F3D18206F7A540D46848BC96E348566DD09622C3DA2CFBDF088E1DD6F4471A5B6DEDCD659ECCF9C44F","orcidId":"0009-0008-3094-7680","documentHash":"d7c31c40-f278-42ac-a271-4a12ff093bf4"},{"objectId":"5e70930d878c28a0473a1f18","name":"Helena","lastName":"Martynowicz","uuid":"4E05962BA4513F438D25F4C100113C716C9B79792E33B8A72EE8445868166C063EC9258EFF44D5689E91CFD57F798439E01DCE55B1860946C1DF48C85DF710A2","orcidId":"0000-0003-1283-8460","documentHash":"06ae6407-b4b0-40a3-8a63-3ab9b0fa1e28"},{"objectId":"5e70930d878c28a0473a1eee","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Poręba","uuid":"FBC0CF8DA48A626576FB4D809D93B3C1E9248B5AB24EF083B41459AD2904FFB64C3CB1937F9511356EF75FB721FCC4473E355D644AFB0EAD5DE1C8F51293A416","orcidId":"0000-0002-7217-7070","documentHash":"04697c74-eed8-42f7-95e1-badd682f02f6"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1342","name":"Mieszko","lastName":"Więckiewicz","uuid":"FA7EB40C92CDD16785E548D822F7EAB28489FCD3156C09A32DC9552FCD608535F0375C279E4DAFFB71391F2DD24377F500607118E88498C41E15A0411B1BCA5C","orcidId":"0000-0003-4953-7143","documentHash":"b6e1e483-3996-459d-a8d7-45739fc39fed"},{"objectId":"5e7091ff878c28a04738e508","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Mazur","uuid":"CD71868FC2D388FEA87DCFCFCA0D64D78F08A5C9B1CE4F6EEC31FE1E616B99C9AB5C7869D136364AE6528645197395647BE88502530F9ACF38F458501918360A","orcidId":"0000-0001-6610-2008","documentHash":"7e30072c-efe4-4b6a-b5ac-d5fd1ebbd5a6"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e16212"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Porównawcza polityka społeczna","polityka rynku pracy","sociologia i polityka społeczna","socjologia pracy"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Comparative Social Policy","Labour Policy","Sociology and Social Policy","Sociology of Work"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65cca91a409707626366bde7","doi":"10.4337/9781800370111","title":"School-to-Work Transition In Comparative Perspective","year":2023,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-1-80037-011-1","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://www.elgaronline.com/edcollbook-oa/book/9781800370111/9781800370111.xml","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"abf7d0c1-05cc-415d-b006-9d4dd969dca5","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb753","mniswId":"900","name":"Edward Elgar Publishing","documentHash":"ff250e7f-b6e8-4754-8bd4-828d039de851"},"openAccess":{"mode":"PUBLISHER_WEBSITE","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2023-12-01","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null}},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Do the interactions with employment services and other institutions facilitate school-to-work transitions?

Here we present the analysis of teraelectronvolt diffuse emission from a region of the Galactic plane over the range in longitude of l ∈ [43°, 73°], using data collected with the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) detector. Spectral, longitudinal, and latitudinal distributions of the teraelectronvolt diffuse emission are shown. The radiation spectrum is compatible with the spectrum of the emission arising from a CR population with an index similar to that of the observed CRs. When comparing with the DRAGONbase model, the HAWC GDE flux is higher by about a factor of 2. Unresolved sources such as pulsar wind nebulae and teraelectronvolt halos could explain the excess emission. Finally, deviations of the Galactic CR flux from the locally measured CR flux may additionally explain the difference between the predicted and measured diffuse fluxes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421838","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"961","pagesFromTo":"104","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad00b6","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6601386a40970762631a7d1b","name":"S.","lastName":"Ventura","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1648ea40-15c3-4f25-aecc-353e286227c4"},{"objectId":"6601386a40970762631a7d1a","name":"A.","lastName":"Marinelli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4ef848c0-7412-4cf2-9bcd-25764da6063b"},{"objectId":"6601386a40970762631a7d19","name":"D.","lastName":"Grasso","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c010b2ec-e068-4188-b928-53b0be9324f2"},{"objectId":"6601386a40970762631a7d18","name":"D.","lastName":"Gaggero","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6699e35e-2943-4b54-b27f-334143db9578"},{"objectId":"6601386a40970762631a7d17","name":"O.","lastName":"Fornieri","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"be9f71e9-09be-4f28-8116-bc0a3de4a48d"},{"objectId":"6601386a40970762631a7d16","name":"C.","lastName":"de León","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2fee440d-b94b-441c-9db3-5aa6d5337dd8"},{"objectId":"6601386a40970762631a7d15","name":"H.","lastName":"Zhou","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d66990b2-c980-4541-ab82-053a667c9af8"},{"objectId":"6601386a40970762631a7d14","name":"E.","lastName":"Willox","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9fdefa8e-1d47-4bf4-895f-939a42be6e65"},{"objectId":"6601386a40970762631a7d13","name":"L.","lastName":"Villaseñor","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7d87e469-1e25-4a8c-8f5f-3299e16906a8"},{"objectId":"6601386a40970762631a7d12","name":"F.","lastName":"Ureña-Mena","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4ecec177-1b88-472b-96eb-14b6806e4a1b"},{"objectId":"6601386a40970762631a7d11","name":"R.","lastName":"Torres-Escobedo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2185dde9-931c-4659-a904-0184d96d38bf"},{"objectId":"6601386a40970762631a7d10","name":"I.","lastName":"Torres","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"72d35e94-12b6-42ba-8878-0d6e35345f18"},{"objectId":"6601386a40970762631a7d0f","name":"K.","lastName":"Tollefson","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"581e2d90-828c-4576-8168-83a87e6fa0a0"},{"objectId":"6601386a40970762631a7d0e","name":"O.","lastName":"Tibolla","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cf6924ed-1722-435b-8942-2b55f83d3fc8"},{"objectId":"6601386a40970762631a7d0d","name":"R.

The nanostructuring technique allows to fabricate fibers with arbitrarily designed (free-form) refractive index distribution based on two glasses. Three optimization schemes have been proposed. The nanostructuring method allows for designing fibers with optical properties similar and even better parameters impossible to produce by other methods. In this proposal, we examined four linearly polarized (LP) few-mode fibers. We report a high effective refractive index difference between modes while maintaining other important parameters for the weakly coupled approach."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421846","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65cb71dd4097072cdd795952","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"23","number":"30","doi":null,"documentHash":"19a4848e-e858-4028-ab2b-e65680b9d3d1"},"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"65cb46c44097072cdd7597f0","mniswId":null,"startDate":"2023-05-07","endDate":"2023-05-12","fullName":"2023 Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics","shortName":"CLEO 2023","city":"San Jose","country":"US","website":null,"isEdition":true,"documentHash":"2ac1bd0c-b5ef-4826-a0e2-2356bbe7c094"},"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"pp. 41832-41846","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://opg.optica.org/directpdfaccess/95907d99-76b4-4ec2-9d441e9663f4e9c8_512852/oe-30-23-41832.pdf?da=1&id=512852&seq=0&mobile=no","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7a75","name":"RYSZARD","lastName":"BUCZYŃSKI","uuid":"F8F41CD81B39BAFE3CF460561A721BF42EB82698CADC939AC8670928888562CDBAF97BF810B145A6C241E6BB2829A6AA2218CB8C522029419A448B63959A6C1D","orcidId":"0000-0003-2863-725X","documentHash":"8bdeef02-722c-4047-854a-3edc8bad0f79"},{"objectId":"5e709358878c28a0473a7a33","name":"RAFAŁ","lastName":"KASZTELANIC","uuid":"CB17576FE4E0EFC4D52B7FDDC6C79EC98566F7C78C421D859FED81C9EB4A88F0B6D0D463309B37250ACFBBEEED5F571E194F50BEF472B5C9DEE51B9AC25E2A83","orcidId":"0000-0002-6901-4641","documentHash":"4e5943fa-c96e-488f-8792-7506a3879e70"},{"objectId":"5e7092a8878c28a04739a067","name":"Damian","lastName":"Michalik","uuid":"709B0B9A009C075C98DCD74AE06DC64B005C2BC6DC41A662F9D9FEBD0003D3D065366FA96DA4AC584EB73705BE7750D35D6A5A295CE6A7719295FA6BEDEC543F","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"59daf1b9-e41a-4286-aeab-e5a2ceff02fe"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["standaryzacja","adaptacja","marketing międzynarodowy","branża fast food","percepcja konsumentów"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["standardization","adaptation","international marketing","fast food industry","consumers' perception"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Standardization and adaptation of international marketing activities in countries of high national identity – the case of McDonald's in Vietnam","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa83c9aff2974850cd2f","mniswId":"497940","title":"Miesięcznik Marketing i Rynek","doi":null,"issn":"1231-7853","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"4047a271-f843-442c-8fce-2825e46f9784"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65cf12c54097076263722749","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709252878c28a047393a24","65cf12c5409707626372274a"]},"issue":"10","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Celem artykułu jest identyfikacja postrzegania przez konsumentów działań w zakresie standaryzacji i adaptacji\r\nmarketingu, realizowanych przez międzynarodowe firmy\r\nna rynku o silnej tożsamości narodowej.

A 22-year-old man was brought to the Emergency Room from a party, where he had ingested orally 20 g of mephedrone. The man exhibited a disorder of consciousness with no logical verbal contact and dilated pupils. Moreover, a metabolic acidosis was present. The patient died after an hour from an admission to the ER. Blood and vitreous humor collected during an autopsy were analyzed with the use of an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS) with the use of C18 column in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Both biological specimens were prepared using liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) with the use of ethyl acetate and 0.5 M ammonium carbonate water solution (pH 9). The limit of quantification (LOQ) of the method was 0.5 ng/ml in both matrices; precision and accuracy values did not exceed ±15%. Recovery of the method was in the range of 86.1%–102.7%. Determined concentrations of 4-CMC were 8542 and 9874 ng/ml in blood and vitreous humor, respectively. Other substances present in both biological materials were: atropine, diazepam, lidocaine, and its metabolite norlidocaine, as well as methcathinone and ethyl alcohol. The concentration presented in here described case is the highest ever reported 4-CMC concentration. Important aspect is also receiving other NPS by recreational users than intended, which lead to accidental poisoning (in presented case user assumed 4-CMC was 4-MMC)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421851","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"68","pagesFromTo":"349-354","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1556-4029.15162","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e7844097076263e89ccc","name":"Olga","lastName":"Wachełko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"06e7aee2-bb7a-4482-932b-fe779ae18ccb"},{"objectId":"634a1b297523402e341271bc","name":"Kaja","lastName":"Tusiewicz","uuid":"DA5236240327493FCAA10E0D523BA5ECBE6FB397FD2130EA0F803A3E08BD216F20898028919A5529B9B81DD6E3A45018BEC3FF66717AE3497BF0FBEE62E4373F","orcidId":"0000-0002-9968-2042","documentHash":"d2c02224-5568-498d-b6aa-9cc0adf81399"},{"objectId":"5e709464878c28a0473bc150","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Chłopaś-Konowałek","uuid":"133CFF0110A79095F35CFC6E7BE5BC434E6B3F4C7BC982AE7986FC4119C026324EDEE61A43A688976D38C96CAADF823550481E58C0B1C6A7E97B674EDF0D7C79","orcidId":"0000-0003-2814-8114","documentHash":"d30916b8-5810-4a6a-9c6c-3b0a4bfef900"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a660d","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Szpot","uuid":"C0DD6021DF77CCF3DC6E35941E7AD532C9CF9E10BB0744B0F1B2DAEC2062CDAA348B9D49D148FD5480E1E057906E027FDEBC40888CD430841AE2816B0788C200","orcidId":"0000-0002-5352-3492","documentHash":"8f789c6c-3d19-4c38-ba3c-7176f398d2da"},{"objectId":"5e70930d878c28a0473a1f0f","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"ZAWADZKI","uuid":"A503182E6481542437338034E0BE421E7C439271BBECF2167AFD04AE6AF8BAE0541FE861CD6BF2F981D76476181370A82533D1268C24EF669F25122174AE3ABA","orcidId":"0000-0003-2146-9724","documentHash":"4310342d-a7a3-4928-81e6-34a1ca07b42a"}],"doi":"10.1111/1556-4029.15162"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["prawo podatkowe","Ordynacja podatkowa","PIT","podatek dochodowy od osób fizycznych","MDR – Mandatory Disclosure Rules"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["tax law","Tax Code","PIT","personal income tax","MDR – Mandatory Disclosure Rules"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922e878c28a04739150c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"MDR przedmiotem interpretacji indywidualnych : glosa aprobująca do wyroku Naczelnego Sądu Administracyjnego z 16 lutego 2022 r.

Obie te procedury mają charakter pozasądowy, a ich głównym celem była ochrona dłużnika i pomoc w restrukturyzacji.

The validity of current methods has not been tested to a great extent. Our aim was to determine how precise are stature estimations obtained from three different approaches, namely by using (i) Rösing's method (Rösing 1977), (ii) a 10% shrinkage correction factor (Strzałko et al. 1972) and (iii) chemosteometry (Gonçalves et al. 2020). For this purpose, pre- and post-burned head measurements from the humerus, radius and femur were used. The sample comprised 46 human skeletons of known sex and age-at-death. These were experimentally burnt to maximum temperatures ranging from 700 to 1100°C (attained after 90–188 min) for other research purposes. Stature estimations were performed through measurements in both pre-burned and burned bones using the three approaches and based on the method of Olivier and Tissier (1975). Mean absolute differences and the relative technical errors of measurements (TEM%) between the pre-burned and the estimations were calculated. Absolute mean differences indicated that the chemosteometric approach allowed for potentially more precise stature estimations than the other two procedures. However, the TEM% was very low for all approaches (smaller or close to 1%), and stature estimations were thus well within the error margin reported by Olivier and Tissier (1975). Results suggest that the chemosteometric approach enables more accurate predictions of the actual heat-induced shrinkage of each bone thus rendering more precise stature estimations. Nonetheless, the other procedures also provided quite reliable estimations although they require confirmation that the bone is calcined."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421862","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65d5a8c74097076bd548e59d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"68","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"5c5b6719-ada0-47ba-bacf-26fa6c76044a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"68","pagesFromTo":"252-256","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1556-4029.15175","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65d5a8c74097076bd548e5a1","name":"David","lastName":"Gonçalves","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4eb79467-4e94-4b2e-ac8b-b182643a8eb0"},{"objectId":"65d5a8c74097076bd548e5a0","name":"Luís","lastName":"Esteves Batista de Carvalho","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"216e078f-1e0f-4581-b3ea-a54da6de120c"},{"objectId":"65d5a8c74097076bd548e59f","name":"Maria Paula M.","lastName":"Marques","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"30747408-4e90-45d3-bd41-2bf3242acf35"},{"objectId":"65d5a8c74097076bd548e59e","name":"Ana Rita","lastName":"Vassalo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b1950fdb-7574-4fc0-912c-1cad0cbbb4c1"},{"objectId":"6160fea975234017e050deb7","name":"Bogumiła","lastName":"Wolska","uuid":"45013DFD632851312BC614A2858E4D806B701FF1A6884F48CDA26C3AF8149175CA132557321AED4F65CCCA5E24E94B6BE8A068DA542BADB283345B96FD62D7A4","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4897a44b-8f28-4df6-a7c4-78107312fd16"}],"doi":"10.1111/1556-4029.15175"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["atrial fibrillation","cardiac output","cardiac resynchronization therapy","His bundle pacing"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

At present, however, little is known about the optimal method of programming of the His bundle-paced CRT systems in terms of achieving the best cardiac output.\r\n\r\nAim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of cardiac resynchronization therapy with conduction system pacing (CRT+CSP) on echo-based hemodynamic parameters in the early post-operative measurements.\r\n\r\nMethods: The study enrollment criteria included: permanent atrial fibrillation, heart failure and bundle branch block. All patients underwent implantation of CRT + HBP. During the post-operative phase, we aimed to optimize HOT-CRT settings in order to achieve the greatest cardiac output assessed by complex echocardiographic measurements.\r\n\r\nResults: The study included 21 patients, mean age 71.2 (6.3) years, predominantly men (71.4%) with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy 62%. All patients had heart failure with NYHA functional class III and IV (81%). Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 27.5 (9.7%). The mean duration of the QRS complex was 148.8 ms. The effects of resynchronization pacing: HBP alone, HBP with left ventricular pacing, HBP with biventricular pacing (BiV) and BiV without HBP were analyzed consecutively. HBP combined with left ventricular pacing demonstrated the best hemodynamic response.\r\n\r\nConclusion: His bundle pacing coupled with LV pacing proved to be the most advantageous pacing program setting with regard to cardiac output. Moreover, it performed better than biventricular pacing and significantly better than RV pacing."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421864","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"40","pagesFromTo":"1068-1078","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/echo.15679","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e9774097076263e89fbe","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Małecka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e7b45162-fc06-4752-9ded-d7256302685d"},{"objectId":"6630e9774097076263e89fbd","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Lelakowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ec881fb2-0f38-49ce-ad58-314830dd242a"},{"objectId":"6630e9774097076263e89fbc","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Gackowski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"44edac23-031b-4f3a-9594-8c7cd01faf9c"},{"objectId":"6630e9774097076263e89fbb","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Holcman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"44c235e3-b711-4b4b-b05d-67630b0b90a5"},{"objectId":"6630e9774097076263e89fba","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Dębski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e8caeb0b-007c-4fff-b53d-7f14e1014a9b"},{"objectId":"6630e9774097076263e89fb9","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Golińska‐Grzybała","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0e498910-40b0-49a8-95af-544e21d23b32"},{"objectId":"6630e9774097076263e89fb8","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Ząbek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8d0e04d0-6435-4f30-ac61-b4c7f3b6aaa0"},{"objectId":"6630e9774097076263e89fb7","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Boczar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b1f176ca-aa53-4c1b-9d3d-3dc05026896a"},{"objectId":"5e7094f3878c28a0473c7ceb","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Sławuta","uuid":"7B3CCB220BF7BC9DE27FBC50D14F49CE2525805E85312E7CEFFBA805BAF8C6D413D74FFB636A69FAE484A745F530F8E2145A741E29E4FCE83AB0E88AB5A8FC48","orcidId":"0000-0001-5671-9864","documentHash":"6043e512-407a-413a-8218-5966b6fc03bd"},{"objectId":"5e70930d878c28a0473a1f0e","name":"JACEK","lastName":"GAJEK","uuid":"C2521E002FA7B384D023EFE884CF82CFA790FFACA85EB4CE0FF4F8AC54D48D93ADA93F710845D347F5270CC3133A8B2C1143F301EE8CFF2BB758BE91B172A0FB","orcidId":"0000-0002-0038-1750","documentHash":"3a1e1d9f-580b-41af-825f-aec2ed6967cc"}],"doi":"10.1111/echo.15679"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["heart failure","signs","symptoms","psychometrics","reliability","validity"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed to test the factor structures. To assess criterion-related validity, HFSPS factor scores were correlated with Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) scores using the Spearman correlation method. The reliability of the internal consistency of the HFSPS was determined by calculating the Cronbach's alpha coefficient and the factor score determination coefficient.\r\nResults: Data from 173 patients with a mean age of 80.7 years (SD 9.1), women (51.1%), were analyzed. The majority (74.7%) were NYHA class II/III. The confirmatory factor analysis of four factors after eliminating one item showed fit indices close to the recommended indices: χ2 = 169.237, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.920, TLI = 0.901, RMSEA = 0.057 and SRMR = 0.061. Regarding the validity related to the criterion, all the scores of the HFSPS dimensions were correlated with all the scores of the KCCQ dimensions and were statistically significant. The reliability of the HFSPS factors of the coefficient of determination obtained scores of 0.73 for the dyspnea factor and early and subtle and lower for edema and chest discomfort with fewer items. Cronbach's alpha was acceptable for three of the scales >0.71 and poor 0.52 for chest discomfort with two items. The internal consistency index based on the model was 0.850.\r\nConclusion: The Spanish version of the HFSPS is a valid and reliable instrument that that would be feasible to use in clinical and research setting to evaluate in the perception of symptoms in patients with heart failure."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421870","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"art.1242057 [9 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2023.1242057/full","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e9704097076263e89f07","name":"Vicente","lastName":"Gea-Caballero","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"85b34dfb-972e-4e82-b5ec-a01263b1353e"},{"objectId":"6630e9704097076263e89f06","name":"Ivan","lastName":"Santolalla-Arnedo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c2cfb23c-1aa6-433b-9a3e-7897ed7ef925"},{"objectId":"6630e9704097076263e89f05","name":"Clara Isabel","lastName":"Tejada-Garrido","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0b8ebdcd-c142-4088-a279-92cf1f45c407"},{"objectId":"6630e9704097076263e89f04","name":"Ana","lastName":"Cobos-Rincón","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a2ec0a10-e19e-4864-8655-98cf5d7b3ec4"},{"objectId":"6630e9704097076263e89f03","name":"Noelia","lastName":"Navas-Echazarreta","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c9f7b493-1399-4de4-a94c-1ef8e4ba678b"},{"objectId":"6630e9704097076263e89f02","name":"Carlos","lastName":"Saus-Ortega","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b6db23eb-b5d7-4bb1-965b-a9f022edfebb"},{"objectId":"6630e9704097076263e89f01","name":"José Vicente","lastName":"Benavent-Cervera","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ccd512b7-3dba-4b2e-b0e5-56734c5a7088"},{"objectId":"6630e9704097076263e89f00","name":"Marco","lastName":"Di Nitto","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b755be4c-e14a-4a60-9880-bd459560e48b"},{"objectId":"6630e9704097076263e89eff","name":"Angela","lastName":"Durante","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"614f90e0-859b-4cd3-ac3e-db509b8c8f68"},{"objectId":"6630e9704097076263e89efe","name":"Raúl","lastName":"Juárez-Vela","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f39786be-29af-4ef1-b1d1-9abd13a5acfa"},{"objectId":"6630e9704097076263e89efd","name":"Rosa","lastName":"Antonio-Oriola","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"06fe8f26-a334-459d-8fe1-ae451ca013bb"},{"objectId":"5e7094c7878c28a0473c383d","name":"Michał","lastName":"Czapla","uuid":"F241A3A93C9297B0CC7621A3FB52E7F10530B0515BFD46FE96AD938D40C1748DCED47E8AE10D5CF004F6434A5B908E4A45CFB50223EFFE0F306589A45A1A64F8","orcidId":"0000-0002-4245-5420","documentHash":"73c1748c-d090-491c-9f8a-2c21149fb49e"}],"doi":"10.3389/fcvm.2023.1242057"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","uid":"bX41kHc85ivocrWE0ISfROw","uuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","parentUuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de34","rootUuid":"dbdda9a7-f6f7-44e8-af1d-9863e2256ca3","name":"Politechnika Wrocławska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70930d878c28a0473a1ee4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Selective demyelination of a sciatic nerve allograft after SARS-CoV-2 infection -

Religious orders in the PPR held considerable organizational and personal potential, which meant that they were of interest to both the Episcopate of Poland and the state authorities, and their activities were formed under the distinct influence of the relationship between the state and the Roman Catholic Church. Two periods can be distinguished on the basis of executing different policies of the communist authorities with regard to monastic orders and congregations in Poland: from 1945 to the early 1960s and from the 1960s to the end of 1989.</p>\r\n<p>During the first period (the so-called Stalinist era) monastic orders, much like the Roman Catholic Church, were treated as an enemy of the state. During this period, in the case of the Congregation of Salvatorian Fathers in Bagno, state repression and, at the same time, limitations on their freedom to manifest religious beliefs were enforced through administrative, legal and police measures.</p>\r\n<p>In the second period, the Communist authorities altered their tactics in their dealings with monastic orders. At that time, steps were taken to weaken the episcopate’s influence over monastic orders by attempting to use their autonomy to break up the unity of the Church in Poland.</p>\r\n<p>Up until 1964, the Salvatorian Fathers’ Higher Seminary in Bagno was frequently inspected and required to produce suitable documentation for the authorities. After that, the government made larger-scale attempts to infiltrate the monastery by building a network of secret collaborators. They took advantage of the order’s international missionary activities in particular, forcing or encouraging monks to cooperate with the State in exchange for passports and gaining permission to leave.</p>\r\n<p>In view of this, the policy towards the Salvatorian Fathers’ congregation in Bagno depended on the institution’s loyalty to the State, which also directly translated into its members’ greater freedom to express their religious beliefs, which in the case of this congregation meant, among other things, that they were allowed to educate clerics at the Lower and Higher Seminary and conduct their missionary activities in the spirit of Roman Catholic faith.</p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421873","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"45","pagesFromTo":"177-195","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.19195/2300-7249.45.1.9","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094df878c28a0473c5b6f","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Włodarczyk-Czech","uuid":"0886D2F0963F611D668B523F32B9354583624F430EAB89DEA7733261F5DFA7AA76AC8EAC5BD6B2A9661A12D5F398029D31BBF8231FE64B80E050952A8487158D","orcidId":"0000-0003-2268-1268","documentHash":"d7ea276f-5422-4fae-8763-4b9b49f56dfe"}],"doi":"10.19195/2300-7249.45.1.9"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["61a98f3975234066bac870b1"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Application of machine learning-based surrogate models for urban flood depth modeling in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477150","mniswId":"1519","title":"APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING","doi":null,"issn":"1568-4946","eissn":"1872-9681","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d6682289-a2a9-4f76-b79c-2480e8a12e1d"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65ccb9e64097073ccbc8f5ee","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65ccb9e64097073ccbc8f5f0","65ccb9e64097073ccbc8f5f1","65ccb9e64097073ccbc8f5f2","65ccb9e64097073ccbc8f5f3","65ccb9e64097073ccbc8f5f4","61a98f3975234066bac870b1","65ccb9e64097073ccbc8f5f5","65ccb9e64097073ccbc8f5f6","65ccb9e64097073ccbc8f5f7","65ccb9e64097073ccbc8f5f8"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Rapid flood prediction in coastal urban areas is an important but challenging task. However, multi-driver floods in coastal areas and their non-linearity in physical processes are hard to represent in physics-based numerical models (PBNMs). In this study, we investigated the performance of surrogate machine learning (ML) models and their flood prediction capability. Initially, we utilize the MIKE+ coupled 1D–2D model to simulate coastal urban flooding in one of the severely flood-affected areas of Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam. Then, nine ML models, including AdaBoost (AB), Decision Tree (DT), Gaussian Process (GP), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Naive Bayes (NB), Neural Network (NN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are employed to surrogate the PBNM flood prediction performance and engaged to predict flood depths of the study area domain. 806 simulation scenarios of MIKE+ modeling having a spatial grid of 1107 ×1513, grid size = 2 m, extracting 270,000 inundation points to generate input data for nine ML models are used to simulate surface flood depths for the study area. Results show three ML models, GP, RF, and NN, outperform the remaining models, with R2 value of 0.997, 0.996, and 0.995, respectively. Thus, applying ML models can significantly reduce the simulation time by a PBNM, improve accuracy, and potentially be adopted for real-time forecasting and emergency management."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421875","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"150","pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494623010499","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65ccb9e64097073ccbc8f5f8","name":"Duong Tran","lastName":"Anh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b4974b06-f2e0-4bca-9834-b42cd8ec9697"},{"objectId":"65ccb9e64097073ccbc8f5f7","name":"Phong Nguyen","lastName":"Thanh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"30e7b42c-be0b-414b-ba44-4b464f9de73d"},{"objectId":"65ccb9e64097073ccbc8f5f6","name":"Son T.","lastName":"Mai","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"03830735-395f-4e53-8f69-a5019a230ee0"},{"objectId":"65ccb9e64097073ccbc8f5f5","name":"Van Hieu","lastName":"Bui","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c231ea6c-6353-47f5-a5ee-006c45d072c8"},{"objectId":"65ccb9e64097073ccbc8f5f4","name":"Ahad Hasan","lastName":"Tanim","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"72e84e9a-fda4-4cda-8b47-d57696918d53"},{"objectId":"65ccb9e64097073ccbc8f5f3","name":"Thanh Duc","lastName":"Dang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9203eaf4-12f4-48a7-92c1-9a1400912ab7"},{"objectId":"65ccb9e64097073ccbc8f5f2","name":"Quyen Ngoc","lastName":"Le","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c2eaee8d-dae5-4e3a-9395-9b14c58590a4"},{"objectId":"65ccb9e64097073ccbc8f5f1","name":"Ba Hoang","lastName":"Tran","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"573f70a9-34c2-4276-997d-634de2fd3b49"},{"objectId":"65ccb9e64097073ccbc8f5f0","name":"Thanh Quang","lastName":"Dang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3902249f-a51b-4bf7-8867-b25082d6a936"},{"objectId":"61a98f3975234066bac870b1","name":"Quoc Bao","lastName":"Pham","uuid":"476B7E8AC954DD65FF6021768A3C94CD2258DA21839B7D612D154E044FD45CB9BBA88702BA83F311DF00CDE87B34F918026478116394F32F0295046A52020FDA","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bb4c2731-86e1-4a1f-98c0-097d9c3b8634"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.asoc.2023.111031"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["obturator nerve","AQUA","case-study","humans","cadaver"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

We evaluated whether ECG parameters are associated with the distribution and dynamic of LGE along the course of myocarditis.\r\n\r\nMethods: Fifty-one patients with CMR confirmed acute myocarditis were included who underwent CMR with LGE and 12-lead ECG at baseline and 3-month follow-up at our institution. The association between the presence, regional distribution and change of ECG parameters and LGE was investigated using linear regression analysis. LGE was quantified as visual presence score (VPS) and visual transmurality score (VTS).\r\n\r\nResults: Among many ECG parameters only > 1 mm ST-elevation (STE) was associated with VPS and VTS at baseline (β = 3.08 [95%CI: 1.75; 4.41], p = < 0.001 and β = 5.40 [95%CI: 1.92; 8.88], p = 0.004; respectively). STE was most frequent in lateral and inferior ECG-leads (48% and 31%) and it was associated with VPS and VTS in these localizations (p < 0.05 all), however no association between anterior-septal STE and LGE could be confirmed. At follow-up the regression of STE was associated with the regression of VPS and VTS in univariate analysis (β=-1.49 [95%CI: -2.41; -0.57], p = 0.003 and β=-4.87 [95%CI: -7.18; -2.56], p = 0.001, respectively), which remained significant for VTS using a multivariate model (β=-2.39 [95%CI: -3.32; -0.47], p = 0.019).\r\n\r\nConclusion: Although we demonstrated some promising associations between STE and LGE, the usability of ECG to estimate the territorial involvement and dynamical changes of LGE along the course of myocarditis is generally limited and cardiac magnetic resonance should be considered for this purpose.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421882","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"39","pagesFromTo":"1169-1178","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10554-023-02811-3","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e72e4097076263e8945d","name":"Robert","lastName":"Manka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6db7b1bf-83a9-41ee-96a1-f9e1d7f4892d"},{"objectId":"6630e72e4097076263e8945c","name":"Hatem","lastName":"Alkadhi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f03906fe-df85-4b7d-99b7-3346e416c5e1"},{"objectId":"6630e72e4097076263e8945b","name":"Alexander","lastName":"Gotschy","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"073d719f-2ae1-43f0-9c89-0e0162eed452"},{"objectId":"6630e72e4097076263e8945a","name":"Malgorzata","lastName":"Polacin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0639a212-0452-4ce3-9fc1-d1d399a4b36b"},{"objectId":"6630e72e4097076263e89459","name":"Ioannis","lastName":"Matziris","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b43320a7-568c-49dc-b0aa-485240240978"},{"objectId":"6630e72e4097076263e89458","name":"Lucas","lastName":"Weber","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"74a24bf9-91f6-4e9b-b2c3-412a656618fd"},{"objectId":"6630e72e4097076263e89457","name":"Márton","lastName":"Kolossváry","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"063a6cc4-dc99-444e-92fc-791085c4683f"},{"objectId":"6630e72e4097076263e89456","name":"Mihály","lastName":"Károlyi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"73caf6ce-0e50-4b70-8354-c138cd1399f1"},{"objectId":"5e709368878c28a0473a8ef4","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Sokolska","uuid":"5EE74BAAAD63F8C034EAD48D6B260412F5F470764FED16CDC7173E5BE2CF7C5CC3F05756077295FF0E3F8C4455EBA869A6783C3A2CE49C80EE06BE09AEF9E60C","orcidId":"0000-0002-4759-5879","documentHash":"8eac9b8f-def7-4803-8a08-06e461cf070d"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10554-023-02811-3"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["teleoperation; simulators; sensors"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b4878c28a047385b32","uid":"bS6M08TFKPbY503_RCN7QVg","uuid":"09856ec8-9220-4fe5-b068-d49e53a4db41","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Instytut Robotów i Konstrukcji Maszyn","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094dc878c28a0473c5820"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A Concept of a Plug-In Simulator for Increasing the Effectiveness of Rescue Operators When Using Hydrostatically Driven Manipulators","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796fd","mniswId":"18383","title":"SENSORS","doi":null,"issn":"1424-8220","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"c8a0faed-8ad8-4c36-9597-a6dc2ad66c22"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2024-02-07","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65cf32e34097075ea84222e3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094dc878c28a0473c5820"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The introduction of Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) into the field of rescue operations is an ongoing process. New tools, such as UGV platforms and dedicated manipulators, provide new opportunities but also come with a steep learning curve. The best way to familiarize operators with new solutions are hands-on courses but their deployment is limited, mostly due to high costs and limited equipment numbers. An alternative way is to use simulators, which from the software side, resemble video games. With the recent expansion of the video game engine industry, currently developed software becomes easier to produce and maintain. This paper tries to answer the question of whether it is possible to develop a highly accurate simulator of a rescue and IED manipulator using a commercially available game engine solution. Firstly, the paper describes different types of simulators for robots currently available. Next, it provides an in-depth description of a plug-in simulator concept. Afterward, an example of a hydrostatic manipulator arm and its virtual representation is described alongside validation and evaluation methodologies. Additionally, the paper provides a set of metrics for an example rescue scenario.

The goal is to determine the effects of structured recreational team sports interventions (TSG) on metabolic health, body composition and physical fitness parameters when compared to passive or active control groups. This study adhered to the PRISMA guidelines for reporting a systematic review. A thorough examination of relevant literature was conducted on November 06, 2023, using three prominent databases: PubMed, Scopus, and the Web of Science. Inclusion criteria considered overweight (e.g., BMI 25.0–29.9 kg/m2 ) and obese (e.g., BMI > 30 kg/m2 ) populations exposed to training interventions using recreational team sports, while the comparator group consisted of the same populations not exposed to exercise (passive controls) or exposed to alternative training methods. The primary outcomes of interest were metabolic health parameters (glucose, waist circumference, blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides), body composition (e.g., fat mass, lean mass), as well as physical fitness parameters (e.g., aerobic fitness, muscular fitness). Only studies with two- or multi-arm designs, whether randomized or not, were eligible  for inclusion. The PEDro scale was used to assess the methodological bias of the included studies. Out of the initial 275 titles retrieved, we deemed ten eligible for our study. In terms of body composition, TSG demonstrateda significant decrease in body mass index across three studies (−2.3 to −5.1%) and a significant reduction in waist circumference in four studies (−4.6% to −8.4%). Regarding blood pressure, TSG exhibited a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure in two studies (−3.9% to -8.3%), while diastolic blood pressure showed a significant decrease in only one study (−7.3%). Cholesterol levels saw a significant decrease in TSG in three studies (−7.0% to −9.7%), and triglyceride levels showed a significant reduction in four studies (−16.4% to−20.1%). In terms of aerobic fitness, TSG demonstrated within-group improvements in the field-based tests in three studies (8.1% to 79.0%), and within-group improvements in maximal oxygen uptake in four studies (6.5% to 31.0%), with significant favoring of TSG in most studies. Overall, TSG demonstrated significant benefits for overweight and obese populations compared to the control group, particularly in terms of improvements in body mass index, systolic blood pressures, cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and aerobic fitness. Future research ought to concentrate on tailoring responses to varying training volumes on an individualized basis"}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421889","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"41","pagesFromTo":"243-266","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.termedia.pl/Effects-of-recreational-team-sports-on-the-metabolic-health-body-r-ncomposition-and-physical-fitness-parameters-of-overweight-and-r-nobese-populations-A-systematic-review,78,52319,1,1.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65ce198d4097074ca0bea4ed","name":"Jun","lastName":"Dou","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"932b5ecd-f01b-4713-9d46-14b9444e12b1"},{"objectId":"65ce198d4097074ca0bea4ec","name":"Qi","lastName":"Xu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5120c0da-ce8b-437a-be92-c444d1d15e61"},{"objectId":"65ce198d4097074ca0bea4eb","name":"Tao","lastName":"Wang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8376d1e4-c991-4b29-8994-728e8e98ed06"},{"objectId":"65af32ba40e3ff6b129fa20b","name":"Filipe","lastName":"Batista Clemente","uuid":"856B05A23E2ADB59468DF33FE6FE1E022CD0BF8F631FB752209FA870B45CB94FC0754809C07C74A89D18A5F838B1F82ECA562F86586F1052CCF20EF750503D37","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f2917418-6f97-4b48-b889-e98a78531615"},{"objectId":"6427972940e3ff13873ba589","name":"Liu","lastName":"Yang","uuid":"4B123117FA320F0DFFC5984BE09715C0625215978F456E7CD4F947715D6606E52387E893A30BB038AE12D53F4B8194B14CBE43B89F4F62E702514D233272383E","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"76f92b54-de33-4dd2-9025-6324adb895fd"}],"doi":"10.5114/biolsport.2024.134762"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet Warmińsko-Mazurski w Olsztynie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709217878c28a04738fd25","5e709217878c28a04738fd21"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"An Analysis of the Relationships between Social Capital Levels and Selected Green Economy Indicators on the Example of Polish Voivodeships","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c28514547989e","mniswId":"19173","title":"Sustainability","doi":null,"issn":"2071-1050","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"76492123-acbe-4743-a4ae-6a63f3108e24"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"FEBRUARY","releaseDateYear":2024,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65cc991a4097073ccbc64e4f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709217878c28a04738fd25","5e709217878c28a04738fd21"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059421897","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65c9f27940970762634a1497","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"16","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"76bc2897-2232-4ee6-8ac5-f481a5909abe"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"1459","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/4/1459/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fd25","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Pawlewicz","uuid":"D49B8AB5FFA51DD4BCF02548BDBA84FA8CE9BA01A8B80CC3B9143DC09CA64145216D0182E6A4EE8A952F1DA72FC07E2A3F93B25EA20AD536CD8C7C1E7860544E","orcidId":"0000-0002-1804-9596","documentHash":"7abb5be1-a5fd-41f4-810c-ecfb4f158f73"},{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fd21","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Cieślak","uuid":"D182B5F8D18BB16CEF3307666F6F8CC3C6E5F8C8D9390DD91C0ECA9051FFF0BFD44552B7863C039A4D12464F71019BDA45E755FF287C8D9FA3B7C3CD619C5C6B","orcidId":"0000-0003-4219-5718","documentHash":"d1d829d7-711c-4342-93cf-e7e9f241ebb1"}],"doi":"10.3390/su16041459"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Pasożyt czy sojusznik?

The study material consisted of 24 patients with end-stage hip osteoarthritis scheduled for THA. The patients were examined one day before surgery and consecutively on the 4th day, 9th day, and 10th week postoperatively using the SBMs (weight-bearing chair-rising test, measurements of the maximal isometric torque of the quadriceps muscle); the PBMs (10-m walk, timed up-and-go, and stair-climbing tests); and the functional outcome measure (Harris Hip Score). The results obtained in a given category of tests at different time points were compared, and the correlations between the tests were determined. The reliability of the outcome measures was determined. The results of tests in the studied categories statistically significantly (p &lt; 0.05) improved at the 10th week postoperatively compared to preoperative results. No strong correlations were revealed between the three studied types of outcome measures in THA patients. Therefore, none of them can be considered redundant.

As I argue, its author, Bruce Scates, recognizes the different heritages of the Gallipoli peninsula by including a multiplicity of voices and perspectives in the 1915 layers of his novel. The whole tradition of Australian historiography, to\r\n which Scates himself has largely contributed, finds its echoes in the text. The article demonstrates how Scates undermines the myth of the glorious Gallipoli campaign and the heroism of the Anzacs, revisiting the mythologized site of conflict from a Turkish perspective. The Gallipoli peninsula\r\n is approached as an affective landscape, which deeply transforms the protagonists. However, the fabricated nature of this site of the conflict, and the construction of its special place in the national mythology, are also emphasized in the analysis. Synchronously, <I>On Dangerous Ground</I>\r\n problematizes the obligation of the nation towards those missing in action, and the cultural malaise accompanying

article offers an analysis of the representation of the Askari in Abdulrazak Gurnah’s 2020 novel Afterlives. I approach the war and colonialism as interconnected factors and argue that Gurnah contests the myth of the Askari as savage mercenaries devoted to their German officers. By retracing Gurnah’s portraits of African protagonists, the article shows the different motivations and choices of the Askari before, during and after the First World War. The figure of Ilyas throws into relief the pitfalls of colonial modernity, as well as the disturbing continuities of violence between the colony and the concentration camp. By contrast, Hamza’s intimate relationship with a German in the Schutztruppe serves to explore an alternative history of emotions between colonial soldiers and their officers. The article goes on to examine Gurnah’s representation of war trauma, the phantomatic presence/absence of the Askari in collective memory, and the conflicted ethics of postcolonial war commemoration."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421909","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"58","pagesFromTo":"468-481","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17449855.2022.2059210","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092bd878c28a04739bdcf","name":"Anna","lastName":"Branach-Kallas","uuid":"E11076D138304B38BB41EF05614657E5B8BD3E27B69D4CE38B47D8411394AD58D4CD2E284230AED9A98947438531430812A7BA80DF74030F6F418771B7F66730","orcidId":"0000-0001-5754-1906","documentHash":"a3c653c1-a2e9-40f3-a1e0-078fb711b896"}],"doi":"10.1080/17449855.2022.2059210"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["pracujących na własny rachunek","praca na własny rachunek","bezpieczne i higieniczne warunki pracy","BHP","warunki pracy"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6439343e4097076e1e3bc422","doi":"10.34616/145128","title":"Pro opere perfecto gratias agimus.

This study aimed to evaluate the nutritional behavior and knowledge of amateur ultrarunners. This study involved a group of 308 respondents (89 women and 219 men) aged 18 -65. It investigated the influence of the level of knowledge about nutrition, gender, education, and smoking on dietary food habits and eating frequency.\r\nMethods: The KomPAN questionnaire was used to determine the dietary habits, diet quality, lifestyle, and nutrition knowledge of ultramarathon runners. The nutrition knowledge influenced the eating habits and frequency of specific meals expressed as the Healthy Diet Index-10 (HDI-10) and Unhealthy Diet Index-14 (UDI-14).\r\nResults: In women with sufficient knowledge about nutrition, lower HDI-10 scores were observed compared to those with a good level of knowledge, while men did not show a similar relationship. However, the effect of smoking on the frequency of food intake in men was noted. Interestingly, male smokers had a lower UDI-14 score than non-smokers. Depending on the level of knowledge, female and male ultrarunners more often or less frequently used selected food products. In turn, no effect of education on the frequency of consumption of specific foods was observed.\r\nDiscussion: Such different results are most likely caused by the specificity of the study group, which consisted of amateur runners. Additionally, the study looked at general eating habits, not those employed when preparing for marathons. In the future, more respondents should be surveyed, also taking into account nutrition during training."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421923","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"art.1137412 [11 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnut.2023.1137412","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e7354097076263e8950a","name":"Marta","lastName":"Ligocka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f57640f3-75bd-476d-b3fd-9a4c8e096b34"},{"objectId":"5fc5592c085dcb1e6ae0bae1","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Król-Kulikowska","uuid":"302802F8B806C4C5D55E7135AD86693A0FAFF6CC83FE4F99537C6087DE590C40F217293B05FB52AEAB7BD3430A48E15D2601D39826A0A24190C5AC2B4290C910","orcidId":"0000-0003-2842-8255","documentHash":"bd6e41ae-544c-4140-a0f7-1149b51ebfb8"},{"objectId":"5e709305878c28a0473a1451","name":"Marta","lastName":"Kepinska","uuid":"ECD08E0CA5513168886467EF3B2A433D6D11E0942A67AC3270250874F2BC9978B7E674DDBE381BC91D2C1F101F3E0603BE6D3385278ED7EFB3E08229C449CEB1","orcidId":"0000-0002-0935-5663","documentHash":"0bdefeef-c176-4bc5-8182-b0508c362129"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a12eb","name":"Aureliusz","lastName":"Kosendiak","uuid":"F4276692E357AF65B6AB175E7BEF615C4BD13AE9528E2033CB112A79510D71088EC19BE5CF7808F2DE78A3C7C3C8AF85DAA9B38FBA6413FF1338FE15242AF9A8","orcidId":"0000-0003-2075-5438","documentHash":"e187b212-846d-4619-8e66-4df7f17f914c"}],"doi":"10.3389/fnut.2023.1137412"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Cannabis sativa L.","zastosowanie do celów medycznych","THC","CBD","uwarunkowania prawne"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cannabis sativa L.","medicinal use","THC","CBD","legal considerations"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Historycznie rzecz biorąc, leki na bazie konopi były stosowane w leczeniu wielu schorzeń. W XX wieku nastąpiła penalizacja ich stosowania na świecie. Współcześnie wiele krajów dekryminalizuje ich stosowanie. Złożoność tematyki, zmienność jakościowa składników aktywnych poszczególnych odmian tego gatunku determinuje nowe obszary wymagające badania i analizy. Na uwagę zasługują kwestie prawne, problematyka kontroli jakości, niedobory randomizowanych i kontrolowanych badań klinicznych. Artykuł skierowany jest zarówno dla profesjonalistów związanych z opieką zdrowotną, jak i dla osób zainteresowanych zagadnieniami prawno-medycznymi oraz potencjalnymi korzyściami i wyzwaniami związanymi z konopiami medycznymi.\r\nCel badań: W pracy przeanalizowano aspekty prawne i praktyczne dostępu do marihuany i jej stosowania do celów medycznych w Polsce. \r\nMateriał i metody: Analizy zagadnienia dokonano na podstawie aktualnego przeglądu piśmiennictwa. Porównanie rozwiązań i przeanalizowanie różnic w regulacjach prawnych marihuany stosowanej do celów medycznych w wybranych krajach umożliwi również wskazanie kierunków rozwoju w tym obszarze w Polsce. \r\nWyniki: W niniejszej pracy omówiono ramy prawne dostępu do konopi medycznych i ich zastosowania do celów medycznych.

Przestrzeń medycznego zastosowania konopi omówiona została także w aspekcie możliwości współpracy lekarzy i farmaceutów w ramach sprawowania usług na rzecz pacjenta celem osiągnięcia skuteczności terapeutycznej i wypracowania narzędzi zarządzania ryzykiem farmakoterapii konopiami medycznymi. \r\nWnioski: W miarę łagodzenia ograniczeń w badaniach i stosowaniu, z pewnością zostaną znalezione nowe możliwości terapeutyczne. Tym samym pomimo licznych wyzwań związanych z zastosowaniem Cannabis jak problemy doboru surowca, kontroli jakości, stabilności, bezpieczeństwa i skuteczności,  należy uznać za pozytywne dotychczasowe osiągnięcia, również o istotnym  znaczeniu dla systemu opieki zdrowotnej w Polsce."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background. Cannabis has been used medicinally for centuries. Historically, cannabis-based medicines have been used to treat many conditions. In the 20th century, their use was criminalized worldwide. Nowadays, many countries decriminalize their use. The complexity of the subject and the qualitative variability of the active factors of individual varieties of this species determine new areas that require research and analysis. Attention is drawn to legal issues, quality control issues, and shortages of randomized and controlled clinical trials. The article is addressed to health care professionals and people interested in legal and medical aspects and the potential benefits and challenges related to medical cannabis.\r\n\r\nAim of the study. The aim of article analyzed the legal and practical aspects of access to marijuana and its use for medical application in Poland.\r\n\r\nMaterials and method. Comparing legal solutions and analyzing differences in the regulations of marijuana used for medical purposes in selected countries will also make it possible to indicate the directions of development in this area in Poland.\r\nResults. This article discusses the legal framework for access to medical cannabis and its use for medical purposes. There are at least twenty-one types of raw materials on the market in Poland, which, while maintaining the same levels of THC and CBD, differ in their terpene profile and, therefore, in detailed therapeutic properties. Understanding the differences can enable pharmacists to support and monitor patient drug therapy in this area. The area of medical use of cannabis was also presented in terms of the possibility of cooperation between physicians and pharmacists in providing services to patients in order to achieve therapeutic effectiveness and develop risk management tools for pharmacotherapy using medical marijuana.\r\nConclusions. As limitations in research and use are eliminated, new therapeutic options will be explored. Despite numerous challenges and limitations related to the use of Cannabis, such as the problems of raw material selection, quality control, stability, safety and effectiveness, the achievements so far in this area should be considered encouraging and important for the health care system in Poland."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421926","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"79","pagesFromTo":"379-396","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.ptfarm.pl/wydawnictwa/czasopisma/farmacja-polska/103/-/30209","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e1e64097076263e84e70","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Kozaczuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5cd73010-c7ef-497f-b5c3-bf302988800e"},{"objectId":"5e70930b878c28a0473a1c21","name":"Artur","lastName":"Owczarek","uuid":"121E768D343EC36B46EF74EE2A6E5FD7677F9F64780C2307E950DBEAF5EE6048F066FDEDF3522C3BDD8F678739947F47D3EF2B6E8F0CE003CEF70A05A271E479","orcidId":"0000-0003-0624-5132","documentHash":"e5bf7759-ca85-44ac-b68e-25402ccaee91"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1344","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Karolewicz","uuid":"F4090C94D75F17146095ED3AC0DA0F7974D53077F06C325B2C3325A096F82991EC3541E4E0940FC76007DE12745CD4DC80788B3BDD21683026415623FEEFA547","orcidId":"0000-0003-0970-6344","documentHash":"49c8216d-d001-4c30-a2ae-f031d8509254"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a129d","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Grimling","uuid":"AE0D3B5BEE4C6CE4955C83A6A20408E5DF2C646E37A9B48C998709C951AAAB313ECDD417669E92E7893D3FA99B2D0DB6325960999741A52C7AB721F3978F2699","orcidId":"0000-0002-8574-9293","documentHash":"90b73e53-2bb7-4006-84b7-05aa70f54ccd"}],"doi":"10.32383/farmpol/174885"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hospital indoor air","air sampling","Aspergillus","Fusarium","Penicillium","triazole"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

(2) Methods: Three hematology departments and a hospital for lung diseases were surveyed in 2015 and/or 2019. Air samples were taken with a MicroBio MB1 air sampler on Sabouraud agar. The susceptibility of Aspergillus fumigatus isolates to voriconazole, posaconazole and itraconazole was tested with a microdilution method, according to EUCAST. (3) Results: The amount of fungi cultured from rooms equipped with sterile air circulation, as well as flow devices for air disinfection, was significantly lower compared to that from unprotected rooms. The areas most contaminated with fungi were corridors and bathrooms. The dominant species were Cladosporium and Penicillium. A. fumigatus was rare in hematological departments (6/61, 9.8% examinations performed in 2014 and 2/40, 5% in 2019), whereas in the hospital for lung diseases an outbreak of A. fumigatus spores with up to 300 CFU/m3 was noted in March 2015. No triazole-resistant A. fumigatus isolate was detected. (4) Conclusions: Regular microbiological testing of the hospital environment can contribute to the detection of spore outbreaks, and thus enable the implementation of corrective procedures (e.g., additional disinfection, changing of HEPA filters)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421928","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"art.1031 [14 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2607/11/4/1031","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e98c4097076263e8a24a","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Mierzwiak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"46ccfebc-3335-4801-b909-ea59c01983ae"},{"objectId":"6630e98c4097076263e8a249","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Grzech","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b32f2919-9acc-4bdb-ac5e-5b851718598d"},{"objectId":"652608a940e3ff22d34a6c07","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Górzyńska","uuid":"8A05C419CEDBE41E9DC86BAD0FA97A4915BCDE2B61CC3A4AEF0DE3CCF6DA8F5C6604A6F44CC9D7CDF4D7A427563B95D5552F8B31E9646952DB901963D30AF9BE","orcidId":"0009-0000-0289-1554","documentHash":"a613b38d-1c0c-489a-8690-f897813bfabf"},{"objectId":"5e70930d878c28a0473a1ee3","name":"Marek","lastName":"Ussowicz","uuid":"F0914362C0D4796EDB3616AF10145DA3554F1AFC1499A467991AE370EAAE064A9B812D1B44EBFF65AAE6ED7DC1F16636AE3CC96FB0A5D78FF9C55B847B06CA04","orcidId":"0000-0001-5725-4835","documentHash":"55e1d6a4-a3a7-4b13-84ea-a9cdd9911db8"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a1ba7","name":"Monika","lastName":"Biernat","uuid":"E143ABBAD50CEFE0E2FB850CEC45EDFF7FE0FB75F2882E1C751A9C344F11D28A69062230B800516F3E432B6DBB02E9E9FD60957F4344E617A15D62EDFDCDF3E1","orcidId":"0000-0003-3161-3398","documentHash":"49176f6a-2179-4841-be08-7c66e7250698"},{"objectId":"5e709304878c28a0473a1320","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Nawrot","uuid":"65BF2A4FDD2B07A58305055847438DDA800C005C95A7E87A1DCF0D1AE067AD9B1C9D02E2E6A86D3B4D62E3F6DD82C16DF91352ED1FBD04E801D4653EBF09CA5D","orcidId":"0000-0002-0906-2377","documentHash":"722916fd-f31b-4063-98cf-7c94d19ed0a0"}],"doi":"10.3390/microorganisms11041031"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Curriculum","Education","Nurses and allied professions","Entrustable professional activities"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

W ramach badań przeprowadzono zajęcia, w których uczestniczyło 16 dzieci, w tym 4 mających orzeczenie lub podejrzanych o zaburzenia rozwojowe. Inspiracją do przyjętej organizacji zajęć były wskazówki Edyty Gruszczyk-Kolczyńskiej i Ewy Zielińskiej, które opisywały w swojej książce, w jaki sposób organizować zabawy małych dzieci, aby bawiły się „mądrze i długo” (2019c, s. 209). Głównym celem badań było ustalenie, czy zastosowanie ciekawych elementów wybranych metod zainteresuje wszystkie dzieci i zachęci do wspólnej zabawy także te, które dotychczas niezbyt chętnie uczestniczyły w zabawach grupowych lub miały kłopoty z kontaktami z rówieśnikami. Na podstawie prowadzonych obserwacji można potwierdzić hipotezę, że sukces procesu włączania do grupy dziecka w przedszkolu integracyjnym w dużym stopniu zależy od przemyślanego działania nauczyciela, celowego doboru zajęć oraz dostosowania ich do potrzeb konkretnego dziecka. Przedstawione obserwacje stanowią wstęp do dalszych poszukiwań dotyczących zastosowania elementów różnych metod pedagogicznych w środowisku przedszkolnym w odniesieniu do najmłodszych dzieci."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The article deals with the issue of the effectiveness of implementation selected pedagogical methods in the process of inclusion children with development disorders to the kindergarten group. As part of the research sixteen children participated in the study, including 4 with development disorders.

The main aim of the research was to find out whether usage specific elements of selected methods would interest all children and encourage them to play together, also those who had not been very eager to participate in group activities or had problems with contacts with their peers. On the basis of the conducted observations, it is possible to authenticate the thesis that the success of the process of inclusion child with development disorders to the kindergarten group depends significantly on the deliberate actions of the teacher, the deliberate selection of activities and their adaptation to the needs of a specific child. The presented in the article observations are an introduction to further research on the implementation selected pedagogical methods in the kindergarten with regard to the youngest children."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421944","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"83","pagesFromTo":"369-379","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367184869_Skutecznosc_stosowania_wybranych_metod_pedagogicznych_w_kontekscie_wlaczania_dzieci_z_zaburzeniami_rozwoju_do_srodowiska_grupy_przedszkolnej","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"640876d87523405b4c2b2fcc","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Majkowska","uuid":"A6870509365989F34846B567926BBFC43BBBB911A888DA0C6DE38C39DD0F527B37CFC7FE19AF9F775EDA4C177768EE26BAC61845CB84473F622250775A1DA5C7","orcidId":"0000-0002-5728-7239","documentHash":"fbe902ac-68a5-4f58-9675-b5a1675af001"},{"objectId":"5e70924c878c28a0473934a7","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Skrzetuska","uuid":"363C71C1DC32420A7AE8BC8FED345AD800BB9EE7B9092660B679C6E9186257855405EE699C0CD20B7D3C3E7AF28A84917B5CABBBA1F605543206F50E344D1E1A","orcidId":"0000-0003-2035-6082","documentHash":"9e700e76-d70e-46c8-9428-f521e8f1adeb"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Enterprise Resource Planning System (ERP)","Business Process Management System (BPMS)","Business Process Management Suite","Industry 4.0","Industry 5.0"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet Warszawski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709347878c28a0473a640f"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","uid":"bT0wgNmw2NF3tmKZFz7D7bQ","uuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","parentUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de97","rootUuid":"fe0251f2-3765-4045-91af-9e1b55dbd752","name":"Instytut Badań Systemowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709479878c28a0473bde28","5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"PAVING THE WAY FOR TOMORROW: THE EVOLUTION OF ERP AND BPMS SYSTEMS","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d54878c28514547a747","mniswId":"200171","title":"Zeszyty Naukowe Politechniki Śląskiej.

The purpose is to investigate whether BPMS remains pertinent in the face of increasingly complex and diverse business processes, considering the overlapping functionalities with ERP systems.  Design/methodology/approach: This discussion paper employs a systematic theoretical literature review approach. The methodology integrates insights from existing research, conducting comprehensive searches across reputable academic databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. Keyword searches yielded over 500 results, which were refined to 203 relevant articles through prioritizing peer-reviewed sources. The synthesis of literature includes an analysis of historical evolution and  a comparative study of critical success factors, forming the basis for deriving potential future trajectories for these interconnected system classes, and emphasizing their strategic alignment. Findings: This discussion paper presents an overview of the current state and future development trajectory of the two critical information systems (IS) classes for modern organizational management—ERP and BPMS—and compares the critical success factors (CSFs) associated with each system class. Based on this comparison, the paper determines the development direction of both system classes concerning business requirements. Originality/value: Unlike prior literature which has examined ERP and BPMS systems individually, this study provides original perspectives by conducting a direct comparative analysis of the critical success factors for each system class. The comparative CSF analysis approach enables this study to contribute unique insights into the status and future trajectory of ERP and BPMS systems."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421945","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65a120fb4097071121a64e27","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"185","doi":null,"documentHash":"d2b5657f-b901-4fd7-98cf-b1d133920232"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"481-510","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.29119/1641-3466.2023.185.27","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65ce028e4097074ca0bb69c2","name":"Audrone","lastName":"LUPEIKIENE","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a6c98daa-3602-4c16-9199-5c8923e09ac3"},{"objectId":"5e709479878c28a0473bde28","name":"Włodzimierz","lastName":"Szelągowski","uuid":"27F74A4788BFD3CE18AFEB15DDFD6AF68BFD26DF42B08C891FC5799E5B821C30B1F9540493266D7BECFDE07FFF614A4D3046CB12C2036C95DBF88BD8E077B779","orcidId":"0000-0002-5114-6793","documentHash":"e3659fe9-4b80-4538-b542-c25ae66f4639"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a640f","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Senkus","uuid":"9F2DA6CE6DC4A44F2C2FB311D069C7B76E8E928EE6F9EDAF4CA1A3158AE1084ADBBED9AEE17BFA0D0BD386EC980B91B67AFAAC71C1D8D9DB5D14B890670A2079","orcidId":"0000-0001-9033-6437","documentHash":"236bc6d3-e94c-45f1-8a08-af04c9195d08"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739ac70","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Berniak-Woźny","uuid":"6138BF6B0A41DA74BFC258AA49BE7E5394626426404BA3AC8D242813245830AFA5AACE0908A279A3C7F928737C7621C8210C452F3DFC7AD46842090E2364BA3B","orcidId":"0000-0002-3156-5755","documentHash":"95feafe5-9ec4-4ca4-8cd3-ceb6bdadc6bf"}],"doi":"10.29119/1641-3466.2023.185.27"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["agronomic trait improvement","cereals","CRISPR/Cas9","multiplex editing","strategies for gain-of-function"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ec878c28a04739f453"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"CRISPR enables sustainable cereal production for a greener future","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454799df","mniswId":"19799","title":"TRENDS IN PLANT SCIENCE","doi":null,"issn":"1360-1385","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"fbaee378-b134-439f-a18b-b84719f96f81"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"NOVEMBER","releaseDateYear":2023,"releaseDateMode":"BEFORE_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65cb72594097072cdd795ea8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["65cb72594097072cdd795eaa","65cb72594097072cdd795eab","65cb72594097072cdd795eac","65cb72594097072cdd795ead","5e7092ec878c28a04739f453"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system has become the most important tool for targeted genome editing in many plant and animal species over the past decade.

In this study, we investigate the impact of Cu doping on the sintering mechanism, electrical performance, and stability of BaCe0.7Zr0.1Dy0.2-xO3-δ (BCZD) electrolyte. The morphology, composition, structure, and chemical state of BCZD electrolytes were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Remarkably, the sintering temperature of BCZD is reduced to 1200 °C through Cu doping Furthermore, the introduction of Cu as a dopant induces Ba exsolution from the BCZD crystal lattice alongside the generation of oxygen vacancies. XPS measurements confirmed that vacancy concentrations increase with increasing Cu doping concentrations. However, as the Cu content surpasses 2 mol%, the exsoluted Cu reacts with Ba, leading to the formation of BaCuO2. Accumulation of BaCuO2 at the grain boundaries adversely affects the conductivity and stability of Cu-doped BCZD, in a humidified atmosphere where it exhibits significant instability. Notably, BCZD with 2 mol% Cu content demonstrates a conductivity of 2.7 × 10-2 S cm−1 and maintains stability for up to 420 h in the H2/3%H2O atmosphere at 600 °C. In contrast, BCZD with 5 mol% Cu content exhibits a conductivity of 1.9 × 10-2 S cm−1 at 600 °C but experiences continuous degradation in a humidified atmosphere, ultimately leading to failure within 30 h. The 2 % Cu-doped BCZD exhibits high conductivity and stability at intermediate temperatures, rendering it highly suitable for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) applications."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421949","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65ccd6694097073ccbcb446e","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"654","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"b8cb1b1d-7784-48ce-886f-9a06b26f5e9b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"654","pagesFromTo":"1124-1135","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0021979723020271?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65ccd6694097073ccbcb4473","name":"Cheng-Xin","lastName":"Li","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5e98e651-19c6-4e6c-a624-38fdb86dd6e7"},{"objectId":"65ccd6694097073ccbcb4472","name":"Jiutao","lastName":"Gao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f654ae4c-49e8-4422-835b-b140613ebd8e"},{"objectId":"65ccd6694097073ccbcb4471","name":"Xing Liang","lastName":"Lin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6f34cdcd-5a2d-473d-8f1d-3103a8d3608b"},{"objectId":"65ccd6694097073ccbcb4470","name":"Muhammad Bilal","lastName":"Hanif","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"46ca3baa-e7ad-491b-956b-ba8f69804841"},{"objectId":"65ccd6694097073ccbcb446f","name":"Zaheer Ud Din","lastName":"Babar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f6f5c32d-6771-44dc-9b89-c5479493dd8b"},{"objectId":"5e70940f878c28a0473b5978","name":"Michał","lastName":"Mosiałek","uuid":"7B2B7FEAE1CF62326D4273E569C2EFC32B5863E7DB870E689055B3C2C44A0D07F02BFFDAE428882D2A9DC6371C4F20DDDA4EFD77E45C0B0159E575CEE0C1CE0F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6891-881X","documentHash":"1b90bd3e-5a37-4b3a-93a3-d3b9ba52b96d"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jcis.2023.10.094"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Latin America","authoritarianism","Venezuela","Nicolas Maduro","Supreme Tribunal of Justice"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Latin America","authoritarianism","Venezuela","Nicolas Maduro","Supreme Tribunal of Justice"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Engagement of the Judiciary in the Political Activity of the Ruling Camp.

One path is through incorporating humanities into medical and healthcare practitioners’ education. The really big idea is that one studies humanities to become a better human, and while there are a billion reasons to study humanities, this paper focuses on how, through art and humanities, people can comprehend health, illness, and disability, namely how literature can be used to raise awareness about Alzheimer’s disease. This paper introduces the notion of medical and health humanities, briefly summarises their beginning, and how, so far, the applied literature in health sciences has been used. Next, the idea is illustrated in the example of Lisa Genova’s novel Still Alice. This part analyses how sickness and its impact on people’s lives is portrayed. Finally, the article proposes an original mode of application to acquire a deeper insight into illnesses, well-being, and pain that might be fostered in future healthcare providers, as well as a better understanding of patients and their caregivers."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421956","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65c381154097074c89e08c94","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"142","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"aa393529-f101-4422-aaad-8bca4ff5ff58"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"142","pagesFromTo":"80-94","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.15804/kie.2023.04.05","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65cca2d54097073ccbc73a0a","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Skrzek-Wielmowiec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"15743b02-9373-436e-ad11-ddbd0c3ca67a"}],"doi":"10.15804/kie.2023.04.05"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb4","uid":"bj27tL_rvHoo5VZAgM5eZ_g","uuid":"2e1e6c2d-6b50-4115-9e97-a2cee488f353","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb4","parentUuid":"2e1e6c2d-6b50-4115-9e97-a2cee488f353","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb4","rootUuid":"2e1e6c2d-6b50-4115-9e97-a2cee488f353","name":"Instytut Mechaniki Górotworu Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f5878c28a0473b4063","65cdfa3b4097074ca0ba780d","645b01a940e3ff38f8b4e277","5e709472878c28a0473bd470"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Experimental Stand for Very-Low-Velocity Gas Flow Generation","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5ec00656ad49b31cced98375","mniswId":null,"title":"SENSORS","doi":"10.3390/s","issn":"1424-8220","eissn":"1424-8220","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"ec4e8368-3533-4c46-bc00-a11947d2579c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65cdfa3b4097074ca0ba7808","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["645b01a940e3ff38f8b4e277","5e709472878c28a0473bd470","5e7093f5878c28a0473b4063","65cdfa3b4097074ca0ba780d"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747059421959","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65cdfa3b4097074ca0ba7809","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"23","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"eb0eb9a9-1b4e-4a44-b374-84aafc967430"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"1569","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/3/1569/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65cdfa3b4097074ca0ba780d","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Rachalski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"20847623-81d8-42da-aedb-e6a81dd7d052"},{"objectId":"645b01a940e3ff38f8b4e277","name":"Tymoteusz","lastName":"Piga","uuid":"7AE6FCA906366C415EBD17B456CE5122D6101E0B9121FBFC7DFB4BF7610660E4F6B13F8A21824C9FFBEB2D19D7DD0F827AE13859B228EA438AB24D997DB7BF83","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"33e6d945-80bf-4a9f-8e7c-65546e356fae"},{"objectId":"5e709472878c28a0473bd470","name":"Waldemar","lastName":"Wodziak","uuid":"CB544C5B4FE1698CC8C86E032B4C2ADF73513516DA6121BFD19D7AD8BF41ADA0A9AF09E6994B356910DC13916B9470A99D46B3CCC26B64B488752D41ECF9299C","orcidId":"0000-0001-9999-1796","documentHash":"fe439864-a0a7-43f5-9d1a-fef375d12a9c"},{"objectId":"5e7093f5878c28a0473b4063","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Sobczyk","uuid":"FEB6C8E4A306DA6DC51772B8C96DE5D9EF1C604AA6A155C9FD93BD131097B7DBFCBBCE1B9B17D7CD564E632ABE0727B12598124B97D9458F73C0F62D7AD73B68","orcidId":"0000-0003-0594-9867","documentHash":"19d93f44-6965-498a-85ea-2642b7890101"}],"doi":"10.3390/s23031569"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cardiology","cardiovascular","clinical trial","heart failure","motivational interviewing","randomized","heart","self-care","randomized controlled trial"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

Self-care is a cornerstone approach for optimizing therapy for patients with HF. Patients play a crucial role in managing their condition, given that several adverse health outcomes might be avoided with adequate self-care. In this regard, the literature describes motivational interviewing (MI) as highly favorable for treating chronic diseases, with promising results supporting its efficacy in enhancing self-care. Moreover, caregivers' availability constitutes a fundamental supporting factor among the strategies to improve self-care behaviors in people with HF.\r\n\r\nObjective: The primary study aim is to test the efficacy of a structured program, including scheduled MI interventions, in improving self-care maintenance in the 3-month follow-up from the enrollment. Secondary aims comprehend the assessment of the effectiveness of the above intervention on secondary outcomes (eg, self-care monitoring, quality of life, sleep disturbance) and the corroboration of the superiority of caregivers' participation to the intervention over the program administrated only to individual patients in enhancing self-care behaviors and other outcomes at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months from the enrollment.\r\n\r\nMethods: This study protocol designed a prospective, parallel-arm, open-label, 3-arm, controlled trial. The MI intervention will be administered by nurses trained in HF self-care and MI; the education program will be provided to nurses by an expert psychologist. Analyses will be performed within the framework of intention-to-treat analysis. Comparisons between groups will be based on an alpha of 5% and 2-tailed null hypotheses. In the case of missingness, analyzing the extent of the missingness and identifying underlying mechanisms and patterns will guide imputation methods.\r\n\r\nResults: The data collection was started in May 2017. We completed the data collection with the last follow-up in May 2021. We plan to perform data analysis by December 2022. We plan to publish the study results within March 2023.\r\n\r\nConclusions: MI enhances potential self-care practices in patients with HF and their caregivers. Although MI is effectively largely employed either alone or combined with other treatments and is administered in different settings and ways, face-to-face interventions seem to be more effective. Dyads with higher shared HF knowledge are more efficient in promoting self-care adherence behaviors. Moreover, patients and caregivers may perceive proximity with health care professionals, resulting in a better ability to follow the received health professionals' directions. The scheduled in-person meetings with patients and caregivers will be exploited to administer MI, respecting all the safety regulations for infection containment. The conduction of this study may support changes in clinical practice to include MI to improve self-care for patients with HF.\r\n\r\nTrial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05595655; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05595655.\r\n\r\nInternational registered report identifier (irrid): DERR1-10.2196/44629.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421963","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"art.e44629 [11 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.researchprotocols.org/2023/1/e44629","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630e70a4097076263e890ca","name":"Rosario","lastName":"Caruso","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"714bb41b-280a-4928-896a-41031a71d040"},{"objectId":"6630e70a4097076263e890c9","name":"Cristina","lastName":"Arrigoni","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bb131e87-e606-4fc7-8f0e-794e6cd6da09"},{"objectId":"6630e70a4097076263e890c8","name":"Sara","lastName":"Russo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4ccd1d21-f456-4129-ad77-5c70756ece96"},{"objectId":"6630e70a4097076263e890c7","name":"Ida","lastName":"Vangone","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"22d8cfe7-a55f-42ef-8db0-089ad156f019"},{"objectId":"6630e70a4097076263e890c6","name":"Giada","lastName":"De Angeli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ebc428e5-ac6c-4817-9a3d-ceb6b7528578"},{"objectId":"6630e70a4097076263e890c5","name":"Irene","lastName":"Baroni","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d78c76f4-3632-4b87-8c98-3bd5a084da3b"},{"objectId":"6630e70a4097076263e890c4","name":"Gianluca","lastName":"Conte","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3b27e46a-2fed-4c78-a86a-2a60dff0f831"},{"objectId":"6630e70a4097076263e890c3","name":"Arianna","lastName":"Magon","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f9417574-1232-4468-8b05-910a59d5d69a"},{"objectId":"6630e70a4097076263e890c2","name":"Greta","lastName":"Ghizzardi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f61b983b-98fc-45c7-8a22-264a64c70f28"},{"objectId":"6630e70a4097076263e890c1","name":"Federica","lastName":"Dellafiore","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"65d8388d-a48f-41c1-9b07-509db8271142"},{"objectId":"65f26f3840e3ff25249e6537","name":"Ercole","lastName":"Vellone","uuid":"91787B098D203366D4A79F0CE072972CF0FF112DE7C49487D02D142AC7244C3094A35A905903F5E1DA2383C833910AB53DA4F7379DE97717204DE1AEB0055EE9","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"299b335d-f2d3-45fd-a196-d14098f8c31b"}],"doi":"10.2196/44629"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":"978-94-035-4807-4","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709195878c28a04737f49e","uid":"bXY_DMagKuf8Wt0-tVB5Guw","uuid":"f39171b5-f192-4064-bc1b-c5c84006a634","parentId":"5e709195878c28a04737f49e","parentUuid":"f39171b5-f192-4064-bc1b-c5c84006a634","rootId":"5e709195878c28a04737f49e","rootUuid":"f39171b5-f192-4064-bc1b-c5c84006a634","name":"Uniwersytet Ignatianum w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709312878c28a0473a2458"]}],"type":"BOOK","title":"Labour Law: Council of Europe, 5th Edition","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":440,"publicationPlace":"The Netherlands","translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65cdcef940970762636d7323","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709312878c28a0473a2458"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Derived from the renowned multi-volume International Encyclopaedia of Laws, this monograph on Council of Europe not only describes and analyses the legal aspects of labour relations, but also examines labour relations practices and developing trends.

binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the first step in human viral infection. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of interaction between RBD and ACE2 at the molecular level is critical for the prevention of COVID-19, as more variants of concern, such as Omicron, appear. Recently, atomic force microscopy has been applied to characterize the free energy landscape of the RBD–ACE2 complex, including estimation of the distance between the transition state and the bound state, xu.

Among the Paratethys sub-basins, the foreland Dukla Basin hosted dark dysoxic Menilite Shales. Within these the lenticular body of deep-marine Cergowa Beds was deposited. Due to its marginal position and orogenic activity, the Cergowa depocenter was sensitive to a broad range of influences reflected by: separation from and re-connection with the Tethys Ocean; reactions to global sea-level change; variations in calcareous nannoplankton palaeoecology and fluctuations in water chemistry; changing sediment gravity flow mechanisms; facies progradation and basin tectonics; palaeotransport direction; and changes in the calcite compensation depth. The proximal north-western part of the Cergowa depocenter consisted of two troughs evolving towards the south-east into an unconfined distal area. This is shown by palaeocurrent patterns changing down current from low-dispersion to fanning out distributions. Sedimentation during the succeeding NP23 nannoplankton zone was controlled by glacio-eustatic shallowing, enhanced by tectonic uplift, both resulting in isolation from the Tethys Ocean, forming a brackish environment affected by fluvial supply. Aggrading sand-rich proximal turbidite facies common at this stage include hyperpycnally-generated sustained turbidites that were sourced from shelf-edge delta, as well as hybrid event beds that reflect erosion of morphologically unbalanced slopes modified by fold-thrust tectonics. Nannoplankton of the succeeding NP24 zone documents normal salinity of an open sea that was reconnected with the Tethys Ocean, which is contrary to the global cooling and related eustatic sea-level lowstand during this time. At this stage, deposits of low-density turbidity currents predominate and form a succession prograding towards the south-east. Therefore, the oceanic reconnection was likely controlled by local subsidence, the rate of which exceeded the rate of deposition, especially in the south-east. The reconnection also influenced the calcite compensation depth level and resulted in an increase in coccolithophore productivity, recorded by laminated pelagic limestone interbeds within the youngest fining-upwards part of the Cergowa Beds succession. This fining-upwards sequence of low-density turbidites reflects retrogradation of the arenaceous material within the distributary system and a transition to mudstone-dominated disoxic facies of the Menilite Beds, being the most productive hydrocarbon and helium source rock unit in the Outer Carpathians. These processes and relationships show that due to the marginal position of the synorogenic basin, the Cergowa Beds record environmental sensitivity to extrabasinal and intrabasinal factors, and a broad range of global, regional, and local influences, thus providing insights applicable to research into the evolution of other basins placed in a similar context."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421976","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65ce09844097074ca0bc311a","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"444","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"07139aea-d959-413c-9d6d-76aa01463b4a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"444","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0037073822002470?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65ce09844097074ca0bc311c","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Godlewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"eeb28b64-02fc-41cf-bfed-5a2d31fdd048"},{"objectId":"65ce09844097074ca0bc311b","name":"Marek","lastName":"Wendorff","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"102f8195-ac80-4ab9-b92f-cb7ae3e47cfa"},{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a047397708","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Pszonka","uuid":"98E5476325D0822AA35D86E0653EA664E7CFA3BB827215B96623EEB6EE48DD19F7967647B22CBF65571D0A4BF93D0E0CBAF5AF5985584310FF2F51E5CD1005FC","orcidId":"0000-0002-2776-0224","documentHash":"84f40afa-d14f-4cd3-aaa3-5cc07b27fcad"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.sedgeo.2022.106326"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["krople do oczu","napięcie powierzchniowe","kwas hialuronowy","kwas poliakrylowy","metyloceluloza"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["eye drops","surface tension","hyaluronic acid","polyacrylic acid","methylcellulose"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","uid":"bHhhRrJPOI9BMfGA4x5cmvQ","uuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","parentUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de56","rootUuid":"18711a61-b8cc-4cb5-97c3-893045eff81e","name":"Uniwersytet Medyczny im.

A group of 34 dermatological patients, aged 12–19 years old, with various skin diseases were given the T-QoL as well as the CDLQI or DLQI to complete. They were also asked to complete the T-QoL questionnaire for the second time after 3–5 days. Statistical analysis of the results was performed.\r\nResults:\r\nThe Polish version of T-QoL is internally consistent (Cronbach a 0.893 for the whole questionnaire). Moreover, it presents very good convergent validity (ICC = 0.864). No statistically significant differences between each question were noticed between the first and second time of completing the form.

Having discussed classical teacher roles from a diachronic perspective, the author defines new teacher roles, based on research conducted with 127 primary and secondary school teachers. The research reveals that classical roles that have defined the teaching profession for years must be redefined due to the dynamic nature of the contemporary school environment. This article, divided into two main sections—theoretical and empirical—clearly implies that the tasks and duties of the contemporary teacher define the innovative roles, thus bringing about new challenges for teachers in the dynamic Polish educational context.

Since pancreatic cancer (PC) remains one of the most lethal neoplasms and its incidence is increasing despite numerous ongoing research on diagnostic biomarkers and novel therapies, we aimed to investigate whether CD has an impact on the risk of PC. Material and Methods: We performed a systematic review of the literature published from January 2000 to March 2022 in two databases: Web of Science and Scopus and a meta-analysis of eligible studies. Results: Our search identified eight publications included in the systematic review. A total of five studies involving 47,941 patients, including 6399 CD patients with malignancies and 1231 PC cases were included in the meta-analysis and 221 cases of PC in CD patients with other cancers were recognized. The pooled OR for PC was 1.46 (95% CI 1.26–1.7) with significant heterogeneity (89.1%; p &lt; 0.05), suggesting that CD patients with malignancies were at higher risk for PC. Conclusions: The association between CD and PC is uncertain. However, the results of the current meta-analysis may indicate an increased risk of PC in the group of patients with CD and other cancers.

Results: In this review, 55 patients with multiple myxomas aneurysms were analyzed, and 65% were women. The average age when aneurysms were diagnosed was 42.5 ± 15.81; most patients were less than 60 years old (86%). Aneurysms could be found before the diagnosis, at the same time as cardiac myxoma, or even 25 years after resection of the atrial mass. In our review, the mean time to diagnoses was 4.5 years. Our review estimates that the most common symptoms were vascular incidents (25%) and seizures (14.3%). In 15 cases, variable headaches were reported. Regarding management strategies, 57% cases were managed conservatively as the primary choice.

However, the study of cancer biology phenomena in canine cells is currently limited by restricted availability of validated antibody reagents and techniques. Here, we provide an initial characterization of the expression and activity of key components of the DNA Damage Response (DDR) in a panel of hematopoietic canine cancer cell lines, with the use of commercially available antibody reagents.\r\n\r\nMaterials and methods: The techniques used for this validation analysis were western blot, qPCR, and DNA combing assay.\r\n\r\nResults: Substantial variations in both the basal expression (ATR, Claspin, Chk1, and Rad51) and agonist-induced activation (p-Chk1) of DDR components were observed in canine cancer cell lines. The expression was stronger in the CLBL-1 (B-cell lymphoma) and CLB70 (B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia) cell lines than in the GL-1 (B-cell leukemia) cell line, but the biological significance of these differences requires further investigation. We also validated methodologies for quantifying DNA replication dynamics in hematopoietic canine cancer cell lines, and found that the GL-1 cell line presented a higher replication fork speed than the CLBL-1 cell line, but that both showed a tendency to replication fork asymmetry.\r\n\r\nConclusion: These findings will inform future studies on cancer biology, which will facilitate progress in developing novel anticancer therapies for canine patients. They can also provide new knowledge in human oncology.\r\n"}],"lastRefresh":"1747059421998","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"art.1227683 [15

Formal and simulation techniques are appreciated for the verification of proof-of-work agreement protocols, because the formal techniques development process frequently requires a series of assumptions, leading to somewhat unrealistic models. A conventional colored Petri net model, presented by the authors in a previous study, allowed us to refine the Keller and Böhme consensus protocol by applying the simulation technique. In this study, we developed a reenterable colored Petri net model representing a general construct for model-driven development and refinement of consensus protocols and the corresponding software. A considerable benefit of a reenterable model is the invariance of its structure with respect to the net topology, number of attached nodes, and parameters of their software and hardware, which are represented as the marking of dedicated places. Switching of topology tags associated with dynamic objects represents the basic principle of reenterable model functioning. It is shown that, having the same characteristics, in bounds of admissible error of some 2-3%, the reenterable model results in 6 times speed-up of the simulation process and a drastic decrease in time for model editing, especially when the number of nodes exceeds a hundred.

Badania przeprowadzono na podstawie studium przypadku. Analizie poddano 1524 głosowania, które odbyły się w latach 2019–2021, a dokładnie w pierwszej połowie IX kadencji Sejmu RP. Zwrócono uwagę na poziom opozycyjności między frakcją rządzącą a tymi, które formalnie pozostawały poza obozem rządowym. W pierwszej kolejności pomiaru opozycyjności dokonano w oparciu o indeks podobieństwa w głosowaniach. Następnie zaproponowano nowe narzędzie pomiaru dające sposobność skwantyfikowania poziomu opozycyjności pomiędzy dwoma frakcjami uwzględniając stanowisko każdej z nich względem konkretnej sprawy, jak i zakres ich wewnętrznej spójności."},{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of this paper is to present a way of measuring the actual opposition distance between parliamentary political groups. Attention was focused on opposition observed through the lens of parliamentary group behaviour in potentially final passage votes. The research was conducted on the basis of a case study. The analysis was based on 1524 votes that were taken in the first half of the ninth term of the Polish Sejm. Consideration was given to the degree of opposition between the ruling group and those that formally remained outside the government camp. It was first measured using the Index of Voting Likeness. A new measurement tool was then proposed to quantify the level of opposition between the two groups, taking into account the position of each group on a particular issue, as well as the extent of their internal unity."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059422010","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65d846ed4097071e5456bfd8","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"","number":"6","doi":"","documentHash":"86597cca-fab8-443b-a7c2-9130de46e1ca"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"337-353","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://czasopisma.marszalek.com.pl/en/10-15804/ppk/1355-ppk-2023/ppk-20236/12059-ppk2023624","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709253878c28a047393bbc","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Glajcar","uuid":"1E703CFD33926DD8257F82DE5C3DA5F87EE7A71C8F604091AC88040AD1FF2500B551DFF72EDF267897021DD2F2B8551B9C4AAD429D7B718D158232DF3684C884","orcidId":"0000-0002-1850-013X","documentHash":"0dc472d3-c2df-4849-9a83-be175376ee82"}],"doi":"10.15804/ppk.2023.06.24"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"65ccbf85409707626366c0ba","doi":null,"title":"UBEZPIECZENIA","year":2024,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-208-2586-2","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://www.pwe.com.pl/ksiazki/finanse/ubezpieczenia,p813328141","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"a83b3046-9c3d-422f-914f-b4a7173e94ad","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8a8","mniswId":"50300","name":"Polskie Wydawnictwo Ekonomiczne","documentHash":"537b4805-1da7-42b6-8c23-f66e2ea634ba"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","uid":"b1CAWFlsJj7f886P9BWoCUQ","uuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","parentUuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","rootUuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","name":"Uniwersytet Radomski im.

Macroalgae significantly\r\ninfluenced lipid profiles, reducing total cholesterol levels (quadratic contrast p = 0.001) and demon-\r\nstrating an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, particularly with 1% macroalgae\r\ninclusion (linear contrast p < 0.001), with a decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in both\r\nmacroalgae-supplemented groups (linear contrast p = 0.001). Additionally, macroalgae had a positive\r\nimpact on the activities of antioxidative enzymes (ferric-reducing ability of plasma, superoxide\r\ndismutase, reduced glutathione) and reduced lipid peroxidation products (lipid hydroperoxide, mal-\r\nondialdehyde) in the blood, liver tissue, and intestinal epithelium of the ileum, suggesting enhanced\r\nantioxidative defense mechanisms. These changes were dose-dependent; in blood plasma, they\r\nexhibited both a linear and quadratic response, while in the tissues, the response was primarily linear.\r\nAdditionally, an increase in the digestibility of crude fat in macroalgae-supplemented groups was\r\nobserved (linear contrast p < 0.001), highlighting their potential role in improving nutrient absorption\r\nand digestion. The study findings emphasize the health benefits of natural, seaweed-based additives\r\nin diets, particularly in managing oxidative stress and improving lipid profiles, and highlight the\r\npotential of macroalgae as a natural dietary supplement to improve antioxidant systems and lipid\r\nmetabolism in piglets."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059422018","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"549","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/14/4/549","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65cf37d5409707626375a183","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Woś","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2355cfb7-b9ba-4335-ae76-7395fbea531f"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390afc","name":"Siemowit","lastName":"Muszyński","uuid":"E8B92AB9BFAAFAA51E854380BD375F25BDAB1C32543155332BAAE342F63D09EA2D5994A8241100BB8141CB6AA0718808F1D6B5FFCF207EAF09FA2CBCA463FF34","orcidId":"0000-0002-4118-6302","documentHash":"4ac39fda-840b-464a-9401-d6ddde97f0d1"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a047390ac6","name":"Anna","lastName":"Czech","uuid":"66AFEBE34A215F792E4BF9DA4F50E7C4F7DF36C2A969B753167696922ECCC2C7FA736EFB37323E61D169D24DDC617F33184567E9BBC202E41A560078CE8A2D21","orcidId":"0000-0003-4142-2608","documentHash":"b85c8033-f20d-4b2f-948e-e153a65147bc"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a047390a26","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Tomaszewska","uuid":"EF8728197761928296AF05CE05BB6595A6A90B359177B2419A897F9392E4EA3A27A1EA198A5D7F3B3554271E7F1A68AF87967A0BA6B4735120AB9C6CC6DE7322","orcidId":"0000-0002-7574-2653","documentHash":"48936eeb-4df7-446f-93cf-b552d3a826f2"}],"doi":"10.3390/ani14040549"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Game theory","Payoff functional","Staircase-function strategy","Non-cooperative game","Equilibrium stack","Multidimensional-matrix game"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","uid":"bGA_QwQGoDNg-6MMEBxlWNQ","uuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","parentUuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737df0a","rootUuid":"3b7a72f4-78d9-4c46-8876-932d37791dd0","name":"Akademia Marynarki Wojennej im.

The spaces canbe finite and continuous as well. The method is based on stacking equilib-ria of “short” non-cooperative games, each defined on an interval wherethe pure strategy value is constant. In the case of finite non-ooperativegames, which factually are multidimensional-matrix games, the equilibriaare considered in general terms, so they can be in mixed strategies as well.The stack is any combination (succession) of the respective equilibria of the“short” multidimensional-matrix games. Apart from the stack, there areno other equilibria in this “long” (staircase-function) multidimensional-matrix game. An example of staircase-function quadmatrix game is pre-sented to show how the stacking is fulfilled for a case of when every “short”quadmatrix game has a single pure-strategy equilibrium. The presentedmethod, further “breaking” the initial staircase-function game into a suc-cession of “short” games, is far more tractable than a straightforwardapproach to solving directly the “long” non-cooperative game would be."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059422021","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65cdca4c4097074ca0b52b02","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"46","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"1d9e6805-eb5a-4d1e-8de7-7729f08e59ba"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"46","pagesFromTo":"79-114","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.prz.edu.pl/jma/article/view/1526/1145","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65d6bfbb40e3ff7706ea7d84","name":"Vadim","lastName":"Romanuke","uuid":"A17EC39ED9C2B177FE1C28F9B74FDCEB4692147AB33B2613A20A182B5770C19FD19C75B2FF248D1CF1D71F3F4BD71C159F49316216E6095A384977F62042AEAD","orcidId":"0000-0003-3543-3087","documentHash":"c5620bf0-8042-4ae2-8489-60316d8eec69"}],"doi":"10.7862/rf.2023.4"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2023,"isbn":"978-83-8270-235-4","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[],"type":"BOOK","title":"Bliscy osób uzależnionych.

In this study, we compared the levels of these personality variables in a group of professional theater actors and a group of professional illusionists with a control group of participants who were neither actors nor illusionists and had no artistic education. We also examined the correlations between emotional reactivity and self-esteem in the three groups. For emotional reactivity, we found (1) very strong evidence that the level is less for magicians than for controls, (2) substantial evidence that the level is less for magicians than for actors, (3) anecdotal evidence that the level is less for actors than for controls, and (4) decisive evidence that the average score is less for males than for females. For self-esteem, we found (1) anecdotal evidence that the level is higher for magicians than for controls, (2) substantial evidence that there is no difference between actors and magicians, (3) anecdotal evidence against a difference between actors and controls, and (4) anecdotal evidence against a difference between males and females. Based on the entire sample we found a moderate correlation between self-esteem and emotional reactivity (r = -.30, p < 0.001). Our results are compatible with the notion that emotional reactivity – as part of the temperament concept – is a factor influencing the choice of an artistic profession."}],"lastRefresh":"1747059422026","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65cc7dfc4097073ccbc49987","year":"2023","publishedYear":null,"volume":"54","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"d1214e4f-f64a-4cd4-a303-71f38c99f43e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"54","pagesFromTo":"229–244","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/ppb?language=pl","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65cc7dfc4097073ccbc49988","name":"Vebjørn","lastName":"Ekroll","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"46d7cb26-182f-438f-9e6b-b46d76ec889a"},{"objectId":"5e7092aa878c28a04739a350","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Napora","uuid":"7F0280B19547EDB56BEE4ED8B22E8D2B10FBAA0A54D6E762F0CAEEBAD29FE261365520D94C956F64BBA26C23A75321DFD39F94EB73EA4A242F1F07213F890CEF","orcidId":"0000-0002-4224-9563","documentHash":"4d8aadbe-e1b1-484d-a180-be1d98922f49"}],"doi":"10.24425/ppb.2023.148055"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["electronic delivery","administrative procedure","administrative proceedings"]}],"year":2023,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ba878c28a0473afe1f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The Impact of Electronic Delivery on the Course of General Administrative Proceedings","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a5d1","mniswId":"200212","title":"TEKA Komisji Prawniczej PAN Oddział w Lublinie","doi":null,"issn":"1899-7694","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"81049739-8c56-4b2a-a4ed-a364e29bc1c6"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2023-12-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"65cc606f4097076263632068","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ba878c28a0473afe1f"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The entry into force of the Act on electronic delivery of November 18, 2021 has exceeded the expectations of technology supporters.
