Despite the structural similarities, ODDs accept a variety of substrates and facilitate a wide range of reactions, that is hydroxylations, desaturations, (oxa)cyclisations and ring rearrangements. In this review we present and discuss the factors contributing to the observed (regio)selectivities of ODDs. They span from inherent properties of the reactants, that is, substrate molecule and iron cofactor, to the interactions between the substrate and the enzyme's binding cavity; the latter can counterbalance the effect of the former. Based on results of both experimental and computational studies dedicated to ODDs, we also line out the properties of the reactants which promote reaction outcomes other than the “default” hydroxylation. It turns out that the reaction selectivity depends on a delicate balance of interactions between the components of the investigated system."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145846","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6257e24c2467f0168bdad44e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"28","number":"18","doi":null,"documentHash":"13b2c451-2271-4ccc-a284-82c090ae259a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"28","pagesFromTo":"e202104106","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/chem.202104106","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61b026b875234066bacade7a","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Wojdyła","uuid":"BBAD15132DF45C7D8314A457F97683F68F0BB65872630B7AF24745582B0AF91C223F350FCFE4BA88DF2022EFEB3202E2984B5F0F07CDFD9D07CC23D8DAAACC3B","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5d8082a8-17fa-495e-9479-3d8aba972827"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a0473979ce","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Borowski","uuid":"A1E56EAE124C81F7ECD0F979286DD41D89D3C93B83406002BDB12D08F26F55ECB6407E0F82B45E4C2D8190A6F335D1B73378933E6571798F34BCDD3DE5F12EEF","orcidId":"0000-0002-3450-3576","documentHash":"714e433d-305f-4f79-af76-c2d6ffdd2eaf"}],"doi":"10.1002/chem.202104106"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091d1878c28a04738b26a","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"CSIRO","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709469878c28a0473bc6ea"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debd","uid":"bIPOz_WiDWR0kK88nqXox3A","uuid":"6c713100-70da-4346-9836-92ba3723e52a","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debd","parentUuid":"6c713100-70da-4346-9836-92ba3723e52a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debd","rootUuid":"6c713100-70da-4346-9836-92ba3723e52a","name":"Instytut Podstaw Informatyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709469878c28a0473bc6ea"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Cube attacks on round-reduced TinyJAMBU","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":null,"issn":"2045-2322","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6256a60d2467f0756e3cb553","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6256a60d2467f0756e3cb556","6256a60d2467f0756e3cb557","6256a60d2467f0756e3cb558","5e709469878c28a0473bc6ea","6256a60d2467f0756e3cb55a"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Lightweight cryptography has recently gained importance as the number of Internet of things (IoT) devices connected to Internet grows. Its main goal is to provide cryptographic algorithms that can be run efficiently in resource-limited environments such as IoT. To meet the challenge, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced the Lightweight Cryptography (LWC) project. One of the finalists of the project is the TinyJAMBU cipher. This work evaluates the security of the cipher. The tool used for the evaluation is the cube attack. We present five distinguishing attacks DA1–DA5 and two key recovery attacks KRA1–KRA2. The first two distinguishing attacks (DA1 and DA2) are launched against the initialisation phase of the cipher. The best result achieved for the attacks is a distinguisher for an 18-bit cube, where the cipher variant consists of the full initialisation phase together with 438 rounds of the encryption phase. The key recovery attacks (KRA1 and KRA2) are also launched against the initialisation phase of the cipher. The best key recovery attack can be applied for a cipher variant that consists of the full initialisation phase together with 428 rounds of the encryption phase. The attacks DA3–DA5 present a collection of distinguishers up to 437 encryption rounds, whose 32-bit cubes are chosen from the plaintext, nonce, or associated data bits. The results are confirmed experimentally. A conclusion from the work is that TinyJAMBU has a better security margin against cube attacks than claimed by the designers."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145854","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6204e9a22467f04219d00aa3","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"6f277079-92a2-4906-a3fd-56acdd571480"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"5317

The states are required to provide educational services to every citizen, as it is an essential tool for creating and enhancing the knowledge and skills of a given society. The aim of this study is to investigate how Ukraine deals with the efficiency of public spending on education, as compared to the other EU countries. Design/Methodology/Approach: As a quantitative tool, a non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been applied. The DEA evaluates the technical efficiency and aims at estimating the relationship between the inputs and outputs of homogeneous objects. It is a powerful, non-parametric method for evaluating the relative efficiency when there are multiple inputs and outputs. The variant of the super-efficiency and non-oriented, slack-based DEA model, under the assumption of variable returns to scale has been used in this study. Findings: The DEA computations showed that Ukraine fared very well, as compared to 22 EU countries, taking second place in the DEA super efficiency ranking (δ = 1.18). This result confirmed that in terms of the technical efficiency of public spending on education, Ukraine was doing much better than many EU member states. It does not mean that the Ukrainian education system should be considered a model one, but only that with relatively low expenditure on education, Ukraine achieves above-average results. Practical Implications: The results of the study help to identify areas of state activity in which Ukraine meets the standards of the European Union countries and justify the need to introduce appropriate aid to support Ukraine in its pursuit of the EU membership. Originality/Value: The study complements the existing knowledge in the literature with evidence-based discussion on the opportunities and threats of Ukraine joining the EU."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145880","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"XXV","pagesFromTo":"1008-1024","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709271878c28a047395bf5","name":"GRAŻYNA","lastName":"KOZUŃ-CIEŚLAK","uuid":"5B3A610EC5DBA54C0EF17CD18839D134908F94E681F44472CCF6771C38E6DA53A8C574406020F84946EEF1A283500BD4464AD1D6D0FAA7B6CE44A2B2F83021AE","orcidId":"0000-0001-5836-2766","documentHash":"75101b9e-8d53-4435-901b-5d54bcf65e0f"}],"doi":"10.35808/ersj/2900"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["lokowanie produktu","marka","serial"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["advertaiment","brand","branded content","product placement","series"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Sposoby wykorzystania serialu przez marki – uwagi wstępne","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a0e8","mniswId":"487056","title":"Culture-Media-Theology","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2081-8971","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"9c932060-a796-4044-96c5-0ae48d623239"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62bd7385409707690bdd8c0b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709337878c28a0473a510c"]},"issue":"50","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Serial to jeden z gatunków, który bywa wykorzystywany przez marki w komunikacji z odbiorcami.

two-year study was focused on the effect of the application of different biomass ash doses on selected soil physical properties, i.e., soil moisture (SM), bulk density (BD), penetration resistance (PR), and soil stability in water measured by the content of readily dispersible clay (RDC), following control and mineral NPK fertilization in the cultivation of winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L. var. napus). A one-factor field experiment conducted on podzolic soil (control, NPK, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 kg K2O·ha−1) showed that the use of biomass combustion ash significantly improved soil moisture at all depths and variants, and especially at a depth of 30–35 cm in the 500 kg·ha−1 variant, i.e., by 2.99% v/v, compared to NPK. In turn, the moisture content in the 30–35 cm layer increased by 3.19% v/v in all variants in both years compared to the control. In 2020 and 2021, bulk density in the 0–5 cm layer treated with a dose of 500 kg·ha−1 exhibited a positive 0.15 and 0.12 Mg·m−3 decrease, respectively, compared to the control. In both years, the BD values in the 30–35 cm layer were reduced by 0.14 and 0.16 Mg·m−3 compared to the control. The PR values decreased in the treatments with doses of 300, 400, and 500 kg·ha−1, especially in 2021. The RDC content was found to decline in both years, i.e., 2020 and 2021, upon the application of even the lowest dose (100 kg·ha−1) in all the analysed layers. The reduction in the RDC content, especially in the 0–5 cm layer, is very important for soil structure stability and to protect the soil environment. This layer is most susceptible to crusting, which results in poor aeration and weak plant emergence during drought and/or periods of excessive moisture. It may also increase surface runoff and intensify soil erosion processes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145896","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62907549409707780b02f82f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"19","number":"11","doi":null,"documentHash":"f0831845-85e5-43c3-bbd4-60af3d32e06f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"6693","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/11/6693/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6164f32875234017e0524992","name":"Miłosz","lastName":"Pastuszczak","uuid":"380D3A421B9F19A5697339B3EC9EBACD48E6A053645FE0ABEC709B14868C4DFCFE0652993177F3199A697F3D4AADF6CFDF62B46DF3848E9729EFC147E6189432","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d3f195f4-b9b4-489d-990f-f2af1e2cd4e0"},{"objectId":"615e5ba875234017e04fdde0","name":"Karol","lastName":"Skrobacz","uuid":"DBEBE9DCEDE80293E36D43A0DA6C4D07ECCD81538FD77A9F75666C65F04F26888726BF21BEE8F95416876944FF5CA4AD540605832891AAC24454CDBB134851EF","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b5ae0817-5c06-4072-a6a3-f25c9f024531"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fb26","name":"Jadwiga","lastName":"Stanek-Tarkowska","uuid":"A28D48AE07D676FD7E25A968588EA1B36A2389B230F5FFFEA0BA0EB4637830C6BFC0A12B212F00F982C210C8CD27C6849FF3DED285F30B213194655CF4C0279F","orcidId":"0000-0003-1664-2625","documentHash":"6638892a-cd69-4f24-be56-b9270d3d99be"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fa68","name":"Ewa Antonina","lastName":"Czyż","uuid":"A87D605096DD48AA607D4FDF1890B25287C6C50311F74AAC51DE51D7AA475C0DB093EFE6D2A64EC46CA050B8B6BF9FCE29F9AF939E23BD65CFC7068FE74F9D1C","orcidId":"0000-0003-3326-7804","documentHash":"01b56091-51dd-446e-848b-d64f28a5b061"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19116693"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Leszek Nowak","Unity of science","Idealisation","Concretisation","Idealisational theory of science"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094cd878c28a0473c410c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"On Leszek Nowak’s Conception of the Unity of Science","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d49","mniswId":"6794","title":"Foundations of Science","doi":null,"issn":"1233-1821","eissn":"1572-8471","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"9611e1ec-197c-4828-85a0-1f2b040be70a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62c1e6da40970751c1a56431","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094cd878c28a0473c410c"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The purpose of this essay is to present and analyse the basic assumptions of Leszek Nowak’s conception of the unity of science. According to Nowak, the unity of science is manifested in the common application of the method of idealisation in scientific research. In accordance with his conception, regardless of the discipline they represent, researchers go through the same stages in building a theory. Two key ones among them are: introducing idealising assumptions into the representation and then their concretisation. In this view, idealisation is the basis of the scientific method, while other cognitive procedures complement it. Nowak’s conception has particular relevance in the context of the dispute between naturalism and anti-naturalism and in the context of the continuing rift between social scientists and natural scientists. It calls into question the anti-naturalist thesis of the ontological uniqueness of social sciences and the resulting methodological consequences. I argue that Nowak’s conception is a cognitively valuable contribution to the contemporary epistemology of science, but it also has weaknesses, mainly due to the limitations of applying the idealisation-concretisation scheme in research practice. For it turns out, as I point out in this essay, that many idealising assumptions are not subject to concretisation and that concretisations do not always condition an increase in the explanatory and/or predictive power of the representations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145898","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6645b21040970708a82b517a","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"29","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"e4671554-3c75-4d5b-9796-dacce7b16f4c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"29","pagesFromTo":"307-324","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10699-022-09843-3","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094cd878c28a0473c410c","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Wajzer","uuid":"F23D6FB7706E896B09066A5997B4A84CBA9ADDD623E2D9A42016C36A4EA3D57FA14EEC280890BBB1A8E8947C20F82AA1A29DD43C72DC5C40598B1F13FF15B607","orcidId":"0000-0002-3108-883X","documentHash":"0db2d750-c295-4b28-9791-44104bf3b04b"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10699-022-09843-3"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["IV-kNN","Interval-valued fuzzy set","Aggregation function","Precedence indicator","Indistinguishability","Similarity measure"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"621605da2467f04ac0da6ac1","doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-95929-6","title":"Uncertainty and Imprecision in Decision Making and Decision Support: New Advances, Challenges, and Perspectives: Selected papers from BOS-2020, held on December 14-15, 2020, and IWIFSGN-2020, held on December 10-11, 2020 in Warsaw, Poland","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"9783030959289","ismn":null,"issn":"2367-3370","url":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-95929-6","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"documentHash":"e8482b47-6830-403b-bc25-71bc77b21086","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb8c0","mniswId":"53500","name":"Springer","documentHash":"a92b641b-75b9-457d-9eb9-1fdc9f4f407b"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","uid":"bLDwoyIU1jG5BHqZ9HzVPQg","uuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","parentUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd22","rootUuid":"2cb4e33a-bb7e-4220-9821-896895006f20","name":"Wyższa Szkoła Informatyki i Zarządzania z siedzibą w Rzeszowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709228878c28a047390d3e"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Influence of Interval-Valued Measures on Classification Methods with Missing Values","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62c3f8b34097077bbdbd7beb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62c3f8b34097077bbdbd7bed","5e709228878c28a047390d3e"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"In this paper, the basic version of the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm has been extended to include similarity and indistinguishability measures that reflect uncertainty.

The aim of this study was to assess the interrelationships of Young’s early maladaptive\r\nschemas with indicators of specific neural emotional systems conceptualized in Panksepp’s theory\r\nin a group of people suffering from depressive disorders. Materials and methods: The Affective\r\nNeuroscience Personality Scales (ANPS) v. 2.4. and J. Young’s Early Maladaptive Schema Questionnaire (YSQ-S3-PL) were used. Ninety (90) individuals aged 18–58, including 45 people treated for\r\ndepression (DD group), were qualified to participate in the experiment. Results: The subjects in\r\nthe DD group scored statistically significantly lower than the subjects from the control group (CG\r\ngroup) on the three ANPS scale domains, namely SEEKING, PLAY, and ANGER. The subjects with\r\ndepressive symptoms scored significantly higher in the YSQ-S3-PL questionnaire on two domains of\r\nearly maladaptive schemas, i.e., “Impaired autonomy and performance” and “Other-directedness”.\r\nRegression analysis results indicate that impairment of the emotional SEEKING system explains\r\nmost of the variability in the following typical domains of depression: “Disconnection and rejection”, “Impaired autonomy and performance”, and “Other-directedness”. For score variability in\r\nthe domain area of “Impaired limits”, the ANGER system was found to be most significant, and the\r\nFEAR system proved the same for “Overvigilance and Inhibition”. Conclusions: 1. Two domains of\r\nearly maladaptive schemas are significant for the onset of depressive symptoms, namely “Impaired\r\nautonomy and performance” and “Other-directedness”, linked to difficulties in engaging in behaviors\r\nto meet one’s own needs. 2. Impairment of the neural emotional SEEKING system most significantly\r\nexplains the variability in depression-typical areas of early maladaptive schemas."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145905","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/13/8062","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65840d964097076c14bfffd7","name":"Jan ","lastName":"Chodkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b1183cc9-fbdb-405c-9b81-3e9461c78237"},{"objectId":"65840d964097076c14bfffd6","name":"Monika","lastName":"Talarowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f6a78118-0b05-4472-8991-ef21e5e6516a"},{"objectId":"5e7092de878c28a04739e72c","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Wysiadecki","uuid":"5B1FCE5846FA6A74895915594FE59A47BA485E50BC785A0AF60966280B738451E4B8E53A823393F8959FD1950DE819174D16FC3FDD125AB7CA60E9E07AFECDAC","orcidId":"0000-0003-3631-2295","documentHash":"ec487ed2-123c-4588-befe-c5a39a7243c9"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19138062"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["military administration, Polish–Lithuania Commonwealth, Sigismund III,Władysław IV, Stanisław Koniecpolski"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","uid":"bpBenp-xOEUyWFZisxulIDw","uuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","parentUuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de21","rootUuid":"7fe045d3-8e37-4760-b8db-075f13a6dce9","name":"Uniwersytet Kardynała Stefana Wyszyńskiego w Warszawie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b03f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Transformation of Polish Military Administration in the First Half of Seventeenth Century – Ideas and its Realization","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"60a6470d2467f011f2df392b","mniswId":null,"title":"Open Military Studies","doi":null,"issn":"2545-3254","eissn":null,"websiteLink":"https://www.degruyter.com/journal/key/OPENMS","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"f3a64c77-3f48-4823-a4f2-4a36491d0852"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"625810ce2467f0168bdb8a52","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b4878c28a04739b03f"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background ‒ The article aims to present some proposal of transformation of Polish military administration in the first half of the seventeenth century and its realization in the form of successful attempt to establish the office of Master of Ordnance (starszy nad armatą) and failed rehearsal to regulate the question of food supply for Polish army stationing on the south-eastern border.\nMethodology ‒ The author has examined manuscript and printed narrative, normative and treasury sources. He compared the results with existing historiography concerning this topic.\nPrincipal findings/Results ‒ Affected by the negative results of war against Sweden between 1621 and 1629, Polish and Lithuanian noble elite agreed to establish new office of Master of Ordnance with new tax to finance artillery on condition that King’s domain would be burdened by it. At the same time, the diet rejected all proposals tended to transform the system of food supply for army defending the south-eastern border of Poland, especially establishing new taxes and officials.\nConclusions/Significances ‒ It was widely expected from the King to prepare the defence of the country from his own sources. Many nobles, especially from western part of the Commonwealth shared the aversion for new taxes dedicated to the defence of the southern border against Tatars’ raids, while inhabitants of Ruthenia or Ukraine were not going to pay new taxes alone and suffer the presence of the troops at the same time. The creation of the office of master of ordnance shows clearly that change in military administration was possible, if the nobility was convinced that reforms were necessary and saw the option to pay for it from King’s coffer, in which case the complaints of the opponents were gladly dismissed. It seems that in the case of army supply too many parliamentarians and their electors did not see the sufficient need for a change and rejected the idea to burden the possessors of King’s estates by new tax."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145906","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6241b0682467f0290d2e2f38","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"2","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"c9c25f8b-b3fd-42bb-ba14-5ee7004ade6a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"2","pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/openms-2020-0117/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092b4878c28a04739b03f","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Gawron","uuid":"DAEF30966C1B17E3DF0129F822B7F55D526DA02AF09F1D9B8A7BB6597878982F682705E2A26B5CC6F1A829BFE4DCC5F71EE24EB068642E52F80A4D34AA9C4474","orcidId":"0000-0003-2834-6735","documentHash":"1d944685-7294-4ab6-be6f-b713c18847db"}],"doi":"10.1515/openms-2020-0117"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","uid":"b-COLbcdAG-k5w4OvZzdVBg","uuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","parentUuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","rootUuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","name":"Narodowy Instytut Onkologii im.

In\naddition, a comparison was made between the velocity curves for forward and backward locomotion. Nine male members\nof the sitting volleyball team participated in the study. Hydraulic and spring manual dynamometers were used to\nmeasure hand grip strength. Movement times were registered for distances of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 10-m with the use of\nthe Smart Speed System photocells. Significant relationships between hand grip strength of the left (rs=-0.78) and right\n(rs=-0.73) hands and the forward movement time over a distance of 1-m were found.

Thus, the main aim of this study is to establish whether the frontal inclination angle (reflecting the mid-sagittal shape of the frontal bone) or the facial retraction angle (describing the grade of facial retraction) is more strongly related to the degree of gracilisation in the supraorbital region in a large sample of geographically diverse modern adult human crania (n = 250). Earlier studies based on small modern Homo sapiens cranial samples (derived from one population) demonstrated a lack of a relationship between the facial angle (reflecting the prognathism of the lower face) and the supraorbital region’s expression. In this study, we also investigated whether there was no relationship between these traits in the analysed large modern human cranial sample. Spearman’s rank correlations and models concerning partial rank correlations (including traits such as sex, geographic origin, size of the facial skeleton and size of the neurocranium to eliminate their influence on the examined relationships) were used. The results indicate a stronger relationship of the degree of gracilisation in the supraorbital region with the frontal inclination angle than with the angle of facial retraction (without the influence of the other considered factors). No significant relationship between supraorbital region expression and prognathism was established. The importance of the obtained results was discussed, including the evolutionary perspective and the occurrence of significant interpopulation differences in the gracilisation of the supraorbital region in modern humans."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145912","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"79","pagesFromTo":"341-360","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1127/anthranz/2022/1497","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"625e6b982467f01c21edfb95","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Biecek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2e5936e8-911d-4e42-8b74-8a2090517961"},{"objectId":"625e6b982467f01c21edfb94","name":"Janusz","lastName":"Piontek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"717c67ef-5564-4498-9da0-a37531556867"},{"objectId":"5e709392878c28a0473ad0c4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kubicka-Kaczmarska","uuid":"FAB13464E23A382062FC99740EBDF7A7BD64729E541738CB321A89FC1B800F0D81632586F2BB240810714BCFA4950CA81CE1639927AAF840445A27D889DE6E91","orcidId":"0000-0002-7844-9225","documentHash":"0309e42d-acb4-4278-9766-6211d4114d4b"},{"objectId":"5e70922f878c28a04739162c","name":"Wioletta","lastName":"Nowaczewska","uuid":"73996457D42F11BAF90E40C9314AAC1824D8D1DAAA71BF32D89FEACB6936EC3B908866DA4605D12F1CB04E87B16B13279612961567A3CE89F2F3F3DAF8A77DC1","orcidId":"0000-0003-1907-554X","documentHash":"6d974a90-5de8-4f52-95ab-f403dbdb5ca1"}],"doi":"10.1127/anthranz/2022/1497"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ESCHERICHIA-COLI","MEMBRANE-PROTEINS","MOLECULAR-BASIS","PHAGE DISPLAY","CRYO-EM","FEATURES","WAAL","SALMONELLA","EXPORT","POLYSACCHARIDE"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","uid":"bKH7OhxrOAmP_ULnBGYKnJQ","uuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","parentUuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de98","rootUuid":"8f90fc81-2eaa-4d08-a7e8-633f3477839c","name":"Instytut Biochemii i Biofizyki Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f47","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2a7b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Structural basis of lipopolysaccharide maturation by the O-antigen ligase.","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478f77","mniswId":"14803","title":"Nature","doi":null,"issn":"0028-0836","eissn":"1476-4687","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"0bf3f025-fb04-4d5a-b97c-71c6b478a995"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"626650d94097071c15d8b48a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["626650d94097071c15d8b48c","626650d94097071c15d8b48d","626650d94097071c15d8b48e","626650d94097071c15d8b48f","626650d94097071c15d8b490","626650d94097071c15d8b491","626650d94097071c15d8b492","626650d94097071c15d8b493","626650d94097071c15d8b494","626650d94097071c15d8b495","626650d94097071c15d8b496","626650d94097071c15d8b497","626650d94097071c15d8b498","626650d94097071c15d8b499","5e7093e4878c28a0473b2a7b","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3f47","626650d94097071c15d8b49b","626650d94097071c15d8b49c","626650d94097071c15d8b49d","626650d94097071c15d8b49e","626650d94097071c15d8b49f","626650d94097071c15d8b4a0","626650d94097071c15d8b4a1"]},"issue":"7905","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria has an external leaflet that is largely composed of lipopolysaccharide, which provides a selective permeation barrier, particularly against antimicrobials'. The final and crucial step in the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide is the addition of a species-dependent O-antigen to the lipid A core oligosaccharide, which is catalysed by the O-antigen ligase WaaL(2). Here we present structures of WaaL from Cupriavidus metallidurans, both in the apo state and in complex with its lipid carrier undecaprenyl pyrophosphate, determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The structures reveal that WaaL comprises 12 transmembrane helices and a predominantly alpha-helical periplasmic region, which we show contains many of the conserved residues that are required for catalysis. We observe a conserved fold within the GT-C family of glycosyltransferases and hypothesize that they have a common mechanism for shuttling the undecaprenyl-based carrier to and from the active site. The structures, combined with genetic, biochemical, bioinformatics and molecular dynamics simulation experiments, offer molecular details on how the ligands come in apposition, and allows us to propose a mechanistic model for catalysis. Together, our work provides a structural basis for lipopolysaccharide maturation in a member of the GT-C superfamily of glycosyltransferases."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145916","journalIssue":{"objectId":"626650d94097071c15d8b4a4","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"604","number":"7905","doi":null,"documentHash":"2ef8ec89-343e-41e6-9c3d-db4aad26f684"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"604","pagesFromTo":"371-376","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04555-x","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"626650d94097071c15d8b4a1","name":"Filippo","lastName":"Mancia","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3293-2200","documentHash":"ebc7c23f-00e0-4618-8cd3-828f1bfd9862"},{"objectId":"626650d94097071c15d8b4a0","name":"Phillip J.","lastName":"Stansfeld","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8800-7669","documentHash":"d8237609-94c7-440e-9659-15ca4e391df6"},{"objectId":"626650d94097071c15d8b49f","name":"M.

For the attitude loop with limited range, the FNN controller parameters were trained offline using flight data, whereas for the position loop, the method based on FNN compensation proportional-integral-derivative (PID) was adopted to tune the system online adaptively. This method not only combined the advantages of fuzzy systems and neural networks but also reduced the amount of calculation for cascade neural network control. Simulations of fixed set point flight and spiral and square trajectory tracking flight were then conducted. The comparison of the results showed that our method had advantages in terms of minimizing overshoot and settling time. Finally, flight experiments were carried out on a DJI Tello quadrotor UAV. The experimental results showed that the proposed controller had good performance in position control."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145920","journalIssue":{"objectId":"621679e52467f04ac0dc71a7","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"5","doi":null,"documentHash":"42b00240-cbb1-44e9-b565-eef7bd2d61c4"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1763-1 - 1763-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.3390/en15051763","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62c3d62c4097075e7cc3b229","name":"Bo","lastName":"Li","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"113bb1b5-747d-4d07-a90f-71bc20c15d00"},{"objectId":"62c3d62c4097075e7cc3b228","name":"Zhen","lastName":"Zhang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e09c53b7-88b9-4e78-83d3-75cf7935f9b3"},{"objectId":"62c3d62c4097075e7cc3b227","name":"Dongdong","lastName":"Chen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"11543899-4ebd-4a8a-bf92-fa52519661fd"},{"objectId":"62c3d62c4097075e7cc3b226","name":"Jinjun","lastName":"Rao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9885d15e-3a60-4078-bf9c-c81e5f95169a"},{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473ae9ee","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Giernacki","uuid":"E67F526F43B5095D739BD7F24A5A23EF0F10003E071B7754FA5DD0FD8471AFB4692621EFA41B7C4CB2481E64220ACC6DFA4201EF58C092FFA4A371DFC4CBC4E1","orcidId":"0000-0003-1747-4010","documentHash":"193489c4-17b2-49f0-8e68-60d9f87d326b"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15051763"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["production costs","Miscanthus giganteus","honeysuckle","energy willow","biomass","agricultural holding"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","uid":"bsTIibl14j-FXDX1as_pUTA","uuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","parentUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","rootUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","name":"Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709289878c28a0473977b3"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Harvesting Technologies and Costs of Biomass Production from Energy Crops Cultivated on Farms in the Małopolska Region","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477aa9","mniswId":"5673","title":"Energies","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1073","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"4a9eea49-41c4-4246-8d84-ecd6284b7f7a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"626647804097071c15d89371","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["657c62974097076c14ab2b97","5e709289878c28a0473977b3","657c62974097076c14ab2b98"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study aimed to assess biomass production costs from perennial energy crops, such\r\nas Miscanthus giganteus, Sida hermaphrodita, and coppiced willow, in selected agricultural holdings.\r\nThis assessment was based on applied technologies for harvesting the biomass of the energy crops\r\nmentioned above. The scope of the study included research on ten farms located in Małopolska\r\nand establishing the possibility of biomass production from selected energy crops in these entities.\r\nBiomass production costs have been estimated using the computer application “Bioalkylation”. The\r\nresult of the research was the answer to the question: what can be the cost range of biomass production from perennial energy crops for the crops Miscanthus giganteus, Sida hermaphrodita, and coppiced willow as the most popular plants? The study shows that production costs depend primarily on the harvesting technology used and the machinery used in the farm. The harvest with rotary mowers, small presses, and windrows was applied regarding Miscanthus giganteus and Sida hermaphrodita. The costs of biomass production were, on average, 424.7 EUR ha−1 for Miscanthus giganteus and 278.9 EUR ha−1 for Sida hermaphrodita. Concerning tonne, this was 37.6 EUR t−1 for Miscanthus giganteus and 30.0 EUR t−1 for Sida hermaphrodita, respectively. In the case of harvesting energy willow, in the form of whole shoots, inefficient and labour-intensive technologies using chainsaws and combustion cutters were applied. The biomass production costs were thus the highest among the assessed plants and amounted, on average, to 612.1 EUR ha−1, which in terms of tonne corresponded to a value of 30.6 EUR. The obtained results and the analysis presented in the paper may help in planning the cultivation of perennial energy crops in order to obtain biomass used for heating purposes on a farm."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145921","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61c2dfca2467f057531dd187","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"35d7af3b-28f3-4dc0-94a1-73c4071fb0ad"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-18, [nr art.] 131","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/1/131","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"657c62974097076c14ab2b98","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Kwaśniewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d7b9b2a2-372d-48e9-8a96-ef1eb90fe772"},{"objectId":"657c62974097076c14ab2b97","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Płonka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"434bbae0-a213-47ed-a513-87e02d01ab4d"},{"objectId":"5e709289878c28a0473977b3","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Mickiewicz","uuid":"96766303F3C95BB01A09424071C7B40E873234ED117EF9C81CC1EB1AF16CEC7A8CC38D724C2D82061EFE055A28265F33F4E368202EA269704474319AF50134F0","orcidId":"0000-0003-1667-1290","documentHash":"a197c0cd-9b57-4d15-9c94-eaa7a67b1a72"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15010131"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["miasto, rondo, organizacja ruchu drogowego, model, symulacja komputerowa, AnyLogic"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62be9217409707383bcb7d4b","doi":null,"title":"Inżynieria transportu","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-66159-77-8","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://wydawnictwo.wsei.eu/sklep/e-book-inzynieria-transportu/","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":null,"translationFromPolish":null,"bookProjectNCN":null,"bookProjectFNP":null,"bookProjectNPHR":null,"bookProjectUE":null},"documentHash":"c0a27e7b-e98d-4890-b78c-1f46af4843f6","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb7fa","mniswId":"26700","name":"Innovatio Press, Wydawnictwo Naukowe","documentHash":"a0f6cb19-ef67-4e15-8682-505285b8d356"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd3a","uid":"bfskHPklsldyd3xD172-Eng","uuid":"f4dd5e8d-c071-4ec2-a048-faf9c2aae76d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd3a","parentUuid":"f4dd5e8d-c071-4ec2-a048-faf9c2aae76d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737dd3a","rootUuid":"f4dd5e8d-c071-4ec2-a048-faf9c2aae76d","name":"Lubelska Akademia WSEI","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70927e878c28a047396b8d"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Symulacyjne badania ruchu drogowego na wybranym rondzie w Lublinie","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62beb404409707383bcc8404","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70927e878c28a047396b8d","62bec4c5409707383bcd3511"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Przedmiotem pracy były badania symulacyjne ruchu na rondzie im. Eugeniusza Kasprzaka w Lublinie. W tym celu najpierw wykonano badania obserwacyjne natężenia ruchu drogowego w wybranych jego punktach. Wynikało z nich, że znaczące potoki zróżnicowanych pojazdów istotnie zakłócają płynność i właściwą koordynację ruchu, co może sprawiać kierowcom problemy bezpiecznego przejazdu. Potwierdziły to też dane archiwalne Urzędu Miejskiego w Lublinie, z których wynika że dochodziło tu do licznych kolizji drogowych. Do tego znajdujące się tu przejścia\ndla pieszych spowalniają ten ruch i generują powstawanie korków. Dlatego autorzy\npostawili sobie jako cel pracy opracowanie symulacyjnego modelu ruchu na tym\nrondzie, jego badania oraz wskazanie sposobu poprawy funkcjonowania. Do realizacji\ntego zadania wykorzystano program symulacyjny AnyLogic, w którym utworzono\nmodel tego ronda i wykonano badania dynamiczne ruchu pojazdów.

The proposed research is devoted to the disclosure of a number of interrelated\nconcepts and terms, due to which the issue of communicative and educational value of «color reflection» is identified by the author as a functional link between educational systems. Nevertheless, the ambiguity of color is manifested in the consistent ascent to the educational application of its remarkable potential, primarily in the reflexive form of successful art communication and more complex subspecies – «visually-reflexive» form of demonstration of markers of color. Thus, the presented theoretical and practical mechanism of using the flexible specifics of «color reflection» as a communicative link of art educational\nmodulation reveals inconspicuous features of the internal dynamics of setting different age audiences to check «mind-contact line» capture the proposed educational information.\nPurpose. The aim of this article is revealed in the balanced plane of the three-dimensional search\nfor the artistic and communicative education value of «color reflection», the study of which has received\nvery limited attention. The practical narrative of «color reflection» is worked out on the functional part of\nthe information and visual context of interdisciplinary, but relevant to this issue of scientific approaches.\nMethods. A powerful and productive method of functional analysis was chosen for this study, the\nadvantages of which to a large extent quite effectively reveal a significant methodological scope of the systemic purpose of the communicative-educational direction of active mental action «color reflection».\nResults. It is worth emphasizing that the presented study establishes promising provisions for the\nuse of educational capacities of «color reflection» as a motivational, visual final evaluation denominator. It\nis important to emphasize that the concomitant role of communicative factors of reflexive manifestations of the main pronunciation of colors is a constant accompanying and necessary mechanism of natural values of color possibilities, which must be used professionally in the educational process.\nSuch an educational process is most successfully reflected in the analysis of the types of «color\nreflection». For example, artistic manifestations of the reflective influence of colors are involved in creative\nactivities at the individual level of self-awareness of a deep sense of harmony, which is successfully\ndemonstrated on her paintings by Ukrainian artist Olga Hrytsenko. At the same time, the typed features of creative activity extend to the form of «author's reflection», which reflects at the level of color personal reflective visions of a complex type of communication.\nOriginality. The communicative-educational approach to the study and recognition of the meanings\nof «color reflection» has hardly been studied, so the published approach contains a significant part of the\ninnovative search for conceptual-terminological and methodological components of this study. To this\nposition should be added the fact that a detailed analysis of the primary communicative component of\n«color reflection» is based on the basic inferences made by the famous and outstanding German poet and famous figure J. Goethe. In Ukraine, Goethe's work «Color theory» was almost not involved not only in coordinating the determinant part of such a conceptual structure as «color reflection», but also in general, on the cornerstones of the subject part of the science of color.\nConclusions. Thus, the importance of the silent treatment of colors not only through works of art,\nbut also through the everyday world of things around indicates the diversity of habitual reflexivity, as a\ndeep lever of inner elaboration of exciting thoughts. Communication in the educational plan at the level of\ndialogue uses the possibilities of colors as a visual marker of correlation of student audience with a specific situational field of information, which causes the advantages of the primary physiological plan, which J. Goethe argued. At the scientific level, the comparison of a significant research contribution to color studies allows in comparison with educational and pedagogical functionality to develop methodological mechanisms for successful immersion in the reflective worldviews of barely strengthened youth in order not only to intuitively imagine the reaction to the proposed teaching content communication with the inclusion of «color reflection» in the arsenal of the pedagogical process of quality artistic communication. The article attempts to find a variety of «color reflection», complex forms of which demonstrate the priority motivation of the communicative and educational component."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145930","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62bd5dfc409707690bdc8017","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"48","number":"1","doi":"10.31376/2410-0897-2022-1-48-10-197","documentHash":"e6a22df0-9baa-484b-90f9-9e41ad3a211f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"48","pagesFromTo":"132-139","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[{"languageCode":"ukr","title":"«КОЛІРНА РЕФЛЕКСІЯ» В ПРОЦЕСІ ХУДОЖНЬО-КОМУНІКАТИВНОГО ВИХОВАННЯ"}],"publicUri":"http://dx.doi.org/10.31376/2410-0897-2022-1-48-132-139","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62bd93aa409707690bdecb1e","name":"Liubov","lastName":"Ilnytska","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2163-7751","documentHash":"da7b1be0-dfc4-4e06-beb1-c2b0aaaa3602"}],"doi":"10.31376/2410-0897-2022-1-48-132-139"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19","economic security","multidimensional comparative analyzes","financial crisis in the United States"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

In particular, they can be applied to form Pickering emulsions and foams for “green” applications in the cosmetics, pharmaceutical industry or food processing. We demonstrated that carboxylated cellulose nanocrystals enhance foamability and foam stability when mixed with cationic surfactant ethyl lauroyl arginate (LAE), having superior properties over sulfated cellulose nanocrystals (sCNC) concerning surfactant concentration range and foam volume. Mixtures of LAE and cCNC were characterized for their hydrodynamic diameter, zeta potential, surface tension and surface rheological properties. The influence of electrolytes, namely, sodium chloride, guanidine hydrochloride and sodium salicylate, and the addition of concentrated urea to LAE-cCNC mixtures on foamability and foam stability were investigated. Electrolytes in the concentration of 5 mM showed a moderate effect on foam stability. In contrast, spectacular foam collapse was detected after adding concentrated urea. The preliminary rheological data from the pendant drop oscillations revealed low elastic modulus upon urea addition and the loss modulus that increased with the frequency, which suggested a viscous interfacial layer."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145940","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6246a7e72467f0368b88ee8e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"6","doi":"","documentHash":"2be49b75-b403-4ebc-9d4c-176fbaba8196"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"2797","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/6/2797/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709482878c28a0473bebf3","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Czakaj","uuid":"0ABCA81B2146D6F42201FB35BD76E37D91528E9AC8A5D8420F9493226B2B59BE9468B35A6341A8AE95757AB412053C6DDFCACCADFF7488BFC429BF8DD452DDEA","orcidId":"0000-0002-7751-8938","documentHash":"43695cb4-5046-4e13-aaad-1f64e05ebf03"},{"objectId":"5e70928f878c28a047397f13","name":"Marcel","lastName":"Krzan","uuid":"3E046C2A05AB671B5501E4692D2E65E20398979E01E90AA723C63859A410C51C37BBE693FB9FE3E1A8DA8BA4ADB5B0A7D7C5C0FB8DFF7901BBE360D62C7F8AC3","orcidId":"0000-0002-7469-3247","documentHash":"25063526-8d9a-43e1-9c4b-3dd95ae207e7"},{"objectId":"5e70928b878c28a04739797a","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Warszyński","uuid":"6BAC8688F822693F425E29EEB99AD0F6340B7C6E28BA9D856949F99FCDB056C45147BF78A12CEA5B0F271214B761A0D38D7BCB3C99AE5D0DAA42A6C4AB47B80B","orcidId":"0000-0001-5449-9060","documentHash":"593fdd00-6e34-4655-816d-d43ad7031f43"}],"doi":"10.3390/app12062797"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["#MeToo","system of theatre organization in Germany;","democratisation of institutions","power relations","work ethic"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","uid":"b0fTcFrzUTdyVrXHObZy7yg","uuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092eb878c28a04739f36c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Jaka jest przyszłość niemieckiego teatru?","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479d9b","mniswId":"200087","title":"DIDASKALIA.

Ten resistance-trained males with at least three-year experience in resistance training (22.2 ± 1.9 years, 88.7 ± 11.2 kg, 179.5 ± 4.1 cm, bench press one-repetition maximum (1RM) = 127.25 ± 25.86 kg) performed the flat bench press exercise under two conditions at selected loads (85% and 100% of 1RM assessed without the SS). Peak sEMG amplitude of triceps brachii, pectoralis major, and anterior deltoid was recorded for the dominant and the non-dominant side of the body during each attempt. The comparison between the dominant and the non-dominant side was carried out using the limb symmetry index (LSI(%) = (2*(XR - XL)/(XR + XL))*100%) where XR = values of the right side and XL = values of the left side. There was a main effect of condition (p = 0.004; η2 = 0.64) and the load (p = 0.004; η2 = 0.63) for the triceps brachii LSI in parallel with a main effect of condition (p = 0.003; η2 = 0.42) for the anterior deltoid LSI. Post hoc analysis for the main effect of condition showed significant differences in the LSI between the CONT and SS conditions for the triceps brachii (p = 0.003; 1.10 vs. -8.78) as well as for the anterior deltoid muscles (p = 0.03; 12.91 vs. 9.23). The results indicate that the assistance of the Sling shot significantly affects the sEMG activity pattern on both the dominant and non-dominant sides of the body while influencing inter-limb asymmetries"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145944","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"83","pagesFromTo":"223-234","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.johk.pl/files/10078-83-2022-v83-2022-22.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"603094589543c7410626f7f9","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Wojdała","uuid":"D5E1B6C4E00CA61EE04C6121073D794AA039B3DDE5FF4EF52F8158315010898B82033C8F8711B25CC838187004A226511A2A30B6A648E8CE26740EF787DC6006","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"acead991-ea09-4870-b411-e37032391581"},{"objectId":"5ebed67f752340254fc4072a","name":"Robert","lastName":"Trybulski","uuid":"7F1695B5ACF4DD1C25F93FE28CBF40517CBD6CD3957A17F90CC3FF6ED0CA3B5CD4A0B798C6801F78A31E0E0F30210CC08E4944D878CFE7090CDD299208B37236","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5edef524-13f4-4073-b089-247622ca7a73"},{"objectId":"5e70946c878c28a0473bcb2b","name":"Marta","lastName":"Bichowska- Pawęska","uuid":"BFA965772EBC887724FEBD9D2BC7E92B2A70A46AB17647E333CAEB31D74C7A57E3F2CFC3B20F95C1FE58878B2DB33F0E13C6482F51C81EE1757389609B47E208","orcidId":"0000-0001-6327-9879","documentHash":"e88b20d0-3b89-4009-8b22-b1c694f1d878"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473a9e44","name":"Michał","lastName":"Krzysztofik","uuid":"09B2064AE9D43D6879AE4A67450FA0D08BAB72E52E4AF7A9A3DB21E8CD0D9CFC18B7AC9B5AAE86C4E27C827622E08E19B2338B2B52FF2D1BCD34B4FF452320EC","orcidId":"0000-0003-2797-8431","documentHash":"eb9c811f-81a8-4d79-9155-53e811b9c5f8"}],"doi":"10.2478/hukin-2022-0084"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bovine","leukemia","virus","BLV","proviral","load","phylogenetic","analysis","genetic","variability","Kazakhstan"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","uid":"buPqRqCoVBU8HDf2hb2xRAg","uuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","parentUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737defe","rootUuid":"9e9249c9-34a1-4fc1-ac1e-588eefb412c3","name":"Państwowy Instytut Weterynaryjny - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709342878c28a0473a5cad","5e709342878c28a0473a5d36","61d510b87523401fc110f98b"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Molecular Characterization of Bovine Leukemia Virus with the Evidence of a New Genotype Circulating in Cattle from Kazakhstan","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5c878c28514547ceac","mniswId":"15767","title":"Pathogens","doi":null,"issn":"2076-0817","eissn":"2076-0817","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"0aee51de-2ae0-4570-a31e-61056cf6d598"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6259285e2467f03744819ddb","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6259285e2467f03744819ddd","5e709342878c28a0473a5d36","6259285e2467f03744819ddf","6259285e2467f03744819de0","61d510b87523401fc110f98b","6259285e2467f03744819de2","6259285e2467f03744819de3","5e709342878c28a0473a5cad"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is a retrovirus that causes enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL) and has worldwide distribution.

Furthermore, we conducted the phylogenetic and molecular analysis of 41 BLV env-gp51 gene sequences from BLV infected cattle. Phylogenetic analysis showed the affiliation of sequences to two already known genotypes G4 and G7 and also to a new genotype, classified as genotype G12. In addition, a multivariate method was employed for analysis of the association between proviral load and different variables such as the geographical location of the herd, cattle breeds, age of animals, and the presence of particular BLV genotypes.

It is not clear how this mechanism could effectively operate in hot, low-density plasma, where the electrical resistivity is extremely low.\n\nAims. We show that non-stationarity, a common factor in plasma turbulence (e.g., in the interstellar medium caused by random supernova explosions), allows inducing a strong large-scale electromotive force (EMF) by the plasma flow and significantly enhances the dynamo effect.\n\nMethods. We adopted the simplest approximation in which plasma evolution is modelled with a set of incompressible magnetohydrodynamic equations with a random, Gaussian, and non-stationary forcing to explicitly demonstrate the role of non-stationarity in the large-scale dynamo process. The EMF was calculated analytically in the limit of large magnetic Prandtl numbers (low magnetic diffusion in comparison with plasma viscosity) and strong magnetic fields for the non-stationary turbulence and the standard diffusive mechanism.\n\nResults. We show that the EMF induced by the effects of non-stationarity can typically be expected to dominate the dynamo mechanism (over the diffusive phase shift generation) by several orders of magnitude. This is confirmed by the explicit calculation in two example cases for the interstellar medium in the Milky Way galaxy and hot accretion disks such as those of active galactic nuclei."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145953","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6268ef5f409707015984cd0e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"660","doi":null,"documentHash":"7d49d82d-e115-4e70-9bea-dd519eca775a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"660","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2022/04/aa42488-21/aa42488-21.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396b20","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Mizerski","uuid":"701B5D7D7AA53237569495D5318BA2683F6DF807391F02B976FEF27D347B20C6E279FAE1B0847BD7F143C52FAEB1B8D66FFAF9137A85F82AF6B7352A818AD837","orcidId":"0000-0003-0106-675X","documentHash":"fc47a420-7054-45f8-8d61-5c0327b8bf67"}],"doi":"10.1051/0004-6361/202142488"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ESO","control performance assessment","tuning","extended state observer","neural networks"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709445878c28a0473b9558","62bed1a84097077f6df09836"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Tuning of extended state observer with neural network-based control performance assessment","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c285145477b9c","mniswId":"6153","title":"European Journal of Control","doi":null,"issn":"0947-3580","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"2e6c92d8-47a9-4f63-818b-54ca5405852c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62bed1a84097077f6df0982f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709445878c28a0473b9558","62bed1a84097077f6df09835","62bed1a84097077f6df09836"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The extended state observer (ESO) is an inherent element of robust observer-based control systems that allows one to estimate the impact of disturbance on system dynamics. Proper tuning of ESO parameters is necessary to ensure a good quality of estimated quantities and impacts the overall performance of the robust control structure. In this paper, we propose a neural network (NN) based tuning procedure that allows the prioritization between selected quality criteria such as the control and observation errors and the specified features of the control signal. The designed NN provides an accurate assessment of the control system performance and returns a set of ESO parameters that delivers a near-optimal solution in terms of the user-defined cost function. The proposed tuning procedure, using an estimated state from the single closed-loop experiment, produces near-optimal ESO gains within

In this paper, we propose a Multicriteria Data-Driven Decision Support (MDDDS) model for a patient who explores medical database to make a decision on selecting the best medical professional specializing in his or her disease. Optimization of the decision relies on the data-driven collection about the particular disease’s stage and suitability to the efficiency of the medicament recommended by the doctor. Comparison of the medical service quality is based on popularity of the medicament prescribed by other medical professionals and other patients comments suffering from the disease and being ordered the same medicament. Efficiency of the approach proposed has a pragmatic nature such that it can be applied by medical clinics, hospitals and other healthcare institutions as well. We trust that the data collected by our MDDDS model is found of the greatest importance by the patients while seeking a reliable and high-quality healthcare service. Our findings based on the real data simulation indicate that implementation of HMM and Viterbi’s algorithm gives a very promising results in optimization of the patient’s decision process as regardless of the data including the disease entities, the number of the medical service providers, we achieve ambiguous outcome, which in each case allows the patient to make a reliable and firm

In this paper, we detail the main strategies and functionalities of CYRUS, the RoboCup 2021 2D Soccer Simulation League champions. The new functionalities presented and discussed in this work are (i) Multi Action Dribble, (ii) Pass Prediction and (iii) Marking Decision. The Multi Action Dribbling strategy enabled CYRUS to succeed more often and to be safer when dribbling actions were performed during a game. The Pass Prediction enhanced our gameplay by predicting our teammate’s passing behavior, anticipating and making our agents collaborate better towards scoring goals. Finally, the Marking Decision addressed the multi-agent matching problem to improve CYRUS defensive strategy by finding an optimal solution to mark opponents’ players."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145974","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":"6268036140970720eb52f198","mniswId":null,"startDate":"2021-06-22","endDate":"2021-06-28","fullName":"24th RoboCup International Symposium","shortName":"RoboCup 2021","city":"online","country":"US","website":"https://2021.robocup.org/symposium","isEdition":true,"documentHash":"65edd83f-824e-49c5-9456-0faa8b68282e"},"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"340–351","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-98682-7_28","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62680a0940970720eb530117","name":"Amílcar","lastName":"Soares Júnior","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-5957-3805","documentHash":"2225a142-3ba1-4ac7-8ea4-7642c9db8d76"},{"objectId":"62680a0940970720eb530115","name":"Arad","lastName":"Firouzkouhi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"03ccdcdb-353f-450c-a228-2146fadca320"},{"objectId":"62680a0940970720eb530114","name":"Mahtab","lastName":"Sarvmaili","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c968096b-c661-4975-bbdb-8d4e5944b775"},{"objectId":"62680a0940970720eb530113","name":"Aref","lastName":"Sayareh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a535d3ff-84af-4d60-8eec-9fef36ee3520"},{"objectId":"62680a0940970720eb530112","name":"Omid","lastName":"Amini","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"931f6fbd-78e1-4165-8c2d-8ba885d023b3"},{"objectId":"62680a0940970720eb530111","name":"Nader","lastName":"Zare","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dde0fae4-21ca-46bc-8468-0e3ba3e4d669"},{"objectId":"5e709344878c28a0473a5f77","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Matwin","uuid":"0A766745E1F9F7DDBCDCAE3FA91ED5EE107CA1A64D4FEDF9ED0C09F9C9FBC3BFA3E57ACCA3E158753B818C49CB598ED54C86CC510725CFAF5A42C8A7F5BA58A1","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"07f9075f-604b-40b5-9de2-85c9b5e714da"}],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-98682-7_28"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["bimetallic bars","ESS LM method","explosive cladding","steel resistant to corrosion","surfacing method TIG"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Metallographic Analysis of Bimetallic Bars Produced from Feedstock Mill of the Surfacing Method TIG, of the Method ESS LM and Explosive Cladding Received","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547e187","mniswId":"23872","title":"Journal of Chemical Technology and Metallurgy","doi":null,"issn":"1314-7471","eissn":"1314-3859","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"2f5cc3be-46e3-4b42-a92b-ce60b9803201"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62c422854097077bbdbeff49","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709202878c28a04738e848","5e709202878c28a04738e811"]},"issue":"Iss.2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A considerable increase in interest in using corrosion resistant steel clad ribbed bars in the construction industry has been observed in recent years. This is owing to the particular properties of these bars, namely high durability and rigidity, good mechanical properties, and high corrosion resistance. Bimetallic ribbed bars can be manufactured in medium-size and small shape mills from previously produced bimetallic feedstock. The manufacture of ribbed bars with an outer layer of corrosion-resistant steel is a complicated process that involves numerous technological problems. The most important of which includes the obtaining of bimetallic feedstock with the adequate strength of the bond in the region of junction between the core and the clad layer, and assuring the even plastic flow of both bimetallic layers during the process of rolling in the elongating and forming passes in the shape Mill. Failure to meet these conditions may result in a delamination of the bimetallic band during rolling or the formation of other defects, which will disqualify the finished bimetallic bar. In the paper the metallographic analysis of bimetallic ribbed bars steel-steel resistant to corrosion produced from bimetallic feedstock mill of the surfacing method TIG, the method ESS LM received and explosive cladding of bimetallic stock.

The introduction of the paper analyzed the existing submunition dispenser and cluster bomblet solutions. The key aspects of the paper include the calculation of the effective blast radius of the designed cluster bomblet and the analysis of the trajectory of a bomb dropped from horizontal flight. A bombing analysis was carried out, taking into account the influence of the atmosphere and drop control conditions on bombing accuracy and proper fragment coverage of the bombed area. \nA preliminary concept of the airdrop control system was developed, which could enable effective bombing with a series of cluster bomblets.

This article is part of a wider study on adults with autism. The main assumption of the series of studies is concerned with listening to and hearing the voices of those most affected - those with a diagnosis of autism. The collected material, which is based on own experiences of people with autism, allows us to present views on the role of the teacher - the creator of the educational space. Thus far, we have presented the experiences and comments of teachers and therapists; now we can listen to the voices of not only students and parents but people with autism. The research problem was to present own educational experiences described by autistic people – in the presented paper on pedeutology .  The aim of the study was to find out about the opinions on education held by people with autism.\nMethod. This study employed the netnographic method. The study involved a group of people with a diagnosis of autism and meeting in closed online for a, who agreed to participate. \nResults. Reaching out to a large group made it possible to analyse the results of the statements given by ranking and creating meaning bundles.\nConclusions. The first conclusion is that there is a difference in approach to the teaching/learning process. This is due to symptoms that are specific to autism, as well as the different educational and therapeutic approaches. The second is related to the use of punishment that, in addition to the forbidden ones (such as physical), often evolve into psychological and social punishments, such as isolation, marginalisation, or a lack of interest. It seems to be equally important to draw attention to the ineffective attempts to impose (often referred to as violating) recognised normative forms of functioning, as well as the treatment of these people as not fully intellectually capable , which is not a condition (intellectual disability can co-occur in a few - cf. Casanova et al. 2000)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058145984","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62bd46e2409707690bdbcb4f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"21","number":"11","doi":"10.35765/mjse.2022.1121.12","documentHash":"efafef6c-c850-4f0d-9c00-496cbcf66c63"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"235-249","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092c0878c28a04739bfc3","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Błeszyński","uuid":"EBC6CBB4187716429FD3A88A10D15FDF0A7CED1F07C73C7A38FAC051B115031815E3916DE3B7FB85A6B91D1C7066096F1689CC37DB2E589BCB6F85B34FE02ADE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6553-0550","documentHash":"76f735c9-be4a-4f36-81c9-0064e4de1cc2"}],"doi":"10.35765/mjse.2022.1121.12"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62b7043540970741aba65c5b","doi":null,"title":"Dylematy współczesnej informatyki ekonomicznej.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess how different drying methods and periods of storage affect the bioactive properties of the herb Salvia hispanica and to compare it with other species of sage (Salvia officinalis L. and Salvia sclarea L.). In fresh herbs, directly after drying (freeze-drying, natural drying, and drying at 30, 40, and 50 °C), and after storage (3, 6, and 12 months), the following analyses were performed: content of total carotenoids and total polyphenols, polyphenol profile (including 25 compounds), and antioxidant activity. Additionally, the basic chemical compositions of the herbs were analyzed. To the best of our knowledge, the content of total carotenoids and the quantitative polyphenol profile in Salvia hispanica and Salvia sclarea were evaluated for the first time. The obtained results showed that the barely investigated herb Salvia hispanica is rich in polyphenolic compounds and shows high antioxidant activity. In all the tested species, rosmarinic acid was the most abundant polyphenolic compound.

The first is use of existing living and inanimate natural resources resulting from need to maintain life expectancy. In the second area, focus on its protection and care for its duration. Therefore, it should be emphasized that associating innovations with them is extremely important in modern ecology. Striving to create new eco-friendly solutions of an eco-innovative nature both in the sphere of its social acceptance and in utilitarian dimension.\nOriginality/value: the article enriches, and at the same time develops, knowledge and\ndiscussion in the field of defining eco-innovations – and their impact on the lives of\ncommunities and individuals.

During that period, 816 individuals of the Coccinellidae belonging to 10 species were collected in apple orchards and 670 specimens (8 species) in their neighbourhood. In the orchards with IPM, more beetles were recorded in their surroundings than in the orchards; presumably, use of chemical treatments in the IPM orchards negatively affected the species richness and the number of coccinellids while in the surroundings the presence of varied vegetation (shrubs, trees and herbaceous plants) contributed to the increase in the species richness of the Coccinellidae. On the ecological site, however, more ladybird beetles were collected in the orchard than in its neighbourhood. The species which dominated the coccinellid assemblages in the orchards and their surroundings were Coccinella septempunctata L. and Harmonia axyridis (Pall). The research showed that in the case of coccinellids, the impact of the vegetation surrounding the orchards on the presence of ladybugs in the orchard was smaller than the management system."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058146001","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c404fb4097077bbdbe0b38","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"31","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"1c372204-ded0-4c10-9f42-2bdf08a69a1a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"31","pagesFromTo":"2895-2903","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.pjoes.com/pdf-143764-75694","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62c404fb4097077bbdbe0b36","name":"Edyta","lastName":"Wilk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a6de4473-362f-46e6-9338-a1ff88506562"},{"objectId":"5e70930a878c28a0473a19f4","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Wojciechowicz-Żytko","uuid":"F4A31FDD508141F11141C37EC53665061400FF6FC2E60DF923B6D702963B7953395548E850AF77F24577FA16287BD2A39E126C0D2AA06C26E497630718485269","orcidId":"0000-0001-8137-3113","documentHash":"66904c01-c7b4-4475-a81c-13114e0dd22d"}],"doi":"10.15244/pjoes/143764"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet Warszawski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5ecf31d37523400cab488aec"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The second life of Jewish belongings–Jewish personal objects and their afterlives in the Polish and Belarusian post-Holocaust shtetls","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5ebffe3fad49b31ccecead66","mniswId":null,"title":"Holocaust Studies","doi":null,"issn":"1750-4902","eissn":"2048-4887","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"56bbab28-2f94-44cb-baf8-a37aeef98537"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62569f772467f0756e3c8bf2","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62569f772467f0756e3c8bf4","5ecf31d37523400cab488aec"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058146002","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62569f772467f0756e3c8bf7","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"48d2de50-dcd5-4211-8143-5c0a0b43f9f9"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17504902.2022.2047292","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62569f772467f0756e3c8bf4","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Waligórska","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7856-0831","documentHash":"55cb2000-b336-49b8-b2e1-e3ff5bbe7866"},{"objectId":"5ecf31d37523400cab488aec","name":"Ina","lastName":"Sorkina","uuid":"4C1CB6688CA6717E870210993588A9B18FF75F68058C60F60434E6D2E698AD85CA664308D1F661FE119DE9B9A88CDA252569654924846F487DDC6E5D969D6B7D","orcidId":"0000-0001-6648-1343","documentHash":"e543d911-9930-4c23-ae83-f7327977c52c"}],"doi":"10.1080/17504902.2022.2047292"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["culture","cultural activity","museum","associations"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","uid":"b1CAWFlsJj7f886P9BWoCUQ","uuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","parentUuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","rootUuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","name":"Uniwersytet Radomski im.

gulf of centuries separates the Byzantine Empire from the academic field of Byzantine studies. This book offers a new approach to the history of Byzantine scholarship, focusing on the attraction that Byzantium held for Early Modern Europeans and challenging the stereotype that they dismissed the Byzantine Empire as an object of contempt.\n\nThe authors in this book focus on how and why the Byzantine past was used in Early Modern Europe: to diagnose cultural decline, to excavate the beliefs and practices of early Christians, to defend absolutism or denounce tyranny, and to write strategic ethnography against the Ottomans. By tracing Byzantium’s profound impact on everything from politics to painting, this book shows that the empire and its legacy remained relevant to generations of Western writers, artists, statesmen, and intellectuals as they grappled with the most pressing issues of their day.\n\nRefuting reductive narratives of absence or progress, this book shows how “Byzantium” underwent multiple overlapping and often discordant reinventions before the institutionalization of “Byzantine studies” as an academic discipline. As this book suggests, it was precisely Byzantium’s ambiguity—as both Greek and Roman, ancient and medieval, familiar and foreign—that made it such a vibrant and vital part of the Early Modern European imagination."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058146010","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":"Extravagantes","translation":false,"publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb756","mniswId":"1200","name":"Harvard University Press","documentHash":"21c7c5c8-42f6-48dc-beba-e4236c99ac84"},"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780884024842","numberInSeries":"2","authors":[],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["computational fluid dynamics","constant rate of kinetic energy change","ejector-diffusor","single-stage ejector","two-stage ejector"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Numerical Analysis on a Constant Rate of Kinetic Energy Change Based a Two-Stage Ejector-Diffuser System","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479847","mniswId":"18976","title":"Strojniski Vestnik/Journal of Mechanical Engineering","doi":null,"issn":"0039-2480","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"a3db967d-2d02-4a15-9a12-9f452c8b03be"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-24","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62c2ac9940970721cb8ecbb8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62c2ac9940970721cb8ecbb9","62c2ac9940970721cb8ecbba","62c2ac9940970721cb8ecbbb","62c2ac9940970721cb8ecbbc","62c2ac9940970721cb8ecbbd","5e709200878c28a04738e744"]},"issue":"Iss.5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Supersonic ejector energy flow devices are extensively used in various applications, such as pumping, mixing, compression, etc. The conventional single-stage ejector (SSE) design approaches are inefficient for modelling an efficient ejector because of their inefficiency in minimizing mixing losses in the mixing chamber, thermodynamic shock in constant area diffuser, and utilization of redundant discharged momentum at the exit of the first stage. The physics-based single-stage ejector design has better solutions because it minimizes irreversibility due to thermodynamic shocks. The present study utilizes the constant rate of a kinetic energy change physics-based approach to design a two-stage ejector (TSE) for water vapour.

The study was conducted in three countries namely, Poland, Thailand, and Pakistan. The study was considered significant considering the advancements in technology that have had an unprecedented impact on education, and the need to conduct learning online due to the COVID-19 to pandemics. The research adopted the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) and extended it by including other variables including culture, social distancing, and absorptive capacity. The study was conducted using the quantitative methodology, where the data was collected using a structured questionnaire. The data was collected from a sample from each of the three countries, and sample sizes were 455, 490, and 513 for Poland, Thailand, and Pakistan respectively. The data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and multi-group SEM analysis. The results of the study indicated that effort expectancy and culture significantly and positively influenced behavioral intention to use MOOCs in all three countries. As well, absorptive capacity is mediated significantly by performance expectancy and effort expectancy. Facilitating conditions have a significant influence on MOOCs in both Thailand and Pakistan. Social influence has a significant influence on behavioral intention to use MOOCs in Thailand, hedonic motivation and price value have a significant influence on behavioral intention to use MOOCs in Poland, and the habit has a significant factor in Pakistan. The keys aspects influencing behavioral intention to Use MOOCs were different in Poland, Thailand, and Pakistan, in various factors which are performance expectancy, social distancing, price value, facilitating conditions, and social influence. The research recommended that it is important to evaluate the situation and prevailing conditions of the concerned country, before implementing the MOOCs and the associated online learning practices."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058146014","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"Vol.17","pagesFromTo":"brak","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0262037","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62c405f74097077bbdbe0eff","name":"Wornchanok","lastName":"CHAIYASOONTHORN","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f9e5db84-51a9-4790-af17-fa5bb97b1fbf"},{"objectId":"62c405f74097077bbdbe0efc","name":"Bilal","lastName":"KHALID","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"81eef416-9ee5-48ac-86f3-3353da18b956"},{"objectId":"62c405f74097077bbdbe0efb","name":"Singha","lastName":"CHAVEESUK","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"32c359ae-3adb-4f0d-ab71-bc236603223e"},{"objectId":"5e709247878c28a047392ea5","name":"Eugenia","lastName":"Rostańska","uuid":"EEE7801D5685A90726869B2E8348D7D8E3D3F77BC263325419A28ED917DDD10A872C7BFC16F29D82068C1257EE464D5512F2EF21CD07AE7B55BA35A4B9C0DB1A","orcidId":"0000-0002-3118-7766","documentHash":"9d401415-a191-4ba4-8864-b1b326a0936c"},{"objectId":"5e709203878c28a04738e908","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Bsoul-Kopowska","uuid":"3ECCD7C7381C01B446B7D01BE46020E17E6342C0D6A13B9D76C8704F7044493F25238C167149CAB2C7F4E46BDD762D457970582135F0F4B75D0D813EC0BEF2CF","orcidId":"0000-0002-6167-6827","documentHash":"3db720d3-9f40-4ad5-b98d-28de0b4c5e9f"}],"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0262037"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b1878c28a04739acee"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"From the Sharkovskii theorem to periodic orbits for the Rössler system","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478614","mniswId":"10787","title":"Journal of Differential Equations","doi":null,"issn":"0022-0396","eissn":"1090-2732","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ea9abf59-ec8a-4328-9a02-1aa90dd78792"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6268eb38409707015984907a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b1878c28a04739acee","64cd2f724097077ac1dd43ec"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058146016","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"314","pagesFromTo":"733-751","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/291321","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64cd2f724097077ac1dd43ec","name":"Anna","lastName":"Gierzkiewicz-Pieniążek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8e6fcb2b-45f7-412c-aea7-d3b20b16f1f5"},{"objectId":"5e7092b1878c28a04739acee","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Zgliczyński","uuid":"8521BAF2D1684397474131C14246E5A2F08E95C0E14DC2DC309ECAB3AFF4D1A118DEB9AE70387A9934DCBAE4264E3BDA4673FF3879588F4CA09208C4A6EC6828","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8853abe0-eca3-4a81-93b3-ccced825b0df"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.jde.2022.01.022"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Bezpieczeństwo publiczne","COVID-19","Ochrona ludności","Zapobieganie","Zarządzanie kryzysowe","Zdrowie publiczne","Polska"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"625817fe2467f01c216bb8ba","doi":null,"title":"Epidemiologia i bezpieczeństwo CBRN.

It has been shown that more than 50% of tumors are connected with mutations in the Tp53 gene. These mutations cause a disturbance in cellular response to stress, and eventually, cancer development. Apart from the full-length p53, at least twelve isoforms of p53 have been characterized. They are able to modulate p53 activity under stress conditions. In 2020, almost a half of million people around the world were diagnosed with renal cancer. One genetic disturbance which is linked to the most common type of kidney cancer, renal cell carcinoma, RCC, occurs from mutations in the VHL gene. Recent data has revealed that the VHL protein is needed to fully activate p53. Disturbance of the interplay between p53 and VHL seems to explain the lack of efficient response to chemotherapy in RCC. Moreover, it has been observed that changes in the expression of p53 isoforms are associated with different stages of RCC and overall survival. Thus, herein, an attempt was made to answer the question whether p53 and its isoforms are important factors in the development of RCC on the one hand, and in positive response to anti-RCC therapy on the other hand."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058146019","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62b47b3b4097070c593d21ac","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"10","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"588010f5-cb81-42d9-b148-4d4e739af959"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"1330","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9059/10/6/1330/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70934a878c28a0473a69aa","name":"Agata","lastName":"Świątkowska","uuid":"E4064476F6C31079993B2966369FD6D512165C5A8879538A53FFF3DFC0F82EC13A15A608D85A3FE5A4230CD60056B1BB0F1E41F12A68C6026108BE450E2E6241","orcidId":"0000-0002-3100-2952","documentHash":"b89b1dfe-40ec-4cfe-a467-78b822d706a5"}],"doi":"10.3390/biomedicines10061330"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["łańcuch dostaw","finanse łańcucha dostaw","logistyka"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["supply chain","supply chain finances","logistics"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62bd4c914097077f6de68818","doi":"10.18559/978-83-8211-106-4","title":"Logistykacja gospodarki światowej","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-8211-105-7","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://doi.org/10.18559/978-83-8211-106-4","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"ec0443f0-cef5-45d3-8512-a376853afe00","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb8ea","mniswId":"58500","name":"Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Poznaniu","documentHash":"a860e639-06c8-4c3f-9951-db4a63c2c41c"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Finanse łańcucha dostaw w obliczu wyzwań współczesnej logistyki","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62bd4ca44097077f6de68910","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709341878c28a0473a5af9","602e46389543c7410626efff"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The cognitive goal of the article is to systematize the knowledge of supply\r\nchain finance (SCF) management in the context of contemporary trends and challenges\r\nin logistics.

Both strains produce the cyclic peptide gramicidin S (GS) that was described as the main weapon inhibiting some gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and fungus-like organisms along with the production of biosurfactant and hemolysis activities. However, the contribution of the cyclic peptide gramicidin S (GS) to the biocontrol ability of A. migulanus has never been studied experimentally. In this paper, using a mutant of the A. migulanus Nagano strain (E1 mutant) impaired in GS biosynthesis we evaluated the contribution of GS in the biocontrol potential of A. migulanus against Phytophthora spp. The two strains of A. migulanus, Nagano and NCTC 7096, were tested in a pilot study for the inhibition of the growth of 13 Phytophthora species in dual culture assays. A. migulanus Nagano was significantly more inhibitory than NCTC 7096 to all species. Additionally, using apple infection assays, P. rosacearum MKDF-148 and P. cryptogea E2 were shown to be the most aggressive on apple fruits displaying clear infection halos. Therefore, the three A. migulanus strains, Nagano, NCTC 7096, and E1, were used in apple infection experiments to check their effect on infection ability of these two Phytophthora species. Treatment with A. migulanus Nagano significantly reduced the severity of symptoms in apple fruits compared with NCTC 7096. A. migulanus E1 mutant showed total loss of biocontrol ability suggesting that GS is a major actor in the biocontrol ability of A. migulanus Nagano strain"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058146029","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6253eae62467f02e69a1f384","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"c4dc61e0-0f21-4903-8235-719529ce7e64"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"535","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/13/4/535/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62669ff24097071c15db0d63","name":"Lassaȃd","lastName":"Belbahri","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7040-4500","documentHash":"61ad800d-bcad-4db8-8672-e5e32324baa3"},{"objectId":"62669ff24097071c15db0d61","name":"Marcel","lastName":"Jaspars","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2426-6028","documentHash":"1470ed40-970f-4048-adfe-d80d4ab452c3"},{"objectId":"62669ff24097071c15db0d60","name":"Allaoua","lastName":"Silini","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"69c30ed4-3068-4fdd-8044-9a5b2cbe8af0"},{"objectId":"62669ff24097071c15db0d5f","name":"Hafsa","lastName":"Cherif-Silini","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8609-5028","documentHash":"0419a0d2-850e-43a5-bf58-0b808f13d296"},{"objectId":"62669ff24097071c15db0d5e","name":"Ali Chenari","lastName":"Bouket","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8421-1758","documentHash":"c81eb9f6-df69-4767-909f-6c9ceefb9222"},{"objectId":"62669ff24097071c15db0d5d","name":"Faizah N.","lastName":"Alenezi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c082b22b-8523-48bd-9e36-6b0e96f8007b"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923ce","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Oszako","uuid":"BF6BD270F2C938EBEB10D624284BEE223F03544B4ED31ECAB8E1DCD2523D6F8044590B7101A419A95F790996F9556A466EE5F4BF4B270DD50FEC876C0B126AF2","orcidId":"0000-0003-4688-2582","documentHash":"fe1be6f9-a1a5-46d1-8df0-56ef5c343194"}],"doi":"10.3390/f13040535"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709470878c28a0473bd05c","5e709312878c28a0473a24da","5e7093b7878c28a0473afa74"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Volumetric incorporation of NV diamond emitters in nanostructured F2 glass magneto-optical fiber probes","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477541","mniswId":"3245","title":"Carbon","doi":null,"issn":"0008-6223","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"bb2e7d77-fce5-40cc-ad63-be4285867052"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-04-29","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6267ca7d40970720eb5200aa","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709457878c28a0473bad86","64cd2f364097077ac1dd3c0f","5e7093b7878c28a0473afa74","5e709430878c28a0473b7e1d","5e709358878c28a0473a7a75","5e709312878c28a0473a24da","64cd2f364097077ac1dd3c12","64cd2f364097077ac1dd3c13","64cd2f364097077ac1dd3c14","5e709470878c28a0473bd05c","64cd2f364097077ac1dd3c15","64cd2f364097077ac1dd3c16","5e709359878c28a0473a7cf2"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Integration of optically active diamond particles with glass fibers is a powerful method of scaling diamond's magnetic sensing functionality. We propose a novel approach for the integration of diamond particles containing nitrogen-vacancy centers directly into the fiber core. The core is fabricated by stacking the preform from 790 soft glass canes, drawn from a single rod dip-coated with submicron diamond particles suspended in isopropyl alcohol. This enables manual control over the distribution of nanoscale features, here – the diamond particles across the optical fiber core. We verify this by mapping the diamond distribution in the core using confocal microscopy. The particles are separated longitudinally by 12–29 μm, while in the transverse plane a separation of approximately 1.5–2.2 μm is observed, corresponding to the individual cane diameter in the final fiber, and without significant agglomeration. The fiber's magnetic sensitivity is confirmed in optically detected magnetic resonance recorded with a coiled, 60-cm-long fiber sample with readout contrast of 1.3% limited by microwave antenna coverage. Moreover, magnetic-field dependence of the NV─ fluorescence intensity is demonstrated in the absence of microwaves, allowing magnetometric applications with a large (from 0 to 35 mT) B-field dynamic

salts and azole derivatives are well known for their antimicrobial properties. Recent evidence has demonstrated also their cytotoxic and genotoxic potential toward both normal and cancer cells. Still, little is known about the action of complexes of azoles with silver(I) salts. Thus, the goal of the study was to compare the chemical, cytotoxic and antimicrobial properties of metronidazole complexes with silver(I) nitrate and silver(I) sulfate to metronidazole and pure silver(I) salts. We synthetized a novel complex, [Ag(MTZ)2]2SO4, and confirmed its chemical structure and properties using 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and X-Ray, IR and elemental analysis. To establish the stability of complexes [Ag(MTZ)2NO3] and [Ag(MTZ)2]2SO4, they were exposed to daylight and UV-A rays and were visually assessed. Their cytotoxicity toward human cancer cells (HepG2, Caco-2) and mice normal fibroblasts (Balb/c 3T3 clone A31) was determined by MTT, NRU, TPC and LDH assays. The micro-dilution broth method was used to evaluate their antimicrobial properties against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. A biofilm eradication study was also performed using the crystal violet method and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The photo-stability of the complexes was higher than silver(I) salts. In human cancer cells, [Ag(MTZ)2]2SO4 was more cytotoxic than Ag2SO4 and, in turn, AgNO3 was more cytotoxic than [Ag(MTZ)2NO3]. For Balb/c 3T3 cells, Ag2SO4 was more cytotoxic than [Ag(MTZ)2]2SO4, while the cytotoxicity of AgNO3 and [Ag(MTZ)2NO3] was similar. Metronidazole in the tested concentration range was non-cytotoxic for both normal and cancer cells. The complexes showed increased bioactivity against aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria when compared to metronidazole. For the majority of the tested bacterial strains, the silver(I) salts and complexes showed a higher antibacterial activity than MTZ; however, some bacterial strains presented the reverse effect. Our results showed that silver(I) complexes present higher photo-stability, cytotoxicity and antimicrobial activity in comparison to MTZ and, to a certain extent, to silver(I) salts"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058146048","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-24","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/14/4/900","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"658d6a4a4097076c1458215e","name":"Justyn","lastName":"Ochocki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"38f4657d-932f-4a9e-81f1-0e90ac6978c6"},{"objectId":"658d6a4a4097076c1458215d","name":"Posyniak","lastName":"Andrzej","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"97d771b8-8137-4bc4-b67f-60ef3ed5cc61"},{"objectId":"658d6a4a4097076c1458215c","name":"Michał","lastName":"Wójcik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1bd9bdae-0e76-46b3-86cd-cfa318400791"},{"objectId":"658d6a4a4097076c1458215b","name":"Agata","lastName":"Przekora","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7557d1be-add7-408f-8220-ce306f34ef68"},{"objectId":"658d6a4a4097076c1458215a","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Korona-Głowniak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7ab0de30-3594-41df-afaa-f19aba2c1771"},{"objectId":"658d6a4a4097076c14582159","name":"Joachim","lastName":"Kusz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0606054b-acf3-401c-bf54-cd18c0c45261"},{"objectId":"658d6a4a4097076c14582158","name":"Lilianna","lastName":"Chęcińska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"17e4c26d-261b-4134-9ff5-bf7bf16bd283"},{"objectId":"658d6a4a4097076c14582157","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Radko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bf3390a8-5742-4407-965c-8024d52f959d"},{"objectId":"5e7094f3878c28a0473c7c4d","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Żyro","uuid":"774B151E10CF40C596BEAFBA3D2B1A1634B5DB980451C68EE7952746E3161E96B5F8A2195B8F66D96A68105B73820C2CE3D16886ECD6A4E44D0EE4808A4E1AA6","orcidId":"0000-0003-1594-8366","documentHash":"a83509fe-81ea-4339-93db-2e598bb19c1b"},{"objectId":"5e7092e0878c28a04739e972","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Śliwińska","uuid":"D8D01F037053CFA0190C7A839E2EF5263819D247D48B26E6427F11967883C145997E9EA449FC0E6B2D6B0EFD3E8A84224A94FD54F931152DEE777AB7003E0EC2","orcidId":"0000-0002-6864-0704","documentHash":"0a869404-4605-4316-8910-a307a29ccb28"}],"doi":"10.3390/cancers14040900"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["szkoła lwowsko-warszawska","Ingarden","psychologia","fenomenologia"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["phenomenology","psychology","Ingarden","Lvov-Warsaw school"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62bc33a34097070fda669a1e","doi":null,"title":"Intuition and Analysis.

It regains its original size, shape, and volume. In this paper, the deflection arrow was analysed based on the field tests conducted, and then the modulus of elasticity of natural shrub vegetation was determined. Measurements were made at different plant heights. Analysis was carried out at different growing periods to estimate the variation of plant elasticity with growth, development, and season. The results confirm the loss of flexibility during winter for all the shrubs analysed. Based on the measurements carried out, the elastic modulus E of the shoots was estimated. The average modulus of elasticity ranged from about 2100 to about 4000 MPa and showed high variability, reaching even µ = 50%, both within a given shrub and depending on the measurement season. The results presented here indicate a high natural variability of mechanical parameters even within the same

this paper, we have performed thorough analyses of volumetric and viscosity data for six oils. The volumetric data has been inspected by using two different equations of state, drawing a special attention to the intersection of the isothermal pressure dependences of the thermal volume expansivity, which were earlier reported for various materials in the liquid state. Each fluid is unique with respect to the other oils’ relative composition, with those being either a pure liquid (Sebacate), or mineral oil with a proprietary blend of branched paraffins, napthalenes and aromatic molecules (Normafluid) or are undisclosed composition of mineral oil (MIN-H01 and MIN-H02) or are composed of fatty acid methyl esters (soybean biodiesel and rapeseed biodiesel). We have confirmed that the intersection points evaluated for different isotherms constitute a nonlinear curve for a given tested oil, and not any single point or straight line. Consequently, we have determined the temperature–pressure areas important from the application viewpoint, within which the thermal volume expansivity behaves differently, either increasing or decreasing with increasing temperature at a constant pressure. In the viscosity analysis, the parametrizations of the temperature–pressure dependences of specific volume based on the equations of state enabled to employ the density scaling idea in its simplest form of a power law of densityγ/temperature, where  related to an effective intermolecular potential is independent of thermodynamic conditions to a good approximation, which was successfully validated by various materials mainly in the supercooled liquid state, but also in the normal liquid and liquid crystal states in some cases. We have found that the scaling law giving prediction benefits relied on a linkage between macroscopic measurement quantities and effective molecular interactions is obeyed by the viscosity data of examined oils. Then, based on the prediction capabilities of the density scaling criterion, we have successfully explored the inflection points observed in some isothermal pressure dependences of viscosity measured for the oils in the temperature–pressure ranges that differ from those earlier reported for other materials. This intriguing finding observed in case of the experimental data for only some examined oils yields not only cognitive benefits, but it is also expected to exert an effect for instance on mechanical properties of the materials. Thus, our comparative discussion about the intersection and inflection curves provide a useful contribution to the further investigations of these thermodynamic and dynamic issues and other physicochemical properties of oils, which require gaining a better insight."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058146056","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"353","pagesFromTo":"118728-1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167732222002653","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602f51789543c7410626f333","name":"Bernadeta","lastName":"Jasiok","uuid":"2E26177A7EFEEAD478360BE99A1441C5C0685A5818327DE1F07A38A2B97D3881C78C7FB1A97A08C4E8A9CE3AAE831B5CC4A1C1F9ABBBB0692E792C6B826CEC33","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"95c8fc3b-1fde-4b67-b04c-bb9d59cd93a3"},{"objectId":"5e7094e7878c28a0473c6789","name":"Alexander","lastName":"Lowe","uuid":"829D77510A137F0582CF04DDA3C51D2EA0051B572C1968E03BE630F04FCFDBF4C7023796D33CE311836845446C20BB6504127241A62128E328DC1C016CFC2FFC","orcidId":"0000-0002-9700-5873","documentHash":"5e7c1a21-271c-4573-af85-f26d1fa8c1fb"},{"objectId":"5e7092ec878c28a04739f44b","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Chorążewski","uuid":"608E0020DDB96BDB1CFFC0484C2BF49E01CF682E442C8F2046CAA67EBEBA5F86FFD1F7FB95A4919742A06AF7840A621C547F82E02CD2803C65F367BA44855548","orcidId":"0000-0002-8912-9024","documentHash":"ba3177d7-c142-4d41-b1c1-dabb1b88289c"},{"objectId":"5e7092ea878c28a04739f149","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Grzybowski","uuid":"579EBA9D1736B53DD63795D7C3D91C76652A0B75D4E814EB6EA6B7291947650FB51F67786A678294D92BDE18C5A77CAC3B9F9F7E66D13D5F743A7078B56D8CCE","orcidId":"0000-0002-5258-6926","documentHash":"6d62a503-35e7-4d87-9946-fceaefa2e0e1"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.molliq.2022.118728"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["composites","mechanical fasteners","plain rivets","blind threaded rivets"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","uid":"byIMgWh_9RUyyDH3dMzNDyw","uuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna im.

This genus has been the subject of numerous cytological and cytometric studies and have shown enormous variation in terms of genome size, ploidy level, and even the basic chromosome number. The basic chromosome numbers are 5 or 7, but 10, 11, and 12 have been recorded as well. Most narcissus cultivars are euploid tetraploids. There are also numerous triploids. Some cultivars are aneuploid such as tetraploids or triploids, with missing chromosomes or possessing additional chromosomes. Due to their very complex parentage, cultivars have various numbers of chromosomes not found in the species. In this publication, we present a study on the genome size and assessment of the likely ploidy level of 38 cultivars and breeding clones of Narcissus in relation to their selected morphological traits and information on their parental forms. For the first time, 12 Polish cultivars and breeding clones of narcissus were the subject of such an evaluation. Perianth diameter, leaf length, and width were evaluated and rated with notes according to the descriptor of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants. Stomatal density and stomata length were measured using light microscopy. Analysis of genome size was carried out using flow cytometry. For three selected genotypes, the chromosome number was counted. Our results lead to the general conclusion that the morphological traits studied and nuclear DNA content can be useful for determining the possible ploidy level of narcissi. The information on the origin and parental forms of narcissi can be helpful in determining the ploidy level of narcissi.

Compared to target visual tracking using a single camera, cooperative tracking based on multiple cameras has advantages including wider visual field, higher tracking reliability, higher precision of target positioning and higher possibility of multiple-target visual tracking. With vast ocean and sea surfaces, it is a challenge using multiple cameras to work together to achieve specific target tracking and detection, and it will have a wide range of application prospects. According to the characteristics of sea-surface moving targets and visual images, this study proposed and designed a sea-surface moving-target visual detection and tracking system with a multi-camera cooperation approach. In the system, the technologies of moving target detection, tracking, and matching are studied, and the strategy to coordinate multi-camera cooperation is proposed. The comprehensive experiments of cooperative sea-surface moving-target visual tracking show that the method used in this study has improved performance compared with contrapositive methods, and the proposed system can meet the needs of multi-camera cooperative visual tracking of moving targets on the sea surface."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058146086","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61dc529f2467f07650dd624d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"22","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"508a05c7-31cf-4dee-ac37-d4b6989c5081"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"693-1 - 693-23","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/2/693","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62c3cbbc4097075e7cc3af6f","name":"Qiuyu","lastName":"Zhang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"98275601-4899-47ea-98ad-c839ed1ab655"},{"objectId":"62c3cbbc4097075e7cc3af6e","name":"Zhen","lastName":"Zhang","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9ae22780-8fce-44ba-97fb-ff1af46e130e"},{"objectId":"62c3cbbc4097075e7cc3af6d","name":"Mei","lastName":"Liu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e0309670-ab3d-4f4a-bf2f-9bf44637232f"},{"objectId":"62c3cbbc4097075e7cc3af6c","name":"Jingtao","lastName":"Lei","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"82d3be98-3303-430e-a347-6905bc9917e5"},{"objectId":"62c3cbbc4097075e7cc3af6b","name":"Jinbo","lastName":"Chen","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8341c08e-b4c4-4072-98d9-f0d0413f487b"},{"objectId":"62c3cbbc4097075e7cc3af6a","name":"Jinjun","lastName":"Rao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a5491c98-0c77-4d59-a415-3cb119f0c85c"},{"objectId":"62c3cbbc4097075e7cc3af69","name":"Kai","lastName":"Xu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"982bbbc1-31c2-4f4a-b69c-52d45e531ea6"},{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473ae9ee","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Giernacki","uuid":"E67F526F43B5095D739BD7F24A5A23EF0F10003E071B7754FA5DD0FD8471AFB4692621EFA41B7C4CB2481E64220ACC6DFA4201EF58C092FFA4A371DFC4CBC4E1","orcidId":"0000-0003-1747-4010","documentHash":"193489c4-17b2-49f0-8e68-60d9f87d326b"}],"doi":"10.3390/s22020693"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["RCF","zużycie zmęczeniowe","topografia powierzchni","obręcz koła tramwajowego"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093a9878c28a0473aea38","5e7093a9878c28a0473aeaee","5e7092fc878c28a0473a0856"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Investigations of the complex wear mechanisms of tram wheel tyres","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479aac","mniswId":"20248","title":"Wear","doi":null,"issn":"0043-1648","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"f7512842-05d9-4bcf-8dda-2788ff43cbbb"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62c2a54a4097077f6d7db4a3","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092fc878c28a0473a0856","5e7093a9878c28a0473aeaee","5e7093a9878c28a0473aea38","62c2a54a4097077f6d7db4a8"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Nowadays, the dynamic development of public transport is seen as one of the main ways to reduce exhaust emissions and, consequently, the greenhouse effect. One of the fastest-growing branches in this area is the building and evolution of tram lines. One of the conditions for the success of this transport method is the durability and reliability of the rail vehicles used. From a tribological point of view, friction behaviour and potential wear processes in the tram’s rail-wheel contact is of special importance. Therefore, taking into account the specific structure of the tram wheel, the main goal of this study was to identify and characterise the wear mechanisms on the two areas most exposed: the running surface and the top surface of tyre flange. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the surface topography of the worn surfaces of the tyres, with regard to the wear processes, was carried out. This part of the study included the measurements and analysis of the height parameters of the roughness and Abbott-Firestone curves (with their characteristics), both in accordance with the ISO 25178 standard. On this basis, it was found which parameters best characterise the evolution of the surface topography from the initial state to the worn one. As a consequence, those that have the potential to control the state of the tram wheels’ tyres (mainly the level of wear) during operation are proposed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058146090","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c2a54a4097077f6d7db4c3","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"500-501","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"09aadf8e-9a6e-4940-bd70-8ad8ac726084"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"500-501","pagesFromTo":"204354-1 - 204354-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043164822001181?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62c2a54a4097077f6d7db4a8","name":"Thomas G.","lastName":"Mathia","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bb7a64b1-3f98-4411-a3e9-502770641aca"},{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473aeaee","name":"Marta","lastName":"Paczkowska","uuid":"5AF0B8C7008FDB4610E54D6D0AC373AAA094D1FFD133BE6FA1630E4A0CD2DCE1D17E2DD14FA92E523753F24EB40E10F63AC24A69E83CC7FBB6CF30A735B21C97","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8ec3584e-9736-4f7b-96eb-7d4177f0cc1d"},{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473aea38","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Gapiński","uuid":"1175EBD7C7703D645FF2E02A8643056969E615C7C560CA6C573B6DED0F784C1E1B95E13D967B80B668B5A40C11B7AFD0BC069730E366C69D4968243591AA30B4","orcidId":"0000-0003-0206-1942","documentHash":"bcf6e2bd-ef6e-4b00-8eb0-c1eee0eec383"},{"objectId":"5e7092fc878c28a0473a0856","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Wojciechowski","uuid":"447D5943B4A166F7583D259E0E811963845D5B59E990CBAB8CB31AEC76C13FB6B888716E0A98141792871F6E460FD04725F1BF34172748A8F203F79AEEF16547","orcidId":"0000-0003-3682-6368","documentHash":"516cdff2-36f1-4c29-9596-57235f9b9666"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.wear.2022.204354"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-3-030-95946-3","book":null,"typeName":"Tom pokonferencyjny","affiliations":[],"type":"PROCEEDINGS","title":"Information Systems : 18th European, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern Conference, EMCIS 2021, Virtual Event, December 8–9, 2021 : Proceedings","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62c28b424097077f6d7cf824","editors":[{"objectId":"62c28b424097077f6d7cf826","name":"Marinos","lastName":"Themistocleous","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"605917cb-a3d1-4297-b4c9-b8454ba71949"},{"objectId":"62c28b424097077f6d7cf825","name":"Maria","lastName":"Papadaki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"99effa6e-0962-46b9-ab06-5a62690a7292"}],"conferenceSeries":{"objectId":null,"mniswId":null,"startDate":null,"endDate":null,"fullName":"European, Mediterranean and Middle Eastern Conference on Information Systems","shortName":"EMCIS","city":null,"country":null,"website":null,"isEdition":false,"documentHash":"7dcf9632-19ea-47a6-9c1a-dad76501c572"},"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["62c28b424097077f6d7cf825","62c28b424097077f6d7cf826"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058146091","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":{"objectId":null,"mniswId":null,"startDate":"2021-12-08","endDate":"2021-12-09","fullName":"18th European, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern Conference EMCIS 2021","shortName":"EMCIS 2021","city":"Poznań","country":"PL","website":"https://sin.put.poznan.pl/conferences/details/conference/18th-european--mediterranean--and-middle-eastern-conference-emcis-2021","isEdition":false,"documentHash":"e5638b8d-38ea-4811-a8ed-fe8b8220b6e0"},"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":"Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing","translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-95947-0","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[],"doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-95947-0"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Corona formation of nanoparticles","Electrokintic measurements","Deposition of particles","Gold nanoparticles","Kinetics of particle deposition","Mechanisms of deposition","Modeling of particle deposition","Nanoparticle deposition","Nanoparticle layers","Quartz microbalance measurements","Silica nanoparticles","Silver particle deposition","Silver particle release kinetics","Virus attachement","Zeta potential of nanoparticles"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","uid":"bUTj-4n-6geiAzfKPaPBNhg","uuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","parentUuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737deb1","rootUuid":"bbdc19a0-7611-48bc-85b5-5072e791573a","name":"Instytut Katalizy i Fizykochemii Powierzchni im.

In the first part theoretical aspects were briefly discussed, comprising limiting analytical solutions for the linear transport under flow and diffusion. Methods of the deposition kinetics analysis for non-linear regimes affected by surface blocking were also considered. Characteristic monolayer formation times under diffusion and flow for the nanoparticle size range were calculated. In the second part illustrative experimental results obtained for micro- and nanoparticles were discussed. Deposition at planar substrates was analyzed with emphasis focused on the stability of layers and the release kinetics of silver particles. Applicability of the quartz microbalance measurements (QCM) for quantitative studies of nanoparticle deposition kinetic was also discussed. Except for noble metal and polymer particles, representative results for virus deposition at abiotic surfaces were analyzed. Final part of the review was devoted to nanoparticle corona formation at polymer carrier particles investigated by combination of the concentration depletion, AFM, SEM and the in situ electrokinetic method. It is argued that the results obtained for colloid particles can be used as reliable reference systems for interpretation of protein and other bioparticle deposition, confirming the thesis that simple is universal."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058146093","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6242f1672467f04b0b325966","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"302","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"d2b04e7b-225f-4ef1-b339-8611801ffff7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"302","pagesFromTo":"102630","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S000186862200032X?httpAccept=text/xml","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709445878c28a0473b96c6","name":"Marta","lastName":"Sadowska","uuid":"0A0B04F8A6798C4929DB963DE7ABE868E6C8D3618D5305D8FA4FE3645E31F295240018A9DE0392A28922D6F4E9FD473902FDE5DCF01EECF6467DFEDF0D0B8D86","orcidId":"0000-0001-5482-5989","documentHash":"5b8b4e0d-e30c-45aa-905f-29292f33e117"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7cbb","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Nattich-Rak","uuid":"412E799370D3763334795BDCAFCBA78D24297BC250D9F3C0A358E69CDCD15E68F3194DC1781EBA45235447DBB3E14A3F0224134EBB453EFA7F8A79F653C30823","orcidId":"0000-0002-5025-8611","documentHash":"b6e669d9-b10e-4731-a128-a9dd6da14895"},{"objectId":"5e7092ae878c28a04739a793","name":"Maria","lastName":"Morga","uuid":"CE3AF419BCD086ADFD16470740AD91885DAA4419CA8F4399F14701E2E646CE972F50AD19DD268E4B0002DF158F6D8957A9E17AFE3F380D9DCF2615205350DE6C","orcidId":"0000-0002-4913-9244","documentHash":"d9b9e094-169e-4be4-ad08-b52785d5de17"},{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a047397706","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Adamczyk","uuid":"330B9F334C71A0EF7D62785B69146CDFB249D0685FD02844290D7D23F4B27656B7207D74973DCB96CA036DD7280FA202B1078C8B032D881CBBBC20666FA003AA","orcidId":"0000-0002-8358-3656","documentHash":"abc53ecd-2607-4ec3-b04b-286b5df2b9d3"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.cis.2022.102630"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-83-67074-51-3","book":null,"typeName":"Książka","affiliations":[],"type":"BOOK","title":"CERKIEW  PW.

electricity is treated as commodity that shouldbe delivered from a distributor to a consumer with a certain quality. The powerquality is defined by the set of measures with specific limit values. One of the basic measures is the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), which allows to assess the level of the voltage distortion. The measurement of THD ratio should be carried out in accordance with thenormative specification. It is assumed that this requirement is met by class A power quality analyzers. Currently, measures are taken tomonitor power quality in a large number of measurement points with the use of smart energy meters that are part of the Advanced MeteringInfrastructure (AMI). The paper presents the problem of THD ratio measurement by AMI meters if voltage fluctuations occur.

In MDD/MDE, recent precision nomothetic psychiatry studies discovered a new endophenotype class, namely major dysmood disorder (MDMD), a new pathway phenotype, namely reoccurrence of illness (ROI), and a new model of the phenome of depression. The aim of the present study is to examine the association between ROI, the phenome of depression, and MDMD’s features and IRS, CIRS, macrophages (M1), T helper (Th)1, Th2, Th17, T regulatory, and growth factor (GF) profiles. Culture supernatants of unstimulated and stimulated (5 μg/mL of PHA and 25 μg/mL of LPS) diluted whole blood of 30 MDD/MDE patients and 20 controls were assayed for cytokines/GF using the LUMINEX assay. MDMD was characterized by increased M1, Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg, IRS, CIRS, neurotoxicity, and GF profiles. Factor analysis shows that ROI features and immune-GF profiles may be combined into a new pathway phenotype (an extracted latent vector). ROI, lifetime and recent suicidal behaviors, and severity of depression are significantly associated with immunotoxicity and GF profiles. Around 80.0% of the variance in the phenome is predicted by ROI and neurotoxicity or the IRS/CIRS ratio. The molecular pathways underpinning ROI-associated sensitization of immune/growth networks are transmembrane receptor protein kinase-triggered STAT protein phosphorylation, TLR/NF-κB, JAK-STAT, and the main proliferation/survival PI3K/Akt/RAS/MAPK pathway. In conclusion, MDMD’s heightened immune responses are the consequence of ROI-associated sensitization combined with immunostimulatory triggers."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058146102","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"1-23","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/11/7/1183","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6595629b4097076c1490a31a","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Basta-Kaim","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"41340c76-572b-43f2-bf0c-28cb2a4e8750"},{"objectId":"6595629b4097076c1490a319","name":"Atapol","lastName":"Sughondhabirom","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2a9c547c-5e25-4844-8b1a-43eadc4b3280"},{"objectId":"6595629b4097076c1490a318","name":"Siriwan","lastName":"Klinchanhom","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c0fa664a-82f4-4011-8330-a070750f12e1"},{"objectId":"6595629b4097076c1490a317","name":"Pimpayao","lastName":"Sodsai","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"663a9705-c1f4-4017-851d-14b21766b924"},{"objectId":"6595629b4097076c1490a316","name":"Ketsupar","lastName":"Jirakran","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"77464fd5-ba31-4760-acb2-8376fc203199"},{"objectId":"6595629b4097076c1490a315","name":"Muanpetch","lastName":"Rachayon","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2a5fc120-9aee-44db-8457-32f1a439ee47"},{"objectId":"6595629b4097076c1490a314","name":"Michael","lastName":"Maes","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d01fe095-d1c1-494f-a1fc-ff268f92f27b"},{"objectId":"5e7092e1878c28a04739e9cd","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Gałecki","uuid":"44E15E4F93E7FCC17A85DCD3500BF4936275EA18132D5D5E216C448E418CF6D82E23EE09BB7894B0824F767D4F653D402BDF513419437223BDBFB99050C3B125","orcidId":"0000-0003-2447-5636","documentHash":"98981206-92e8-402e-812d-7cd82f395d05"}],"doi":"10.3390/cells11071183"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["prawo kanoniczne zasada kontradyktoryjności proces o stwierdzenie nieważności małżeństwa Mitis Iudex Dominus Iesus reforma papieża Franciszka"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["canon law, principle of contradiction, process to declare nullity of marriage, Mitis  Iudex  Dominus  Iesus, Pope Francis’s reform"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709195878c28a04737f560","uid":"b-QhPpCcUJetk1AqkjBdSkQ","uuid":"07208b1f-4d34-483a-a884-05ac93b6fcec","parentId":"5e709195878c28a04737f560","parentUuid":"07208b1f-4d34-483a-a884-05ac93b6fcec","rootId":"5e709195878c28a04737f560","rootUuid":"07208b1f-4d34-483a-a884-05ac93b6fcec","name":"Uniwersytet Papieski Jana Pawła II w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70931e878c28a0473a3232"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Implementation of the Principle of Contradiction in the Canons of the Code of Canon Law Following the Reform by Pope Francis of the Process to Declare Nullity of Marriage (Procedural Parties and Their Equality)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d51878c285145479cdc","mniswId":"485055","title":"Biuletyn Stowarzyszenia Absolwentów i Przyjaciół Wydziału Prawa Katolickiego Uniwersytetu Lubelskiego","doi":null,"issn":"1896-8406","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"2da5fb66-78a2-4f9e-a4ab-46c879caf1ec"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-06-14","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62bc188f4097070fda6545f5","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e70931e878c28a0473a3232"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Artykuł porusza problematykę wpływu listu apostolskiego motu proprio Mitis Iudex Dominus Iesus papieża Franciszka na zakres obowiązywania zasady kontradyktoryjności w sprawach o stwierdzenie nieważności małżeństwa.

This cross-sectional study was conducted using the Abbreviated World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire (WHOQoL-BREF), Fertility Quality of Life tool (FertiQoL) and an author-constructed questionnaire. The study included 1200 men treated for infertility without the use of assisted reproductive technology (non-ART), intrauterine insemination (IUI) and in vitro fertilization (IVF). The control group consisted of 100 healthy men with confirmed fertility. The quality of life assessed by the WHOQoL-BREF questionnaire was significantly lower in study groups in the Environmental domain, compared to the control group (p = 0.009). Statistically significant differences were found in the case of FertiQoL subscales: Emotional, Mind-Body, Relational, and Treatment Environment, depending on applied treatment.

Crowd counting is still attracting research interest due to its potential usefulness for traffic and pedestrian stream monitoring and analysis. This study considered a specific case of crowd counting, namely, counting based on low-altitude aerial images collected by an unmanned aerial vehicle. We evaluated a range of neural network architectures to find ones appropriate for on-board image processing using edge computing devices while minimising the loss in performance. Through experiments on a range of neural network architectures, we also showed that the input image resolution significantly impacts the prediction quality and should be considered an important factor before going for a more complex neural network model to improve accuracy. Moreover, by extending a state-of-the-art benchmark with more in-depth testing, we showed that larger models might be prone to overfitting because of the relative scarcity of training data."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058146119","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c3cded4097075e7cc3b0d0","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"14","number":"10","doi":null,"documentHash":"d69f1e43-e148-4056-a91e-fe1df6308dad"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"2288-1 - 2288-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/10/2288/htm","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"616e2da875234017e055d077","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Piechocki","uuid":"BB3E3B1391F925F8A4AEA38E48AE3BC57EE778BBDE251D35CB2803A3515D04E01560C7EEEFB23B9D893CC662CE6E62FDEEE29BB6B4CC70FFEC3E3C896A2530D2","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1e53bf5c-45b6-4780-9635-1d506e9746b7"},{"objectId":"616e2da875234017e055d003","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Ptak","uuid":"DF58A0311B6810AD5B7D89B937850A1A8B2CCB24155775B1576A1AA557B4AC30D06443027DE0F61E63D34983AF5E992609F68618458DDE62A32E7B976104FFEE","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4e6fd38e-bff8-44db-ba56-0aa23d9bd06f"},{"objectId":"5e709420878c28a0473b6a51","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Pieczyński","uuid":"07BFDD795EF70281C2A667B41F96EE91F23852786A6D1B75BE6CC83B47495231A57E6DE98AE24F654F5AC7D49D215D9E40AFA7BA6660AAD9EE36350689F39E8B","orcidId":"0000-0003-0275-5629","documentHash":"b852ad8d-5667-4512-b98d-15a6510874d6"},{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473ae9f4","name":"Marek","lastName":"Kraft","uuid":"1DE0D664250019BAE472585F38DB92C937968B65662E65F18C4225838A89474431E8732729DCD8B8890A9305459904634BBB78ED9A1D65FFDEDFB48910FFB6E9","orcidId":"0000-0001-6483-2357","documentHash":"684bb03f-5a8b-4c2d-ac7e-6314c3a28c6f"}],"doi":"10.3390/rs14102288"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","uid":"b1CAWFlsJj7f886P9BWoCUQ","uuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","parentUuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de32","rootUuid":"282be714-cb82-4078-850e-810d7003cb31","name":"Uniwersytet Radomski im.

Triathlon is a typically endurance discipline. Prolonged and intensive exercise is known to cause changes in blood rheological properties and biochemical markers; sometimes athletes participating in strenuous competitions need medical attention. To understand the phenomena occurring in the body in such situations, we decided to study participants’ biomarkers after the XTERRA Poland 2017 triathlon competition. The study involved 10 triathletes. The XTERRA Poland 2017 event comprised 1500-m swimming, 36-km cycling, and 10-km mountain running. Blood samples were collected 2 days before, immediately after, and 16 h after the competition. Immediately after the race, white blood cells count, platelets, and uric acid levels were significantly (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001) increased; haematocrit, Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, Cl<jats:sup>–</jats:sup>, and IgA were decreased. On the following day, Na<jats:sup>+</jats:sup>, Cl<jats:sup>–</jats:sup>, and C-reactive protein levels were significantly (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001) increased; white blood cells count, red blood cells count, haemoglobin, haematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, platelets, IgG, and IgA were decreased. Assessing rheological parameters such as erythrocyte deformability and aggregation is useful for monitoring adverse effects of intensive and exhaustive exercise. The study illustrates the change in blood rheological properties and biochemical markers after intensive physical effort. Despite these differences, the indicators were within the reference range for the general population, which may demonstrate normal body function in the studied triathletes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058146123","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":null,"numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6385e0e64097077716756c18","name":"Bartłomiej","lastName":"Ptaszek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f31f2812-e961-4acd-a75f-081538d0a232"},{"objectId":"6385e0e64097077716756c16","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Tota","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"caa957ef-e680-4e1b-9023-f671894edc85"},{"objectId":"6385e0e64097077716756c15","name":"Jakub","lastName":"Marchewka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"110e6d26-21e0-456e-a7b3-b4b095b4ad50"},{"objectId":"6385e0e64097077716756c14","name":"Aneta","lastName":"Teległów","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cbc37696-efb5-4068-b9d7-98dae4d6c771"},{"objectId":"5e7093db878c28a0473b1fc6","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Mucha","uuid":"D2B8DE2652E633BFF24DFAE2C334C1DDC335EB1221BA2A9F82B00799323AE605197425FF6FE061083A3C1F0EF48CCEE5E719D46296F107494A38FC89CEA0EC27","orcidId":"0000-0003-2068-4510","documentHash":"4d221b55-c536-415f-adad-9f72b1857789"},{"objectId":"5e70927e878c28a047396c26","name":"Robert","lastName":"Makuch","uuid":"75A46C827EC7186BF11D41FB4CD84B86D46ED6FBD41E0BF400A3AA9C8E18D317845B6E7031FCA09CBF94D4A88ECE4CB9E5508ACFBA6E9164B75DB4EB23A13C9B","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cc9b373e-3aab-45e8-824e-710fb5d0b708"},{"objectId":"5e709256878c28a047393e9a","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Mucha","uuid":"4C7AF967997E3335188F7EFDB24AA4B213FBC648876E613B4559A46EB4E69B738CD2A6FBBAEFEC74661E04EEB83ECB6D1B3BD8BA8CCC001A3DA933AC7FCA1343","orcidId":"0000-0001-8361-8663","documentHash":"23ffc51e-615b-45f5-8816-60bc46e0d3b3"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-022-07240-1"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sewage sludge","waste management","ecotoxicological tests","reclamation blend","soil substitute"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decd","uid":"bDVT6eE951oVevqx9vwsANA","uuid":"52307719-d5a8-4e16-8c65-acc1f011e9bb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decd","parentUuid":"52307719-d5a8-4e16-8c65-acc1f011e9bb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decd","rootUuid":"52307719-d5a8-4e16-8c65-acc1f011e9bb","name":"Główny Instytut Górnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70940d878c28a0473b5774","5e709430878c28a0473b7dbb","5e7094e7878c28a0473c66c4"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Comparison of different municipal sewage sludge products for potential ecotoxicity","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477198","mniswId":"1668","title":"Archives of Environmental Protection","doi":null,"issn":"2083-4772","eissn":"2083-4810","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"420f3201-1098-4463-9dcc-fb1bd0d33409"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_SA","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"MARCH","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6267c6f140970720eb51f6ed","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7094e7878c28a0473c66c4","5e70940d878c28a0473b5774","5e709430878c28a0473b7dbb"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"To test the potential harmfulness of soils fertilized with sludge-based products to plant organisms, a biotest method using the physiological/biochemical reaction of the organisms to assess their toxicity was chosen. This paper presents the results of a preliminary ecotoxicological study of different products: a sludge-based fertilizer, a plant growth promoter, and a reclamation blend. The study was conducted using Sinapis alba L., a plant used in agriculture for intercropping and recommended for toxicological testing. Toxicity tests were performed in a gradient of concentrations of the indicated products (2.5%, 5%, and 10%). For comparison purposes, a trial\ncontaining a commercial fertilizer was used alongside the control soil (without additives). The fertilizer and the crop support agent were of low toxicity, but data analysis indicated toxicity of the so-called reclamation blend, which contained heavy metals among other things. The test products showed an increase in toxicity with the\nincreasing dose used. This research represents an important step in assessing the usefulness of products created from sewage sludge and may help overcome the „psychological barrier” that prevents potential investors from investing capital that would allow production to spread."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058146126","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"48","pagesFromTo":"92-99","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.pan.pl/dlibra/publication/140548/edition/122596/content","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094e7878c28a0473c66c4","name":"Anna","lastName":"Borgulat","uuid":"EF8F8496886C1DD59381593CE9B307AF35407B4778DC1DAE3C870AA16E1208299F33F97696CC5304DC80911883E15D5DA32CC8BDCF892B73389AAF449CB0E2C4","orcidId":"0000-0002-1847-3653","documentHash":"63a2a088-70d9-4885-9b34-10bfa3e6d1b9"},{"objectId":"5e709430878c28a0473b7dbb","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Głodniok","uuid":"C368F89C2EFD4A44732F24112C63A5F32FD95E0C1FF75A7E866DEE5D3BBA2A9501D613D950BEE05BFC051B93D2631A858B077C3EFABB30092C5DB856A2DEE652","orcidId":"0000-0002-9049-7107","documentHash":"c2bdfd0a-8724-4386-952d-8a509e5e48cc"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b5774","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Zgórska","uuid":"28E9465E96F57D83D710FEC07ADEAC7FE16DE1A83C206F0FBD79DBC8F2EC065799704C93227CFDFD58D0F899BF6FA81430717BBFAACB559C13764C0CC4556BF3","orcidId":"0000-0002-2731-630X","documentHash":"f421c32d-65d2-4e75-bcaf-3312f818f319"}],"doi":"10.24425/aep.2022.140548"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["timber production","timber market","protection","forest forecasting","broadleaved","roundwood and pulpwood assortments","wood"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","uid":"bk6a4u9UDD_o3fTovGAeczg","uuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","parentUuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","rootUuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","name":"Instytut Badawczy Leśnictwa","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d0878c28a04739d3e6"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Between Biodiversity Conservation and the Supply for Broadleaved Wood: A Case Study of State Forests National Forest Holding (Poland)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d36","mniswId":"6744","title":"Forests","doi":null,"issn":"1999-4907","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"42a3ad4f-b110-4a47-9a0c-7c0eb98ed81c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-10","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62664ab84097071c15d8a0f0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093b5878c28a0473af8f6","5e7092d0878c28a04739d3e6","5e7091f3878c28a04738d9cd"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Climate change is an important issue that increasingly affects our lives. One of the proposals\r\nfor mitigating climate change is fighting biodiversity loss, which can support climate mitigation and\r\nadaptation actions. In Poland, the possibility of excluding large tracts of forest areas from use is being\r\nconsidered. The discussed the exclusion of forest land from use will affect the timber supply and\r\nmarket, especially for broadleaved wood. The main purpose of this analysis is to present a timber\r\nsupply forecast, with a particular focus on the possibility of obtaining broadleaved hardwood timber\r\nin Poland from forests managed by State Forests National Forest Holding under three scenarios that\r\nassume different criteria for selecting forest areas for protection. The work was divided into two\r\nmain phases: (1) the analysis of historical sales volume of wood products and average sale prices of\r\nhardwood during the period 2011–2020; (2) the preparation of a forecast of the potential possibility\r\nof maintaining broadleaved hardwood production in the three decades between 2020 and 2049. In\r\nthe forecast, it was assumed that about 2.7 million hectares of planted and production forests are\r\nexcluded from use in order to implement the provisions of the 2030 Biodiversity Strategy. In Scenario\r\n“I”, the supply of merchantable broadleaved roundwood volume will be reduced to 14%–18% that of\r\nScenario “0”. In Scenario “II”, 55% of the “0” scenario is harvested, and in Scenario “III”, 33%–37% of\r\nthe “0” scenario merchantable broadleaved roundwood is harvested. The introduction of restrictions\r\non timber harvesting as a result of Poland’s compliance with European Union requirements in the\r\narea of environmental protection will lead to a significant reduction in the supply of timber on the\r\nmarket. This may lead to a further increase in timber prices and an increase in the importance of\r\nlarge timber buyers at the expense of local buyers. The recommendations contained in the policy\r\nobjectives that the EU sets for the states should be supported by a thorough analysis when selecting\r\nareas for strict protection."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058146131","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/13/3/438/htm","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093b5878c28a0473af8f6","name":"Emilia","lastName":"Wysocka-Fijorek","uuid":"74488C00DC500FD6EF093802407A33A542722B1F9D112A4C5166C101BB52DD06E64CF90136207852025CF37165E1339EC2193F7869F04777C9886A4126FCABC0","orcidId":"0000-0002-4838-8169","documentHash":"a926cea1-d43e-45eb-b6c6-3a8cc03fa6de"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d3e6","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Gołos","uuid":"E36AF06ACD0B3DD9DDA62C8EFD52E23F7F0EEA0D7F93EFF73002A1546F3B3286F465D10B84991FC7682DC2C7DD4997E0DDE06910C52F6FF31409D619CE6CCBD8","orcidId":"0000-0001-5303-136X","documentHash":"43e5115e-cd30-4cf7-8a40-89169a042e4d"},{"objectId":"5e7091f3878c28a04738d9cd","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Janeczko","uuid":"7E9A86690215773315B2F96299D616A58612063168F4AB7713E170E9515102BB4AB339466DDD767941B42D4CF0BA4B2AB1A10A68101DAC1F6E529FC9D0E61AA3","orcidId":"0000-0002-3350-4032","documentHash":"60cf9b17-e259-4f05-a13f-7100afa3d281"}],"doi":"10.3390/f13030438"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["samorząd terytorialny","młodzieżowe rady","młodzieżowa rada gminy","partycypacja społeczności lokalnych"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","uid":"bzvsPYOprn7OdjI6A8M5SNw","uuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Uniwersytet Warszawski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["602cbb949543c7410626e27a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Młodzieżowe rady jednostek samorządu terytorialnego na nowo","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a47a","mniswId":"497444","title":"SAMORZĄD TERYTORIALNY","doi":null,"issn":"0867-4973","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"5babd99a-bd71-4ffd-ac00-dcdf3f59bbe2"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62bc4e764097070fda679099","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["602cbb949543c7410626e27a"]},"issue":"6","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"W czerwcu 2021 r. weszły w życie nowe przepisy regulujące funkcjonowanie młodzieżowych rad przy jednostkach samorządu terytorialnego – w tym stanowiące podstawę funkcjonowania młodzieżowych rad powiatów i sejmików województw.
