Though the\npopularity of geotourism is rapidly growing, research on the demand side, particularly on segmenting\ntourists to geosites and understanding their profiles, is limited. This obviously makes the designing\nof effective tourism policies that aim at developing geotourism sustainably very difficult. Hence, the\nmain objectives of this study were to segment and profile tourists to geosites based on the benefits\nsought, and to show its implications for sustainable development of geotourism. With a survey of\n415 tourists, this study clustered tourists to geosites in the southern Lake Tana region in Ethiopia\nbased on the benefits sought. A factor–cluster method was applied to segment the tourists. The study\nidentified four distinct segments: Activity–Nature Lovers, Culture Lovers, Nature–Culture Lovers,\nand Want-It-Alls. These segments differed in their demographic, trip, and behavioral characteristics.\nThe findings implied that for sustainable development, destination managers and marketers need to\ncustomize their geotourism product development and marketing strategies based on the needs and\ncharacteristics of each market segment."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085672","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"3411","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/6/3411/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623449aa2467f00ffe9469e7","name":"Amaury","lastName":"Frankl","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8fba3a7e-d1ab-440a-8b9a-3a9bd318eb17"},{"objectId":"623449aa2467f00ffe9469e6","name":"Kerebih","lastName":"Asrese","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"31e0eeb2-5c6e-4a16-b31d-d1a1610ea9d6"},{"objectId":"623449aa2467f00ffe9469e5","name":"Amare Sewnet","lastName":"Minale","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2626-7112","documentHash":"5e7fbae6-6eea-4fa5-acfa-f6622faced39"},{"objectId":"623449aa2467f00ffe9469e4","name":"Enyew","lastName":"Adgo","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6824-5037","documentHash":"1d2fc2e7-c32f-4bf7-a9ae-776ba52fe717"},{"objectId":"623449aa2467f00ffe9469e3","name":"Steven","lastName":"Van Passel","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6971-9246","documentHash":"8c98c17d-7403-496e-90cd-33e015c6a773"},{"objectId":"623449aa2467f00ffe9469e2","name":"Anton","lastName":"Van Rompaey","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-5435-6887","documentHash":"118e259a-3ace-4840-bec6-db701aebe6a4"},{"objectId":"623449aa2467f00ffe9469e1","name":"Jan","lastName":"van der Borg","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8683-3390","documentHash":"4f1e432c-d34e-420f-8593-f2b0145b66b0"},{"objectId":"623449aa2467f00ffe9469e0","name":"Getaneh Addis","lastName":"Tessema","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3972-0641","documentHash":"8c1cd981-cfda-48bf-9be3-620e2c199834"},{"objectId":"5ebed7eb752340254fc40d73","name":"Jean","lastName":"Poesen","uuid":"D29B7A1EFC0A991B826FDD2646418935A73E1BDE11906E166850F8F3F1F4FC63467F00EC2A583721567180FC2DADCB5AAE2BA63502DB51AB5D6C1BDABD6657B9","orcidId":"0000-0001-6218-8967","documentHash":"f4ff93c0-be91-4abb-9708-a2e3a90838ff"}],"doi":"10.3390/su14063411"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["menu engineering","neuromarketing","restaurant business","restaurant pricing","Kasavana and Smith model","restaurant menu structure"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61a5dabe2467f0269e776b52","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Odessa National Academy of Food Technologies","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623b2e022467f02a86c62e19"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Development of an effective restaurant menu.

The object of research is the restaurant business, and the subject is the influence of the restaurant menu on the choice of dishes by its consumers. One of the major problems is that restaurant owners often underestimate the importance of the structure and content of their restaurant menu – the names and descriptions of dishes, the sequence of their arrangement, the number of certain items, the selection and recording of prices, the quality of photographs and the overall appearance of the menu. This task is most often shifted to a graphic designer who does not have a certain competence in this matter.\n\nThe paper describes various psychological techniques that can have a direct impact on the choice of dishes by the guest on the menu. The method of menu engineering by Michael Kasanava and Donald Smith, the features of the psychology of choice and neuromarketing in the restaurant business are considered. The study used the methodology of focus groups and content analysis. 73 printed restaurant menus were analyzed and 3 focus groups were conducted with specific target audiences. Focus group participants were asked to familiarize themselves with different types of restaurant menus. During the discussion, the participants expressed their opinions, comments and recommendations on the arrangement of dishes in the menu, structure, number of positions, sequence of dishes, etc.\n\nInteresting results were obtained, which proved the importance of not only the appearance and beautiful design of the restaurant menu, but also the need to pay great attention to its content, a certain arrangement of texts and structure. This is due to the peculiarities of the psychology of choice and neuromarketing.\n\nThanks to the study, recommendations have been developed on the use of certain psychological techniques for the menu of any restaurant. The implementation of the techniques described in the paper made it possible to create an effective menu for the BLOOM healthy food cafe (Odesa, Ukraine), which led to an increase in sales of the establishment by 15.8 % compared to the previous printed cafe menu."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085681","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623b1a0d2467f02a86c5df37","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"4 (63)","doi":"","documentHash":"fff04d3f-206a-49e5-8c4a-243b8d39ef66"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/tarp/article/download/253040/250711","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623b2e022467f02a86c62e19","name":"Kateryna","lastName":"Fedosova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7194-1340","documentHash":"dc52a000-eb0a-4cbb-997a-c442bd242937"}],"doi":"10.15587/2706-5448.2022.253040"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"623c91de2467f04a321af568","doi":null,"title":"Organizational Management and the COVID-19 Crisis Security and Risk Management Dilemmas","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"9781032255842","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://www.routledge.com/Organizational-Management-and-the-COVID-19-Crisis-Security-and-Risk-Management/Wereda-Wozniak-Stochaj/p/book/9781032255842#","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"dc32abfd-a59f-4ce4-b26c-c2b443f499c3","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb75f","mniswId":"2100","name":"Routledge","documentHash":"64cc346c-fb88-4618-a71a-f3105e672a66"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b6878c28a047385e24","uid":"bITc4cttztoiiv973rXfccw","uuid":"9d48cae3-39ad-462a-8216-ad67ec5520ed","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wydział Bezpieczeństwa, Logistyki i Zarządzania","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709285878c28a0473973eb"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Instruments supporting the economy of the European Union during the COVID-19 pandemic","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"623dbb682467f074f8984014","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709285878c28a0473973eb"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058085683","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.routledge.com/Organizational-Management-and-the-COVID-19-Crisis-Security-and-Risk-Management/Wereda-Wozniak-Stochaj/p/book/9781032255842","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709285878c28a0473973eb","name":"Konrad","lastName":"Stańczyk","uuid":"03DA48488777964C4ADF1AFA22CC6FD5FEECFBCF29E8ECA1B7F57B30E2E2030AF00B2454549A8B068FC086D15B663F883701B5634E45E41ACA2C387B0B6E77FE","orcidId":"0000-0003-2788-5358","documentHash":"e90dcc18-7583-492a-9523-072766fd5313"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Poland","cloud cover","cloud genera","cloud amount","cloudiness","types of clouds"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","uid":"bFhiVYWupXf-L0BTdpdX5dg","uuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","parentUuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","rootUuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","name":"Instytut Meteorologii i Gospodarki Wodnej -

It is determined that in the process of intensification of digitalization processes, various methodological approaches to statistical measurement of management efficiency were distinguished. Indices used to compile international ratings for the development of digital technologies have been established. The existing methodical approaches of statistical measurement of influence of digitalization on efficiency of public administration have been analyzed. In this regard, it was determined that there is no unified method of evaluation. A conceptual model of the system of statistical measurement of management efficiency under the conditions of digitalization at the organizational level has been built. It is substantiated that the devised model creates the basis for the formation of theoretical and methodological foundations for statistical measurement of the impact of digital technologies on management efficiency. Statistical indicators of the impact of digital technologies on management efficiency were systematized. The composition of indicators of measurement of external efficiency, efficiency coefficients of the controlled subsystem and control subsystem was clarified. A procedure for calculating the indicator of the overall efficiency of management has been devised. A methodical approach for diagnosing the movement of management efficiency indicators was proposed. It is established that differences in the speed of movement lead to large differences in the values of indicators. It has been determined that solving the system of equations makes it possible to find the intersection points of linear trends. The use of the proposed methodological approach could make it possible to measure the quantitative and qualitative effects of digitalization and ensure effective management at all levels by taking

However, the issues of choosing the parameters of the pruning procedure have not been sufficiently studied at the moment. The choice essentially depends on the configuration of the neural network. However, in any neural network configuration there is one or more multilayer perceptrons. For them, it is possible to develop universal recommendations for choosing the parameters of the pruning procedure. One of the most promising methods for practical implementation is considered – the iterative pruning method, which uses preprocessing of input signals to regularize the learning process of a neural network. For a specific configuration of a multilayer perceptron and the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset, a database of handwritten digit samples proposed by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology as a standard when comparing image recognition methods, dependences of the classification accuracy of handwritten digits and learning rate were obtained on the learning step, pruning interval, and the number of links removed at each pruning iteration. It is shown that the best set of parameters of the learning procedure with pruning provides an increase in the quality of classification by about 1 %, compared with the worst set in the studied range. The convex nature of these dependencies allows a constructive approach to finding a neural network configuration that provides the highest classification accuracy with the minimum amount of computational costs during implementation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085698","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6234838c2467f00ffe9659c3","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"9 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"089b239a-8df4-4132-9d11-1db8fbe09c4f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"75-83","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/253103/250759","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62349e512467f00ffe96f2fb","name":"Nikolay","lastName":"Baranov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2463-3673","documentHash":"a3757988-e970-4f33-b414-cf8d7c419b60"},{"objectId":"62349e512467f00ffe96f2fa","name":"Bohdan","lastName":"Shevchuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-9880-5621","documentHash":"8cde2574-182d-4706-84a9-adb736ec866a"},{"objectId":"62349e512467f00ffe96f2f9","name":"Alexander","lastName":"Nevrev","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7673-5466","documentHash":"c916d088-ed35-4cfb-a118-b25616c521f0"},{"objectId":"62349e512467f00ffe96f2f8","name":"Oleg","lastName":"Galchonkov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-5468-7299","documentHash":"7ea2eb4c-edf7-4f30-906c-064b5c65c42a"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.253103"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"9789634492849","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"FIKUSZ 2021 XVI.

The majority of previous efforts to search for gravitational microlensing events have concentrated toward high-density fields such as the Galactic bulge. Microlensing events in the Galactic plane have the advantage of closer proximity and better constrained relative proper motions, leading to better constrained estimates of lens mass at the expense of a lower optical depth, than events toward the Galactic bulge. We use the Zwicky Transient Facility Data Release 5 compiled from 2018-2021 to survey the Galactic plane in the region of ∣b∣ < 20°. We find a total of 60 candidate microlensing events including three that show a strong microlensing parallax effect. The rate of events traces Galactic structure, decreasing exponentially as a function Galactic longitude with scale length ℓ <SUB>0</SUB> ~ 37°. On average, we find Einstein timescales of our microlensing events to be about three times as long (~60 days) as those toward the Galactic bulge (~20 days). This pilot project demonstrates that microlensing toward the Galactic plane shows strong promise for characterization of dark objects within the Galactic disk.\""}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085715","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"927","pagesFromTo":"150","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927..150R","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6242c9ad2467f01c21279225","name":"Reed","lastName":"Riddle","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"145b3e8c-6f72-497d-bc76-7fe3d728f03e"},{"objectId":"6242c9ad2467f01c21279224","name":"Thomas A.","lastName":"Prince","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"636931b0-c900-469f-89d7-466063212595"},{"objectId":"6242c9ad2467f01c21279223","name":"Frank J.","lastName":"Masci","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"532d5e6f-cbce-41c3-b438-a16e100aabed"},{"objectId":"6242c9ad2467f01c21279222","name":"Matthew J.","lastName":"Graham","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1c61b47b-ec2c-46d2-ac30-9b1f3c570151"},{"objectId":"6242c9ad2467f01c21279221","name":"Dmitry A.","lastName":"Duev","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b27f386a-51e4-443a-be56-4239a71953f0"},{"objectId":"6242c9ad2467f01c21279220","name":"Andrew J.","lastName":"Drake","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6f72d3ad-ab5c-4d72-8a65-2cf6f6a7172b"},{"objectId":"6242c9ad2467f01c2127921f","name":"Richard","lastName":"Dekany","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9a859086-24dc-48dd-b343-05de41908c45"},{"objectId":"6242c9ad2467f01c2127921e","name":"David L.","lastName":"Shupe","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6d22a362-7bc4-4a04-998c-eb8f6dbe0008"},{"objectId":"6242c9ad2467f01c2127921d","name":"Eric C.","lastName":"Bellm","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"231242a1-fb67-4aa2-bcd3-7c61271a3bda"},{"objectId":"6242c9ad2467f01c2127921c","name":"Igor","lastName":"Andreoni","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"30977822-8141-4be7-b004-caccc3167429"},{"objectId":"6242c9ad2467f01c2127921b","name":"Antonio C.","lastName":"Rodriguez","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a6c46bb2-1ec5-41a7-b9b7-601b5a312cc5"},{"objectId":"6242c9ad2467f01c2127921a","name":"Shrinivas R.","lastName":"Kulkarni","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"362e6790-fdac-44a1-8cfd-5a46f3281d60"},{"objectId":"5e709371878c28a0473a9a79","name":"Przemysław","lastName":"Mróz","uuid":"DDB2A10E0643B3C83B05E0DFF1D7EAE7A136C1510E9E0017DFA14FAC28ACE7867A2A0F735DC7DDF076AD717DE1BAD396015A7EFFD6275AF18B279A1DE1D7EA38","orcidId":"0000-0001-7016-1692","documentHash":"29577772-076a-4770-b777-26c4c89431d8"}],"doi":"10.3847/1538-4357/ac51cc"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["zrównoważenie","wymiary ekonomiczny","środowiskowy","społeczny","gospodarstwa rolne","kompromis","modelowanie równań strukturalnych"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sustainability","economic","environmental","social dimensions","agricultural holdings","trade-off","structural equation modelling"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Economic, environmental, and social dimensions of farming sustainability – trade-off or synergy?","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454798de","mniswId":"19300","title":"Technological and Economic Development of Economy","doi":null,"issn":"2029-4913","eissn":"2029-4921","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"18b1c5ff-913f-4be9-b08f-49bfd82ece5c"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-04","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6239824b2467f01c21930c70","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709341878c28a0473a5b1c","5e709236878c28a047391c48","5e709341878c28a0473a5af7"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Prior studies on the relationships between economic, environmental, and social dimen-sions of activity on agricultural holdings has yielded inconclusive results.

Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is enveloped and possesses a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of ~30 kb. Genomic RNA is used as the template for replication and transcription. During these processes, positive-sense genomic RNA (gRNA) and subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) are created. Several studies presented the importance of the genomic RNA secondary structure in SARS-CoV-2 replication. However, the structure of sgRNAs has remained largely unsolved so far. In this study, we probed the sgRNA M model of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. The presented model molecule includes 5 ' UTR and a coding sequence of gene M. This is the first experimentally informed secondary structure model of sgRNA M, which presents features likely to be important in sgRNA M function. The knowledge of sgRNA M structure provides insights to better understand virus biology and could be used for designing new therapeutics."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085724","journalIssue":{"objectId":"620bd5c92467f07b3c5c8b84","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"8e57629b-37e4-43ed-a551-cf2eb7b89185"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"322","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/14/2/322/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6239bfb62467f009d3ffef29","name":"Walter N.","lastName":"Moss","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d7c54153-a7c2-496a-8798-da2c8aa62df6"},{"objectId":"6239bfb62467f009d3ffef28","name":"Collin A.","lastName":"O’Leary","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4246-6277","documentHash":"014ed640-fe6e-4a68-8134-e907d444dae6"},{"objectId":"5e709463878c28a0473bbe62","name":"Marta","lastName":"Soszyńska-Jóźwiak","uuid":"93CC224DFB6938EDF961527D892A35BDA274F72154A677665123FA3143628E89CDAD4D56752BBE650F44D8429BE28E99532032A289AEBC8D01E642C7CE608975","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"36b64b9e-db42-45fe-8302-8dd52b46e34e"},{"objectId":"5e709463878c28a0473bbe60","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Ruszkowska","uuid":"943F7523C605DFCF1C4C4CE708249119A30BF3497108CDE395700D42E5B371628E1AE287B589231ACB5C513B1CB6915E7CC0C5CBE79CF891D50EAC23E0E0343C","orcidId":"0000-0002-9862-4406","documentHash":"2eb38af2-b40f-4151-ba37-7b62a8011ced"},{"objectId":"5e709349878c28a0473a6860","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Kierzek","uuid":"C8BAF60B500B43EB3844F57C38C2797EE6CD4D66501DB18359B0DFC49326E8903790F99989046DAC442CDA3DE3174DD6C5794A4C5A9DFCFEEF649D2970674B3E","orcidId":"0000-0002-5563-003X","documentHash":"1238ec70-6e7c-447c-a11a-9debe10cfcfb"},{"objectId":"5e709349878c28a0473a6857","name":"Ryszard","lastName":"Kierzek","uuid":"D9550C9655E0D240293AE404E47BEB16920A474FF86C563683B54BB477414D6A22714A3FEA4E92E97F23AF4991AD4DA0F8745CD33A3C9EE6FB8974AC94D06FB0","orcidId":"0000-0002-7644-0016","documentHash":"a5ea0d0f-b680-4699-b6a2-37880e2dfce8"}],"doi":"10.3390/v14020322"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["passive and active solar systems","solar architecture","heliostats","multi-scale systems of insolation","future cities"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","uid":"b1WXv5M2cR408NksLN0NM0A","uuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","parentUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de20","rootUuid":"c1ace867-f745-40ef-a300-04f736b3372c","name":"Uniwersytet Wrocławski","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70922f878c28a047391552","5e709232878c28a04739182d"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","uid":"bFhiVYWupXf-L0BTdpdX5dg","uuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","parentUuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dee8","rootUuid":"ae02494e-7705-4d08-bfa6-d92925752883","name":"Instytut Meteorologii i Gospodarki Wodnej - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709339878c28a0473a5304"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Passive and active solar systems in eco-architecture and eco-urban planning","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-3417","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ff202409-59bf-494e-82ae-6802b8fb2444"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-17","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"623835b52467f067af116265","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709232878c28a04739182d","5e70922f878c28a047391552","63a04a5c4097072312045f63","5e709339878c28a0473a5304","63a04a5c4097072312045f65"]},"issue":"6","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The subject of this article is a presentation of multi-scale passive and active solar and shading systems in urban areas.

Attention has been paid to the role of innovative solutions used in the field of ur ban insolation, such as heliostats in the development of future eco-architecture and eco-urban planning. This research has been based on the assumption that only by taking into account the close symbiosis between an energy-efficient building and its appropriate insolation, in combination with properly planned surroundings, it is possible to actually achieve the principles of sustainable development in the urban fabric. The analytical part concerns detailed investigation into solutions in the field of passive and active solar architecture and urban planning, regarding both insolation and shading. The article analyzes source materials, includes descriptions of case studies, and presents a comparative analysis of passive and active solar and shading systems.

With this approach the combustion of the sample adds to the heat of the furnace, which is in contrary to current approach and does increase the severity of the test. To quantify the consequences, three wall assemblies were tested with pre-defined heat release curves and modified furnace conditions. The assemblies were timber walls built from two layers of Oriented Strain Boards (OSB, 25 mm thick) on a timber frame with an air cavity (100 mm). A reference experiment with a well-insulated wall was performed to determine the furnace’s minimum heat release rate (HRR) required to maintain the standard (ISO 834) temperature/time curve. The first wall was tested with a standard fire resistance test, and in the 2nd and 3rd wall experiment, the furnace followed the minimum HRR value determined in a reference experiment. In experiment 2, the furnace ventilation matched the air requirements of the burners, and in experiment 3, the furnace was over ventilated. Peak temperatures measured in experiments 2 and 3 exceeded the standard temperature/time relation by 420°C and 600°C, respectively. The assembly’s failure (integrity criterion) was observed after 27 min, 23 min and 14 min of experiments 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The limitations of the approach used related to reproducibility and validity are discussed."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085788","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"58","pagesFromTo":"1767-1787","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10694-022-01226-1.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70942c878c28a0473b799f","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Turkowski","uuid":"77C63F4B2DE64A328EE2C0EC20D21FBAF7400B6E4001C53399A36B913BFE51C217CD94A33D5FA4D666F86FBAEB66C0E591629656AA285493F706B61199771E79","orcidId":"0000-0002-0020-0091","documentHash":"39645c50-bb98-4fd2-af0e-5cef8d46b177"},{"objectId":"5e7093f8878c28a0473b41f2","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Węgrzyński","uuid":"DBF1DA3E120865ACD27EB1E1D838C61BC986720F9D232F99E17BB18EDC9DE7DEEC7D4B12C9198871A770E369AB41889191F312107AA52EBC949ED3FA7EDBBC8A","orcidId":"0000-0002-7465-0212","documentHash":"998a1a27-3d50-40a5-a3fa-0356fa14d827"}],"doi":"10.1007/s10694-022-01226-1"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["drum ball mill","coal grinding","efficiency improvement","thermal power plant","regression analysis"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61c99bc32467f00f2d512247","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Almaty University of Power Engineering and Telecommunications named after Gumarbek Daukeyev","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62337aea2467f0713d579575","62337aea2467f0713d579573","62337aea2467f0713d579572"]},{"id":"5e7091b0878c28a047384ecf","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Technical University of Sofia","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62337aea2467f0713d579574"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Improving the efficiency of the coal grinding process in ball drum mills at thermal power plants","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-24","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62337aea2467f0713d57956f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62337aea2467f0713d579572","62337aea2467f0713d579573","62337aea2467f0713d579574","62337aea2467f0713d579575"]},"issue":"1 (115)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Ensuring the reliable operation of the dust fuel preparation system at thermal power plants (TPP) is a topical issue since it determines the energy strategy of any country that fires coals for thermal energy production. This unit is one of the most energy-intensive units in TPP. Those systems are outdated, poorly automated and high energy-intensive. Furthermore, they must ensure efficient and safe operation of the facility while being environmentally friendly. The current work focuses on the process of grinding coals in ball drum mills for further pulverized combustion. An experimental study was performed in order to determine the main factors (rotational speed of the drum mill, the degree of loading with the grinding balls, and the velocity of the supplied air) that affect the efficiency of the fuel preparation system. The obtained experimental data and performed mathematical modeling resulted in regression equations describing the energy performance of the mill. Three regression equations for mill productivity, power consumed, and specific surface area of the final product were obtained and validated. The study reveals that the lowest specific energy consumption is achieved when the relative rotational speed of the mill is between 0.81 and 0.87; the weighted average diameter of the balls ranges from 33.5 up to 34.5 mm; the load factor of the grinding media ranges from 0.325 up to 0.335, the supplied air velocity is between 0.2 and 0.3 m/s. The proposed methodology allows adjustment of the operating parameters of the grinding process to achieve the lowest energy consumption. The power consumption for the preparation can be reduced up to 5 % for the selected operation mode of the grinding facility."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085794","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623355402467f0713d5675a0","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"1

The evaluation includes rolling correlations to see if relationships change over time. Results illustrate that commodities can be very effective hedging tools. However, some commodities do a better job than others. The optimal choice depends on what regions’ or countries’ inflation risk one seeks to mitigate, and the optimal choice can change as conditions change in the future.

certain situations, internal insulation is the only possible renovation option. However, it is risky where there is high humidity in a building and ventilation is not working sufficiently. The internal insulation retrofit changes the original thermal and moisture balance of a wall, therefore, it is necessary to carefully design it already at the initial stage. This paper analyses four interior insulation systems based on open diffusion capillary active materials: wood fibreboards (flex and rigid), perlite boards, and microporous calcium silicate. The hygrothermal performance under the climatic conditions of Central Europe (Poland) was assessed using the WUFI Plus software, taking into account the dynamic variation of indoor and outdoor conditions. The analysis included three insulation thicknesses with different ventilation rates and varying moisture loads. The results show that the hygrothermal properties of the wall change with the increase of insulation thickness and depend on the individual moisture properties of the material. In addition, both the reduction of moisture load and more intensive air exchange improve the hygrothermal properties at the interface between the insulation and the wall. Of all the solutions analysed, the system with perlite board and the system with wood fibreboard showed the worst hygric properties. Conversely, the highest risk of mould and interstitial condensation was recorded for the flex wood fibreboard solution."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085856","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/5/1862/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093a5878c28a0473ae6d9","name":"Dobrosława","lastName":"Kaczorek","uuid":"C1FBDF6DB9A66FEBE4DFD5BE6FF091851B0B542345B3ADDCCD7C1D0CEF02B138296C8FCE35EAF6E44FB3C6C763034A4C1886D24BDD04596027581F29341F2932","orcidId":"0000-0001-5014-4326","documentHash":"67755021-49e6-4801-8d16-43d9486449da"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15051862"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["neural networks","transfer learning","convolutional neural networks","computer resources"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091c4878c28a047388864","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"National Aviation University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623b1aec2467f02a86c5e2e9"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Comparative characteristics of the ability of convolutional neural networks to the concept of transfer learning","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a5c9","mniswId":"1002078","title":"Technology audit and production reserves [ Технологический аудит и резервы производства ]","doi":null,"issn":"2226-3780","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b2ddb9ee-c11c-4559-bf8e-ac90b931d78e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-11","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"623b1aec2467f02a86c5e2e7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["623b1aec2467f02a86c5e2e9"]},"issue":"2(63)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The object of research is the ability to combine a previously trained model of a deep neural network of direct propagation with user data when used in problems of determining the class of one object in the image. That is, the processes of transfer learning in convolutional neural networks in classification problems are considered. The conducted researches are based on application of a method of comparison of theoretical and practical results received at training of convolutional neural networks. The main objective of this research is to conduct two different learning processes. Traditional training during which in each epoch of training there is an adjustment of values of all weights of each layer of a network. After that there is a process of training of a neural network on a sample of the data presented by images. The second process is learning using transfer learning methods, when initializing a pre-trained network, the weights of all its layers are «frozen» except for the last fully connected layer. This layer will be replaced by a new one with the number of outputs, which should be equal to the number of classes in the sample. After that, to initialize its parameters by the random values distributed according to the normal law. Then conduct training of such convolutional neural network on the set sample. When the training was conducted, the results were compared. In conclusion, learning from convolutional neural networks using transfer learning techniques can be applied to a variety of classification tasks, ranging from numbers to space objects (stars and quasars). The amount of computer resources spent on research is also quite important. Because not all model of a convolutional neural network can be fully taught without powerful computer systems and a large number of images in the training sample."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085861","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623b19d62467f02a86c5dab8","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"2 (63)","doi":"","documentHash":"d5903342-8fbd-4543-821e-49db803b1962"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"10-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/tarp/article/download/252695/250110","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623b1aec2467f02a86c5e2e9","name":"Vladimir","lastName":"Khotsyanovsky","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0415-777X","documentHash":"608e5357-eed7-4c51-8b75-891a54063ae0"}],"doi":"10.15587/2706-5448.2022.252695"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Variation in cross-sectional indicator of femoral robusticity in Homo sapiens and Neandertals","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c2851454796b9","mniswId":"18277","title":"Scientific Reports","doi":null,"issn":"2045-2322","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e98721ba-91a2-4f56-82d5-b1d138b3b57a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-18","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6239a4052467f01c21931e58","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6405b6714097077035581909","6405b671409707703558190a","5e7092ef878c28a04739f81a","6405b671409707703558190b","6405b671409707703558190c","6405b671409707703558190d","5e7092ef878c28a04739f79a"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Variations in the cross-sectional properties of long bones are used to reconstruct the activity of human groups and differences in their respective habitual behaviors. Knowledge of what factors influence bone structure in <jats:italic>Homo sapiens</jats:italic> and Neandertals is still insufficient thus, this study investigated which biological and environmental variables influence variations in the femoral robusticity indicator of these two species. The sample consisted of 13 adult Neandertals from the Middle Paleolithic and 1959 adult individuals of <jats:italic>H. sapiens</jats:italic> ranging chronologically from the Upper Paleolithic to recent times. The femoral biomechanical properties were derived from the European data set, the subject literature, and new CT scans. The material was tested using a Mantel test and statistical models. In the models, the polar moment of area (J) was the dependent variable; sex, age, chronological period, type of lifestyle, percentage of the cortical area (%CA), the ratio of second moment areas of inertia about the X and Y axes (Ix/Iy), and maximum slope of the terrain were independent covariates. The Mantel tests revealed spatial autocorrelation of the femoral index in <jats:italic>H. sapiens</jats:italic> but not in Neandertals. A generalized additive mixed model showed that sex, %CA, Ix/Iy, chronological period, and terrain significantly influenced variation in the robusticity indicator of <jats:italic>H. sapiens</jats:italic> femora.

Описано фактори, що\nсприяють розвитку патології, та причини виникнення. Висвітлено різноманітні спроби\nкласифікації, зокрема, детально описано клінічну класифікацію, яка базується на\nфізикальному приліжковому огляді та поділі пацієнтів на чотири категорії, залежно від\nнаявності ознак застою та гіпоперфузії. Також увага приділена класифікації згідно з Т. Killip\nта J. Kimball осіб із гострою серцевою недостатністю, яка виникла на ґрунті гострого\nкоронарного синдрому. Наведено перелік додаткових інструментальних і лабораторних\nметодів обстеження, критерії госпіталізації пацієнта у відділення інтенсивної терапії,\nпоказання до інтубації трахеї.

Sensory tests showed that beers made from barley with addition of Saskatoon fruit of the ‘Smoky’ cultivar were characterised by the most balanced taste and aroma. Physicochemical analyses of fruit beers, produced with Saskatoon fruit pulp added on the seventh day of fermentation, showed that the beers enhanced with ozone-treated and untreated ‘Smoky’ Saskatoon fruits had the highest contents of alcohol, 5.51% v/v and 5.66% v/v, respectively, as well as total polyphenol contents of 395 mg GAE/L and 401 mg GAE/L, respectively, and higher antioxidant activity (assessed using DPPH•, FRAP and ABTS+• assays). It was demonstrated that the ozonation process led to a decrease in the contents of neochlorogenic acid, on average by 91.00%, and of caffeic acid by 20.62%, relative to the beers enhanced with ‘Smoky’ Saskatoon fruits not subjected to ozone treatment.

paper reports a comparative analysis of accuracy in the detection of steganograms formed according to adaptive steganographic methods, using steganography detectors based on common and specialized types of artificial neural networks. The results of the review of modern convolutional neural networks applied for the tasks of digital image stegoanalysis have established that the accuracy of operating the steganography detectors based on these networks is significantly compromised when processing image packets characterized by a significant variability of statistical parameters.\n\nThe performance accuracy of steganography detectors based on the modern statistical model of container images maxSRMd2 has been investigated, as well as on the latest convolutional and «hybrid» artificial neural networks, in particular, GB-Ras and ASSAF networks, when detecting steganograms formed according to the adaptive steganographic methods HUGO and MiPOD. It was established that the use of the statistical model maxSRMd2 makes it possible to significantly (up to 30 %) improve the accuracy of steganogram detection in the case of analyzing those images that are characterized by a high level of natural noise. It was found that the use of the ASSAF network makes it possible to significantly (up to 35 %) reduce an error of steganogram detection compared to current steganography detectors based on the GB-Ras network and the maxSRMd2 statistical model. It was determined that the high accuracy of the ASSAF network-based steganography detector is maintained even in the most difficult case of image processing with high noise and poor filling of the container image with stegodata (less than 10 %).\n\nThe results reported here are of theoretical interest for designing high-precision steganography detectors capable of working under conditions of high variability in image parameters."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085876","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6234838c2467f00ffe9659c3","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"9 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"089b239a-8df4-4132-9d11-1db8fbe09c4f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"45-55","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/251350/250756","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623497812467f00ffe96df3e","name":"Mariia","lastName":"Yarysh","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8728-8745","documentHash":"e7c58a67-89e2-4aef-a1ba-31a31a3fffb6"},{"objectId":"623497812467f00ffe96df3d","name":"Dmytro","lastName":"Progonov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1124-1497","documentHash":"4303bdbd-f3fb-4b75-97be-2281774fff13"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.251350"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["M1 grade copper wire","electrical application","combined plastic deformation","resistivity","stress relaxation"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"623b121c2467f02a86c5bc33","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Technical University Metinvest Polytechnica","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623b121c2467f02a86c5bc35","623b121c2467f02a86c5bc36","623b121c2467f02a86c5bc38"]},{"id":"61f148762467f06d26f6e6e3","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Odessa Scientific Research Institute of Forensic Expertise of the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623b121c2467f02a86c5bc37"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Forming of properties complex of copper wire by the method of combined deformation by torsion and tension","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a5c9","mniswId":"1002078","title":"Technology audit and production reserves [ Технологический аудит и резервы производства ]","doi":null,"issn":"2226-3780","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b2ddb9ee-c11c-4559-bf8e-ac90b931d78e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-11","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"623b121c2467f02a86c5bc32","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["623b121c2467f02a86c5bc35","623b121c2467f02a86c5bc36","623b121c2467f02a86c5bc37","623b121c2467f02a86c5bc38"]},"issue":"1(63)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The object of research is the mechanical properties of copper wire M1 for electrical applications, subjected to combined torsional deformation with tensile tension. One of the most problematic aspects in the manufacturing of such a wire is its fracture during processing due to low strength and ductility. DSTU EN 13602:2010 regulates the ultimate tensile strength, relative elongation, the number of bends before fracture and the number of twists until failure. To increase the service life of the product it is necessary to increase strength and plastic properties.\n\nThe methods of influence on the material by combined plastic tensile deformation with tensile was used in the study, the mechanical characteristics (ultimate tensile strength, true deformation before failure, relative elongation, relative reduction in area) and electrical conductivity were determined. Statistical analysis tools were used for modeling and graphical displaying of data.\n\nThe proposed approach allows to select the modes of combined torsional deformation with tensile, providing the optimal combination of tensile strength and relative narrowing of M1 grade copper wire. Under certain modes of such deformation, with increasing degree of deformation, it is possible to increase the strength characteristics and at the same time obtain high values of plasticity.\n\nThe obtained results of approbation of different combined deformation modes allow to consider it an effective tool for achieving high values of true rapture stress and ultimate deformation in order to improve the service characteristics of the deformed wire. It is shown that relaxation processes occur during such treatment, which leads to a decrease in stresses and a sharp increase in plastic characteristics. Clarification of the mechanisms of the characteristics formation allows to control the features of the structure and, accordingly, the level of mechanical properties to obtain a wire that combines high strength with high toughness. This makes it possible to develop deformation modes to obtain copper wire with special properties depending on customer requirements, for example: strong wire with low electrical resistance."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085881","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623b0d692467f02a86c5ae0e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"1 (63)","doi":"","documentHash":"94cb98b8-d391-4d94-a798-46a8e3483f68"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/tarp/article/download/252282/250244","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623b121c2467f02a86c5bc38","name":"Igor","lastName":"Boyko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7742-4694","documentHash":"f2862076-5af8-4013-9441-27876fb5cdde"},{"objectId":"623b121c2467f02a86c5bc37","name":"Maryna","lastName":"Kraliuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0693-9508","documentHash":"56509c9f-ee1c-4c6e-9b0e-709645fd0765"},{"objectId":"623b121c2467f02a86c5bc36","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Pashynskyi","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0118-4748","documentHash":"736e9c2c-7d4e-480d-8c73-1afeed78bbd3"},{"objectId":"623b121c2467f02a86c5bc35","name":"Olena","lastName":"Pashynska","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7102-1544","documentHash":"169bf39a-d86a-41ee-b06b-99d4f42838d8"}],"doi":"10.15587/2706-5448.2022.252282"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["siły morskie","programy modernizacyjne","planowanie","zarządzanie i jakość","model referencyjny"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["naval forces","modernization programs","planning","management and quality","reference model"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de09","uid":"bFitDBcx4YvxolIt7JKxDiw","uuid":"29483405-4eba-4db1-b6c9-321ff370bdf9","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de09","parentUuid":"29483405-4eba-4db1-b6c9-321ff370bdf9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de09","rootUuid":"29483405-4eba-4db1-b6c9-321ff370bdf9","name":"Uniwersytet WSB Merito w Gdańsku","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092b7878c28a04739b447"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Planowanie rozwoju sił morskich Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a36d","mniswId":"486024","title":"PRZEGLĄD GEOPOLITYCZNY","doi":null,"issn":"2080-8836","eissn":"2392-067X","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"8a854f1d-e18b-4236-aeff-04708c3592d4"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"MARCH","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"623880622467f067af12d926","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092b7878c28a04739b447"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Celem opracowania jest prezentacja modelu planowania rozwoju sił morskich w państwie średniej wielkości na przykładzie Polski, poprzez ich trafną i skuteczną modernizację.

The antimicrobial activity in the contact phase was most pronounced against Gram-negative bacteria, with inhibition zones of 12.66–15.33 mm and a minimal inhibition concentration of 2.36–8.26 µL/mL. The antimicrobial activity of the CAEO vapor phase was high at the highest concentration tested (500 µL/mL), but the inhibitory effect was seen at all concentrations tested. The effect was observed on all types of microorganisms and all types of model foods. Based on the findings, CAEO could find use in storing and extending the shelf life of agricultural products. Insecticidal activity reached 10–90% depending on the concentration used. The significant insecticidal effect provides the possibility of using CAEO as a natural insecticidal, larvicidal, or repellent

is considered one of the most common chronic neurological diseases among humans. Lamotrigine is an effective new-generation anticonvulsant, which is widely introduced to the pharmaceutical market by various drug manufacturers. That is why the urgent aim for pharmaceutical analysis is developing of high precision, valid, accessible and quantitative methods for lamotrigine in pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe aim of the work is to study the optimal conditions for the reaction between lamotrigine and diazole red 2J, to define the coefficients of stoichiometric relationships in the “pharmaceutical substance – reagent” system and to develop a valid, sensitive and easy-to-follow technique for the quantitative determination of lamotrigine in pharmaceutical forms.\n\nMaterial and methods. As reagent and solvent, diazole red 2J of AR grade and acetone of AR grade were used. Analytical equipment: Specord 200 spectrophotometer, ABT-120-5DM electronic scales, Elmasonic E 60H ultrasonic bath and measuring glassware of A class.\n\nResults. A new spectrophotometric method for the quantitative determination of lamotrigine in four pharmaceutical formulations based on interaction with diazole red 2J in acetone medium has been developed. The proposed method is valid according to such validation characteristics as linearity, precision, intra-laboratory precision, accuracy, application range and robustness. The subordination to Behr's law is in the range of concentrations of 2.20–3.36 mg/100 ml. The LOD and LOQ values based on the values of the calibration line were 0.00450 % and 0.0138 % respectively. It was found that the studied coloured solutions are stable for at least 60 min and fluctuations in the amount of added red diazole 2J solution within ±10 % do not significantly affect the value of optical density. The coefficients of stoichiometric ratios between the components of the “lamotrigine – diazole red 2J” reaction mixture were defined by three methods and are 1:1. The predicted complete uncertainty of the results of analysis for quantitative determination of lamotrigine in the pharmaceutical form (2.2 %) does not exceed the maximum allowable uncertainty for the technique (3.2 %) and meets the SPhU requirements.\n\nConclusions. According to the experimental data, the technique can be correctly reproduced and it is suitable for using in laboratories of the State Inspection for Quality Control of Medicines and QCD of the chemicopharmaceutical enterprises"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085902","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623aef552467f02a86c5000d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"1(35)","doi":null,"documentHash":"08271846-50dd-4f90-ac8a-4a2fbdf8185f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"44-51","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/sr_pharm/article/download/253542/250787","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623af9492467f02a86c525a6","name":"Ivan","lastName":"Pavljuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6423-8777","documentHash":"f6f7d8e1-71ea-4930-892f-ea17696e1938"},{"objectId":"623af9492467f02a86c525a5","name":"Alla","lastName":"Korzhova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2034-9010","documentHash":"06ef622a-1b21-47ea-b0c3-320488de66da"},{"objectId":"623af9492467f02a86c525a4","name":"Svitlana","lastName":"Vasyuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1569-9374","documentHash":"a191da66-db76-4dac-ba3c-7b8460a925c3"},{"objectId":"623af9492467f02a86c525a3","name":"Kateryna","lastName":"Miedviedieva","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7260-5728","documentHash":"2eee7e80-94b2-4e68-bcac-e6721f72738c"}],"doi":"10.15587/2519-4852.2022.253542"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Lawsone","Lawsonia inermis","henna","analgesic","anti-inflammatory","medicinal plants","phytotherapy","herb","pharmacognosy","pharmacology"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61b85a542467f00dcba7497c","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"University of Thi-Qar","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623b0ac72467f02a86c57e95","623b0ac72467f02a86c57e93"]},{"id":"62336c392467f0713d574558","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"University of Kerbala","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623b0ac72467f02a86c57e94"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"The analgesic and anti-inflammatory effect of lawsone isolated from Lawsonia inermis","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"60e6fa81c9aff2974850cc6b","mniswId":"29703","title":"SCIENCERISE: PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCE","doi":null,"issn":"2519-4852","eissn":null,"websiteLink":"http://journals.uran.ua/sr_pharm","metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"fa974751-179b-4d0e-90e3-97c8c7b8a4ca"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"623b0ac72467f02a86c57e90","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["623b0ac72467f02a86c57e93","623b0ac72467f02a86c57e94","623b0ac72467f02a86c57e95"]},"issue":"1(35)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This study aimed to assess the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of lawsone isolated from henna leaves (Lawsonia inermis). \n\nMethods: A total of 120 healthy adult mice (weighing about 25±5 g) were included in this study.

The hot plate was used to determine the analgesic effect, while the anti-inflammatory effect was determined by the ability of the compound to minimize the inflammation and edema caused by the injection of carrageenan. \n\nResults: Lawsone was isolated from Lawsonia inermis. A Stuart SMP10 digital melting point apparatus was used for measuring all melting points. Infrared spectrometer FT-IR 400D was used for measuring/recording IR spectra (KBr) which the frequency of absorption was represented as cm−1. For 1H-NMR spectrum recording, a Bruk-spectrophotometer of 400 MHz was used with internal TMS standard, with deuterated Ś 2.51 ppm for acetone-d6, remained solvent signals as well as 13C.NMR was used. TLC was utilized as adsorbent, UV light, or iodine-completed visualization to verify compounds' purities.\n\nThe LD50 of the oral lawsone was 96 mg/kg, and the highest dosage that did not kill any of the experimental animals was 80 mg/kg, which was used to investigate lawsone's analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects.\n\nLawsone and aspirin possessed an analgesic effect compared to the control group (p<0.0001 and p<0.001, respectively); however, lawsone induced a potent analgesic effect compared to aspirin (p<0.1). In contrast, Lawsone and aspirin exerted an anti-inflammatory effect (p<0.05) compared to the control group and were equipotent in carrageenan-induced hind paw edema.\n\nConclusion: It is concluded that lawsone possesses analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, which endorse the practical medical importance of Lawsonia inermis. The latter is widely used traditionally for these purposes own to its cost-effectiveness and safety; however, further studies are required to determine the systemic safety of lawsone"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085905","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623aef552467f02a86c5000d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":"1(35)","doi":null,"documentHash":"08271846-50dd-4f90-ac8a-4a2fbdf8185f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"77-84","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/sr_pharm/article/download/253555/250791","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623b0ac72467f02a86c57e95","name":"Narjes","lastName":"Alfuraiji","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-5338-6443","documentHash":"43b83777-d1aa-4cff-9223-bd4e01000cec"},{"objectId":"623b0ac72467f02a86c57e94","name":"Tayseer Ali","lastName":"Talab","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8262-9851","documentHash":"89a3d590-db78-4391-a089-df6bb2634d08"},{"objectId":"623b0ac72467f02a86c57e93","name":"Ali Esmail","lastName":"Al-Snafi","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0239-028X","documentHash":"d04e252d-b017-47b6-bbc3-526d7b4e3420"}],"doi":"10.15587/2519-4852.2022.253555"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["elm yellows","genetic variability","phylogenetic analysis","phytoplasma","sequencing"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709288878c28a0473976fc"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Multigene characterization of 'Candidatus Phytoplasma ulmi'‐related isolates associated with elm yellows disease of Ulmus minor Mill. in Poland","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145477d2f","mniswId":"6736","title":"FOREST PATHOLOGY","doi":null,"issn":"1437-4781","eissn":"1439-0329","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"a30dcc2a-220d-4bb6-9529-0608a6e2c0d7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62415baf2467f0290d2c7f76","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709288878c28a0473976fc","62415baf2467f0290d2c7f79","62415baf2467f0290d2c7f7a"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"‘Candidatus Phytoplasma ulmi’, associated with elm yellows, shoot proliferation and dieback of elm (Ulmus) species trees was reported in United States of America and in many European countries. Until now its presence in elm trees in Poland has not been detected. In 2017–2018, during visual inspection of elm trees grown in four areas of southern Silesia Province leaf yellowing, shoot proliferation, phloem necrosis and dieback of branches were observed on European field elm trees grown in nature reserve close to the border with the Czech Republic. Phloem tissue from shoots collected from six symptomatic and twenty asymptomatic trees was used for extraction nucleic acids. Nested PCR with primer pairs amplifying 16Sr RNA sequences of phytoplasmas resulted in specific products for samples from six symptomatic trees however the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and phylogenetic analyses of the sequenced products did not allow to clearly classify newly detected isolates within the elm yellows group (16SrV). The isolates found in Poland clustered on the boundary of the 16SrV-A and 16SrV-C ribosomal subgroups. Sequence analyses of less conservative genes rpl22- rps3 and secY confirmed the affiliation of the phytoplasma isolates found in Poland to ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma ulmi’; however, the significant nucleotide changes in signature sequences for all three genes were shown compared with EY1T reference strain. Surprisingly, the newly detected isolates shared a common origin and were phylogenetically closer to EY1-SRB and EY10-SRB strains from Serbia as well as NK16 strain from Croatia strains than to the EYCZ1 strain from the Czech Republic. This is the first report on detection and molecular characterization of ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma ulmi’ in Poland based on sequence analysis of three genetic

paper analyses the regularization of an ill-conditioned mathematical model in a single-epoch precise GNSS positioning. The regularization parameter (RP) is selected as a parameter that minimizes the criterion of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) function. The crucial for RP estimation is to ensure stable initial least-squares (LS) estimates to replace the unknown quadratic matrix of actual values with the LS covariance matrix. For this purpose, two different data models are proposed, and two research scenarios are formed. Two regularized LS estimations are tested against the non-regularized LS approach. The first one is the classic regularization of LS estimation. In turn, the second one is its iterative counterpart. For the LS estimator of iterative regularization, regularized bias is significantly lower while the overall accuracy is improved in the sense of MSE. The regularized variance-covariance matrix of better precision can mitigate the impact of regularized bias on integer least-squares (ILS) estimation up to some extent. Therefore, iterative LS regularization is well-designed for single-epoch integer ambiguity resolution (AR). Nevertheless, the performance of the ILS estimator is studied in the context of the probability of correct integer AR in the presence of regularized bias."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085913","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":null,"issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jag-2021-0031/html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602e13159543c7410626ebc5","name":"Artur","lastName":"Fischer","uuid":"4D5C370A1D3E78CDAF14D2E60D364C56545B949341761E0EDD9364532208B41691A5D325C6F56EE5A681293ACA3932A1FF7787C268F418C06B24FFA09E79D1C8","orcidId":"0000-0002-4093-6773","documentHash":"e4ee1ecd-8cf7-4f07-9eae-18f6a2d48e43"},{"objectId":"5e70945e878c28a0473bb8ce","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Nowel","uuid":"77AF809D87E775D4C95FA02FCA7501C5993642CDC35F1FD491FDB0192741476E27F76E4935CBECF4F1BADDDCB3CB111034E8E7F28E736EB14F8ECD7843E6B047","orcidId":"0000-0001-5593-2428","documentHash":"a698cb50-d066-49f6-b330-defcf4b73fb5"},{"objectId":"5e709217878c28a04738fd42","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Cellmer","uuid":"2F815BEEE75990BA38E86FFE026E5C410DF564E6BD4016290A04A2A49AE52751F311DE9A6745136052CD51605FBE21DE1C49D4A039C9D504D6CAFB15328391F8","orcidId":"0000-0002-2614-8017","documentHash":"f1e13a64-7b79-434b-98ac-9f74f54a4e9d"}],"doi":"10.1515/jag-2021-0031"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["urea","large granules","run-in granulation","regime and technological parameters","temperature regime","rotational speed"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b6878c28a047385f0e","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Sumy State University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623b26ca2467f02a86c60de1","623b26ca2467f02a86c60de2","623b26ca2467f02a86c60de5","623b26ca2467f02a86c60de6","623b26ca2467f02a86c60de3","623b26ca2467f02a86c60de4","623b26ca2467f02a86c60de7","623b26ca2467f02a86c60de8"]},{"id":"61a5e2212467f0269e786fa7","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"The General Directorate Education of Iraq","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623b26ca2467f02a86c60de0"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Research of plate granulator operation modes in the production of coarse carbamide granules","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c28514547a5c9","mniswId":"1002078","title":"Technology audit and production reserves [ Технологический аудит и резервы производства ]","doi":null,"issn":"2226-3780","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b2ddb9ee-c11c-4559-bf8e-ac90b931d78e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-14","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"623b26ca2467f02a86c60ddd","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["623b26ca2467f02a86c60de0","623b26ca2467f02a86c60de1","623b26ca2467f02a86c60de2","623b26ca2467f02a86c60de3","623b26ca2467f02a86c60de4","623b26ca2467f02a86c60de5","623b26ca2467f02a86c60de6","623b26ca2467f02a86c60de7","623b26ca2467f02a86c60de8"]},"issue":"3(63)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The object of research is granulation of mineral fertilizers by the rolling method. One of the most problematic places is the uncertainty of the conditions of the temperature regime of granulation. The paper considers the technology for obtaining enlarged urea granules of prolonged action. It is indicated that an increase in the diameter of the granules to 7–10 mm increases the efficiency of the use of mineral fertilizers by the consumer. It is proposed to obtain large carbamide granules by rolling in a plate granulator. It is indicated that the setting of the optimal operating parameters of the tray granulator is an important factor in the efficient operation of the equipment. A scheme of a pilot plant for granulating mineral fertilizers is presented, a methodology for conducting experimental studies and design parameters of a plate granulator are described. It is indicated that in the process of experimental studies, the design parameters changed: the tilt angle of the plate, the height of the side and the frequency of rotation of the plate, the angle of opening of the spray jet by the hydraulic nozzle. In the process of research, the influence of regime and technological parameters, namely, the temperature of the layer on the plate is studied. As a result of experimental studies, the optimal ranges of design and regime-technological parameters for obtaining enlarged carbamide granules in a plate granulator were revealed. The influence of the location of the nozzle for spraying the melt on the layer relative to the plane of the plate is shown, which results in the particle size distribution of the granular product. It is indicated that a higher content of the commercial fraction in the finished product is observed when the layer in the left sector of the upper part of the plate is irrigated by the rising melt. A technique for determining the static strength of the obtained carbamide granules is given. A calculation equation for determining the static strength of a granule is presented. A diagram of a laboratory device for determining the static strength of granules is presented, which made it possible to determine the values of the static strength of granules for individual fractions, namely: for coarse, fine and commercial fractions.

Because dynamic loads were regularly applied, frequency response was examined.  In this study after verification of this computer simulation with experimental results and the results showed it was confidence 95 %. This percentage confidence allows proceeding numerical analysis. Deformation of the entire structure has been computed and found to be 10 mm, which is the maximum amount of overall deformation that can be caused by the applied load, In the Y-axis, a dynamic load was applied. The imposed dynamic load has been studied numerically and interpreted in terms of shear stresses. As a result of the maximum applied load, the maximum shear stress is 10 MPa. The complete composite construction was subjected to Von-Mises stress measurements. The structure's ability to withstand these stresses was determined by conducting a series of tests. The greatest von mises stress that can be applied in this study was 40 MPa. An investigation of how to react to vibration has already been carried out. In the numerical results, it was found that the reaction to the vibration was inconsistent. In terms of amplitude, the highest values may be found at 200 Hz, while the lowest values can be found at 20 Hz."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085936","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6237120d2467f0495b042233","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"7 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"1b2964f3-519e-44e5-843c-363b353cdf2a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"42-47","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/253545/250807","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623716582467f0495b042e51","name":"Zaid Ali","lastName":"Abbas","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2416-1274","documentHash":"1a7f24a1-b9bc-4069-ab18-7997487cd6f3"},{"objectId":"623716582467f0495b042e50","name":"Shaymaa Abdul Khader","lastName":"Al-Jumaili","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2211-8734","documentHash":"f9059672-035f-4c77-8212-8b1615a542e2"},{"objectId":"623716582467f0495b042e4f","name":"Emad Kamil","lastName":"Hussein","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3831-1659","documentHash":"bc8720af-15f2-4fca-841a-684c304a7c84"},{"objectId":"623716582467f0495b042e4e","name":"Kussay Ahmed","lastName":"Subhi","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-5132-859X","documentHash":"49a380c1-6b81-4a60-934f-7a3a0c0a094c"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.253545"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["vehicle","air suspension","air spring","throttle","additional reservoir","simulation","damping factor"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61b1e65c2467f0304b90e205","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Hetman Petro Sahaidachnyi National Army Academy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62371c052467f0495b0439a6","62371c052467f0495b0439a5"]},{"id":"5f2a799f2467f01fd1357212","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"National Technical University “Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute”","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62371c052467f0495b0439a8","62371c052467f0495b0439a2","62371c052467f0495b0439a4","62371c052467f0495b0439a3"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Improving the damping of vehicle vibration by improving pneumatic springs","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62371c052467f0495b04399f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62371c052467f0495b0439a2","62371c052467f0495b0439a3","62371c052467f0495b0439a4","62371c052467f0495b0439a5","62371c052467f0495b0439a6","62371c052467f0495b0439a7","62371c052467f0495b0439a8","62371c052467f0495b0439a9"]},"issue":"7(115)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"It is known that the air suspension of vehicles, in which diaphragm-type air springs are used as an elastic element, do not provide the necessary vibration damping. The reason for this is that such air springs have a relatively large passive part. As a result, a relatively small mass of compressed air crosses through the throttle installed between the air spring and the additional reservoir. This mass of air contains thermal energy, into which the energy of vibrations, which enters through the walls of the additional reservoir into the environment, has turned. This is interpreted as vibration damping, which is insufficient due to the low air mass.\n\nTherefore, hydraulic vibration dampers are installed parallel to the diaphragm air springs, which complicates and increases the cost of the vehicle. Increasing the damping properties of such air suspensions could eliminate these hydraulic vibration dampers, which would reduce costs and simplify operation.\n\nAn air suspension with an improved air spring has been proposed, which has an increased effective area and a reduced \"passive\" capacity, an empirical formula has been built to determine its damping coefficient, as well as an expression for the stiffness coefficient. Mathematical modeling of oscillations of vehicles with different designs of pneumatic springs was carried out in order to improve their damping. The mathematical model takes into account the change in the parameters of the air spring during vibrations. The study was carried out for the diesel train DL-02. Using mathematical modeling, the effectiveness of the air suspension with an improved air spring has been proven: its damping index reaches 0.263, and the vibration damping coefficient is 45,859 kg/s, which corresponds to the values ​​​​recommended for vehicles."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085941","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6237120d2467f0495b042233","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"7

The need for research is caused by the fact that the existing approaches to reengineering business processes in an application for construction enterprises require significant adjustments. The reengineering of a construction enterprise as a target project should be coordinated with the projects and works executed by a construction enterprise.\n\nThe proposed analytical support makes it possible to determine for each of the construction enterprises an alternative to reengineering adapted for its needs. Modules as part of the proposed analytical support implement a single algorithm of unambiguously formalized substantiation of the construction enterprise renovation project – through a developer reengineering project. This toolset allows rationalizing and adjusting decisions on the coordination of determinative characteristics of the above project – the essence of changes, their duration, estimated cost, investment stages.\n\nThe presented study provides a clearly formalized management technology for evaluating and selecting reengineering options, determining in advance the future benefits of reengineering transformations, namely, functional-technological, technological, technical, managerial, and economic changes. The created analytical support makes it possible to perform successful administrative support of a reengineering project.

The forecasting method modification essentially involves an adaptive technique for determining the weight of the correction of the previous forecast, taking into consideration the recurrent state of the predicted process in time. To investigate the accuracy of the forecasting method, a test model of the process dynamics was determined in the form of a rectangular pulse with unit amplitude. In addition, a model of additive masking noise was defined in the form of a discrete Gaussian process with a zero mean and a variable value of the mean square deviation. Based on determining the exponentially smoothed values of current absolute forecasting errors, the dynamics of forecast accuracy were examined for the modified and self-adjusting methods. It was found that for the mean quadratic deviation of the masking noise equal to 0.9, the smoothed absolute prediction error for the modified method does not exceed 23 %; for the self-adjusting method – 42 %. This means that the prediction accuracy for the modified method is about twice as high. In the case of an average square deviation of masking noise of 0.1, the smoothed absolute prediction error for the modified and self-adjusting methods is approximately the same and does not exceed 10 %. That means that at a low level of masking noise, both prediction methods provide approximately the same accuracy. However, with an increase in the level of masking noise, the self-adjusting method significantly loses the accuracy of the forecast to the proposed modified method."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085948","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623456c22467f00ffe94c7ec","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"4 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"939ff66d-3a56-48aa-bc6e-8015b54df435"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"29-36","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/252076/250716","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623460e22467f00ffe950a50","name":"Valentyna","lastName":"Ivanova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6121-6978","documentHash":"ba8c8bad-edf0-48cd-a52d-8627fcb207ac"},{"objectId":"623460e22467f00ffe950a4f","name":"Olga","lastName":"Mukhina","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1815-1988","documentHash":"6e5aae2d-6552-41c7-a9ed-5e8c6f52b512"},{"objectId":"623460e22467f00ffe950a4e","name":"Svitlana","lastName":"Hryshko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5054-3893","documentHash":"32741195-fc70-4048-b739-a712c488c668"},{"objectId":"623460e22467f00ffe950a4d","name":"Svyatoslav","lastName":"Manzhura","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9258-9320","documentHash":"87a0102f-8aea-4d29-96d6-cd8ba41c2aa0"},{"objectId":"623460e22467f00ffe950a4c","name":"Kostiantyn","lastName":"Fisun","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8363-0416","documentHash":"6aecc6e9-6cc8-4299-b780-9167bf8b6c3f"},{"objectId":"623460e22467f00ffe950a4b","name":"Yuliia","lastName":"Bezuhla","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4022-2807","documentHash":"893f4200-df6b-484f-843a-91bcf632bd67"},{"objectId":"623460e22467f00ffe950a4a","name":"Kostiantyn","lastName":"Karpets","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6388-7647","documentHash":"0b78d3cb-dd58-42b1-9e79-964430dd4cab"},{"objectId":"623460e22467f00ffe950a49","name":"Olekcii","lastName":"Krainiukov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5264-3118","documentHash":"14574bd2-00e7-4270-bf9d-016db70dd14a"},{"objectId":"623460e22467f00ffe950a48","name":"Vladimir","lastName":"Andronov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7486-482X","documentHash":"02353ab7-b28e-4e3d-9392-d19451f1dd6e"},{"objectId":"623460e22467f00ffe950a47","name":"Boris","lastName":"Pospelov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0957-3839","documentHash":"6ba61240-d4bf-4567-a6d1-20f2d57cb4a0"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.252076"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Abdominal aorta aneurysm","Blood hemodynamics","CFD","Flow Diverter stent","Blood flow","Fusiform aneurysm"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","uid":"bFu05p5ztjwwaFAGdS4n0Sw","uuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","parentUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de2f","rootUuid":"fa448bd2-74d9-47de-b11b-eba7e1938d12","name":"Politechnika Łódzka","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709268878c28a047395317","5e7092b9878c28a04739b88a","5e709334878c28a0473a4d5e","5e7093da878c28a0473b1e37"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Blood flow through the fusiform aneurysm treated with the Flow Diverter stent – Numerical investigations","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477324","mniswId":"2396","title":"Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering","doi":null,"issn":"0208-5216","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"e84151cc-2877-472f-bac0-e95ca6fda2f6"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":null,"releaseDateMonth":"FEBRUARY","releaseDateYear":2022,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"623836d52467f067af116c5a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093da878c28a0473b1e37","5e7092b9878c28a04739b88a","5e709334878c28a0473a4d5e","5e709268878c28a047395317","6735f151fdbe832d85a48ea1","6735f151fdbe832d85a48ea2","6735f151fdbe832d85a48ea3"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The Flow Diverter is one of the methods used in the treatment of a fusiform aneurysm.\nWhile this method is popular in treating anomalies of the cerebral vasculature, it is not\ncommonly used in the treatment of aortic aneurysms.

The idea of this project is to study and implement an end-to-end system of automatic speech recognition using machine learning methods, as well as to develop new mathematical models and algorithms for solving the problem of automatic speech recognition for agglutinative (Turkic) languages.\n\nMany research papers have shown that deep learning methods make it easier to train automatic speech recognition systems that use an end-to-end approach. This method can also train an automatic speech recognition system directly, that is, without manual work with raw signals. Despite the good recognition quality, this model has some drawbacks. These disadvantages are based on the need for a large amount of data for training. This is a serious problem for low-data languages, especially Turkic languages such as Kazakh and Azerbaijani. To solve this problem, various methods are needed to apply. Some methods are used for end-to-end speech recognition of languages belonging to the group of languages of the same family (agglutinative languages). Method for low-resource languages is transfer learning, and for large resources – multi-task learning. To increase efficiency and quickly solve the problem associated with a limited resource, transfer learning was used for the end-to-end model. The transfer learning method helped to fit a model trained on the Kazakh dataset to the Azerbaijani dataset. Thereby, two language corpora were trained simultaneously. Conducted experiments with two corpora show that transfer learning can reduce the symbol error rate, phoneme error rate (PER), by 14.23 % compared to baseline models (DNN+HMM, WaveNet, and CNC+LM). Therefore, the realized model with the transfer method can be used to recognize other low-resource languages."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085957","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6234838c2467f00ffe9659c3","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"9 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"089b239a-8df4-4132-9d11-1db8fbe09c4f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"84-92","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/252801/250760","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6234a28a2467f00ffe96f95b","name":"Bagashar","lastName":"Zhumazhanov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5035-9076","documentHash":"f117ea73-30ac-44f8-8994-d0a084a52726"},{"objectId":"6234a28a2467f00ffe96f95a","name":"Akbayan","lastName":"Bekarystankyzy","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3984-2718","documentHash":"efa7b4c6-af68-4368-92c0-e7180b14fc92"},{"objectId":"6234a28a2467f00ffe96f959","name":"Dina","lastName":"Oralbekova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4975-6493","documentHash":"00d134e2-eff3-43c7-8bf8-0cff3f3e6817"},{"objectId":"6234a28a2467f00ffe96f958","name":"Keylan","lastName":"Alimhan","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0766-2229","documentHash":"39f880c2-5749-4cc1-9051-8b93d7ea2d55"},{"objectId":"6234a2892467f00ffe96f957","name":"Orken","lastName":"Mamyrbayev","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8318-3794","documentHash":"ddfd7522-3e94-42d3-a308-f2b4afb474e1"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.252801"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["sprężarkowa pompa ciepła","budowa","zasada działania","współczynniki wydajności"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","uid":"byIMgWh_9RUyyDH3dMzNDyw","uuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna im.

At 100 m from the sound source, the noise load level decreases by 13.4 % in the case of the car moving over a bridge, and by 13.3 % when driving a car along an open section of the road.\n\nIt has been found that the noise level on bridges exceeds the level of noise pollution from the road to 10 dB, which is explained by the propagation of different frequencies of noise load from the bridge.\n\nIt has been determined that due to the special nature of sound waves, diffraction through noise screens does not change all frequencies evenly. High frequencies diffract to a smaller degree while lower frequencies diffract deeper into the \"shadow\" zone behind the screen. Therefore, the screen is more effective at reducing sound waves with a high frequency compared to sound waves with lower frequencies.\n\nExperimental studies into the effectiveness of noise-protective screens made of metal perforated structures on sections of public roads were carried out, taking into consideration distances from noise sources to noise load measurement sites.\n\nIt is established that noise-proof screens made of steel (perforated) sheet reduce the level of noise load from vehicles to the environment by up to 14 %.\n\nIt was found that when driving cars on the road, the equivalent sound level at a distance of 1 m in front of the noise protection screen is 88.6 dBA while the maximum sound level at a distance of 1 m in front of the noise protection screen is 103.9 dBA.\n\nIt has been established that in the presence of a drain hole in the noise protection screen, its acoustic efficiency is reduced to 3 dBA."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085977","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62371c532467f0495b043ddb","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"10 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"00866e92-d0a0-418a-ae61-252ac34eb210"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"55-64","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/253389/250702","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623726d92467f0495b04565f","name":"Artur","lastName":"Onyshchenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1040-4530","documentHash":"55927ea2-79df-4cd9-9556-537205504729"},{"objectId":"623726d92467f0495b04565e","name":"Oleksndr","lastName":"Tokin","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7353-4228","documentHash":"932667dc-c480-4266-b9bf-550e054f9c54"},{"objectId":"623726d92467f0495b04565d","name":"Sergii","lastName":"Laslov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6961-8613","documentHash":"9720473f-49cc-47c8-8daf-21e243c98729"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.253389"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Health literacy","health competencies","doctor-patient relationship","health \nawareness","patient empowerment."]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Health Literacy and Its Role in Relational Communication  with Patients: The Study of Literature and Concepts","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d5e878c28514547dc39","mniswId":"22361","title":"European Research Studies Journal","doi":null,"issn":"1108-2976","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"e13ec1b4-9fe9-4c4d-9da5-bd3082096ed5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61f04e302467f0312284bb69","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7091ff878c28a04738e4f2"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Purpose: The article aims to present the issue of health literacy in shaping relational communication with patients. The specific goal was to review the literature on health \r\ncompetencies and the doctor-patient relationship. \r\nDesign/Methodology/Approach: The article bases on a literature study in healthcare, management, and health economics. The study of literature and concepts was carried out based on the desk research method, using professional, scientific databases. The article's author contributed to the development of management and quality sciences by researching the role of health literacy in doctor-patient relational communication. The area of health competencies about the behavior of patients in contact with medical professionals requires further analysis. Findings: Health literacy enables doctors to better communicate with patients and provide them with relevant information to manage and improve their health. Health skills allow patients to control their wellbeing by making informed and wise health care choices and strengthening their relationship with their doctors. Practical Implications: Raising health awareness should become the primary goal of many health systems to protect patients from harm. Health skills should enable the individual to extract knowledge, derive meaning from different sources, and apply new information to changing circumstances. Through health competencies, using a wide range of skills, it is necessary to improve people's ability to act on the data obtained to lead a healthier life. Originality/Value: The presented approach to the topic organizes the information on health literacy and expands doctor-patient communication issues.

The research was conducted from 2016–2018 on arable land inthe south-eastern part of Poland. The selected soils were cultivated in conventional tillage (C_Ts),simplified tillage (S_Ts), and organic farming (O_Fs) systems. The analyses were performed in soilfrom the soil surface layers (up to 25 cm depth) of the experimental plots. The highest mean contentsof soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and organic matter fractions were determined in soils subjectedto the simplified tillage system throughout the experimental period. During the study period, organiccarbon concentration on surface soil layers under simplified tillage systems was 31 and 127% higherthan the soil under conventional tillage systems and organic farming systems, respectively. Also, thetotal nitrogen concentration in those soils was more than 40% and 120% higher than conventionaltillage systems and organic farming systems, respectively. Moreover, these soils were characterisedby a progressive decline in SOC and Nt resources over the study years. There was no significant effectof the analysed tillage systems on the C:N ratio. The tillage systems induced significant differences inthe activity of the analysed soil enzymes, i.e., dehydrogenase (DH) and catalase (CAT). The highestDH activity throughout the experiment was recorded in the O_Fs soils, and the mean value of thisparameter was in the range of 6.01–6.11μmol TPF·kg−1·h−1. There were no significant differencesin the CAT values between the variants of the experiment. The results confirm that, regardless ofother treatments, such as the use of organic fertilisers, tillage has a negative impact on the contentof SOC and organic matter fractions in the O_Fs system. All simplifications in tillage reducing theinterference with the soil surface layer and the use of organic fertilisers contribute to improvementof soil properties and enhancement of biological activity, which helps to maintain its productivityand fertility"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085985","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61d431cf2467f0627d077fec","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"12","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"f75e7399-5df9-48a8-bced-9ecdfd23d8d2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"208","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/1/208/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"61f0381b2467f031228456db","name":"Renata","lastName":"Pawlak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"051eef86-6faa-4a57-ae7b-7c181312431f"},{"objectId":"5e7094c0878c28a0473c3105","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Szostek","uuid":"EC54DCCDF14FADD030A98787C0B2BC53349A5833CDD2C18E227C7991CE787ED9184C466E21BBEA6C74C81FD828C8A25C8EA5A9FAE1C4BF6F3BBA47983C840830","orcidId":"0000-0003-0312-7640","documentHash":"6a3cf3a6-ecbc-4a59-bfc1-0f8fb5ebf6e5"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b812c","name":"Anna","lastName":"Ilek","uuid":"FE72D38D0D4EC89F13FDB6833903CC150FF7E358BFE4AA72B09478D114AA5EFBAA14F04EE8FDD1AE083B73C397E85E9479BAE93427C45F68CCA4DD3BE7FAD56C","orcidId":"0000-0003-3787-0432","documentHash":"4c97fc65-459f-4279-b716-7861cbd5075e"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fb26","name":"Jadwiga","lastName":"Stanek-Tarkowska","uuid":"A28D48AE07D676FD7E25A968588EA1B36A2389B230F5FFFEA0BA0EB4637830C6BFC0A12B212F00F982C210C8CD27C6849FF3DED285F30B213194655CF4C0279F","orcidId":"0000-0003-1664-2625","documentHash":"6638892a-cd69-4f24-be56-b9270d3d99be"},{"objectId":"5e709214878c28a04738fac8","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Szpunar-Krok","uuid":"5A508BB8344FEF45AE24B010A9CE80F6341FE1CB47CBA1F76D114A54E6048A96EC11606EEC46996A4DEF7E428F6D02FA38DB90377FD9ED91EA54A381C4AB7CC4","orcidId":"0000-0001-5788-3631","documentHash":"34e967e2-e3ce-491b-9a2d-3461882c11f3"}],"doi":"10.3390/agronomy12010208"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Cardiovascular disease","Statistics","European Society of Cardiology","Health infrastructure","Service provision","Risk factors","Mortality","Morbidity"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","uid":"byA-JkHm2bCn9kbaIrhLEug","uuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","parentUuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de9d","rootUuid":"8233db0e-f39a-47a6-a03c-5004abc36afc","name":"Instytut Medycyny Doświadczalnej i Klinicznej im.

Methods and results Statistics pertaining to 2019, or the latest available year, are presented. Data sources include the World Health Organization, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the World Bank, and novel ESC sponsored data on human and capital infrastructure and cardiovascular healthcare delivery. New material in this report includes sociodemographic and environmental determinants of CVD, rheumatic heart disease, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, left-sided valvular heart disease, the advocacy potential of these CVD statistics, and progress towards World Health Organization (WHO) 2025 targets for non-communicable diseases. Salient observations in this report: (i) Females born in ESC member countries in 2018 are expected to live 80.8 years and males 74.8 years. Life expectancy is longer in high income (81.6 years) compared with middle-income (74.2 years) countries. (ii) In 2018, high-income countries spent, on average, four times more on healthcare than middle-income countries. (iii) The median PM2.5 concentrations in 2019 were over twice as high in middle-income ESC member countries compared with high-income countries and exceeded the EU air quality standard in 14 countries, all middle-income. (iv) In 2016, more than one in five adults across the ESC member countries were obese with similar prevalence in high and low-income countries. The prevalence of obesity has more than doubled over the past 35 years. (v) The burden of CVD falls hardest on middle-income ESC member countries where estimated incidence rates are similar to 30% higher compared with high-income countries. This is reflected in disability-adjusted life years due to CVD which are nearly four times as high in middle-income compared with high-income countries. (vi) The incidence of calcific aortic valve disease has increased seven-fold during the last 30 years, with age-standardized rates four times as high in high-income compared with middle-income countries. (vii) Although the total number of CVD deaths across all countries far exceeds the number of cancer deaths for both sexes, there are 15 ESC member countries in which cancer accounts for more deaths than CVD in males and five-member countries in which cancer accounts for more deaths than CVD in females. (viii) The under-resourced status of middle-income countries is associated with a severe procedural deficit compared with high-income countries in terms of coronary intervention, ablation procedures, device implantation, and cardiac surgical procedures. Conclusion Risk factors and unhealthy behaviours are potentially reversible, and this provides a huge opportunity to address the health inequalities across ESC member countries that are highlighted in this report. It seems clear, however, that efforts to seize this opportunity are falling short and present evidence suggests that most of the WHO NCD targets for 2025 are unlikely to be met across ESC member countries."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085988","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"43","pagesFromTo":"716-799","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-pdf/43/8/716/42574620/ehab892.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623494662467f00ffe96d943","name":"Stephan","lastName":"Achenbach","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b9c10812-04ff-47ef-aa23-a03917b7ef45"},{"objectId":"623494662467f00ffe96d942","name":"Franz","lastName":"Weidinger","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"75eb89db-c7c6-466f-adb1-4638da78020c"},{"objectId":"623494662467f00ffe96d941","name":"Elias

Even though several studies demonstrated that HA (which is influenced by the crowd) decreased in recent years, the empty stadia caused by COVID-19 restrictions offered unique situations to explore and quantify HA. For this reason, we aimed to assess HA in two seasons of the major Italian Championships. We conducted an observational study with the data from the last three seasons of the Italian football championship A–B series, analyzing a total of 2.964 individual game scores. To quantify the HA, the number of points won at home was calculated as a percentage of the total number of points won, home and away. In every season and for every team classification, HA was found (scored points > 50% in home matches). We reported a difference in HA median score for Serie B. Additionally, a difference was found in Serie A for middle-ranking HA median scores in the two seasons compared (p-value = 0.017), which was similarly found in Serie B (p-value = 0.009). The number of penalties was lower in the season with a crowd compared to one without a crowd (p = 0.001). The HA did not disappear in empty stadiums, so there must be other contributing factors. Additionally, we found that the referees were biased by the presence of the crowd in favor of the home teams, and this result could be considered by the football association during referees’ training and formation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085991","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6239bced2467f009d3ffbeb1","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"10","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"b40e07ad-d0c7-41e8-a912-0e70a7b1cd6c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"10","pagesFromTo":"17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4663/10/2/17/htm","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6239bced2467f009d3ffbeaf","name":"Vittoria","lastName":"Carnevale Pellino","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2299-6366","documentHash":"ca52750d-a85c-41a7-b8a4-8e8a4917354b"},{"objectId":"6239bced2467f009d3ffbeae","name":"Mariangela V.","lastName":"Puci","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b602107d-e7fa-4566-96aa-806bb2c04fa9"},{"objectId":"6239bced2467f009d3ffbead","name":"Nicola","lastName":"Lovecchio","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7a4e8cf7-b2c7-4acf-bba4-6f146d29f43e"},{"objectId":"6239bced2467f009d3ffbeac","name":"Dario","lastName":"Silvestri","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cec9a9c1-9b2e-4817-9634-b14c427c89c5"},{"objectId":"6239bced2467f009d3ffbeaa","name":"Luca","lastName":"Marin","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4185-7428","documentHash":"99446700-3aaa-4177-8508-d93766b635e2"},{"objectId":"6239bced2467f009d3ffbea9","name":"Alessandro","lastName":"Gatti","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8e6edf8a-51db-4d7c-b8b7-8e38d4f004db"},{"objectId":"6239bced2467f009d3ffbea8","name":"Ottavia E.","lastName":"Ferraro","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4398-4885","documentHash":"4d98ac35-c77b-49f2-a75a-5102ee28c84a"},{"objectId":"6239bced2467f009d3ffbea7","name":"Matteo","lastName":"Vandoni","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3405-9364","documentHash":"bd4785a2-fc75-4e80-800f-1af2fd3b5d44"},{"objectId":"5fded4d7085dcb71a319c170","name":"Matteo","lastName":"Giuriato","uuid":"3BA2AA1646C7AEDDC2A1A45FEB98E2408EB2977748FC52631691B060D0979186178946AA9C61EC7981CFAB642042A1E428416D6A519E6C57D54762E231157AA2","orcidId":"0000-0002-4829-1447","documentHash":"b718c308-9081-4fb2-99ca-ab4876c0b437"}],"doi":"10.3390/sports10020017"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","uid":"bmfkTgrYux51kKuOA70Q27Q","uuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","parentUuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dedc","rootUuid":"b464c7a7-69dc-45c8-8163-705096a92b18","name":"Instytut Hodowli i Aklimatyzacji Roślin - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093fc878c28a0473b467b","5e709400878c28a0473b4ae2","5e70943f878c28a0473b8b9e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Genetic Variability in a Population of Oilseed Rape DH Lines Developed from F1 Hybrids of a Cross between Black- and Yellow-Seeded DH Lines.

We attempted to obtain such varieties by crossing two DH lines of winter oilseed rape of different origin, H2-26 and Z-114, which have black and yellow seeds, respectively. The cross was followed by in vitro androgenesis, resulting in a population of 44 DH lines that were studied in a field experiment over two seasons. The following characters of the resulting seeds were analysed: fat, protein, neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre, glucosinolate content and seed colour. The main objective was to check the variability of the DH lines obtained from F1 hybrid black- and yellow-seeded oilseed rape. The range of variability of the DH lines significantly exceeded the range of variability of the parental lines for all traits. These experiments showed that by choosing the appropriate parental genotypes of oilseed rape it is possible to break the negative correlation between protein and fat content. The high level of heritability of traits related to seed quality raises the possibility of improving breeding lines through selection based on phenotype."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085998","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"340","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/12/3/340/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623da8a72467f074f897d921","name":"Zygmunt","lastName":"Kaczmarek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4801ee6f-95a0-4239-be2e-c4d24e1f365d"},{"objectId":"5e70943f878c28a0473b8b9e","name":"Laurencja","lastName":"Szała","uuid":"C72D661B3A934D79A3EF70555F01BF41414A0956A3520F3F954B6F164013C5E72FDB7F034C3B6EE34B4E737B76A4D73DA0D031B242BAC0B942E4D9BA508CE315","orcidId":"0000-0001-9157-7638","documentHash":"ce9de5ce-3497-458f-b27c-8cb8acbf7b62"},{"objectId":"5e709400878c28a0473b4ae2","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Matuszczak","uuid":"5DDC6E13AF8F738B6F8ADD7610F1530B8E0BAA8349D1BB8BFF6CB8A316CDF311AD2BF187E9B0F6D67338D5F336A483F53BD51BA5607485FFBA2340A90C7565F0","orcidId":"0000-0003-0712-7568","documentHash":"f111ca90-9c01-49a2-acf6-5e7bd06680c9"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b467b","name":"Teresa","lastName":"Cegielska-Taras","uuid":"77AFEF0DEFC74F133C3346495B4E470A5AE10AD9BC43C9D8D12C87805B6C6FB9043100D7836DBDCCA3AA3B8CE2EEC054DE83707E505D5D1E1BF30FB9B089B952","orcidId":"0000-0002-6002-9281","documentHash":"0dde4cf7-70fe-43a8-876e-45fb87b9dd2f"}],"doi":"10.3390/agriculture12030340"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","uid":"bk6a4u9UDD_o3fTovGAeczg","uuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","parentUuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decf","rootUuid":"60c45b1a-37ec-4cae-ac91-5b1ed5bcc8ab","name":"Instytut Badawczy Leśnictwa","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ba878c28a0473afd95"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Communities of Mycorrhizal Fungi among Seedlings of Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)

Both of these silvicultural treatments (the removal of trees and preparation) have an impact on soil properties, and on the mycorrhizal fungi associated with the roots of seedlings. We therefore compared assemblages of mycorrhizal fungi associating with natural-regeneration pine seedlings growing on a clearcut, in relation to six types of microsite created using three mechanical site-preparation tools, i.e., a double-mouldboard forest plough (creating furrow and ridge), an active single-disc plough (establishing another type of furrow and ridge), and a forest mill—developing strips, as well as a non-mechanical site preparation control. A total of 46 taxa of mycorrhizal fungi were detected, with Wilcoxina mikolae being the most abundant species (relative abundance—79.8%), and the one occurring most frequently (96.8%). Other abundant mycorrhizal fungi were Thelephora terrestris (3.8%), Tylospora asterophora (3.2%), Hyaloscypha bicolor (2.2%), and Cenococcum geophilum (1.7%). The roots of seedlings growing in the non-mechanical site preparation control were characterised by a significantly greater presence of mycorrhizal root tips, compared with the roots of seedlings growing at other microsites. The highest percentage of non-mycorrhizal root tips was present on pines growing on the two types of ridge: the microsites which characterized the highest levels of mineral nutrients. Communities of mycorrhizal fungi differed between microsites. The five microsites: both types of furrow, forest plough ridge, forest mill strip, and non-mechanical site preparation control, were not found to differ from each other, but did differ from the active plough ridge treatment. The highest diversity of mycorrhizal fungi (Shannon–Wiener and Simpson indexes) was in the non-mechanical site preparation control. Any method of mechanical site preparation in the clearcut decreases the level of root mycorrhization and the biodiversity of mycorrhizal fungi. The least suitable method from the point of view of mycorrhizal fungal communities is the use of an active plough.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058085999","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61fba4f82467f07d34e57093","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"a9f41833-06ed-489f-b87b-4b4a70269fc6"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/13/2/353","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623da81d2467f074f897d664","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Studnicki","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-9773-7313","documentHash":"9c519c4b-70bc-4b0a-ba1d-5f344497f847"},{"objectId":"623da81d2467f074f897d662","name":"Roman Mariusz","lastName":"Bzdyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4f2685f0-ca89-4b24-be81-25ce0b99039b"},{"objectId":"5e7093ba878c28a0473afd95","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Sikora","uuid":"107ABF2FD2CC3E7458734E9A029445CAF3DB8ACB2A23AFCB20AA57906011B3F05BAF5B814809E8549A2FA30A70752AE11E40171FA6219D4ACE6FC3BF86C0C3E6","orcidId":"0000-0002-3215-5934","documentHash":"35b3b181-708f-4387-afbc-cdc1f0e7257b"},{"objectId":"5e7091f3878c28a04738d9f4","name":"Marta","lastName":"Aleksandrowicz-Trzcińska","uuid":"DFE2D6181041A7C7E1F8F3E8610BDAEBF093C6B6F171FC1C6968DCC9ADFEA054E847C444BE1B302D370D4C85F849E2B770CC1B1691671C521A9818BADAF43AEA","orcidId":"0000-0002-1397-4475","documentHash":"747eb972-fd2e-4b74-b152-92d13836b72d"}],"doi":"10.3390/f13020353"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dolomite; fracture; numerical modeling; KCC calibration; semicircular bending test; Brazilian test"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b5878c28a047385c1a","uid":"b-esrdsI7y-DE9S0sSBD8Lw","uuid":"21896781-3176-469e-8842-eca9803c4156","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Instytut Mechaniki i Inżynieriii Obliczeniowej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ea878c28a0473b3386","5e70929e878c28a0473994ad","5e70929e878c28a04739949c","5e70947e878c28a0473be5b5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Investigation of dolomite’ rock brittle fracture using fully calibrated Karagozian Case Concrete model","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478246","mniswId":"9116","title":"International Journal of Mechanical Sciences","doi":null,"issn":"0020-7403","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"49e20cf4-b4db-4300-be3b-0f88052379f2"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"623821302467f067af10faa7","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ea878c28a0473b3386","5e70947e878c28a0473be5b5","5e70929e878c28a04739949c","5e70929e878c28a0473994ad"]},"issue":"107197","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper presents a procedure to compute the parameters of the Karagozian and Case Concrete (KCC) constitutive model for brittle materials based on dolomite rock. First, the fracture energy and fracture toughness of the dolomite rock were determined from two experimental tests: the semicircular bending test (SCBT) and Brazilian indirect tension test (BT). Next, the novel optimization-based strategy was developed for efficiently calibrating the brittle damage parameters, and a broad parametric study was performed based on dolomite rock. Finally, the optimal parameters were validated through three experimental tests: SCBT, BT and a drop-weight fragmentation test. The results were compared with those obtained using three different sets of parameters for dolomite rock that is the KCC model with automatically generated parameters, parameters that provides an instable softening behavior, and the KCC model with parameters calibrated by the authors in a previous study. A qualitative and quantitative comparison of the results confirmed that the approach presented here improves the efficiency of fracture reproduction."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086001","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"221","pagesFromTo":"1-36","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020740322001217?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70947e878c28a0473be5b5","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Baranowski","uuid":"589D74F9B90CE23BA6BF79E7927CB675D1FEC6EB0EDAED1C837CB573C40B19F6A52151CE2B5BC2ADBC4A340BD24D2CC76188F25A449AB401FCC397EB7AA28607","orcidId":"0000-0002-5320-9479","documentHash":"cc7611b2-a43d-47d3-b973-ddaae5156ab0"},{"objectId":"5e7093ea878c28a0473b3386","name":"Michał","lastName":"Kucewicz","uuid":"8FADEFAE1432BDB24661B91CB929CB759CC334902F26697D1518C87757FD217DFF1CB4A08BFE48B10757D48DB6CB95B98046D3280116FABC61175307DB5BC061","orcidId":"0000-0002-2288-050X","documentHash":"53f2105e-480a-4942-8290-1016e945b5a6"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a0473994ad","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Małachowski","uuid":"3E941695DC452C902F05F04536C9F22A559B4EAA42A7F60E8216A3F4163C5AD5FEBE65D0B11D6290B37BD440458745982BA3E18BEBF4F90B058CBF96A19A8F5F","orcidId":"0000-0003-1300-8020","documentHash":"a691bdd4-e5e6-4d8a-8b79-096a648005d5"},{"objectId":"5e70929e878c28a04739949c","name":"Roman","lastName":"Gieleta","uuid":"28AB233791578197762C0DBDB65EFE2EBDDD2ACD7B6ADE73DBEF1C14D97A6F19A238D28310E8B4749FBD43240384211F354428304D6E0E2B5F398FA3B131065D","orcidId":"0000-0003-2645-5321","documentHash":"216eb6b7-ef5b-4ec2-b4b9-7af722f635f0"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ijmecsci.2022.107197"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["e-marketing","global","digitalization","trends","e-marketing strategy","marketing concept","economic and statistical forecasting"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"6237868b2467f0495b050b00","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Irbid National University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6237868b2467f0495b050b01"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Researching global digital e-marketing trends","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6237868b2467f0495b050aff","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["6237868b2467f0495b050b01"]},"issue":"13(115)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The main goal of the study is to identify global digital e-marketing trends in the world. The paper discusses the main aspects of the functioning of companies on the basis of the formation of the classical concept of marketing. The main constituent elements of the classical marketing concept, its advantages and disadvantages are highlighted. Based on the structuring of the main theoretical aspects of marketing development, the evolution of marketing concepts with historical aspects and their characteristics has been formed. The necessity of rethinking the existing business models of companies, which should be based on innovative e-marketing tools, is argued. The main ways and types of transformation of the classical concept of marketing in modern business conditions are highlighted. It has been shown that constant modernization, optimization and improvement of the efficiency of business processes are ensured through the implementation of key elements of e-marketing. Based on a critical analysis and generalization of existing approaches in organizing marketing activities, it is substantiated that ensuring the competitive position of a company on a world level is impossible without the use of e-marketing. The global trends of digitalization of e-marketing in the world were considered and identified. The presented goal is achieved by using the tools of economic and statistical analysis of modern trends in the development of e-marketing and a theoretical and methodological approach to identifying and structuring the main development trends, their directions, and main types. The obtained results of economic and statistical forecasting can be applied in practice in the formation of a company's marketing strategy, taking into account modern trends in the development of innovations."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086004","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62377dbb2467f0495b04f4e3","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"13 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"d5673221-18b0-40e2-8922-e4fc4e6ebdf4"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"26-38","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/252276/250794","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6237868b2467f0495b050b01","name":"Hasan Ali","lastName":"AlAbabneh","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-1136-8911","documentHash":"e59788a1-800a-4e97-bad1-11e14983b049"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.252276"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"9781032255835","book":null,"typeName":"Książka pod redakcją","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b6878c28a047385e24","uid":"bITc4cttztoiiv973rXfccw","uuid":"9d48cae3-39ad-462a-8216-ad67ec5520ed","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","parentUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de81","rootUuid":"b8378660-1504-42e6-9e89-fd4a860e1499","name":"Wydział Bezpieczeństwa, Logistyki i Zarządzania","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70929a878c28a047398e84","5e7092a8878c28a04739a19d"]},{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de09","uid":"bFitDBcx4YvxolIt7JKxDiw","uuid":"29483405-4eba-4db1-b6c9-321ff370bdf9","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de09","parentUuid":"29483405-4eba-4db1-b6c9-321ff370bdf9","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de09","rootUuid":"29483405-4eba-4db1-b6c9-321ff370bdf9","name":"Uniwersytet WSB Merito w Gdańsku","type":"EDITOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70924b878c28a04739325d"]}],"type":"EDITED_BOOK","title":"Logistics, Transport and the COVID-19 Crisis Managing and Operating Logistics Processes","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":205,"publicationPlace":"United Kingdom","translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":{"scientificEdition":false,"translationToPolish":false,"translationFromPolish":false,"bookProjectNCN":false,"bookProjectFNP":false,"bookProjectNPHR":false,"bookProjectUE":false},"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"623c93832467f04a321af986","editors":[{"objectId":"5e7092a8878c28a04739a19d","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Woźniak","uuid":"F56F3FBFB3E89AC324A57F78388F33692D3C60378B867B6C93D297794D987EF4657FF0BB60F41492EAA35D951A9AACC11A668A3DA64E863D22ABA05AC77CAF72","orcidId":"0000-0001-7592-0109","documentHash":"c35923e0-cac8-4fea-b468-7506eef4a827"},{"objectId":"5e70929a878c28a047398e84","name":"Wioletta","lastName":"Wereda","uuid":"B5848E54465D0916DAB7421C3CFA86A5A5FD26597B22E0D6F06A7A6516BF4D8592DA63BE60E589502DCAADB26E780BCED4FFD7C9995147619418BA06669260AB","orcidId":"0000-0002-6948-0239","documentHash":"46c8b0bc-2b48-475e-97c8-937615472852"},{"objectId":"5e70924b878c28a04739325d","name":"Bogdan","lastName":"Nogalski","uuid":"0948176BA9B4ED0D4E2A0A37470301FF8F01FD91CDE597F3E9171438F6FAE30884CD16DD130F7782C24FE493B83439555DFB1E65B32342E70A48D1B4B192D2CE","orcidId":"0000-0003-0262-8355","documentHash":"05361677-ccda-4c46-bcf8-4fa7a5c67b60"}],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"EDITOR":["5e7092a8878c28a04739a19d","5e70929a878c28a047398e84","5e70924b878c28a04739325d"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Under and post COVID-19 conditions, companies are adapting to smart ways of operating and managing logistics processes to counteract the negative implications of the pandemic.

The need to convolute information about model varieties of a men’s jacket is due to the cyclical nature of fashion. Regression analysis of this study’s results has confirmed the impact of the accumulation of quantitative changes in style attributes on the transition to qualitative changes in shape over 15 years. The periodic repeatability of the five-seam design of a men’s jacket as a typical representative indicates the possibility of using clusters of standard elements. Correlation analysis of the update of mobile attributes (an increase along the waistline and the lapel width) confirms a high level of connection with the silhouette characteristic.\n\nInformation and analytical material for encoding classification features of the functional components of model designs for an industrial product range collection has been formed. A variant for convoluting the sets of classification features in the process of sampling sorting relative to the basic list of functional nodes has been proposed. The 24×24 compatibility matrix built makes it possible to apply the morphological box method to compare sample sets. The presence of uniformity of the average value of accumulated frequencies Kc.u.=0.72, Kt.u.=0.69 confirms the membership of the sample in the typological series.

W I części opracowania przedstawiono niektóre dane produkcyjno-finansowe za kilka miesięcy roku, w szczególności dotyczące produkcji, cen, kondycji finansowej i aktywności inwestycyjnej. z analizy wynika, że sektor przetwórstwa spożywczego w Polsce dość dobrze radzi sobie z utrudnieniami, jakie wynikają z funkcjonowania w pandemicznej rzeczywistości. Utrzymanie dobrych wyników produkcyjno-finansowych będzie jednak coraz trudniejsze.

The aim of the article is to assess the situation of the food industry and agri-food trade in Poland in 2021 during the overall economic crisis caused by the pandemic. The first part of the study presents some production and financial data for several months of the year particular concerning production, prices, financial condition and investment activity. The analysis shows that the food processing sector in Poland copes quite well with the difficulties that result from functioning in a pandemic reality. However, maintaining good production and financial results as well as high export dynamics will be more and more difficult. Changing external conditions (increase in production costs, taxes, etc.) pose a great challenge for food companies and require a number of adaptation measures."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086026","journalIssue":{"objectId":"620c92e22467f01217aca8c1","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"76","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"cd0eb460-6184-4b2c-a969-01318b9b6a48"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"76","pagesFromTo":"2-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://sigma-not.pl/publikacja-136027-rynek-i-przemys%C5%82-spo%C5%BCywczy-w-2021-roku-%E2%80%93-cz%C4%99%C5%9B%C4%87-i-przemysl-spozywczy-2022-1.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b585b","name":"Jadwiga","lastName":"Drożdż","uuid":"348673E5F0BECC3363A4E5C0A2B0C83C406B61EF4B4BECE891A8615A1E6DDF34A27AE4F030F8203FDC8FE8B9C9876A6FCD3A0F0D312FC94DB8D565D84AD04FED","orcidId":"0000-0003-3096-3177","documentHash":"4d2b11b4-dded-4c49-b771-1e434b54b57b"},{"objectId":"5e70940d878c28a0473b5804","name":"Robert","lastName":"Mroczek","uuid":"8F6D438742FA577B35181F434BDDF17972EDD9332E7E572C14F0325E511DEF7F7C322C7131C8D5C506A8923C6A3DCE91B8B936EC346C61650DA5642F369BCC32","orcidId":"0000-0003-2238-3885","documentHash":"a6efcaa5-3d3a-4226-9938-94cc9315f38f"},{"objectId":"5e7093fc878c28a0473b4652","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Ambroziak","uuid":"F6D0CC5DD46BD9D96D822FFB73E042E82AE97F0B67AC34C6EF8E16FF69A7A616380DCCE2624F11842920E1A9569FD7D3A10F2A9DE86620F3A579A506446D5F90","orcidId":"0000-0001-8708-841X","documentHash":"6c960127-8069-406c-84db-22cc593231d1"},{"objectId":"5e7093fa878c28a0473b44ee","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Szczepaniak","uuid":"B2D1333BB0CDDD68363E20B21FA7A4C2988BC5BB56C3993AB82F3BFA6362CA7A0F2106A52A6A59DEBECE0B3DDD8ACA297894BC1978C6790C47B7D7FC73D1B878","orcidId":"0000-0002-1511-4428","documentHash":"af3df646-243b-4409-af9d-e385cb399e85"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["steel tank","stress concentration","defects in the form of dents","dimensionless parameters of dents","numerical method","modeling"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61eeaf0e2467f0689144d710","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Mukhtar Auezov South Kazakhstan University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623713122467f0495b0425b9","623713122467f0495b0425b7","623713122467f0495b0425b6","623713122467f0495b0425b5","623713122467f0495b0425be","623713122467f0495b0425bd","623713122467f0495b0425bc","623713122467f0495b0425ba"]},{"id":"61b750722467f06307d106e5","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Universiti Putra Malaysia","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623713122467f0495b0425b8"]},{"id":"61eeaf0e2467f0689144d712","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Kazakhstan International Education Corporation","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623713122467f0495b0425bb"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Estimation of the strength of vertical cylindrical liquid storage tanks with dents in the wall","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"623713122467f0495b0425b1","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["623713122467f0495b0425b5","623713122467f0495b0425b6","623713122467f0495b0425b7","623713122467f0495b0425b8","623713122467f0495b0425b9","623713122467f0495b0425ba","623713122467f0495b0425bb","623713122467f0495b0425bc","623713122467f0495b0425bd","623713122467f0495b0425be"]},"issue":"7(115)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"A multi-level mathematical model was used to estimate the stressed-strained state of a cylindrical reservoir with a defect in the wall shape in the form of a dent; the concentration of stresses in the defect zone was studied.\n\nThe proper choice of the mathematical model was verified; it has been shown that the engineering assessment of the stressed-strained state of the wall of a cylindrical tank with the variable thickness could employ ratios for a cylindrical shell with a constant wall thickness. The spread of values is 2‒10 %. This indicates the proper choice of the mathematical model, as well as the fact that it is possible, for an engineering assessment of the stressed-strained state of the wall of a cylindrical tank with variable thickness, to use the ratios for a cylindrical shell with a constant wall thickness.\n\nThe stressed-strained state of the dent zone in the tank wall was numerically estimated, which proved the assumption of significant stress concentrations in the dent zone and indicated the determining effect on the concentration of stresses in the dent zone exerted by its geometric dimensions and its depth in particular.\n\nThe concentration of stresses in the zone of dents in the tank wall was investigated in the ANSYS programming environment at different sizes of dents on the tank wall, for which two dimensionless parameters were introduced: the dimensionless radius of the dent and the dimensionless depth of the dent.\n\nBased on the results of a numerical study into the stressed-strained state of the dent zone in the tank wall, graphic dependences were derived of the stress concentration coefficient on the dimensionless depth of the dent for various values of the dimensionless radius of dents, which does not exceed 2 % of the indicator.\n\nBased on fitting the stress concentration curves on the dimensions of the dent and tank, a formula was derived for calculating the stress concentration coefficient as a function of the dimensionless radius ξ and the dimensionless depth ς of the dent. The resulting formula makes it possible, with known dimensionless parameters of the depth and radius of the dent, to determine the coefficients of stress concentration in the dented zone of the tank wall."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086031","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6237120d2467f0495b042233","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"7 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"1b2964f3-519e-44e5-843c-363b353cdf2a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"6-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/252599/250804","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623713122467f0495b0425be","name":"Bolat","lastName":"Duissenbekov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3476-5218","documentHash":"4befe87d-3509-4d38-b1e9-a26bb4d0a955"},{"objectId":"623713122467f0495b0425bd","name":"Kuanysh","lastName":"Imanaliyev","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1141-8424","documentHash":"196e8703-c8f6-46ea-b8c9-674b31e54eda"},{"objectId":"623713122467f0495b0425bc","name":"Arman","lastName":"Moldagaliyev","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4286-8401","documentHash":"22fd67c4-435e-4bef-a0d9-3d5e8de7991e"},{"objectId":"623713122467f0495b0425bb","name":"Svetlana","lastName":"Buganova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2005-3305","documentHash":"b6c2eef8-d32e-4e0d-8be7-5f5381482ffe"},{"objectId":"623713122467f0495b0425ba","name":"Khassen","lastName":"Abshenov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0173-2524","documentHash":"d191f88a-7ad9-4b8b-aba5-598db2d35251"},{"objectId":"623713122467f0495b0425b9","name":"Aibarsha","lastName":"Dosmakanbetova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0802-423X","documentHash":"38a08592-6476-4ca9-bf54-f582fb957987"},{"objectId":"623713122467f0495b0425b8","name":"Masrah Azrifan","lastName":"Azmi Murad","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0335-5873","documentHash":"c1b56d1e-185c-46c5-9185-69d0e4ca153f"},{"objectId":"623713122467f0495b0425b7","name":"Akmaral","lastName":"Utelbayeva","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4771-9835","documentHash":"9c12b2cf-9ec2-41c9-88cf-c3acb94152f1"},{"objectId":"623713122467f0495b0425b6","name":"Nurlan","lastName":"Zhangabay","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8153-1449","documentHash":"9d47f1c1-9117-40cd-a314-117297fb9e97"},{"objectId":"623713122467f0495b0425b5","name":"Ulanbator","lastName":"Suleimenov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7798-1044","documentHash":"3bf904d6-9eef-4d0a-9d1c-0c1827a0c67b"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.252599"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","uid":"bdg5X4wp8W-4e-xI_icapqQ","uuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","parentUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","rootUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","name":"Instytut Chemii Organicznej Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623f49eb2467f01793c09433","5e709381878c28a0473ab74e","5e70949c878c28a0473c0688","5e709388878c28a0473ac25a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Machine Learning May Sometimes Simply Capture Literature Popularity Trends: A Case Study of Heterocyclic Suzuki–Miyaura Coupling","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c285145478aed","mniswId":"12814","title":"Journal of the American Chemical Society","doi":null,"issn":"0002-7863","eissn":"1520-5126","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"bfde5f28-5ddd-412d-ace7-deb7f19a57b1"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-03-08","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"623f49eb2467f01793c09430","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709381878c28a0473ab74e","623f49eb2467f01793c09433","5e709388878c28a0473ac25a","623f49eb2467f01793c09435","623f49eb2467f01793c09436","623f49eb2467f01793c09437","5e70949c878c28a0473c0688"]},"issue":"11","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Applications of machine learning (ML) to synthetic chemistry rely on the assumption that large numbers of literature-reported examples should enable construction of accurate and predictive models of chemical reactivity. This paper demonstrates that abundance of carefully curated literature data may be insufficient for this purpose. Using an example of Suzuki–Miyaura coupling with heterocyclic building blocks─and a carefully selected database of >10,000 literature examples─we show that ML models cannot offer any meaningful predictions of optimum reaction conditions, even if the search space is restricted to only solvents and bases. This result holds irrespective of the ML model applied (from simple feed-forward to state-of-the-art graph-convolution neural networks) or the representation to describe the reaction partners (various fingerprints, chemical descriptors, latent representations, etc.). In all cases, the ML methods fail to perform significantly better than naive assignments based on the sheer frequency of certain reaction conditions reported in the literature. These unsatisfactory results likely reflect subjective preferences of various chemists to use certain protocols, other biasing factors as mundane as availability of certain solvents/reagents, and/or a lack of negative data. These findings highlight the likely importance of systematically generating reliable and standardized data sets for algorithm training."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086036","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"144","pagesFromTo":"4819–4827","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jacs.1c12005","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623f49eb2467f01793c09437","name":"Martin D.","lastName":"Burke","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7963-7140","documentHash":"fa02c538-cc39-40c9-a3df-46390ac5910b"},{"objectId":"623f49eb2467f01793c09436","name":"Vandana","lastName":"Rathore","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9612d523-0f09-48be-9850-cdc63cd12063"},{"objectId":"623f49eb2467f01793c09435","name":"Nicholas H.","lastName":"Angello","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6436-3669","documentHash":"cfa3fac3-e652-4b4a-96e7-3e7d8bb72149"},{"objectId":"623f49eb2467f01793c09433","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Roszak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b5257ec7-8d82-4ed5-9905-0b9c826edba0"},{"objectId":"5e70949c878c28a0473c0688","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Grzybowski","uuid":"3221A3D348805FFE2A3ADD83933478873CB0903ADF945458D69DBFDD4251BF25D46CD0CE3764F9D3816FE71AB62D941442C9E1C6A3A5068EF90ECCA93F088257","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0bbf19b4-3d2a-4ce2-9c2f-675fa4dbec75"},{"objectId":"5e709388878c28a0473ac25a","name":"AGNIESZKA","lastName":"WOŁOS","uuid":"9350C7F3ECE94AED0F5AF1C307BC78FC9EF291148BE70339F85FF6E7B681F12E44632098775B1643B6F229118AB98BDE77EF42E2CB7FE4B55851EFCED9CE902D","orcidId":"0000-0001-9881-1634","documentHash":"042ee751-f4ef-4f36-82c1-2a48f38ae318"},{"objectId":"5e709381878c28a0473ab74e","name":"WIKTOR","lastName":"BEKER","uuid":"7A0F3B17175B4CC10069FFB4F42D2EEF624FACB57AACC52A8ED74A2C8E0EB31B410D8E0B46EAF393E4D6EB2921C6514C7A3ECE4D14AE5ECEBFEBF3DA09927A1F","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9eb857f2-98d7-4b3c-95fc-6783774d96e5"}],"doi":"10.1021/jacs.1c12005"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"623431c52467f00ffe93b8a5","doi":null,"title":"Poszerzamy horyzonty.

The method is based on expert evaluation methods, in particular, on determining the importance, degree of realization, and tendency of factors that affect the need for highly qualified specialists. The method implements the unit of data reliability verification based on the Kendall coefficient of concordance and Pearson criterion. The method applies an original approach to determining the competence of experts, in particular, by taking into consideration self-evaluation, mutual evaluation, and objective evaluation. The proposed method makes it possible to take into account the influence of factors on the need for specialists of the highest qualification with the possibility of forecasting.\n\nThe totality of factors that influence the need for specialists of the highest qualification and the magnitude of their impact was determined. They were determined by calculating the indicators of each of the criteria regarding importance, realization, and tendency. Determining was carried out using the algorithm for calculating the coefficients of influence of the factors on the need for specialists of the highest qualification.\n\nIn general, the following groups of factors were determined: conditions of scientific and scientific-pedagogical activity at a certain institution of higher education, the attractiveness of scientific and scientific-pedagogical activity in a certain country (region), development of industry (speciality). A group of 30 experts was selected to determine the numerical values of the factors, which satisfies the condition for achieving a confidence probability of 0.94.\n\nThe results of the evaluation of expert judgments revealed that the most influential factors are: social protection (0.87), budget for higher education (0.99), remuneration (0.9), and prestige of scientific and pedagogical activities (0.91). The least influential are: the number of primary positions in the area (0.48) and self-realization opportunities at a higher education institution (0.58)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086051","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623381152467f0713d57a05b","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"3

this study, multi-tracker optimization algorithm (MTOA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and differential evolution (DE) algorithms were integrated with support vector regression (SVR) to predict energy dissipation downstream of labyrinth weirs (ΔE). In order to evaluate the performance of these methods, the results are compared with corresponding outcome obtained by applying two other methods, namely, multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) and multiple linear regressions methods (MLR). The input parameters comprise the discharge, the upstream flow depth, the crest length of a single cycle of the labyrinth weir, the width of a single cycle of the labyrinth weir, the apex width, the number of labyrinth weir cycles, the sidewall angle, and the height of weir. The results indicate that the meta-heuristic algorithms substantially improve the performance of SVR. The results show that the integrative methods, SVR-MTOA, SVR-PSO, and SVR-DE, are more accurate than the MLPNN and the MLR. In average, the integrative methods provide 39.63% more accurate results than the MLPNN and 79.34% more accurate results than the MLR. The average RMSE and R2 for the integrative methods are 0.0054 m and 0.977, respectively.

The object of research is electromagnetic processes in resonant inverters, in which autogeneration of resonant current oscillations is carried out in the process of operation. The results of studying the electromagnetic processes in sequential self-generating resonant inverters based on the characteristics of the resonant circuit are presented. The operating modes of the inverters have been optimized by setting certain ratios between the operating and resonant frequencies at unstable circuit parameters. The ratio of operating and resonant frequencies is set through the use of phase-shifting filters in a positive feedback loop along the circuit current and correspond to the autogenerator mode. The conditions of self-generation in converters with a sequential resonant circuit have been determined. Mathematical expressions have been built for determining the coefficients of positive feedback on the current and voltage of the resonant circuit, which made it possible to derive target analytical dependences. Analytical dependences of the established operating frequency on the parameters of the circuit and phase-shifting filters have been established. Based on the obtained dependences, the parameters of the positive feedback circuits have been determined in order to ensure a wide range of output power of the converters. The resulting dependences make it possible to carry out theoretical calculations whose results repeat the results of model experiments. Phase characteristics of the resonance circuit and various phase-shifting filters, which can be part of a serial resonant converter, have been constructed. The results of the analysis reported here could be used in the design of resonant inverters with unstable circuit parameters, in particular in inductive chargers."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086072","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62370cbe2467f0495b04116f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"5 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"2de2082c-5b2d-4004-833b-1b46e4022191"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"23-34","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/252148/250648","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62370fa02467f0495b041c15","name":"Irina","lastName":"Vinnichenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3768-1060","documentHash":"69852dae-18c7-4176-a273-acb766ee6cf5"},{"objectId":"62370fa02467f0495b041c14","name":"Andrey","lastName":"Obrubov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-9667-1703","documentHash":"2a028802-f47e-4e94-b16a-a026cbff99dd"},{"objectId":"62370fa02467f0495b041c13","name":"Gennadiy","lastName":"Pavlov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4937-1828","documentHash":"3d68f0c6-17c5-4598-8181-1f0233af717a"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.252148"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["artificial neural network","multilayer perceptron","nutrients","textural features"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","uid":"biKwjl9_8Guib7aGYbp0K3w","uuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","parentUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737eb0e","rootUuid":"f51f35c6-108d-411e-9d16-e3f4037511a0","name":"Instytut Ogrodnictwa - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Prediction of tannin, protein, and total phenolic content of grain sorghum using image analysis and machine learning","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c2851454775ad","mniswId":"3429","title":"Cereal Chemistry","doi":null,"issn":"0009-0352","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"dd6f12d2-5cba-49cc-bdbb-ca46226ab18b"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"623a16472467f009d3017f11","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["623a16472467f009d3017f12","623a16472467f009d3017f16","5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Background and Objectives\n\nSorghum is an alternative crop where poor soil is a limiting factor for the production of corn. Laboratory measurements of chemical compounds of grains are expensive, time-consuming predominantly done on powdered samples. Therefore, a rapid and reliable method integrating image processing and machine learning was evaluated for the prediction of total phenolic compounds (TPCs), tannin, and protein.\nFindings\n\nThe highest TPC (0.83%) was obtained for genotype KGS36 (the brown pericarp) followed by KGS23 (0.54%). The concentration of tannin ranged from 0.008% to 0.616%. Mean comparison revealed variation for the protein concentration (15.17%–11.53%); the highest content obtained by KGS25 and the lowest by KGS36 (p < .01). Multilayer perceptron (MLP) as one of the common artificial neural networks (ANNs) applied to simulate the chemical of the grains was evaluated through the textural features extracted from grain images. For the MLP network, the minimum number of hidden networks was set to 8 and the maximum number was set to 25. For learning and saving, the number of networks was set to 20 and the number of saved networks was set to 5. The best MLP models were selected based on performance (R) and error values for the train, test, and validation sets.\nConclusions\n\nAn ANN for the prediction of the chemical concentration was suggested. The correlations between predicted and observed data were higher than .915.\nSignificance and Novelty\n\nThese models are of great significance for the prediction of chemical concentrations of grain sorghum in plant breeding and food industry."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086077","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623a16472467f009d3017f19","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":null,"number":null,"doi":"","documentHash":"5a239436-dbc8-4c0f-adb4-bc24d8d85d46"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"99","pagesFromTo":"843-849","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://doi.org/10.1002/cche.10542","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623a16472467f009d3017f16","name":"Azim","lastName":"Khazaei","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8867-9553","documentHash":"37d115a8-7104-425e-9c8b-26f00f4abcbc"},{"objectId":"623a16472467f009d3017f12","name":"Leyla","lastName":"Nazari","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f2e75ba2-e11e-44df-8d75-ef76a6e19e2b"},{"objectId":"5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ropelewska","uuid":"E3575740307CA373F3BD454AAC58C202E1C2CA28B9FC90C6BC3006DB867893BEE70DFAC85C7D9667CD0ACB7837B8DF63F7D6636679B032F0F1E0E534A3F3CBD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8891-236X","documentHash":"e9d0e369-fc46-40fe-9cb3-5236d6ea38a0"}],"doi":"10.1002/cche.10542"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["explicit formula","calculation","project risk","situation","high certainty","partial uncertainty"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091c4878c28a047388864","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"National Aviation University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62346a9d2467f00ffe9547b4"]},{"id":"61a79b802467f03711ecd546","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Odessa State Academy of Civil Engineering and Architecture","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["62346a9d2467f00ffe9547b3"]},{"id":"61a629f02467f0269e8e5041","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Odessa I.

At the same time, the very concept of the project risk has been generalized: instead of the conventional risk of unprofitability, a new, more general concept of the risk of unacceptably low project profitability has been introduced. Two levels of the project profitability were considered: a level acceptable to the investor and a realistically achievable level. Corresponding values of design parameters and indices of financial efficiency of the project were found for these levels. Based on the found values, relative margins of investment acceptability and risks of unacceptably low profitability of the project were calculated. A procedure of comprehensive assessment of the risk of unacceptable low profitability of the project for cases of high certainty and partial uncertainty has been developed. Explicit formulas for quantitative risk assessment of unacceptably low profitability of the project have been derived, ranges of values of all risks under consideration have been determined and appropriate recommendations have been given. Explicit formulas for calculating the values of project risks and dynamic points of project acceptability are convenient and useful for software implementation (for example, within the Monte Carlo method). For the Monte Carlo method and the method of scenarios, another alternative approach to assessing the integral risk of unacceptably low project profitability was proposed by the authors based on the direct calculation of unacceptable scenario values of any criterion of the project financial efficiency. A new index of financial efficiency of the project has also been introduced: a discounted period of acceptable return (discounted payback period of the project is its special case)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086078","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623456c22467f00ffe94c7ec","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"4 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"939ff66d-3a56-48aa-bc6e-8015b54df435"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"77-86","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/252997/250721","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62346a9d2467f00ffe9547b4","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Tupko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0625-3271","documentHash":"4aa13e90-e237-4b80-a8b8-8f34be8f3e71"},{"objectId":"62346a9d2467f00ffe9547b3","name":"Nataliia","lastName":"Vasilieva","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0211-7141","documentHash":"50a1d27c-d4d5-4883-99e6-d3c622980214"},{"objectId":"62346a9d2467f00ffe9547b2","name":"Alexander","lastName":"Vasiliev","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3826-4883","documentHash":"75000253-5df1-45fe-b66e-1db8801d3007"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.252997"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy","XPS spectroscopy","Defects","Multiferroic materials","Magnetism","BaTiO3","Nanopowder"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","uid":"bdkLR6wGCrp59lwUjwb_dMA","uuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","parentUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737ded8","rootUuid":"41b42e85-449a-4692-994b-a2b74353f099","name":"Instytut Fizyki Jądrowej im.

Based on the differential equations of gas distribution in space, a phased model of the propagation of a cloud of a dangerous chemical substance was built. The model describes stages in the discharge of a dangerous gaseous substance from emergency technological equipment, the deposition of dangerous gas by a finely-dispersed flow, and free propagation of the cloud in the air. The reported mathematical model makes it possible to calculate the size of pollution zones while determining the boundary safety conditions. When forecasting, the main meteorological parameters, the width of the deposition zone, and the chemical properties of both the gas and liquid are taken into consideration. The comparative analysis of the results of forecasting a conditional zone of chemical damage with the free propagation of the cloud, and at the active deposition by precipitation or technical devices, was carried out. The simulation results revealed that with an increase in the wind speed from 1 m/s to 5 m/s, the size of the affected area increases by 2.7 times, while the concentration of dangerous gas in the cloud falls by 2.5‒3 times. An algorithm has been proposed for integrating the devised methodology of forecasting the level of chemical pollution of the atmosphere into a general cycle of emergency management. It should be especially noted that the devised procedure contains the entire range of components that are necessary for its practical application. It includes a description of the procedure and practical recommendations for the use of the proposed technique in the elimination of emergencies, as well as a list of probable events when the use of the developed procedure would be most effective."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086087","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62371c532467f0495b043ddb","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"10 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"00866e92-d0a0-418a-ae61-252ac34eb210"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"31-40","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/251675/250696","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623720eb2467f0495b044a5c","name":"Natalia","lastName":"Shevchuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5845-2582","documentHash":"1604690a-8508-4335-bb72-b8f4d29d146a"},{"objectId":"623720eb2467f0495b044a5b","name":"Olena","lastName":"Karatieieva","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-0652-1240","documentHash":"fe3cd594-1373-4c0d-a634-f6fb6d098a71"},{"objectId":"623720eb2467f0495b044a5a","name":"Tetiana","lastName":"Pidpala","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4072-7576","documentHash":"03b22c06-4f8b-46ff-863a-3808a9c8403b"},{"objectId":"623720eb2467f0495b044a59","name":"Olena","lastName":"Petrova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8612-3981","documentHash":"9c61edcc-147f-4a6c-b1c2-2c4db1d4284b"},{"objectId":"623720eb2467f0495b044a58","name":"Mikhail","lastName":"Kravtsov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3218-2182","documentHash":"ba51e342-fc51-4374-bbb2-6d2097844098"},{"objectId":"623720eb2467f0495b044a57","name":"Oleg","lastName":"Bogatov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7342-7556","documentHash":"54fb0bd5-4db5-4901-828c-91b1c68c4b51"},{"objectId":"623720eb2467f0495b044a56","name":"Olexandr","lastName":"Tarasenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1313-1072","documentHash":"33c4449b-7f45-4e9d-a53f-6437cf93b637"},{"objectId":"623720eb2467f0495b044a55","name":"Oleksii","lastName":"Basmanov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6434-6575","documentHash":"079056c4-e0c6-4b40-a829-b92e4a0726fc"},{"objectId":"623720eb2467f0495b044a54","name":"Maksym","lastName":"Kustov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6960-6399","documentHash":"277582bc-26bb-449d-bc8c-a129704ce766"},{"objectId":"623720eb2467f0495b044a53","name":"Andrii","lastName":"Melnichenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7229-6926","documentHash":"7cd496cc-371a-4a4f-b21b-9c8186ec8c5e"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.251675"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Non-linear effects","stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS)","fiber-optics","single-mode fiber","communication lines"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61eebfca2467f06891459ae3","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"S.

On the one hand, nonlinear effects impose restrictions on the radiation power that can be transmitted through an optical fiber or light guide.\n\nIn this paper, the problem of the occurrence of the phenomenon from the stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) effect is investigated using two optical sources of rays in a single-mode optical fiber at joint waves of 1310 nm and 1550 nm. Due to the fact that in all trunk fiber-optic lines, the intensity and energy of input signals is limited due to the influence of SBS, methods are currently being sought to reduce the influence of this phenomenon.\n\nIt was found that the energy of the input beam in the combined propagation of the compound did not reach the value of the threshold of SBS in the values of 25 dBm and 27 dBm due to the discrepancy between the experimental results and the results of the model. The SBS effect was not observed when the threshold threshold of 15 dBm and 27 dBm – SBS was reached when combining a dual beam along a single optical fiber in one direction. As a result, by double integration, the value of the SBS threshold was raised, and the direction for future scientific research was determined. If the possibility of increasing the threshold of SBS is proved, then increasing the distance of amplifiers in the main networks, respectively, its economic effect increases. In addition, it can be noted that there are no scientific papers devoted to the study of the effects of optical nonlinear effects by combining and distributing these two compounds along a single optical fiber.\n\nThis article discusses the issues of improving the capacity and determination of the threshold for stimulated Brillouin scattering. To increase the power threshold is invited to consider the dependence of the phase modulation frequency of the spectral width of the laser radiation.\n\nIn addition, the fact that the SBS threshold did not reach the value at an energy of 27 DB in the case of the double-beam distribution can be proved by discrepancies in comparison with the results of experimental studies and the results of the model that determines the SBS effect"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086096","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62370cbe2467f0495b04116f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"5

objective of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of machine learning based on image texture parameters to discriminate plum stone cultivars. The plums of cultivars ‘Emper’, ‘Kalipso’, and ‘Polinka’ were sampled. For each cultivar, one hundred images of plum stones were acquired using a digital camera. Processing of the plum stone images included the conversion of the images to individual color channels, image segmentation, region of interest (ROI) determination, and texture parameter extraction. Then, the discriminant analysis, including the texture selection and building discriminative models for the evaluation of the diversity of the plum stone cultivars, was carried out. The obtained results of discrimination of plum stone cultivars were very accurate and confirmed the effectiveness of image processing to evaluate the cultivar diversity. The most satisfactory results, reaching 96.67% for the average accuracy for three cultivars (97% for ‘Emper’, ‘Kalipso’, and 96% for ‘Polinka’), were obtained for the models built based on combined textures selected from all the color channels using the IBk classifier. The developed procedure can be of practical importance for the correct identification of plum stone cultivars and avoiding their mixing to preserve cultivar uniformity."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086107","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"762","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/4/762","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f7ff7ec085dcb410a25ec10","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ropelewska","uuid":"E3575740307CA373F3BD454AAC58C202E1C2CA28B9FC90C6BC3006DB867893BEE70DFAC85C7D9667CD0ACB7837B8DF63F7D6636679B032F0F1E0E534A3F3CBD1","orcidId":"0000-0001-8891-236X","documentHash":"e9d0e369-fc46-40fe-9cb3-5236d6ea38a0"}],"doi":"10.3390/agronomy12040762"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","uid":"bdg5X4wp8W-4e-xI_icapqQ","uuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","parentUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea0","rootUuid":"8c445b8c-e3dc-4d70-b2b4-097e84208547","name":"Instytut

A flood is an event where water is inundated in an area due to increased water volume. Due to high level of water and other hazards arising from flooding, flood victims need to move to a location prepared for evacuation. To get to that location prepared, the victims must get through a safe route. Searching for safe evacuation routes is important to save flood victims and bring them to the evacuation centre safely. Search for evacuation routes related to obstacles on the road to get through. Slippery roads, high puddles of water on the roads, rivers that are located close to the roads that flood victims will have to get through, drainage of waterways and the vulnerability of victims are taken into consideration in choosing a route to get to the evacuation location. There are several problems in choosing a safe route: (1) how to take into account the obstacles on the road to be passed (2) how to choose the priority of the route to be passed with the obstacles encountered. The proposed solution to deal with the problems encountered are (1) to take into account road obstacles by giving the obstacle weights. Fuzzy logic is used to calculate the value of obstacle weights (2) the problem of selecting route priorities will be solved using the firefly algorithm. The firefly algorithm is an algorithm inspired by the social life of fireflies. The priority route for evacuation of flood victims is sought using the method proposed in this study which is the optimal route. The optimal route referred to in this study is the route that has the smallest obstacle weight value. The simulation results show that the fuzzy logic integrated into the firefly algorithm (FuFA) provides a safe route priority, indicated by the smallest obstacle weight value."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086136","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623456c22467f00ffe94c7ec","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"4 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"939ff66d-3a56-48aa-bc6e-8015b54df435"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"66-76","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/252917/250720","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623469ea2467f00ffe95457f","name":"Riri Fitri","lastName":"Sari","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8841-8078","documentHash":"c361f9b2-8287-4aae-922b-70866512b233"},{"objectId":"623469ea2467f00ffe95457e","name":"Anak Agung Putri","lastName":"Ratna","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-1834-451X","documentHash":"fed32be4-f9ca-4e85-9574-ad7377f7ad12"},{"objectId":"623469ea2467f00ffe95457d","name":"T.

Without cooperation and considerable commitment from everyone, it is possible that these negative effects will worsen. The implementation of the Energy Policy from now until 2050 should facilitate the transformation of the coal-based power system toward a more sustainable and diversified mix of energy sources. Financial investments in the countries analyzed in this paper create real opportunities and changes for the transition toward renewable energy sources (RES), but there is criticism concerning the insufficient speed of change and the costs of the transformation for society. The dominant emphasis on the optimum selection of energy sources creates conflicts, especially in democratic decision-making. Resource management is both incremental and participatory, and while decisions are strongly based on science, the decision-making process is rarely rational or comprehensive. It is difficult to estimate environmental costs, especially because there is no method for comparing the many criteria between the different energy sources since there are differences in the energy efficiency results obtained in different areas. Public opinion is of great importance and it has a huge influence on the development of the development strategies and policies that are undertaken. Therefore, as part of our analysis, we conducted research using a questionnaire to obtain opinions on fundamental issues regarding the climate and energy strategies that have been adopted in the EU. This was important for achieving the main goal of this article, which is a multidimensional analysis of activities aimed at adapting the national economy to the EU strategies that are responsible for reaching the energy and climate goals by 2050. The low-emission energy transformation is aimed at introducing significant changes for the entire economy while at the same time ensuring the implementation of the so-called European triad of goals (energy security, energy competitiveness and climate protection), which often contradict each other in practice."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086143","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623c387e2467f01c21a45848","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"15","number":"7","doi":null,"documentHash":"c88baf07-e702-4d23-9ec3-02e7111fbaf1"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-29","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/7/2351","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6661a1644097074fa1bcca23","name":"Henryk","lastName":"Wojtaszek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"41fba75e-b1f1-4b87-a685-c0cd98eff246"},{"objectId":"6661a1644097074fa1bcca22","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Jałowiec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2e8ca11b-45ec-4254-9d30-6308564c8601"},{"objectId":"5e7092ee878c28a04739f59c","name":"Ireneusz","lastName":"Miciuła","uuid":"00E46EF94F60E97EB3A87A24D4A36D3186ECD55B3927007F4E1E9660D314FB56E9F1901A6BEB5D2D219D2AA1B1649F0B3F72A53A857CFCEB8028062EE4A23B7C","orcidId":"0000-0003-3150-4490","documentHash":"f808cc7b-13d5-47d1-ba2f-a6c44e45ef2a"}],"doi":"10.3390/en15072351"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["dobra zmiana","afekty","ideologia","lgbt","dyskryminacja","niewiedza"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["the “good change” policy","affects","ideology","lgbt","discrimination","ignorance"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6240689e2467f038c202b98e","doi":null,"title":"Performatyka.

The objective of our studies was to evaluate the attractiveness of different colors to M. galloprovincialis and non-target species: Spondylis buprestoides and predatory Thanasimus formicarius and T. femoralis. Laboratory tests of fifteen colors against immature and mature M. galloprovincialis revealed some differences in their color preference. In two field tests, eight colors of coroplast vanes in cross-vane traps were compared with unpainted white (a reference (RF)). The first test confirmed the laboratory results, i.e., RF was slightly more attractive to M. galloprovincialis than pastel yellow, reseda green, and cyan blue, but trap color had no significant effect on any of the insect species studied. In the second test, the attractiveness of RF was highest and significantly different from pure white (for all four species), light blue, and pine green (except S. buprestoides). Overall, the unpainted white traps appeared to be most effective in catching M. galloprovincialis. Thanasimus spp. responded to the colors similarly to M. galloprovincialis; therefore, either trap design or lure composition should be modified to reduce their catches."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086153","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623dbd202467f074f8984570","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"13","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"79a95c06-ccdb-412a-9876-dbf47dff8431"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"13","pagesFromTo":"220","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4450/13/3/220/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709428878c28a0473b7460","name":"Aleksander","lastName":"Dziuk","uuid":"B81A2C1B864C3CA5A1272F6EDB86B57181170CBF0C7A1E4199080E230C953612A6DCB9B9E84D31A982D0774A3DF77E15C228DBEBB634C93E4FCEEBD93C3243CC","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e1571b9f-302d-41cd-8c4c-5e78ff067c28"},{"objectId":"5e70934c878c28a0473a6a84","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Jaworski","uuid":"540CE7450CA627528770FC25E4D50E53BF4DE84156C0B6160EDDA0042E328B3BA4329A4214D1E9193ED0333A146EAD5622B2971058889F013FF9119302536900","orcidId":"0000-0002-9663-0407","documentHash":"dd4b4990-0f16-4a7e-b561-fb8b47f14298"},{"objectId":"5e7092ee878c28a04739f5c0","name":"Radosław","lastName":"Plewa","uuid":"6551FE8EAD77B86D59533C66DF0FB994C5742FF69FF0701E1D051860CB335674F2F622122F07EB0DDDA3B9E9C2015392B8071E2F52EFFE9BB179FC7DD2776B3F","orcidId":"0000-0001-6227-3037","documentHash":"36bdd637-509c-4024-b905-f171cbe30946"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c4fd","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Sukovata","uuid":"BBF1BA4BE50DB7A40D9F4534ABFE081011FE1FEACDBDB218B263CD28FC336DD33EA5C8EEAFFD81167F4F48988FA0837F54FA69176699C56444F98FDFFD765DA4","orcidId":"0000-0002-7542-8496","documentHash":"12df87e1-6634-405c-8598-5ef7fb10cb7d"}],"doi":"10.3390/insects13030220"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Natural dyeing, linen fabrics, yellow color,  antibacterial, UPF"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091b3878c28a04738567d","uid":"buXMLEs4lpbxvwxbqswKB9Q","uuid":"fd60174d-73fa-4546-8dce-9f89a7663753","parentId":"5e7091b3878c28a04738567d","parentUuid":"fd60174d-73fa-4546-8dce-9f89a7663753","rootId":"5e7091b3878c28a04738567d","rootUuid":"fd60174d-73fa-4546-8dce-9f89a7663753","name":"Instytut Włókien Naturalnych i Roślin Zielarskich - Państwowy Instytut Badawczy","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ce878c28a0473b1127","5e70938e878c28a0473acb5f"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Influence of Flavonoid Dyes on the Color and Pro - Health Benefits of Linen Fabrics","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c2851454788cd","mniswId":"11965","title":"Journal of Natural Fibers","doi":null,"issn":"1544-0478","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"61167b2c-0860-44e9-bfd8-343a289d6cfd"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"61efc8d42467f0312275dcc4","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093ce878c28a0473b1127","5e70938e878c28a0473acb5f"]},"issue":"[Published online: 18 Jan 2022]","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The paper presents analyses of flavonoid dyestuffs i.e., marigold (Tagetes patula L.), dyer’s broom (Genista tinctoria) and weld (Reseda luteola L.)

Using an S2U-containing anticodon stem-loop fragment derived from tRNALys (S2U-RNA) and recombinant SelU with an MBP tag, we found that only geranyl (C10) pyrophosphate is the substrate for this enzyme, while other pyrophosphates such as isopentenyl (C5), dimethylallyl (C5), farnesyl (C15) and geranylgeranyl (C20) are not. Interestingly, methyl (C1)− and C5−, C10−, and C15-prenyl-containing S2U-RNAs (which were chemically obtained) underwent the selenation reaction promoted by SelU, although the Se2U-RNA product was obtained in decreasing yields in the following order: geranyl ≥ farnesyl > dimethylallyl ≫ methyl. Microscale thermophoresis showed an affinity between gePP and SelU in the micromolar range, while the other pyrophosphates tested, such as isopentenyl, dimethylallyl, farnesyl and geranylgeranyl, either did not bind to the protein or their binding affinity was above 1 mM. These results agree well with the in silico analysis, with gePP being the best binding substrate (the lowest relative free energy of binding (ΔG) and a small solvent-accessible surface area (SASA)). These results suggest that SelU has high substrate specificity for the prenylation reaction (only gePP is accepted), whereas there is little discrimination for the selenation reaction. We therefore suggest that only gePP and the geranylated tRNA serve as substrates for the conversion of 2-thio-tRNAs to 2-seleno-tRNAs, as it is found in the bacterial system."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086158","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623d9cf32467f074f897b8a1","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"122","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"f8318a26-4891-4801-a92b-ca86890e8a81"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"122","pagesFromTo":"Article

double hydroxides, especially Zn-Al, are valuable matrices for intercalation with various functional anions: dyes, medicines, food additives, etc. For the purposeful development and optimization of the technology for the synthesis of Zn-Al hydroxides intercalated with functional anions, the phase composition and crystal structure of Zn-Al nitrate layered double hydroxide samples (Zn:Al=4:1) synthesized at solution flow rates of 0.8 and 1.6 l/h, pH=7, 8, 9, 10 and t=10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 °С were studied. XRD showed that all samples synthesized at different temperatures, pH, and solution flow rates were Zn-Al layered double hydroxides with an α-Zn(OH)2 crystal lattice of medium crystallinity, with an admixture of an oxide phase with a ZnO lattice. Three sections of the dependence of the crystallite size of the sample on the synthesis temperature were distinguished: 10–20 °C, 30–50 °C, and 60 °C, within which an increase in temperature led to an increase in crystallinity. A hypothesis was put forward about a change in the mechanism or kinetics of LDH formation at temperatures of 30 °C and 60 °C. An increase in the pH of the synthesis and the flow rate of solutions led to an increase in crystallinity.\n\nA retrospective comparative analysis of the phase composition and crystal structure of Zn-Al-nitrate and Zn-Al-tripolyphosphate (tartrazine or Orange Yellow S) LDH samples was carried out. It was found that the use of large and multi-charged functional anions caused significant adsorption on precipitate nuclei and difficult intercalation. As a result, low crystallinity was formed (Tartrazine anion) or a significant part of LDH was decomposed to oxide (tripolyphosphate and Orange Yellow S anions)."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086160","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623775112467f0495b04d2df","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"12 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"5191dd5a-a9da-464e-bc55-0935335a9528"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"12-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/252738/250741","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623777352467f0495b04d851","name":"Olena","lastName":"Melnyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-5763-0431","documentHash":"009ff75f-4e10-4fd2-941c-72c3c51b6976"},{"objectId":"623777352467f0495b04d850","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Verbitskiy","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7045-8293","documentHash":"de39a181-ff15-4f9c-bb12-dc07f0436271"},{"objectId":"623777352467f0495b04d84f","name":"Rovil","lastName":"Nafeev","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2721-9718","documentHash":"f23cf7b4-3d86-41b0-9275-6df8e9a0a10e"},{"objectId":"623777352467f0495b04d84e","name":"Valerii","lastName":"Kotok","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8879-7189","documentHash":"f8932885-8213-4eaa-a2c8-4109f28fe357"},{"objectId":"623777352467f0495b04d84d","name":"Anastasiia","lastName":"Borysenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2732-5660","documentHash":"1e27bf1e-f39c-49b2-9eeb-1e1fc77014ce"},{"objectId":"623777352467f0495b04d84c","name":"Vadym","lastName":"Kovalenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8012-6732","documentHash":"bde94327-528d-4958-b400-243101b66681"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.252738"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["COVID-19","Pandemia","Polska","Prawa człowieka"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19","Pandemic","Poland","Human rights"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62383f6a2467f067af119f2c","doi":null,"title":"Political system of the republic of Poland during the covid-19 Pandemic : continuity and change","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-67162-07-4","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://wydawnictwo.uph.edu.pl/pl/p/Political-System-of-the-Republic-of-Poland-During-the-COVID-19-Pandemic-Continuity-and-Change/717","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"3eed78b2-cba6-4ef1-af2d-36db19a298c6","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987c878c28139f4eb900","mniswId":"60700","name":"Uniwersytet Przyrodniczo-Humanistyczny w Siedlcach","documentHash":"0d956fd1-5aa6-457c-b7a2-9020626d0aae"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","uid":"bz_6XXECFL3_CFkpms5BsDQ","uuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","parentUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de3b","rootUuid":"dacccb40-e3e3-4113-a28e-54c4a59d550e","name":"Uniwersytet w Siedlcach","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f1878c28a04739f9eb"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Freedom of movement","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6238534c2467f067af1212aa","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f1878c28a04739f9eb"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058086162","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"101-103","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://wydawnictwo.uph.edu.pl/pl/p/Political-System-of-the-Republic-of-Poland-During-the-COVID-19-Pandemic-Continuity-and-Change/717","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092f1878c28a04739f9eb","name":"Bartosz","lastName":"Nowakowski","uuid":"2E6071C8ECE7C22461FE18A78EB90B4F4A703987C11B0C7E62259055A2D63BC35DFFFA09247A9D6D812212AAF636059ABD431F778B9A036537E2165BB4877767","orcidId":"0000-0002-7182-4600","documentHash":"1c9400bd-9de0-45b5-9d51-80730e9f426d"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Sensorimotor cortex activity","Neuroplasticity","Specificity of practice","Variability of practice","Practice conditions","Motor learning"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","uid":"bfV9s5tJVMHwc1Lo8md7ngA","uuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","parentUuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de4d","rootUuid":"04496ff8-47c8-4c64-af60-278a7de9d867","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Literature includes both behavioral and neuroimaging studies. Unfortunately, no studies are focusing on practice in constant conditions to the best of our knowledge. Hence it is essential to assess possible differences in mechanisms of neuroplasticity between constant vs. variable practice conditions. The primary objectives of the study described in this protocol will be: (1) to determine the brain’s structural and functional changes following constant and variable practice conditions in motor learning (structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging, MRI); (2) to determine the EEG activation and connectivity between cognitive, sensory, and motor cerebral cortex areas (central, temporal, parietal, occipital) in constant and variable practice conditions and as a function of practice time.\nMethods: The study will follow the interventional (experimental) design with two arms (parallel groups). Fifty participants will be randomly assigned to two groups practicing in constant (CG) and variable conditions (VG). CG will be practicing only one pattern of step isometric contractions during unimanual index finger abduction, i.e., 90 trials in all training sessions, whereas VG will practice three different patterns. Each will be practiced 30 times per session in variable conditions. Resting-state fMRI, EEG (cortical networking), and motor task proficiency will be examined before (pre-) and after practice (post- and retentions tests).\nDiscussion: Findings will enhance our understanding of structural and functional neural changes following practice in constant and variable conditions. Therefore, the study can be considered pure (basic) research (clinical research in healthy individuals).\nClinical Trial Registration: Study registered at clinicaltrials.gov (ID# NCT04921072) on 9 June 2021. Last version update: 21 December 2021.\nThe protocol has been prepared according to the complete SPIRIT checklist (http://www.spirit-statement.org/), although the item order has been modified in order to comply with the manuscript structure."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058086163","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623853ac2467f067af12132d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"16","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"027d1af7-50fd-4fd3-90bd-6973aa861f2b"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"16","pagesFromTo":"art. 773730, s. 1-10","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2022.773730/full","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623853ac2467f067af12132b","name":"Irena","lastName":"Rektorová","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0b3f832c-79cc-46f6-90b1-26efbd8a737c"},{"objectId":"623853ac2467f067af12132a","name":"Zuzana","lastName":"Sajdlová","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e15c14f7-a1b7-4f3b-b7e8-3c0a7c872692"},{"objectId":"623853ac2467f067af121329","name":"Patrícia","lastName":"Klobušiaková","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c0396822-b459-4319-a74b-6dd0a572844d"},{"objectId":"5e709265878c28a047394fee","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Czyż","uuid":"C9EB9C02F9370A2A8FDB7F1EBAC46057CCA059E76567757A6054800E36B815CF293064435CC978B02FD2DEF63C68F45E3789A3F3B4B8125485BF30CDBF8F4759","orcidId":"0000-0001-9395-9584","documentHash":"59a42a4d-f61e-4b19-b11f-6ee7b867f394"},{"objectId":"5e709261878c28a047394b65","name":"JAROSŁAW","lastName":"MARUSIAK","uuid":"F6F948F3CD695603A5620510ACB92D6397CF96AB12E9DD7ABA3A13435F3ACF44D413812F31204DC3E531AD16144355C8A973737273AD12293B207F6DE3EBE6EC","orcidId":"0000-0001-6412-5943","documentHash":"56198806-432f-41c0-98a5-3c3220e1788c"}],"doi":"10.3389/fnhum.2022.773730"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["skauting","harcerstwo","przywództwo","metody działalności harcerskiej","koncepcje przywództwa"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["scouting","leadership","scouting activity methods","leadership concepts"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5f64777f2467f01864ec6fe8","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Faculty of Management, General Tadeusz Kościuszko Military University of Land Forces","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092d8878c28a04739e0a4","62386b872467f067af126935"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Scouting as a place to develop leadership qualities","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d60878c28514547ee7c","mniswId":"200027","title":"Scientific Journal of the Military University of Land Forces","doi":null,"issn":"2544-7122","eissn":"2545-0719","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"ERIH","editor":null,"documentHash":"b1312b2e-58c3-47f2-8ea5-6396c0488518"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-03-15","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62386b872467f067af126932","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092d8878c28a04739e0a4","62386b872467f067af126935"]},"issue":"1(203)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Autorzy w artykule rozważają kwestie dotyczące działalności młodzieży w organizacjach harcerskich, dostrzegając atuty owej aktywności.
