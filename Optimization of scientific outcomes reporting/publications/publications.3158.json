Chip temperatures are presented in numerical terms as median and average values; maximum and minimum values; range; and standard deviation. Box plots are also shown for selected machining conditions. The problems arising during signal recording with a mean emissivity coefficient ε = 0.13, a value which is dedicated during machining magnesium alloys, are discussed in detail. Chip temperatures obtained in the tests do not exceed approx. 420 °C. Therefore, the dry rough milling process carried out with carbide tools with different blade geometries can be considered safe for a wide range of machining parameters. The proposed methodology of chip temperature measurement and result processing is a new and effective approach to safety assessment in the dry milling of magnesium alloys."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944738","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6628b47e40970762632fef73","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"9","doi":null,"documentHash":"84142126-a013-48f5-94a5-abf9aa9c1573"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-24","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/9/2063","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bba8fdbe8331742623e6","name":"José","lastName":"Machado","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"28b73003-1cfc-4e84-a907-1b5e9b8dca25"},{"objectId":"6839bba8fdbe8331742623e5","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Legutko","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7add5477-4698-487d-b7b3-52dccd658ac3"},{"objectId":"6839bba8fdbe8331742623e4","name":"Ireneusz","lastName":"Zagórski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"820d409c-cb25-48e7-a7d0-3d525f8069e2"},{"objectId":"6839bba8fdbe8331742623e3","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Zgórniak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c5014c70-9428-4007-907e-6d4deacfc1a4"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395218","name":"Witold","lastName":"Habrat","uuid":"6660E4057D716A6050E2A6B3C181E85240000839CE4B0840F631E6A96AB8CBD99B7080C3ABF6858875D2BB9455CA9D89E6A6C0C0FBB86A4AF5F2485F136F0216","orcidId":"0000-0002-9010-8175","documentHash":"ba4623b9-6e2d-4fb8-b4d4-ba52acce3f31"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17092063"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sustainable development","mechanical engineering","importance–performance analysis","entropy method","customer requirement","LCA","photovoltaic panels","production engineering","quality"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

This research aims to develop an eco-innovative QLCA method to create new product solutions that integrate quality (customer satisfaction) and environmental impact assessment throughout the product life cycle. The QLCA method includes: (i) product prototyping according to quality and environmental criteria; (ii) prospective assessment of the quality of prototypes, taking into account customer requirements; (iii) prospective life cycle assessment of product prototypes using a cradle-to-grave approach in accordance with ISO 14040; and (iv) setting the direction of product development while taking into account the fulfilment of customer expectations and the need to care for the environment throughout the product life cycle. Owing to the lack of previous research in this area, as well as the popularity of photovoltaic (PV) panels in reducing greenhouse gases, an illustration was obtained and test of the method was carried out on the example of silicon photovoltaic panel modules (Crystalline Si PV Module). In accordance with the adopted assumptions, the results of the QLCA method test showed that the modelled PV prototypes will, in most cases, be satisfactory for customers, but they still require improvement actions to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions throughout their life cycle. These activities should be consistent so as to achieve quality that satisfies customers. The QLCA method can be used by designers, managers, and decision-makers at the early stages of design, but also during the product maturity phase for its sustainable development."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944740","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66a219ddfdbe831880dbae49","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"15","doi":null,"documentHash":"7a2a70b0-f43a-433e-9e39-16101a4d6a64"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/15/3841","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c52","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Siwiec","uuid":"0D25573CF2F6189D6F2E868D46D1426725A137590D7F6EF0F5389766898882ED218F890F47C98AC469E938565A92A4B7C2056615A8944A96F515AAA25FEE2128","orcidId":"0000-0002-6663-6621","documentHash":"6d5070e6-7a6e-444d-bae6-f7a4f58e8a5a"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395225","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pacana","uuid":"35D510AA8256DE5E4DEFDF38BF16202BA667F52A940F41C64492BE30097E6AB925BC3352AC6B374350D9E16190A5FD0052B2F59362CFC99AC0345A7CA51144BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1121-6352","documentHash":"bc6c1d9b-8450-4a34-8498-0e87c14cd6d6"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17153841"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["resistance spot welding","nugget diameter","Artificial neural network","shear force","AISI 304","unequal thicknesses"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The performance and durability of the resistance spot-welded joints are significantly impacted by the welding quality outputs, such as the shear force, nugget diameter, failure mode, and the hardness of the welded joints. In light of this, the present study sought to determine how the aforementioned welding quality outputs of 0.5 and 1 mm thick austenitic stainless steel AISI 304 were affected by RSW parameters, such as welding current, welding time, pressure, holding time, squeezing time, and pulse welding. In order to guarantee precise evaluation and experimental analysis, it is essential that they are supported by a numerical model using an intelligent model. The primary objective of this research is to develop and enhance an intelligent model employing artificial neural network (ANN) models. This model aims to provide deeper knowledge of how the RSW parameters affect the quality of optimum joint behavior. The proposed neural network (NN) models were executed using different ANN structures with various training and transfer functions based on the feedforward backpropagation approach to find the optimal model. The performance of the ANN models was evaluated in accordance with validation metrics, like the mean squared error (MSE) and correlation coefficient (R2). Assessing the experimental findings revealed the maximum shear force and nugget diameter emerged to be 8.6 kN and 5.4 mm for the case of 1–1 mm, 3.298 kN and 4.1 mm for the case of 0.5–0.5 mm, and 4.031 kN and 4.9 mm for the case of 0.5–1 mm. Based on the results of the Pareto charts generated by the Minitab program, the most important parameter for the 1–1 mm case was the welding current; for the 0.5–0.5 mm case, it was pulse welding; and for the 0.5–1 mm case, it was holding time. When looking at the hardness results, it is clear that the nugget zone is much higher than the heat-affected zone (HZ) and base metal (BM) in all three cases. The ANN models showed that the one-output shear force model gave the best prediction, relating to the highest R and the lowest MSE compared to the one-output nugget diameter model and two-output structure. However, the Levenberg–Marquardt backpropagation (Trainlm) training function with the log sigmoid transfer function recorded the best prediction results of both ANN structures."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944742","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6628b47e40970762632fef73","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"9","doi":null,"documentHash":"84142126-a013-48f5-94a5-abf9aa9c1573"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-37","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/9/2167","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b9a0fdbe8331742614da","name":"Jorge","lastName":"Acevedo","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dab158a9-2602-4682-827a-c0dbf63921b2"},{"objectId":"6839b9a0fdbe8331742614d9","name":"Marwan T.","lastName":"Mezher","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"39a6ab3e-caa7-40ee-b53d-cf85221b97c8"},{"objectId":"6839b9a0fdbe8331742614d8","name":"Alejandro","lastName":"Pereira","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c222789-27bc-4f93-97b2-256579ab1bb7"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d60b","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Trzepieciński","uuid":"B1173B4E25A04EF20A9FC72135EA66107445195FB931A6F929E34828CBA837AE85B5284995C35F3192186D9A1A95198DD9965EC89FB78C1E42ABBEFD475C5341","orcidId":"0000-0002-4366-0135","documentHash":"819127f8-0b2e-43f0-ae91-077e24078b38"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17092167"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Here, the key factor causing conductivity is the matching of oxygen octahedra tilting in KTaO3 and LaTiO3 which, due to a small gap in the LaTiO3 results in its sensitivity to the crystal structure, yields metallization of its overlayer and following charge transfer from Ti to Ta. Our findings, also applicable to other Mott insulators interfaces, shed light on the emergence of conductivity observed in LaTiO3=KTaO3 (110) where the “polar” arguments are not applicable and on the emergence of superconductivity in these structures."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944745","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6662d4824097075bc10e20a3","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"132","number":"21","doi":null,"documentHash":"c2bd6c76-a1aa-456c-a800-ba2dbf6cf248"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-7","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.216201","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839b9dafdbe83317426168d","name":"I.

This is due to its numerous advantages, such as easy adaptability, high efficiency, reliability and low fuel consumption. Despite these beneficial qualities of internal combustion engines, growing concerns are related to their negative environmental impacts. As a result, environmental protection has become a major factor determining advancements in the automotive industry in recent years, with the search for alternative fuels being one of the priorities in research and development activities. Among these, fuels of plant origin, mainly alcohols, are attracting a lot of attention due to their high oxygen content (around 35%). These fuels differ from diesel oil, for instance, in kinematic viscosity and density, which can affect the formation of the fuel spray and, consequently, the proper functioning of the compression–ignition engine, as well as the performance and purity of the exhaust gases emitted into the environment. The process of spray formation in direct injection compression–ignition engines is extremely complicated and requires detailed analysis of the fast-changing variables. This explains the need for using complicated research equipment enabling visualisation tests and making it possible to gain a more accurate understanding of the processes that take place. The present article aims to present the methodology for alternative fuel visualisation tests. To achieve this purpose, sprays formed by diesel–ethanol blends were recorded. A visualisation chamber and a high-speed camera were used for this purpose. The acquired video provided the material for the analysis of the changes in the vertex angle of the spray formed by the fuel blends. The test was carried out under reproducible conditions in line with the test methodology. The shape of the fuel spray is impacted by an increase in the proportional content of ethanol in the diesel and dodecanol blend. Based on the present findings, it is possible to note that the values of the vertex angle in the spray produced by the diesel–ethanol blend with the addition of dodecanol are most similar to those produced by diesel oil at an injection pressure of 100 MPa. The proposed methodology enables an analysis of the injection process based on the spray macrostructure parameters, and it can be applied in the testing of alternative fuels."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944747","journalIssue":{"objectId":"666fe0e84097073d0011ffeb","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"12","doi":null,"documentHash":"06795d62-e1b9-4684-b090-b1fed7f0c5c5"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/12/3012","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e70944e878c28a0473ba269","name":"Artur","lastName":"Krzemiński","uuid":"2CD9701F279E51321FEC25D0B335BD9B2D6CB5BBCD4DB6BC7FF0AFD474005E10FAD2CD12E0E761CAD203FC48EC2B5A4F58FF47B8363339FA05BD30541E61E7E7","orcidId":"0000-0003-4733-7308","documentHash":"e35d5378-f073-4883-a4b1-a5c6a769d9b2"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951f8","name":"Adam","lastName":"Ustrzycki","uuid":"3F3E939BE5EC1D64A8161F0D4401FBBF213410D901B986E5BF29F6DE15037E6F9093D0911A168D1A90EFE0AD71F55D7DD9CA77ED810FCFFFDA9348EA290E2807","orcidId":"0000-0003-3385-7222","documentHash":"6179eee4-50c7-43b4-932e-d847f2f13468"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17123012"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["water disinfection","underwater electrical discharges","liquid activation","cavitation"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The inactivation of microorganisms is intensified, firstly, by the generation of chemically active particles from the water medium itself, due to the integral action of the electro-discharge cavitation of the whole treated volume, and by local shock waves, acoustic flows, and ultraviolet radiation in the area near the cavitating bubbles. The main advantages of electric discharge cavitation over ultrasonic range are the wider range of high-frequency acoustic radiation inherent in an electric discharge, the high intensity and power of the cavitation processes, and the possibility of a significant increase in the volume of disinfected liquid.

It is known that hot-dip galvanisation changes and relives residual stresses, but so far the current design provisions do not take directly into account the impact of hot-dip galvanising on the reduction of residual stresses, and thus the reduction the generalised imperfection in the Ayrton-Perry model. The paper presents the difference between the relative buckling resistance of steel angles with residual stresses resulting from hot rolling and the same elements in which the magnitude of residual stresses was decreased by the hotdip galvanising process. Carried out tests and geometrically and materially non-linear analyses with imperfections (GMNIA) have shown that angles with residual stresses reduced by heat treatment caused by hot-dip galvanising have higher buckling resistance compared to those with residual stresses after hot rolling.

Różnice te są kluczowe dla zrozumienia roli, jaką uderzenia małych ciał niebieskich odgrywają dla kształtowania powierzchni Księżyca. Materia kosmiczna bez żadnych przeszkód dociera do powierzchni pozbawionego atmosfery Księżyca, zderzając się z nią z prędkościami wyrażanymi w kilometrach na sekundę. Znaczna większość tej materii to mikrometeoroidy i pył kosmiczny, których uderzenia mają jedynie lokalne skutki. Potęgowy charakter rozkładu liczebności małych ciał Układu Słonecznego w funkcji ich masy sprawia, że częstotliwość uderzeń w powierzchnię Księżyca obiektów o masach powyżej kilograma jest bardzo niska. Na obecnym etapie ewolucji Układu Słonecznego, brak endogenicznych procesów zachodzących w księżycowej litosferze sprawia, że zjawiska impaktowe i wietrzenie kosmiczne są praktycznie jedynymi procesami kształtującymi powierzchnię Księżyca."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944756","journalIssue":{"objectId":"663cde2c4097071b7589f5aa","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"b311c7fe-cc9a-4b58-8876-1b91df5f22d1"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"56-70","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://bibliotekanauki.pl/articles/30146490","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092b8878c28a04739b6a8","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Kaczmarzyk","uuid":"FBE41E9A23A8CC1D90761EA3B1FA0C6223299CFB2346CF5547A44343ACA8308207092942E2FFEAC7C8C8F68E48C4B1B883D86C38382E92F20D77DDB29704FA19","orcidId":"0000-0001-5605-5279","documentHash":"d1d09ef1-a953-4cd4-98b8-db4110f8a3d5"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["aluminum extrusion","bulk forming","KoBo method","7075 aluminum"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The resulting complexes have been thoroughly characterized using various analytical and spectral techniques, including elemental analysis, complexometry, thermogravimetry, UV–VIS, FT-IR, 1H NMR, 109AgNPET LDI MS and fluorescence spectroscopy. The molecular formulas of the complexes were determined as follows: Ln(3HF)3, where 3HF - 3-hydroxyflavone, Ln = La(III), Pr(III), Nd(III) and Ln(3HF)3·nH2O, where n = 1 for Ln = Ce(III), Sm(III), Eu(III), and n = 2 for Gd(III). Thermogravimetric studies revealed that the water molecules in the hydrated compounds are located in the outer coordination sphere. Based on the spectral data, it was noted that lanthanide ions interacted with the 3OH and 4CO groups of 3-hydroxyflavone. The effect of lanthanide ion chelation on the excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) process and fluorescence emission of 3HF was investigated. It was found that coordination with metal ions can suppress the ESIPT process and enhance the fluorescence emission of 3HF. The synthesized compounds were also screened for their antibacterial activity, free radical scavenging capacity, and interaction with BSA. The results showed that the complexes exhibit higher biological activity compared to the ligand."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944760","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bb24fdbe83317426202b","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"322","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"fdad5111-1db0-41b2-8abd-91f7897b5b5f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386142524010369?dgcid=author","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bb24fdbe83317426202d","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Przygórzewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"71389f16-b6a1-485b-836d-6711d48775c8"},{"objectId":"6839bb24fdbe83317426202c","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Woźnicki","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"94183dd4-d4bc-4124-92ac-5e13b390a9af"},{"objectId":"5f85248e085dcb410a25ed20","name":"Anna","lastName":"Miłoś","uuid":"6DFD042CC2BAE535787E3E3679A0DE2EE9B7040E4B40CDDA6D675A3428DD04312C5C94A6D8CEEAB2F590ABC58BA663953198160F112F3F759756A0E7580C9FC9","orcidId":"0000-0002-6583-0668","documentHash":"c6dd974e-88c1-4b70-8ad7-95eecacc3509"},{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5cc","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Byczyński","uuid":"3706428DBD76EED9842BBE1A7033BA0235F59A8BB25E2B8FDF602E1B999124E380DF6182F74F28C9EBE94511A0562F56235B2EBC4C9BE13FFF1E728539867485","orcidId":"0000-0001-7463-8785","documentHash":"dca3013c-ebfb-4e9b-b76b-81aad245b422"},{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5bd","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Woźnicka","uuid":"0D11FFBC83C4F95C519843EA8EF9ACF39E9042FCA40F932E378657BD9CEF7F0738CD9F0CF48F89AA76EDF8890E24026923DADE4340A5D311C0E96540AD94A1D4","orcidId":"0000-0002-7699-3593","documentHash":"623c3314-c366-4b1d-810b-db857057c6b5"},{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5b9","name":"Lidia","lastName":"Zapała","uuid":"EC93C787B12DE010DB65A8DB7BFBBA92B7C15AA62649EED162F5FBEB32EC0969AA84E782B3E1E044CC9FF5CF6EC8FEF4C07A944F0D116421F778ACC0EF5E09C0","orcidId":"0000-0003-2671-977X","documentHash":"391943c0-7b9e-4d45-a1c7-c347094df278"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d552","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Lecka-Szlachta","uuid":"ECDF998C9DC0D797F927101457CB778EE6B56C2722554BB013CEFE2240F8FC29C6B3312267BD94871994B2085914D898F2B02E502BA654486BC9A085EE1D91AF","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8179373a-2497-489f-b176-4c7311feb011"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d550","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ciszkowicz","uuid":"FD7F95D0B25E5722B9148A2C51DCC7A33070E3DDDEF2CAA372357EAE2D4C9F3F3A6A9A18A7DECF340D736673A5D97F5F394DF30582315C6193E79B15D4A3848B","orcidId":"0000-0003-3401-2264","documentHash":"663d8b75-cb3d-4f9d-879a-ebbb80fcae0d"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b5a9","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kosińska-Pezda","uuid":"5E344E68E96A753D6668D2A99A478187A45E9A93A38F45C8B8CD121AA90143198B2EDF728F31CAC96E766CD4A524D54F574AF7E4C06D7DA09EC4F8603DD14E73","orcidId":"0000-0002-2623-4740","documentHash":"72c23d55-1ce5-4f9e-8af2-2de8a764a7c7"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.saa.2024.124870"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["biomass","DDGS","sawdust","discrete element method","flowability","meat and bone meal"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Rising interest in biomass and conversion processes necessitates deeper property understanding and technological process optimization. Moisture content is a key parameter influencing biomass quality. In this paper, computer simulations of shear tests depending on the moisture content using the discrete element method were carried out and compared with experimental results. An experimental study and modeling for Jenike’s direct shearing apparatus was carried out. A swelling bed model was proposed to account for the effect of moisture. The swelling bed model assumed an increase in biomass grain vorticity proportional to the moisture content. The model was solved using the discrete element method (DEM). The model considers the effect of moisture on the values of Young’s and Kirchoff’s moduli for biomass grains. The model assumed that moisture is not present in surface form, the total amount of moisture is absorbed into the interior of the material grains, and the volume of a single grain increases linearly with an increase in the volume of the absorbed moisture. The tested materials were pulverized sunflower husks, apple pomace, distiller’s dried grains with solubles (DDGS), meat and bone meal (MBM), and sawdust. Samples with moisture contents of 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30% were tested. The best agreement of the model with the experimental data was observed for the most absorbent materials in which moisture was not present in surface form, such as apple pomace, DDGS, and sawdust. Research data are important for the proper design of biomass storage, transportation equipment, and utilization as feedstock for bioenergy production or soil enrichment."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944763","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839b9b9fdbe83317426159d","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"6","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"8047e60f-45f8-44a2-b08f-0117ec0e51d8"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1349-1364","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2624-7402/6/2/78","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6164f32875234017e05248ec","name":"Regina","lastName":"Przywara","uuid":"7200923113D5A658198DE7FF4E5B0731A788091F1B04661DEBC02F097273E9FC38D9CED044FA7E8C95ACAD421D22AA337B1946CAF69FD6434C0842B2EDB8028B","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ce58e590-afef-420d-a516-66f8a822b44d"},{"objectId":"5e709445878c28a0473b96cd","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Przywara","uuid":"4E758D6E52C615E4CFF8014C3A20B882F8BA525B28B04648107D5927BE6D0B32C2DDF35A23607DB810D6FA83E88789390D29FCE363D01E389455412CCF58EA16","orcidId":"0000-0001-7009-7811","documentHash":"0a87c9da-2556-4b27-8d7a-36b7a2bc3f89"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a04739519e","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Zapała","uuid":"7216A2097D05ECAF0F258BF82BC4D99C8FB7CEF7CFA981B00DB2A7206B71847E755127CF2124567DDF8D5F11007B099BE4E7841240DBE4DDE4C08CE72685EBBC","orcidId":"0000-0001-8225-7480","documentHash":"ecf2b11b-876a-454a-9572-aaf35b23a926"}],"doi":"10.3390/agriengineering6020078"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The model of our interest is nonlinear, and we explore the problem under different limits of weak and strong non-linearity. By applying two electric fields with different frequencies, we control the form of the confinement potential of a ferroelectric subsystem and realize different types of dynamics. We proved that the system is more sensitive to magnetoelectric coupling in the case of double-well potential. In particular, in the case of strong non-linearity, arbitrary small values of magnetoelectric coupling lead to chaotic dynamics. In essence, magnetoelectric coupling plays a role akin to the small perturbations destroying invariant tori according to the KAM theorem. We showed that bifurcations in the system are of Hopf’s type. We observed the formation of magnetoelectric fractals in the system. In the limit of weak nonlinearity, we studied a problem of parametric nonlinear resonance and enhancement of magnetic oscillations through magnetoelectric coupling."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944767","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839ba90fdbe833174261b7a","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"467","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"6fe0e8d2-ad0e-421f-b8ac-8ff407db0a2e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167278924002082?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839ba90fdbe833174261b7c","name":"S.K.","lastName":"Mishra","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7dfe7fa6-2a75-4819-a0af-23c56cebe721"},{"objectId":"6839ba90fdbe833174261b7b","name":"Z.","lastName":"Toklikishvili","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6eb5e719-e2ad-4297-bdc3-9ee2a241411a"},{"objectId":"624e4ca87523402df09dacec","name":"Levan","lastName":"Chotorlishvili","uuid":"CCFDFBB23332A7106F1B11437770516BB3A59268C0F7245C777F445A0F79A79AD83FE4BBDE3566E7AC5CF3CF055762F937EA7ADD9A73D48764B7090F7DA36D68","orcidId":"0000-0001-7042-9273","documentHash":"1cf6052d-0011-41d1-ba5f-2238528fd6f2"},{"objectId":"5e709447878c28a0473b97a7","name":"Michał","lastName":"Wanic","uuid":"312781C211F0067C1B5EC0AD2CC2059C896570A4EDB4E2394C30EE0243486E20060532CC4394C1124D57A67DB82B6AFD503A3A7FC762C69A33799F6F74EB18AC","orcidId":"0000-0002-4905-4988","documentHash":"f9e9f174-1092-46b0-926b-052122da180e"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d5ee","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Trybus","uuid":"451FF0E10FDC33831337C0C7D066DFA3503ECD43BA7E6067A919960AF8B51447B96D48B4E6C0ECF28A9B12D9BB178E353808F915D5E472AE32B192602BA6386E","orcidId":"0000-0002-7110-4769","documentHash":"f241057b-b8a1-4d58-b442-112585488e36"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.physd.2024.134257"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cylinder liner","Macro and micro wear","graphite","Phosphoric eutectic"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

In response to current trends related to sustainable construction and the circular economy, effective ways of modifying these composites with recycled materials are being sought. This approach, in turn, makes these materials require systematic monitoring of their durability, especially in the context of variable operating temperatures. The article describes the results of the testing of concrete-like epoxy composites modified with waste materials, both within the resin matrix – by glycolysate obtained on the basis of propylene glycol and poly(ethylene terephthalate) derived from waste beverage bottles, and aggregates - polyethylene agglomerate from waste bags and waste rubber granules from car tires. After seven days of maturation in laboratory conditions, the mortar samples were exposed in a climatic chamber to cyclic (50 and 100 cycles) temperature changes ranging from +20oC to +100oC and from -10oC to +10oC. Then, strength tests, changes in the mass and adhesion to cement concrete were carried out. The proposed material solution, combined with the conducted set of tests, brings scientific novelty to the field of building composites. The test results confirm the beneficial effect of modification, especially when it took place in the resin matrix. Positive temperature cycles resulted in post-hardening of the samples and thus an increase in the strength characteristics. The impact of negative temperatures was more unfavorable for the material; after 100 cycles, in most cases, a slight decrease in the mechanical parameters was noted, while the adhesion remained at a very good level, twice as high as that required for repair systems."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944901","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bafefdbe833174261ee3","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"24","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"e3794307-9d50-4ef3-a6f3-00a055eb8737"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"155-163","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://kompozyty.ptmk.net/article,the-influence-of-variable-temperature-conditions","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bafefdbe833174261ee5","name":"Marina Altoé","lastName":"Caetano","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4bc79dbb-0581-4689-b876-2b49e599ba8c"},{"objectId":"6839bafefdbe833174261ee4","name":"Guilherme Jorge Brigolini","lastName":"Silva","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b46e6a4f-5955-49b2-bda6-875ca40a60c9"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d538","name":"Bernardeta","lastName":"Dębska","uuid":"9BF8087B46AE52AB7932595F0A32779753241801972E4C7624BE85C9D58D5A6E02B487D4BF2486348E19E5761CB5F0F7E36FD3335FF120D118B1EFACFB875897","orcidId":"0000-0002-4377-9937","documentHash":"64e62bc9-41f5-4170-9685-8869324f1172"}],"doi":"10.62753/ctp.2024.10.2.2"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Politechnika Rzeszowska","współpraca z otoczeniem społeczno-gospodarczym","RFID"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Specially designed harvesters were used, dedicated to powering autonomous semi-passive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags. For the assumed resistive loads, the achievable output voltage values of the harvesters were measured across a wide spectrum of electromagnetic field strengths, simulating real conditions. The performance and dynamics of the energy storage process with fixed parameters were studied at an intermediate stage, before the energy conditioning process. The harvesters were treated as typical energy sources with unknown but variable parameters, so their dynamic parameters and instantaneous energy supply were also analyzed. These activities will enable the final development of a power supply system with parameters acceptable for the planned applications and whose efficiency will be maximized under the given conditions. For this purpose, the energy harvesting systems were designed, a suitable laboratory stand was built, and the elaborated circuits were measured to determine the expected parameters of energy harvesting."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944908","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66b36156fdbe8318804e9aff","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"13","number":"16","doi":null,"documentHash":"db7a4e6b-ac37-49ac-974d-475659327d00"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-29","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/16/3111","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d5eb","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Sabat","uuid":"0207333360D6B54FC7F11691CDC2BBC103FCAF15A69E09AE618E2A6E8D0DACD2FB594A9DF413248AEE9FD07907EE3F5773607AA0E5D7230CB2AB6533E492BB11","orcidId":"0000-0002-7467-5647","documentHash":"d8d079e7-82d8-498a-8ac7-c7b2536ce55b"},{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5e6","name":"Kazimierz","lastName":"Kuryło","uuid":"D978D49E72AB0779835E888B4051AEAA54EF1351D320C3AF97D841CBF26549CD9F2D08CB048B3E50826108AE235A5CA7073FFFDEE4126B52285BE666EA55933B","orcidId":"0000-0003-1386-5049","documentHash":"a3c7aec4-15f2-4c57-b826-36b89995d819"},{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5db","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Klepacki","uuid":"87CBF5983A5D31948C56F0D5BF42C824A06109063552A53CC2ACA3AF46AB08B677AE460847F6C1B3BD19E0579475B70BB84DF1E8640DF5055E2F41A8338ED11B","orcidId":"0000-0002-4396-5262","documentHash":"008ae4be-d4b2-44e4-8811-dd788aea40fc"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d55c","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Skoczylas","uuid":"CA9B3C93FF769D5EDFD162541D9A5FD6C75168A1E0AC016674E97248BB573347C810B1872EA5FD7C7A2147C4F96A81ACCBB67AFD0345711F63D52510D7535AD6","orcidId":"0000-0002-8722-5872","documentHash":"8b37c088-f0de-4ab7-8d8c-45b1a0371a14"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951db","name":"Kazimierz","lastName":"Kamuda","uuid":"1D412AA71407CAA5D31BFC923475D40EB56314317792C766A13922BF8A3A8041E9ECBE84BF8E5D2DC2E687FA3B90AA233EB9933FF7073F7685C54AD9B5C5FD43","orcidId":"0000-0001-7972-2636","documentHash":"4f70cd7d-9f21-4502-8f53-f84c0bf81bc8"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951d9","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Jankowski-Mihułowicz","uuid":"D88B5ADE4BD712A7B74E9BA85531387D183F63BBF42CF7E41D20A1267117874938D01D933AB485E9799599FDC3B838288A05B9CD539F90B593CF598E870E8431","orcidId":"0000-0001-7396-807X","documentHash":"ee8c0c33-030a-4831-8fdb-768fb8b58ecf"}],"doi":"10.3390/electronics13163111"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Fuzzy control","Interpretability of fuzzy rules","Adaptive control","Absolute stability"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Differential or convolutional equations can describe the plant to be controlled, and the fuzzy controller is assumed to be from the MIMO sector-bounded nonstationary nonlinearities class. The task is to obtain robust adaptive stabilization. Some absolute stability theorems and integral evaluations of the state and control vectors are applied in the MIMO fuzzy adaptive controller design procedure for the first time. A method for automatically obtaining a near-optimal nonlinear dynamic reference model is described. A practical step-by-step procedure of the MIMO adaptive fuzzy controller design is proposed, resulting in highly interpretable MIMO fuzzy control rules based on triangular fuzzy sets and strong triangular fuzzy partition. An example of the fuzzy controller design according to the proposed procedure is given."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944910","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bb82fdbe8331742622b5","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"680","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"6cc10097-427c-4078-99b0-d82fae167335"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025524011034?ref=pdf_download&fr=RR-2&rr=8bcc813adf984120","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951b2","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Wiktorowicz","uuid":"1B783371E7801906C05DBF8A5027B624A49A4E89CF8A4D9C77D210F87F2AA13983805C1A4EEFDF213073E5D6E81FB0CFC9A9746C1185D5F54B38CD18D00362DA","orcidId":"0000-0001-8711-1659","documentHash":"7fb42c56-0c21-46bf-9f6e-b1ddbc12c89d"},{"objectId":"5e7091f7878c28a04738dc47","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Kluska","uuid":"ED97B07FD04A3C0E5D0F4BCA74D5FB579CC48362914931BF81320603520F64D4CECB7ED782862D1A36F464F2607A4BA6CF1CC6C4E0DB937D6BEC77EF50F5C5B4","orcidId":"0000-0002-7317-7734","documentHash":"9fb5ea9d-2533-4e88-8d0a-f111964a470e"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ins.2024.121189"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["nośniki energii","koszty ciepła","optymalizacja","efektywność energetyczna"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

It attempts to integrate environmental policy by bringing together and improving several existing policies, initiatives and funding programs that address sustainability and climate change. This article analyzes the goals and objectives of the European Green Deal, as well as strategies for their implementation. The article establishes that the European Green Course is a longterm process that aims to build a better future for society and its main goal is the creation of a sustainable society. This goal can only be achieved with a holistic, allencompassing approach. The article also presents a theoretical conceptualization of sustainable finance and establishes that the appropriate distribution of investments and finances can lead to a successful and even transition of society towards sustainability and environmental improvement. Properly used, sustainable finance reduces the risk of societal negativity, which can be caused by the unavoidably high costs. In addition, systematic increases in funding are expected to result in a stable transition of society to sustainability. Although the correlation analysis does not show a direct relationship between sustainable finance for environmental protection and the implementation of the European Green Deal objectives, the research results indicate a strong correlation between the European Green Deal objectives and the allocation of sustainable finance to research and development and renewable energy resource usage. These differing conclusions can be explained by the fact that the allocation of sustainable finance to environmental protection is a much broader area than the other two variables analyzed separately. In addition, 27 EU countries have been ranked according to the effectiveness of their implementation of EGD directives and economic transition to pro-ecological technologies as of 2021. The positions of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have been determined and examined in detail."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944914","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839baabfdbe833174261c66","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"91d38564-6d1d-4474-8c3c-255dfb673f5d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"54-79","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.economics-sociology.eu/?1028,en_the-role-of-sustainable-finance-in-the-context-of-the-european-green-course","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839baabfdbe833174261c6a","name":"Dalia","lastName":"Streimikiene","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a5b6326d-80c9-423a-a88e-9fe383b72719"},{"objectId":"6839baabfdbe833174261c69","name":"Vilma","lastName":"Lėckienė","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0a82779d-35bb-423c-8187-ca8ccf3a14ee"},{"objectId":"6839baabfdbe833174261c68","name":"Asta","lastName":"Mikalauskiene","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1b8ff10f-ad05-42bc-80be-91eae99ad0b4"},{"objectId":"6839baabfdbe833174261c67","name":"Ignas","lastName":"Mikalauskas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9fe649b2-3cae-48fc-b891-89c2dc601ee9"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395253","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Pisula","uuid":"CF778D7B8D48034748CE64A080B52C0D3EDDA7452DA57081D707FE0A1BA4453B040996647346A6A56842DD464345EB2049E543809E771CA6793482B251B17F3F","orcidId":"0000-0001-7111-9955","documentHash":"73d84655-b8ed-4e43-9991-8c19972c8342"}],"doi":"10.14254/2071-789x.2024/17-2/3"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["sterownik przemysłowy","CPDev","Modbus"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["PLC","komunikacja"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

However, the shape of the transducers can be irregular, asymmetric (a-PZT), and its geometry can be an object for optimization. The paper presents an experimental validation of the application of optimal shaped a-PZT in the active reduction of triangular plate vibrations. Optimization was based on the criterion of the maximum bending moment. This means that the center of a-PZT is located at the point where the bending moment of the plate has reached its absolute maximum. The isosceles right triangular plate with simply supported edges was chosen as the research object. The research confirms the validity of the criterion used for optimization and may be an introduction to considering the use of optimal a-PZT in the active reduction of vibrations for more complex structures."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944917","journalIssue":{"objectId":"669a165cfdbe8343cdba2f06","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"70","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"1985a858-87c0-45d9-8077-65fa4aeada42"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"563-568","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ijet.pl/index.php/ijet/article/view/10.24425-ijet.2024.149579","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093df878c28a0473b24c8","name":"Sebastian","lastName":"Hajder","uuid":"008DC39B52265C088AE9511FDB960190E1CBD078BA029C371A0CE941D9004809942CAF76411BA7C32EADBA2C0777C8EEC6C7B908BDBEF61C81FD7BB3AD398C3A","orcidId":"0000-0003-0513-5994","documentHash":"92010751-0f84-4cd2-b4b5-7f7a90837bbb"},{"objectId":"5e7093df878c28a0473b24c6","name":"Romuald","lastName":"Kuras","uuid":"B089CC2CD9381DAF69037EA57793282D808D511180701717D813C1A453CAFA012F72AD4473F50F17B98B469F2C55D979A0B04A311652C352F922D7705388D3E8","orcidId":"0000-0002-7862-6252","documentHash":"287d3109-6d74-4d18-b8ee-8ced54d5f6b2"}],"doi":"10.24425/ijet.2024.149579"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["water treatment","human reliability","water supply","anthropotechnical system","human error"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

His task is to maintain an appropriate level of reliability and safety for the system by controlling the technological objects. The aim of the work was to assess the reliability of the WTP operator. The paper presents a Human Reliability Assessment (HRA) of the operator of the WTP using the Fuzzy-Bayes CREAM method. The values of the Human Error Probability (HEP) for operators were determined, which are key to carrying out further analyses of the human impact on the reliability and operational safety of anthropotechnical critical infrastructure systems.

The task of optimizing the required number of vehicles, drivers/driving crews, and route configuration was formulated and solved by mathematical programming with time constraints. At the same time, a variable method of organizing the work of drivers on adjacent routes was applied, by which drivers/crews are not assigned to a specific vehicle but are changed after a certain number of work hours. This minimized the non-productive idling of trucks, ensured compliance with the work and rest regulations of drivers, and minimized truck mileage on routes. In contrast to known methods and research results, the problem is solved with a guaranteed achievement of the optimum in an acceptable search time. This result was achieved due to the appropriate formulation of the solution conditions. The results can be applied in the logistic planning of transport processes."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944924","journalIssue":{"objectId":"667d4e44fdbe83017173521c","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"19","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"1a286747-5d41-4aaf-96bd-09a009eef923"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"205-218","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://transportproblems.polsl.pl/pl/Archiwum/2024/zeszyt2/2024t19z2_16.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bae2fdbe833174261e0c","name":"Myroslav","lastName":"Oliskevych","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ed6c64e7-536c-42c9-a66c-170d2a2ebd0c"},{"objectId":"6839bae2fdbe833174261e0b","name":"Gaziza","lastName":"Zhumatayeva","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"215378e6-d097-4029-addd-d3dd3112a2a4"},{"objectId":"67da3a38ece39867be099472","name":"Ihor","lastName":"Taran","uuid":"FB445DA2102ECEEEC2BE5180BF31EE15611D4C1E15F70B3D5423658EAB81B29250ED0E00225BB7A40D54CBB1B8890CD6E07A58F4CC90AEB773DB74189A9B6441","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d06d7fee-bb7e-43bd-aac8-4973bd190e1f"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d547","name":"Mateusz","lastName":"Szarata","uuid":"48FFFDE720291F97F722958D59A0481DDEA754CEDF96FBE00A17423D5536642BF57DC3E0ACA20196FB3181ACC9D39FA8ECEF7FE4CF10169E77FD5D9DE87C9220","orcidId":"0000-0003-0227-2811","documentHash":"01b1e202-3635-4b6d-bfd9-e6cb4c48c62e"}],"doi":"10.20858/tp.2023.19.2.16"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["mechanical engineering","social responsibility","LCA","production engineering","photovoltaic panels","quality"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The classic case is striving to meet customer expectations, i.e., ensuring product quality. However, in terms of sustainable development, it is also necessary to take actions that contribute to the protection of the natural environment and ensure a positive social impact. It is still a challenge. Therefore, the aim of the article is to develop a model for product improvement by considering the criteria of quality, environment, and social impact. The developed model is an original decision indicator, according to which prototypes of modified products are ranked according to their fulfillment of (i) expected quality, (ii) low environmental impact in the life cycle (LCA), and (iii) social responsibility. Based on the results of the model and the proposed decision indicator, it is possible to determine the direction of improvement of any product by assessing prototypes (product variants) in terms of their sustainable development. The model test is carried out for photovoltaic (PV) panels, popular in recent years, verified according to six prototypes and 15 sustainability criteria regarding their quality, environmental impact, and social responsibility. The test confirmed its effectiveness in the case of photovoltaic panels, but the proposed model can be successfully used to design or improve other products. This is supported by a developed original decision indicator supporting the making of multicriteria quality, environmental, and social decisions at the stage of designing new products or improving existing products."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944926","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bb56fdbe833174262189","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"151","number":"79","doi":null,"documentHash":"73e60810-cf1e-4c91-ab64-92e2b3598f0c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"5-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://repository.am.szczecin.pl/handle/123456789/2829","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c52","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Siwiec","uuid":"0D25573CF2F6189D6F2E868D46D1426725A137590D7F6EF0F5389766898882ED218F890F47C98AC469E938565A92A4B7C2056615A8944A96F515AAA25FEE2128","orcidId":"0000-0002-6663-6621","documentHash":"6d5070e6-7a6e-444d-bae6-f7a4f58e8a5a"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395225","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pacana","uuid":"35D510AA8256DE5E4DEFDF38BF16202BA667F52A940F41C64492BE30097E6AB925BC3352AC6B374350D9E16190A5FD0052B2F59362CFC99AC0345A7CA51144BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1121-6352","documentHash":"bc6c1d9b-8450-4a34-8498-0e87c14cd6d6"}],"doi":"10.17402/610"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Au interlayer","titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V)","Cu interlayer","resistance spot-welding","DP600 steel"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The welded joints obtained by RSW without an interlayer were also considered. The influence of Cu and Au as an interlayer on the resulting microstructure as well as mechanical properties (shear force and microhardness) of the joints were determined. A typical type of failure of Ti6Al4V/DP600 joints produced without the use of an interlayer is brittle fracture. The microstructure of the resulting joint consisted mainly of the intermetallic phases FeTi and Fe2Ti. The microstructure of the Ti6Al4V/Au/DP600 joint contained the intermetallic phases Ti3Au, TiAu, and TiAu4. The intermetallic phases TiCu and FeCu were found in the microstructure of the Ti6Al4V/Cu/DP600 joint. The maximum tensile/shear stress was 109.46 MPa, which is more than three times higher than for a welded joint fabricated without the use of Cu or Au interlayers. It has been observed that some alloying elements, such as Fe, can lower the martensitic transformation temperature, and some, such as Au, can increase the martensitic transformation temperature."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944928","journalIssue":{"objectId":"667d357efdbe8301716f7fb5","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"13","doi":null,"documentHash":"85c7784c-8fcc-40c3-aa8a-5608f275e7c8"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-21","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/13/3251","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bab6fdbe833174261cba","name":"Marwan T.","lastName":"Mezher","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c67c779-4d3d-4b41-b4d4-48b932937f85"},{"objectId":"5f8517f3085dcb410a25ed0c","name":"Marek","lastName":"Szewczyk","uuid":"061018F0B6B70D10386DF789993A8C9F85F31E1C6DC911651D81FEF167F6616F8FA2ECCB0824CA95C978F00D21407A46356B8C5EB18866928F35BC94F08681D3","orcidId":"0000-0002-3622-6613","documentHash":"aee1f202-2b71-49b9-ae8d-4b0b145c1e63"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5bbb","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Zielińska-Szwajka","uuid":"49AD64364D21A828314C0596FD75085DA570E9446C8DB6631BBC544A1FCA28170DE898DB3DAEF447357C9276D0DC7A91DE17660699291FC8E8ED11D39DEBF0D8","orcidId":"0000-0002-6212-2666","documentHash":"9b674641-c845-42e0-9500-b0b5233cddde"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d60b","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Trzepieciński","uuid":"B1173B4E25A04EF20A9FC72135EA66107445195FB931A6F929E34828CBA837AE85B5284995C35F3192186D9A1A95198DD9965EC89FB78C1E42ABBEFD475C5341","orcidId":"0000-0002-4366-0135","documentHash":"819127f8-0b2e-43f0-ae91-077e24078b38"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923d1","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Szwajka","uuid":"BE3DBEF640820E864475437AEC4DB8978AE4FC0B4B3B99093CD4857E27DEEA7E923758AFBB9E791E11BF13C3EA626287D3C4FCE7C77FBDA928B5DCDAAE66EFFE","orcidId":"0000-0002-1038-1148","documentHash":"60c70249-8eb8-40a1-ae88-4991b4235bad"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17133251"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["maintenance process","NN","k-NN algorithm","SVM","machine learning"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Avoiding unexpected breakdowns that result in high costs and production losses is a major concern. Not only the selection of appropriate maintenance strategies, but also the use of appropriate methods and tools to support decision making in this area is essential to achieve this goal. This article presents the possibility of using machine learning methods to develop predictive models to support decision making in maintenance management. For this purpose, three different machine learning methods have been considered: Neural Networks (NN), the k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These models were constructed using variables identified through statistical analysis as having a significant impact on the effectiveness of maintenance processes, specifically the availability of machinery in the production process. The developed models were subjected to a qualitative evaluation, which led to the identification of the SVM model as the most suitable to support decision making in the planning and execution of maintenance processes."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944930","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66e3f8e1fdbe83273785433a","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"58","number":"8","doi":null,"documentHash":"a2e85c32-6903-48de-87aa-4a6db050124c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"85-90","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896324007729","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bbc2fdbe8331742624ad","name":"Jozef","lastName":"Husar","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5ecc3ce6-fbe0-4298-8915-9cc34f915045"},{"objectId":"6839bbc2fdbe8331742624ac","name":"Monika","lastName":"Kulisz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"47e4ed99-5c61-4908-9432-924dba2b75aa"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d612","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Antosz","uuid":"9227B894B819EC4FDA2000BA79F84317ABB82DB4451CE7BB5D6C607B3A89F9108D5AB04E8550B5275998C42D6B3E39C9BD4C243E6305197D3E17B6F65BF30493","orcidId":"0000-0001-6048-5220","documentHash":"169c335d-2e8d-4a05-8762-4ffd1a8b65e3"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ifacol.2024.08.055"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The reliability of the products it manufactures is determined by the technologies used, but, most importantly, it ensures the expected level of quality. The purpose of the article is to develop a synergistic quality-cost model for the improvement of casting products. The model is based on an integral methodological configuration that makes it possible to determine the level of relevance of the causes of casting nonconformity in the quality-cost context. The model integrates techniques such as the Pareto-Lorenz diagram, ranking, brainwriting, Ishikawa diagram, Likert rating scale, and matrix diagram. Verification of the method by its implication in the manufacturing process of a gearbox casting is performed. The model makes it possible to identify quality-cost relationships between key categories of problem causes and major product nonconformities. The main causes of the loss of quality stability of the analyzed product are found to be low quality of molding sand, poor technical condition of foundry equipment (too infrequent repairs and overhauls), and ineffective quality control. Carrying out the analysis made it possible to develop appropriate improvement measures. It is proposed to implement changes in the casting process, implement the TPM method, conduct periodic training, develop job instructions, implement a control system, and provide supervision of employees.

This study analyzes Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) in the Polish construction industry. Regression analysis, difference tests, and robustness checks were conducted to achieve the goals of this study. The regression analysis results confirm a limited positive relationship between firms implementing ISO 9001 and WCME. Additionally, the difference tests show no significant differences in WCME between firms that implemented ISO 9001 and those that did not. During the coronavirus pandemic, a sharp decrease in inventory management costs was observed in firms. Inventories did not linger in warehouses, so they did not generate unnecessary costs, but were quickly sold at high margins. The inventory turnover rates on different days were low. These results suggest that controlling stock levels and receivables during crises is essential because payment bottlenecks and delayed deliveries can occur quickly. The insights generated from this study demonstrate that Polish SMEs in the construction industry fail to realize optimum WCME. Therefore, policymakers in Poland must improve managers’ and shareholders’ awareness of the usefulness of working capital management (WCM)."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944935","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bbdbfdbe83317426254a","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"11","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"5cd07f14-488f-4dff-97b7-280322b5daa7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23311975.2023.2292787","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bbdbfdbe83317426254c","name":"Daniela","lastName":"Haluza","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ed78d91c-fea5-494e-a248-0fc853b551e3"},{"objectId":"6839bbdbfdbe83317426254b","name":"Ahmed Mohamed","lastName":"Habib","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a3e5524a-fa40-4a97-a6e5-99909b5e1ec9"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d5a7","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Zimon","uuid":"A0980B4FE76CCF543EF38F8057F61826A29426B4FC39BE0B8091091E347263D4216D667E5CF47E850FC5783C479BAA153F2F70DC6FC591D89C5E1B69DCEC3F5D","orcidId":"0000-0002-2040-4438","documentHash":"e9213c49-1339-471f-8a43-a44604296abc"}],"doi":"10.1080/23311975.2023.2292787"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["generative adversarial network","semi-supervised deep learning","autoencoder","vibrational signal","anomaly detection","gear fault diagnosis"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

This study compares the effectiveness of three forecasting models: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). This study utilizes data from two wind farms located in Poland—‘Gizałki’ and ‘Ł˛eki Dukielskie’—to exclude the possibility of biased results due to specific characteristics of a single farm and to allow for a more comprehensive comparison of the effectiveness of both time series analysis methods. Model parameterization was optimized through a grid search based on the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The performance of the best models was evaluated using Mean Bias Error (MBE), MAPE, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R2Score. For the Gizałki farm, the ARIMA model outperformed SARIMA and SVR, while for the Ł˛eki Dukielskie farm, SARIMA proved to be the most accurate, highlighting the importance of optimizing seasonal parameters. The SVR method demonstrated the lowest effectiveness for both datasets. The results indicate that the ARIMA and SARIMA models are effective for forecasting wind farm energy production. However, their performance is influenced by the specificity of the data and seasonal patterns. The study provides an in-depth analysis of the results and offers suggestions for future research, such as extending the data to include multidimensional time series. Our findings have practical implications for enhancing the accuracy of wind farm energy forecasts, which can significantly improve operational efficiency and planning."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944938","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66fd176bfdbe836fcb7ad876","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"19","doi":null,"documentHash":"9dcad991-6c59-45c1-91d8-163286b133dc"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/19/4803","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bc69fdbe8331742629c9","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Kusznier","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4ca4136f-baa6-4b72-9c2f-7a67b684f277"},{"objectId":"6545baba40e3ff4ef3f3fe5b","name":"Kamil","lastName":"Szostek","uuid":"AAAFD78671EE6794B57358B8B6CF9F3E23599EF79F9391167FBEB6E8198A230D21AACFFB19A1933D7050F134464F15E2BCE22702DC6B998E94D9C4D6631B6F29","orcidId":"0009-0003-5032-4038","documentHash":"ca17060e-3b6c-46ea-8c90-07096d01468f"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d5ec","name":"Damian","lastName":"Mazur","uuid":"C5C27537D18191016B14D55E9E2D1896D662AE78E60D3836E675D56F9BE1819A7E873408D6A5CE8385FF5FA90E59DE1E9993A5DAF48BFDF0A01F35FA205DE9F1","orcidId":"0000-0002-3247-5903","documentHash":"4b2f5f74-734f-4132-9532-a901ae59718f"},{"objectId":"5e709248878c28a047392f34","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Drałus","uuid":"6F81AD42DC594F5A6A8F3370A9063A79ED27DFB3E3ED87EBB529D19D102296DC418D58CF31CCE1074B91B44418CE658334CE67676A81B8779B487C1B6E590A18","orcidId":"0000-0001-7963-8602","documentHash":"0a288a2c-4647-4e32-905c-539288293da4"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17194803"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Micropollutant concentration","Urban runoff","Stormwater quality","Microplastics","Phthalates"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Four leading groups of new emerging pollutants have been identified that may be present in rainwater and municipal wastewater mixtures. The samples were tested for microplastics, phthalic acid esters, pesticides, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as well as basic parameters. The pilot site was Słupsk (northwestern Poland).

The results of the present study revealed that (i) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were not present in the tested samples; (ii) the selected organochlorine pesticides were detected during one campaign in the dry season and therefore were not of critical importance; (iii) out of the 11 analyzed phthalic acid esters, five selected substances released from commonly used plastic products were present; and (iv) the number of microplastics contained in the tested samples ranged from 1,400 to 14,036 pcs/L and even occurred during pure rainfall."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944940","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6597d34e40970755be5e2b9e","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"7b2bf3c4-186e-4bd9-8908-044ad024e285"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-69099-8","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bbfcfdbe833174262661","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Artichowicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7f068f5c-0ffe-4890-8b4a-333beb598ead"},{"objectId":"6839bbfcfdbe833174262660","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Kołecka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ca2e9799-16aa-4d53-9019-c6305822f418"},{"objectId":"6839bbfcfdbe83317426265f","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Gajewska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b9b15351-96e0-41a8-b35b-73bb00b9b284"},{"objectId":"6839bbfcfdbe83317426265e","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Fitobór","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"87596191-a684-441a-9fcc-a9bf351d59c6"},{"objectId":"6839bbfcfdbe83317426265d","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Ulańczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1ddfb0a0-5a80-4761-b811-3245968e7ea8"},{"objectId":"5e7092b8878c28a04739b69d","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Kida","uuid":"73D4FBF8C061EEB0AEC85E6563A0519D20127DB99D94A1C78AB5D62C5E8287B777D28A36428D98D1114DA32C0CF243AA2080F442EF9C139D6F7936F74C870BD1","orcidId":"0000-0003-1744-4014","documentHash":"66604140-6026-4c79-bd98-6b5de21c80d8"}],"doi":"10.1038/s41598-024-69099-8"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["logistics management","norms","material needs","Standards"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The aim of this study was to characterise coated sheets and to analyse the influence of elevated temperature on changes in their selected properties. The methodology and experiments were chosen to simulate the accelerated ageing and to evaluate the surface of organic-coated steel sheets. During the research, the effect of artificial ageing due to increased temperature on changes in mechanical properties of coated sheets was monitored, which were determined by tensile testing according to STN EN 10002-1. The fracture surface of the test samples was analysed using a SEM. The following observations were made for the evaluation of coating by cross-cut tests according to EN ISO 2409. Corrosion tests were carried out by conducting salt spray corrosion tests according to EN ISO 9227. The test specimens were artificially sectioned using a laser beam. The results of the research experiments confirmed the assumption that the utilisation of the laser beam was convenient for the creation cross–cut test of the material. After the ageing test, only small significant changes in the basic mechanical properties of the tested materials were observed. It is necessary to take into account that there were changes in the appearance of the coating. The cross-cut test confirmed the results that the plastic-coated sheets could be utilised in salt corrosion environments."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944944","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66b4568bfdbe83691bc61b28","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"16","doi":null,"documentHash":"963c3b51-8dd5-4794-95a5-00f258c34c22"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-27","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/16/3891","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bb7ffdbe8331742622a4","name":"Miroslava","lastName":"Badidova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"aec09722-75dc-4f70-9047-dec17c91da58"},{"objectId":"6839bb7ffdbe8331742622a3","name":"Janette","lastName":"Brezinova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"07c95c82-7825-4ab2-9558-49bd22f26f88"},{"objectId":"6839bb7ffdbe8331742622a2","name":"Lydia","lastName":"Sobotova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5a14587b-5085-4ec5-8be1-a2c2317b3cd3"},{"objectId":"6839bb7ffdbe8331742622a1","name":"Miroslav","lastName":"Badida","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a0bf87a7-1b6c-4ba7-93d1-59877a8eea4f"},{"objectId":"6839bb7ffdbe8331742622a0","name":"Alica","lastName":"Maslejova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"44ff5802-8ba1-4825-ad2b-e7e181076752"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d606","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Ciecińska","uuid":"22620F1F0E9D9E3ACBA14E467DC4B2EA6302406A2C82BCF821608DA760CA8EAB8F114A5F7EE640847A05022C2211AD2DF7CA8040AF93349B3F78CD82791DC7F8","orcidId":"0000-0001-7966-0420","documentHash":"b334633c-0b6e-46f0-bc00-8f9f223aa8a6"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17163891"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["next-11 countries","tax revenue","Exchange rate","external debt","foreign direct investment"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The model aims to identify the total cost of services by implementing cost accounting practices commonly used in the private sector. Design/Methodology/Approach: The research is conceptual in nature. A critical and in-depth literature review method was used to evaluate the existing practices in public service valuation and to address some of their limitations. A model concept has been proposed to complement the currently used solutions. Findings: The model includes a catalog of services for which the total cost has been calculated using the proposed algorithm. The concept is based on the consideration of both direct and indirect costs, including departmental costs and overhead costs. In the proposed approach, indirect costs are allocated using a work-time key, with a two-stage allocation process that reduces inadequate divisions, which is particularly valuable in organizations with highly diversified operations. The algorithm takes into account the scenarios of service delivery within a single department as well as across multiple departments. Practical Implications: Public funds should be spent purposefully and economically, making their control crucial in this context. Additionally, for decision-makers in local governments, information on the costs of service delivery is key for evaluating efficiency and optimizing costs, and, in the longer term, for freeing up additional financial resources. The practice of valuation also contributes to building the managerial maturity of the unit and can serve as a foundation for benchmarking cooperation.

The paper presents design method for a novel class of omnidirectional mirrors characterized by their settable reflection angle and 3D/2D image projection. Such approach can effectively improve the mirrored image distribution on matrix of optical sensor. A complex mirror curvature was manufactured with application of computerized numerical control milling machines and Physical Vapor Deposition technique. Three prototypes with 15◦, 30◦ and 45◦ vertical top view angles were tested. Mirrors were applied to get a set of wide range cloud-to-ground lightning video registrations. Analysis of the high-speed video confirmed design assumptions, and using lightning location system data, enabled dimensioning and measurement of the lightning channel geometry in 3D. Proposed method can be easily implemented in other applications involving omnidirectional observation and photogrammetry."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944949","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bc42fdbe8331742628b1","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"242","number":"Part A","doi":null,"documentHash":"fa681956-d8ba-4e8c-81d3-9e17064f48b2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263224124016919?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d563","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Karnas","uuid":"B250F65B8F054C4DFAC47BD9F5B5C0793F758A33104371BEE638EE8ABE329DA14C8969F4C287C109EB6A4F22E04CC5F45A0E5F3161B0C3464CF39DBC92653F45","orcidId":"0000-0002-2255-5926","documentHash":"b234729a-06f4-4674-9ec8-394f4b0c03b6"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.measurement.2024.115806"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["composite reinforcement","deck slabs","lightweight concrete","fatigue life"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

One of the critical limit states determining the possibility of using LWC/FRP slabs in road bridge decks is fatigue life. This paper presents the results of research in the field of fatigue life of such decks. A total of nine full-size concrete slabs measuring 3.0 m × 1.0 m × 0.18 m were tested. The main parameters of the slabs compared in the study were: type of concrete (light vs. ordinary), reinforcement ratio of the slabs and the level of fatigue load. The results of fatigue tests were analysed based on crack morphology analysis and slab deflection as well as fatigue life and failure form evaluation. Design procedures adopted in selected standards were also verified to assess the fatigue life of such decks."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944951","journalIssue":{"objectId":"669a2dd9fdbe8343cdbb34cf","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"23","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"ee9758ba-cf12-4a91-bc1f-75ca04de88bf"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"155-178","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.rabdim.pl/index.php/rb/article/view/843","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092b8878c28a04739b69b","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Wiater","uuid":"D4F0F349E81477E00DE0DE97418DE33024B64E7F4F33FEF1A9AC8A52B3C227455513CB8C0CCB6A98C4CFE71DD22F9B949AF30178C6EC1A9428A715C0A797CFE5","orcidId":"0000-0001-5559-3841","documentHash":"79de45d2-5f93-4e42-8213-0b705e18606c"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395160","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Siwowski","uuid":"60E8AE045DE688D769347355C56C8ACF612FC404CCB43774DF91B6FB20CB70B23B67D3647BC155D695119572CBE4E944782E8D58B9D096B9ABC47EF17FDFF467","orcidId":"0000-0002-2003-000X","documentHash":"ce87cefc-d930-4bec-971d-b5a30ea41ab0"}],"doi":"10.7409/rabdim.024.008"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["dualism in public administration","voivode","decentralization","security protection","local government","voivode’s recommendations","protection of public order"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

However, since 1-butanol is characterized, like many other alcohols, by poor autoignition properties and, consequently, a low cetane number, the introduction of this additive into diesel fuel naturally worsens the autoignition properties of the blend so obtained. It is usual to consider a proportion of 1-butanol no higher than approx. 30% alcohol by volume. Thus, when considering the addition of 1-butanol to diesel fuel, it is necessary to improve the autoignition properties of such a blend. One such additive may be 2-ethylhexyl nitrate (2-EHN). This article determines the effect of the 2-EHN additive on the autoignition properties of a blend of 1-butanol and diesel fuel at an alcohol content of 30% (v/v). The tests were carried out using a constant volume combustion chamber method, which additionally made it possible to determine the effect of ambient gas temperature on the ignition delay (ID), combustion delay (CD) and derived cetane number (DCN), among other factors. The study showed, among other things, that with an increase in the mass proportion of 2-EHN in the 1-butanol–diesel blend (BDB) tested, the ignition and combustion delay were shortened, which resulted in an increase in the value of the derived cetane number."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944956","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66b46819fdbe83188052de2b","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"16","doi":null,"documentHash":"3a57ee6a-61cd-4a8b-8158-f343ff3be263"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/16/4085","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951f5","name":"Hubert","lastName":"Kuszewski","uuid":"A3CFA9B27EEBF2E25AF3C583B815D3352C5BEBBE7F8605A83C8CCDD8A383555D4F2B8B775117DA7EC6776C487076B8F8DA0876884B1FE746F12FFC857E7F2FC3","orcidId":"0000-0002-2294-6249","documentHash":"32e187ed-7a14-4078-a1e1-f06a9aa0e3e3"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951f4","name":"Artur","lastName":"Jaworski","uuid":"B5F54FAEC8ECB017F321D7A14523413B4F3CBD823FE98272A7CF3933D76D98E2586886EA9C074169E3973945B90EAF44BEE89FE46161474CA8E52FE4FCADBD33","orcidId":"0000-0002-1599-1711","documentHash":"4a6b8539-e59a-43ef-b5cc-53a7b75bf0b2"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17164085"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sustainable development","BOST survey","3x3 matrix","eco-development","Process Improvement","statistical analysis"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The study used a 3x3 linkage matrix divided into zones within which the results of surveys (carried out using a modified BOST questionnaire) were distributed, and statistical analyses were carried out to determine the level of importance of the considered factors from the area of technological capabilities and product competitiveness referring directly to the idea of sustainable development. The identified key factors referring to eco-development (optimization of the use of productive resources, design of a closed production cycle, in-house research and development) make up the development of new innovative sustainable technologies that will contribute to material savings and efficient use of energy, and thus have a positive impact on the environment.

For the study, development trend (trend) models were used to forecast the changes that will occur in the credit card market in Poland. The analysis was carried out with the use of STATISTICA 13.3. The analysis was based on the results of a study conducted by the National Bank of Poland on the use of payment cards, including credit cards, in retail payments. The article hypothesizes that with the increasing fees associated with the use of credit cards, the number of credit cards issued, as well as the number of transactions carried out using them, is decreasing. The research conducted in the article made it possible to make a prediction, according to which the number of credit cards can be expected to fall to 3.51 million cards by the end of 2024, and to fall to 2.17 million by the end of 2025. On the other hand, the value of credit card transactions conducted, according to the forecast, will increase to PLN 61,807.11 million by the end of 2024, and to 64,249.09 million by the end of 2025. Further technological advances will have an increasing impact on increasing competition among credit card issuers.

The study sample consists of 1200 observations and 200 companies listed on the TSE over a six-year period from 2016 to 2021; furthermore, the statistical method used to test the hypotheses is ordinary least squares (OLS). The results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has led managers to increase current assets to total assets ratio (CATAR), current ratio (CR), quick ratio (QR), net working capital (NWC), cash to current assets (CTCA) ratio, while it has caused a decrease in operational cycle (OC), days account receivables (DAR), and current liabilities to total assets ratio (CLTAR). Furthermore, we find that the higher the company’s risk, the more managers are motivated to embrace the working capital investment policy, net working capital, cash to current assets ratio, and cash conversion efficiency (CCE). In general, our findings indicate that during times of crisis, Iranian companies tend to adopt conservative working capital policies to ensure sufficient liquidity to respond appropriately to unforeseen events. In this study, the theory of liquidity preference aligns with the observed behavior of firms in response to the COVID-19 crisis and firm risk, where the emphasis on liquidity and short-term financial stability becomes paramount."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944963","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bbdffdbe83317426255c","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"12","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"51b9bcd9-4a79-4d2c-85e3-0ec1b74a8590"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-33","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9091/12/4/72","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bbdffdbe83317426255f","name":"Mohammad","lastName":"Sayrani","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0d72470a-a391-4f9e-a177-fa62fc0cf796"},{"objectId":"6839bbdffdbe83317426255e","name":"Mohammad Javad","lastName":"Sheikh","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6c006f02-9b92-4e8a-843e-45aa855e7980"},{"objectId":"6839bbdffdbe83317426255d","name":"Hossein","lastName":"Tarighi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5b0c4186-08ca-4082-894e-c9a3b5be8f25"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d5a7","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Zimon","uuid":"A0980B4FE76CCF543EF38F8057F61826A29426B4FC39BE0B8091091E347263D4216D667E5CF47E850FC5783C479BAA153F2F70DC6FC591D89C5E1B69DCEC3F5D","orcidId":"0000-0002-2040-4438","documentHash":"e9213c49-1339-471f-8a43-a44604296abc"}],"doi":"10.3390/risks12040072"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["ANN","measuring systems","volume fraction","multiphase homogeneous fluid","photon attenuation sensor","capacitance-based sensor"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Hence, there are lots of scientists and researchers who have introduced many methods and equipment in this regard, for example, photon attenuation sensors, capacitance-based sensors, and so on. These approaches are non-invasive and for this reason, are very popular and widely used. In addition, nowadays, artificial neural networks (ANN) are very attractive in a lot of fields and this is because of their accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, to estimate volume proportion of a three-phase homogeneous fluid, a new system is proposed that contains an MLP ANN, standing for multilayer perceptron artificial neural network, a capacitancebased sensor, and a photon attenuation sensor. Through computational methods, capacities and mass attenuation coefficients are obtained, which act as inputs for the proposed network. All of these inputs were divided randomly in two main groups to train and test the presented model. To opt for a suitable network with the lowest rate of mean absolute error (MAE), a number of architectures with different factors were tested in MATLAB software R2023b. After receiving MAEs equal to 0.29, 1.60, and 1.67 for the water, gas, and oil phases, respectively, the network was chosen to be presented in the paper. Hence, based on outcomes, the proposed approach’s novelty is being able to predict all phases of a homogeneous flow with very low error."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944965","journalIssue":{"objectId":"613b11792467f045c82f0cd4","year":"2021","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"14","doi":null,"documentHash":"4fd9015d-247e-43b5-9b38-27257a6b2c12"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-20","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/14/3519","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839baf3fdbe833174261e85","name":"Salman Arafath","lastName":"Mohammed","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"25554a01-154c-45b5-930a-cb9a22909f35"},{"objectId":"6839baf3fdbe833174261e84","name":"Farhad","lastName":"Fouladinia","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"849b3c16-8e44-42ff-b53a-aa8b27d0365f"},{"objectId":"6839baf3fdbe833174261e83","name":"Mohammed Abdul","lastName":"Muqeet","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c8047a80-3baa-4e1c-ac9b-3a3f7ec50894"},{"objectId":"6839baf3fdbe833174261e82","name":"Muneer","lastName":"Parayangat","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bfe0125f-529f-49ed-b481-903942482470"},{"objectId":"6839baf3fdbe833174261e81","name":"Abdulilah Mohammad","lastName":"Mayet","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7377a5fd-b728-4efe-bb12-94a3f15f8d08"},{"objectId":"6839baf3fdbe833174261e80","name":"M.

Therefore, the objective of this investigation was to develop a method that supports the sustainable development of materials and the products made from them based on an aggregated indicator of quality and environmental load in the life cycle (QLCA). The testing and illustration of the QLCA method included a passenger car tyre and nine prototypes. These prototypes were described using eight quality criteria: season, class, size of the load index, speed index, rolling, adhesion, and external noise. Then, customer expectations regarding the importance of the criteria and satisfaction with the indicators in the current and modified states were obtained. Based on the customer assessment, the quality indicators of the prototypes were assessed. This assessment was supported by the weighted sum model (WSM) and the entropy method. Then, life cycle assessment for the reference tyre was performed using the Ecoinvent database in the OpenLCA program. LCA indicators were modelled for other prototypes, taking into account quality changes. As a result of the verification of the method, an aggregated QLCA indicator was estimated, based on which it was possible to select the most favourable (qualitatively and environmentally) prototype out of nine. This was the P4 prototype (QLCA = 0.57). The next position in the ranking was taken by P7 (QLCA = 0.43). The QLCA method can be used to determine the direction of development of materials and products in terms of their sustainable development."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944967","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66a33f9dfdbe836c5d88a443","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"15","doi":null,"documentHash":"c7715c0d-8c93-4d5a-a060-d5681e89b317"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-22","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/15/3859","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c52","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Siwiec","uuid":"0D25573CF2F6189D6F2E868D46D1426725A137590D7F6EF0F5389766898882ED218F890F47C98AC469E938565A92A4B7C2056615A8944A96F515AAA25FEE2128","orcidId":"0000-0002-6663-6621","documentHash":"6d5070e6-7a6e-444d-bae6-f7a4f58e8a5a"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395225","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pacana","uuid":"35D510AA8256DE5E4DEFDF38BF16202BA667F52A940F41C64492BE30097E6AB925BC3352AC6B374350D9E16190A5FD0052B2F59362CFC99AC0345A7CA51144BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1121-6352","documentHash":"bc6c1d9b-8450-4a34-8498-0e87c14cd6d6"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17153859"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Suspended sediment","Retention reservoirs","Organic matter","Stable isotopes","Sediment accumulation","Heavy metals"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The studies were carried out in the summer season of 2019 at Nielisz Reservoir (southeastern Poland, Lublin Voivodeship). Finally, a previously unknown factor related to the quality of organic matter was identified. Autochthonous organic matter was shown to promote the accumulation of the studied heavy metals. To date, the significance of the origin of organic matter in the context of the transport and fate of heavy metals in retention reservoirs has rarely been reported in the scientific literature. More than that, this factor was not considered an important component in the process of heavy metal deposition in bottom sediments. However, it turns out that not only the quantity of organic matter, but also its quality plays an important role in the circulation of heavy metals in retention reservoir ecosystems. It was found that autochthonous organic matter promotes the accumulation of the studied heavy metals. It can be assumed that, in a sense, it plays the role of a catenary (\"hub\") controlling the fate of heavy metals in the water-sediment system. It has also been conjectured that, in a sense, OMS may reflect the potential for heavy metal assimilation by aquatic vascular plants (mainly of the C3 group). Plants with a photosynthetic pathway similar to the C3 group generally have a much lower enrichment in the 13C isotope (δ13C from −38‰ to −22‰). In our case, the lowest δ13C-TOCS value was −24.05‰, and the average for the whole reservoir was −21.53‰. In addition, it was observed that quantitative changes in the isotopic composition of total organic carbon δ13C-TOCS, corresponded with changes in the content of the heavy metals studied in entrapped sediments."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944968","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66dec33efdbe832ef89c2140","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"361","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"739d89f7-5f77-489c-8576-7a8bd8c28e8a"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0269749124015252?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094ab878c28a0473c1528","name":"Maksymilian","lastName":"Cieśla","uuid":"6A5BE66730F42BEAEB840ADDE3B41F6D67F7827DD071D3F767AE6E3B598B6A6A8F3AF73C697DF3799ADB7E26FEA6426A7CCD4FCE2CD61A24FA11F15724F0FCC1","orcidId":"0000-0001-5533-9560","documentHash":"fc6076ec-7d82-4d22-bdcc-f4519dfd13e9"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395187","name":"Renata","lastName":"Gruca-Rokosz","uuid":"CBD87A0CB06465C9BE56E9692CB7183ED6AC59E7094EBA7D93446DB9402648696E533AF8988289C773446DBFC18BFBD03D72F6B4F7C3CCD4A0AC809E18C67D6A","orcidId":"0000-0001-8222-2480","documentHash":"56db2117-f184-43b2-82c2-6e6aa66e11aa"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.envpol.2024.124811"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA)","Malmquist Index","EU Member States","farm size","technical efficiency"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

How the size of a farm is related to its efficiency is a constant problem in agricultural economics research. It also has important implications for agricultural development policy. For developed countries, including the countries of the European Union, numerous studies show that, with the increase in the size of farms, their efficiency usually increases. Moreover, there is a constant decrease in the number of farms and the concentration of land and labor. For this reason, the problem of the influence of the economic size of a farm is included in the scope of the research related to the analysis of the relationship between the farm size and its efficiency. The purpose of the paper was to investigate the relative technical efficiency of the agricultural sector in the European Union (EU-27) using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA).It was found that with the increase in economic size, the technical efficiency of the researched farms improved.Attention was paid to the possibility of reducing labor inputs, mainly in farms of economic size classes ES1-ES4. No need to reduce the level of capital expenditure has been demonstrated. This emphasizes the growing importance of the substitution of labor with capital."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944970","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839babdfdbe833174261cf6","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"24","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"128294c1-e65c-4ecf-85ab-ae7bd18d9c25"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"577-586","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://managementjournal.usamv.ro/pdf/vol.24_2/volume_24_2_2024.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709481878c28a0473be997","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Kusz","uuid":"64879C4D1C8E5D8AE2E6AA07045E4F2F36EED1557A73D1002FA35ABFE71E5D32D064A96979764E0689CCE6F81ED3BBBE387DACCA672F715981FE04199813EDAA","orcidId":"0000-0001-7867-162X","documentHash":"94dc14f4-9191-4f45-853d-0bd1ad00a96c"},{"objectId":"5e7091fe878c28a04738e409","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Kusz","uuid":"8EA23A77ADD90A13B0E4B01D2145264BCF850A3F852A072722264772D19C4F7441F3535A3A96F0775E64CDD1CA1D6EA5C379D413C227D17E26E66C390AA0E031","orcidId":"0000-0002-5643-5404","documentHash":"1a5dce9f-b21b-4f73-9bd8-90909a890b7c"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["waste","exhaust","pyrolysis oil","diesel engine combustion","fuel blending"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Prior to conducting engine tests, a in-depth examination of the tested fuels parameters was undertaken. For the tests was used an advanced single-cylinder research engine utilizing split fuel injection technique. Emission analysis was performed using multi-compound FTIR analytical system. The WPO were blended with diesel fuel in proportions of 20%, on the mass basis and tested at middle engine load and variable EGR rates. Tests have shown that modern combustion systems compliant with the Tier 4 standard with multi-pulse injection can handle fuels with a WPO content of 20% without the need for recalibration. The addition of PPO did not significantly affect the emission, while mixing with PSO resulted in elevated levels of hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. Regarding to the mixture with TPO, increased levels of particulate matter, sulfur oxides, aromatic compounds and formic acid were observed."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944972","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bab2fdbe833174261ca1","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"198","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"41e060e4-ad43-4d0f-94b2-c0c734d214a3"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"74-81","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.combustion-engines.eu/Comparative-analysis-of-waste-derived-pyrolytic-fuels-applied-in-a-contemporary-compression,186697,0,2.html","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bab2fdbe833174261ca6","name":"Jacek","lastName":"Hunicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"398c8c93-3f58-41f5-b4be-02c31761e132"},{"objectId":"6839bab2fdbe833174261ca5","name":"Michał","lastName":"Gęca","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f6f6a3f7-d0d1-4e5d-b394-ff0f46eed766"},{"objectId":"6839bab2fdbe833174261ca4","name":"Maciej","lastName":"Mikulski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6bc44f56-5dc3-4cd5-b089-9bf3aee464b9"},{"objectId":"6839bab2fdbe833174261ca3","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Szpica","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"051a67c8-ffa6-4975-91fd-8641f258a82a"},{"objectId":"6839bab2fdbe833174261ca2","name":"Arkadiusz","lastName":"Rybak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"af578ee5-1fa7-4d3d-997b-17141af3bfad"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951f9","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Woś","uuid":"0C936B93580B831338DC610A6F51E8AEECA67D863358D9D61BFF2AA60AEC03973F5A7C55D174A8C9D012D7086B7BE56E2664C7D4F9E3634DB5D24BA2F3ADD6E1","orcidId":"0000-0003-2730-3258","documentHash":"72c6bfaa-b977-4c69-bb88-fc493beb9ba0"}],"doi":"10.19206/ce-186697"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["autopilot statku","odpowiedź skokowa","dobór nastaw regulatorów","regulator PID"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Limonene is oxidized to limonene oxide, carvone, and carveol. Other oxidation products such as perillaldehyde and perillyl alcohol are found in trace amounts. This catalyst is slightly less active than the previously reported [(N4Py)FeII(MeCN)](ClO4)2 (N4Py–N,N-bis(2-pyridylmethyl)-N-(bis-2-pyridylmethyl)amine). Based on cyclic voltammetry experiments, it is postulated that [(Bn-tpen)FeIV=O]2+ is the active species. The induction period of approx. 3 h during cyclohexene oxygenation is probably caused by deactivation of the reactive Fe(IV)=O species by the parent Fe(II) complex.

Nevertheless, the literature lacks appropriate evidence regarding the influences of green energy and other resources on food security. This study analyses the influences of land use, green energy, and water resources on food accessibility in emerging economies, while also considering the important roles of natural resources, research and development (R&D) expenditure, and economic growth during 1980–2020. Due to non-linear data dispersion, the novel moments quantile regression is employed. Results assert that land use has a positive significant influence on food accessibility in the presence of water resources and a weaker negative impact in the presence of natural resources. Natural and water resources are detrimental to food accessibility in the Emerging Seven (E7) countries. Furthermore, R&D expenditure and green energy positively (negatively), while economic growth negatively (positively) impacted food accessibility in the presence of natural resources (water resources). The results are robust and validate causal inferences that help develop appropriate policies for emerging economies concerning food accessibility or security. In this rapidly evolving era, most empirical studies consider environmental quality. Conversely, this study contributes to the literature by examining the factors influencing food accessibility, as this issue is of considerable importance because of the rapidly growing global population."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944979","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bb20fdbe833174262012","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"35","number":"15","doi":null,"documentHash":"eac65c9d-e493-4e38-94de-0d255f042dd2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"4607-4622","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ldr.5244","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bb20fdbe833174262015","name":"Waqas","lastName":"Amin","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d60a383c-9d4a-43c4-87e9-d636ae99a02a"},{"objectId":"6839bb20fdbe833174262014","name":"Laszlo","lastName":"Vasa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a32ce94a-bb13-4557-a89f-5fe0af73eb4d"},{"objectId":"6839bb20fdbe833174262013","name":"Shouhong","lastName":"Xie","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"642737fd-2438-42e0-92ab-78263e795bf0"},{"objectId":"5e7094f9878c28a0473c8280","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Mentel","uuid":"AECBFD7AB04D38F9779795316EEBF481C0DD14159D3E45AD5D9F3350C70E767B5CD64109EFD7E0B179905F984C7DFFF64F161976EA543938F180254B93F419A0","orcidId":"0000-0003-2060-8980","documentHash":"603ccb49-fe71-4461-aff5-86fd3c10efaf"}],"doi":"10.1002/ldr.5244"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["constrained layer damping (CLD)","viscoelastic materials","passive vibration isolation","experimental modal analysis","free layer damping (FLD)"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The main aim of this study was to determine the damping properties of selected viscoelastic materials. In order to check the damping properties of tested materials, an experimental modal analysis, with the use of an electrodynamic vibration system, was performed. In this study, four kinds of specimens were considered. In the first step of the work, the beam made out of aluminum alloy was investigated. Afterwards, a cantilever beam was covered with a layer of bitumen-based material acting as a damper. This method is commonly known as a free layer damping treatment (FLD). In order to increase the damping capabilities, the previous configuration was improved by fixing a thin aluminum layer directly to the viscoelastic core. Such a treatment is called constrained layer damping (CLD). Subsequently, another polymer (butyl rubber) in the CLD configuration was tested for its damping properties. As a result of the performed experimental modal analysis, the frequencies of resonant vibrations and their corresponding amplitudes were obtained. The experimental results were used to quantitatively evaluate the damping properties of tested materials."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944981","journalIssue":{"objectId":"666945b34097074fa1a3b58c","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"12","doi":null,"documentHash":"19bd9e30-c50b-40d8-ad3e-73210c440e98"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-12","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/12/3021","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ebedf25752340254fc42d9e","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Łabuński","uuid":"0C3F7F856C5D41A39ED1A6BD14E4944948E62EE4574F5D9D9D410D39BE112F5506D02BCD6112441638872DC0DD00B063AE2B7A38F7C648F03A7E39CD0E67089A","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a40b3174-f901-46fa-bb8e-917b065637ad"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951e4","name":"Lucjan","lastName":"Witek","uuid":"0EF9E43F7EA9075EBAF7C110734D04444DC3CEEE5863952556B431033785BFB615C425C8C46FCE09AB4FE0F2CE3DBBB7A123D64F393FB75AEE13CD2DB87FFE3B","orcidId":"0000-0003-3292-0242","documentHash":"5115c896-63d0-4a40-a68d-d8994cfc9b04"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17123021"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["chaos theory","bifurcation","generalization","logistic equation","non-extensive thermodynamics"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Flax fabric was selected as the natural fiber. The biocomposite was subjected to strength tests. Stress–strain characteristics and strength indicators were determined. The workability of the laminate produced was also tested using milling technology. The tests were carried out using five carbide shank cutters for different purposes. The cutters with the geometry used in the processing of polymer materials and composites, general purpose cutters, and cutters with the geometry for aluminum and with different numbers of blades were analyzed. In order to obtain information on the workability of the prepared material, machining tests with different configurations of technological parameters were carried out. For each cutter, the effect of cutting speed and feed rate on the quality of the machined surface was tested. Due to the small thickness of the laminate, the machining was carried out in one pass, as a result of which the cutting depth in each case was constant. Changes in cutting speed and feed were evenly distributed over five levels. The quality of machining was assessed in two stages. The first stage included a visual assessment of the machined surface, involving a preliminary qualification of the machining parameters. The criterion was the amount of chips, frays, burrs, etc., remaining after machining that adhered to the surface. The next stage was the measurement of the geometric structure of the surface, during which the roughness parameters were analyzed using an optical microscope with a roughness analysis attachment. Quantitative analysis was performed for the best quality composite surfaces from each measurement series. The studies showed a dependence of the quality of machining on the technological parameters used. High tool speed, regardless of the type, especially at low feed, led to the sticking of chips, which had a very delicate form. In turn, low tool speed and high feed, due to the chip thickness, favored the formation of burrs. Machining with different types of tools showed that the process progresses better for tools with sharp blade geometry. Machining with a regular and polished cutter did not show any differences in the scope of the process progress."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944986","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66e283d1fdbe83163aac01e1","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"18","doi":null,"documentHash":"83d9e150-16d4-4d67-85ec-32f17b18eb0c"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-18","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/18/4528","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d607","name":"Grażyna","lastName":"Ryzińska","uuid":"B3076474CC57B0C77129AAB6C3ACE4D2B8F1323401BC51128FD845B3CE69B0D97FC60B0FCB76564CE6211FD9353BB348614491DBB3190F5E0C107C97F03F8CC0","orcidId":"0000-0003-4145-0799","documentHash":"0c1461a4-43c0-40b2-8320-5fa742173575"},{"objectId":"5e7092c5878c28a04739c5a2","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Janowski","uuid":"C91A5294B62067B92F5597F01629ACBE5DAE79FB0A78F75EF14DAAF61866D8CF9F70E56076BD9F459758BFA7E215CDE9555E6C8506F90BDBFEFBB405C8F566AB","orcidId":"0000-0001-9765-637X","documentHash":"50ba8ef4-394d-4958-8c16-d4ddb222fa8b"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c448","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Bąk","uuid":"EB5F84BFD3D3723D5BF11F34CEA4F64CC6D72908B86519720FB025B682332A9552F8899BCB664DAFF8FE6C71F5331608A9C352084CDB1C9E1D019D1F196BDD60","orcidId":"0000-0001-8164-3160","documentHash":"2f5471e2-3e3b-47e9-9f19-968cbed38120"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395229","name":"Leszek","lastName":"Skoczylas","uuid":"7899F0CFA47B7C32D8C34573B2C8A2E6AC92E8CE4DFDAC371E473839DA0B607E23D10F9C9A5BFB2F932C1609AD78D82D9551AF436848E327C389346E8682B58A","orcidId":"0000-0002-2714-7155","documentHash":"ad1d4ce7-9a0c-493f-9ff6-7b2be8f18152"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a04739521d","name":"Wiesław","lastName":"Frącz","uuid":"A12F4710061BE1A084076A586D6D9F2482CEE0FDB43CB0E118BA549A57C266F7C259F169A8F8E6B82A41DADA81F73D1E6B4F31B783A892E4AFF0492A732281FD","orcidId":"0000-0003-2079-359X","documentHash":"c14600ef-2c7b-4dea-8336-c2e702e0ed90"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17184528"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["synthetic fuel","waste tires","tires waste fuel","diesel engine","waste management","sustainability"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

One way to manage them is through energy recovery by burning them in the furnaces of combined heat and power plants or cement plants, which from an environmental point of view is not a favorable solution. Another way to use waste tires is to produce liquid fuels, which can be used as pure fuels or components added to conventional fuels. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct research aimed at evaluating the physical and chemical properties of tire-derived fuels relative to conventional fuels. It is also important to determine the impact of feeding engines with synthetic fuels, regarding their operational and environmental performance. In this article, the physicochemical properties of typical diesel fuel, synthetic fuel derived from waste tires (WT) and its blends with diesel fuel (DF) in shares of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25% v/v were studied. Tests were also conducted on an internal combustion engine with a common rail injection system (CR IC) engine to determine operational and emission parameters. The results showed, among other things, a deterioration relative to diesel fuel of such parameters as cold filter plugin point (CFPP) and flash point (FP). At the same time, a favorable effect of synthetic fuel addition was noted on hydrocarbon (HC) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944988","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66a8af7cfdbe8345dee52ebc","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"16","number":"15","doi":null,"documentHash":"63e6ed1f-8668-4320-aeda-6b9ba5aa43a1"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/16/15/6404","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d602","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Balawender","uuid":"0C2F2EA4A49ECC8D5994615D3BBCE2AA9E40D3D4C488B43435FF6B1A1E65DA3C1764F28A4B6C8A14A35D296565ED04106A0DF97DCD7CEA520879D4B7F645BA1D","orcidId":"0000-0002-1219-8611","documentHash":"968fb669-fca8-48fa-88dc-63aa373374e4"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d570","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Jakubowski","uuid":"622C76B05E14CF9B0D7EAAF1C48B65C1852A0B5117800502FDFA66FCE8B3A19E0FEA9BC871F5970F7333506D77144FC1E78594FBF217D9E094148C4F341E338D","orcidId":"0000-0001-9619-8215","documentHash":"030d370d-8bf7-436b-88f7-b5632ea08bae"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951f5","name":"Hubert","lastName":"Kuszewski","uuid":"A3CFA9B27EEBF2E25AF3C583B815D3352C5BEBBE7F8605A83C8CCDD8A383555D4F2B8B775117DA7EC6776C487076B8F8DA0876884B1FE746F12FFC857E7F2FC3","orcidId":"0000-0002-2294-6249","documentHash":"32e187ed-7a14-4078-a1e1-f06a9aa0e3e3"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951f4","name":"Artur","lastName":"Jaworski","uuid":"B5F54FAEC8ECB017F321D7A14523413B4F3CBD823FE98272A7CF3933D76D98E2586886EA9C074169E3973945B90EAF44BEE89FE46161474CA8E52FE4FCADBD33","orcidId":"0000-0002-1599-1711","documentHash":"4a6b8539-e59a-43ef-b5cc-53a7b75bf0b2"}],"doi":"10.3390/su16156404"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["micro","acoustics","Turbine","noise","health","hearing","jet engine","compressor"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The research was divided into three parts: identify noise at various rotational speeds, identify an acoustic field of the engine, and identify noise level at additional points. Obtained results identify that noise from such a small engine at the range of 67 to 109 dbC is harmful and unpleasant to people who are within a radius of 15 meters from the engine.

A particular situation arises when a defect or symptoms of a disease appear on the skin, which, in the case of people suffering from psoriasis, are a source of stress, dissatisfaction with the disease, and a reduction in quality of life. The aim of this study was to assess whether the quality of life related to the occurrence of psoriasis and the level of acceptance of the disease affect coping strategies in stressful situations. Methods: The study involved 111 people with common psoriasis (46.8% women and 53.2% men). Inclusion criteria were as follows: a diagnosis of common psoriasis for at least 0.5 years, no other types of psoriasis, no mental illnesses, and an informed consent of the respondent to participate in the study. In order to compile the research input, a proprietary questionnaire was used along with the following standardised tools: the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), the Acceptance of Illness Scale (AIS), and the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS). Results: The duration of the disease in the studied population varied and ranged from 0.5 years to over 50 years. Most respondents showed relatively low DLQI scores, with an average value of 10.8 points. In stressful situations (CISS), the respondents primarily used a strategy based on rational thinking (Task-oriented coping), with approximately 54 points on average; followed by an avoidant style (Avoidance-oriented coping), with approximately 50 points on average; and least often an emotional style (Emotion-oriented coping), with approximately 46 points on average. The average level of disease acceptance (AIS) in the studied group equalled approximately 26 points. Conclusions: Psoriatic lesions on the torso caused less rational behaviour in stressful situations (a decrease in the Task-oriented coping) in women but had the opposite result in men, whereas psoriatic lesions on the head stimulated the use of Task-oriented coping in women but had the opposite result in men.

Based on the obtained results, it is possible to select appropriate cutting conditions and equipment that allow for vibration reduction. This is an important issue because it improves the stability of machining processes, which may also result in an improvement in the quality of the manufactured parts. Vibrations mitigation also increases machining safety. The conducted research confirmed that the milling process of the AZ91D magnesium alloy can be carried out with relatively high stability over a wide range of cutting parameters. Trochoidal milling is one of the solutions for increasing the efficiency of machining processes. A decreased cutting tool’s arc of contact leads to a reduction in the generated cutting forces, thus improving process stability. Vibration is an inherent part of any machining process, affecting the accuracy and quality of the manufactured components, but it can also pose a danger to machine operators. Chatter is particularly detrimental, leaving characteristic marks on shaped surfaces and potentially leading to catastrophic tool damage. Therefore, it is important to ensure the stability of machining and also reduce vibration. The primary purpose of the conducted research is to evaluate the stability of the milling process of the AZ91D magnesium alloy performed through a trochoidal strategy. An additional objective is to establish the effect of the variation in machining parameters and toolholder types on milling stability. Three types of toolholders most commonly used in industry are used in the study. The basis of the investigation is the measurement of vibration displacement and acceleration analysed in the time domain. A spectral analysis of the signals is also performed based on Fast Fourier Transform, to identify signal components and detect the susceptibility to chatter occurrence. An important part of the study is also an attempt to use the Composite Multiscale Entropy as an indicator to determine the stability of the machining processes. Entropy does not exceed the values of 1.5 for cutting speed and 2.5 for feed per tooth, respectively. Vibration acceleration does not exceed (in most cases) the value of 20 m/s2 for the peak-to-peak parameter and the shrinkfit toolholder. For vibration displacement (peak-to-peak parameter), there are oscillations around the value of 0.9 mm for all kinds of toolholders."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646944997","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6638755c4097076e57a4c467","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"9","doi":"","documentHash":"cdc188b3-b239-4e7c-be61-2244c7a971dd"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/9/3616","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bba5fdbe8331742623d2","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Weremczuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dc4375b2-dc65-460f-accc-d19193bd45c7"},{"objectId":"6839bba5fdbe8331742623d1","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Korpysa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fc3e114a-7b79-4c65-bd6d-e0d1fffee42a"},{"objectId":"6839bba5fdbe8331742623d0","name":"Ireneusz","lastName":"Zagórski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b4603b80-cc07-4dcb-8d33-161cd032a61a"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395218","name":"Witold","lastName":"Habrat","uuid":"6660E4057D716A6050E2A6B3C181E85240000839CE4B0840F631E6A96AB8CBD99B7080C3ABF6858875D2BB9455CA9D89E6A6C0C0FBB86A4AF5F2485F136F0216","orcidId":"0000-0002-9010-8175","documentHash":"ba4623b9-6e2d-4fb8-b4d4-ba52acce3f31"}],"doi":"10.3390/app14093616"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["HTLA process","lifetime","Above-the-pack process","HTHA process"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Additionally, commercial aluminide coatings deposited in the above-the-pack aluminiznig process were analyzed. The aluminizing of the Mar-M247 superalloy by the HTHA, HTLA and above-the-pack processes led to formation of two layers of the coatings. The outer layer of the coatings formed by the above-the-pack process consisted of the β-NiAl phase with precipitates, while the outer layer of coatings formed by the HTHA and HTLA processes consisted of the pure β-NiAl phase. Aluminizing successfully improved the lifetime of Mar-M247 superalloy. Despite the fact that the coatings formed by the above-the-pack process are thicker and have a higher aluminium concentration than the coatings formed by the HTLA aluminizing and process, the lifetime of the coated superalloy was lower. Moreover the oxidation resistance of the coated superalloy in the HTLA aluminizing process was better than that of the coating in the HTHA aluminizing process.

Aqualock AL 6002 (Adhesive_1) and 3M Adhesion Promoter 86A (Adhesive_2) were selected as polymeric sealants for EN AW-2024-T3 aluminum alloy interfaces. Force analysis revealed that the choice of polymer interlayer significantly affects the axial force during welding, with Adhesive_1 joints showing a significant reduction in force compared to other variants. The axial force during FSW in Adhesive_1 was 18% less than in Adhesive_2. Cross-sectional analysis revealed distinct features in joint morphology and defects, with Adhesive_1 joints exhibiting favorable thermal stability and minimal defects compared to Adhesive_2 joints. Tensile strength analysis showed a significant increase in load capacity for the Adhesive_1 (9470N) joint, while the Adhesive_2 (5030N) joint exhibited reduced strength due to inadequate heat flow. The Adhesive_1 joint showed a 93% increase in tensile strength compared to Adhesive_2. The mixing of Adhesive_2 with the joint area produced hard complex particles that reduced the strength of the final joint. Fracture analysis revealed complex fracture mechanisms, with Adhesive_1 joints exhibiting ductile fracture zones and Adhesive_2 joints exhibiting quasi-cleavable intergranular cracking. Microhardness distribution analysis showed variation between the joint variants, with Adhesive_2 joints showing higher microhardness in the weld nugget."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945000","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66d972b1fdbe832d5eb69c3b","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"24","number":"4","doi":null,"documentHash":"ef64cc48-a5c7-4ab3-aedf-62bd73d084b7"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-25","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43452-024-01047-9","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bc30fdbe833174262820","name":"Hamed Aghajani","lastName":"Derazkola","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0d3df686-fea5-4428-90db-277cd5d6b86f"},{"objectId":"6839bc30fdbe83317426281f","name":"Paulina","lastName":"Szawara","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3b8675ad-2a4d-408b-9c3d-92c94706ef88"},{"objectId":"6839bc30fdbe83317426281e","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Macek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bf4517f2-85b1-4cc1-8407-822f71cf10c5"},{"objectId":"6839bc30fdbe83317426281d","name":"Ján","lastName":"Slota","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3d6e43da-2065-4d20-84d4-307b6dee71e5"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b0875","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kubit","uuid":"29B02092717238079C51B6A8162C98BB2B91565F926E0BDCD35A57FAE85A972865A9738DC92B81410E29455B3963394D73D5D13EC5422B63CE951F0FCC7B28CE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6179-5359","documentHash":"b521f1c8-5211-40ee-9442-8c524f0bcc3d"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c47c","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Myśliwiec","uuid":"1D5F1F4AD9F3B82035E86039831333B2E929DAB5E17418D4CAC7BF55A4FDB2A1A3A459AC410ADC770363EB46CF05E8DC207EC7851EC078F6093E79A3E68FECBE","orcidId":"0000-0002-9073-2082","documentHash":"37b3aa31-eb8d-46fb-863b-f5fae282ebba"}],"doi":"10.1007/s43452-024-01047-9"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["robotyka","cyfrowy bliźniak","przemysł 4.0","wirtualna rzeczywistość"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Równocześnie wzrasta zainteresowanie łączeniem urządzeń z innymi na pozór odmiennymi technologiami. Przykładem tworzenia takiej koegzystencji jest integracja rozwiązań przemysłowych z wirtualną rzeczywistością. Działania takie przyczyniają się do tworzenia cyfrowych bliźniaków urządzeń i procesów, co z kolei umożliwia zdalne, a w wielu przypadkach również automatyczne sterowanie fizycznymi obiektami oraz przebiegiem rzeczywistych procesów.

This is caused by the use of large amounts of energy by these machines, including the amount of process heat, which generates negative environmental changes. As part of sustainable development, it is necessary to look for more friendly solutions, e.g., life cycle assessment (LCA). Therefore, the objective was to analyse the main environmental loads that arise during the extraction and processing of the component materials used in mining machines. In this case, the subject of the research was a reduction gear with a high utilisation rate in excavators and forklifts used in mining. The environmental impact criteria taken into account in the analysis were ozone depletion, human toxicity, and eutrophication. The analysis was carried out using the OpenLCA programme with the ecoinvent database. The results of the analysis showed that in the extraction and processing phase of the reduction gear materials, the main environmental loads arise for selected criteria arise, among others: during coke production, oil and gas extraction, natural gas transport, and hard coal exploitation. The results of the analysis may contribute to the sustainable development of machines in the mining industry and may be useful in the production of new mining machines in order to eliminate their negative impact throughout their life cycle."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945007","journalIssue":{"objectId":"676e9110fdbe831a384202ce","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"29","number":"1","doi":null,"documentHash":"30b4ccec-ea8c-468b-a881-343575f09716"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"138-144","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://actamont.tuke.sk/pdf/2024/n1/12siwiec.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bb3afdbe8331742620b1","name":"Martin","lastName":"Mikeska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"de47411a-447f-49da-b5fb-eaa95828c62f"},{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c52","name":"Dominika","lastName":"Siwiec","uuid":"0D25573CF2F6189D6F2E868D46D1426725A137590D7F6EF0F5389766898882ED218F890F47C98AC469E938565A92A4B7C2056615A8944A96F515AAA25FEE2128","orcidId":"0000-0002-6663-6621","documentHash":"6d5070e6-7a6e-444d-bae6-f7a4f58e8a5a"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395225","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pacana","uuid":"35D510AA8256DE5E4DEFDF38BF16202BA667F52A940F41C64492BE30097E6AB925BC3352AC6B374350D9E16190A5FD0052B2F59362CFC99AC0345A7CA51144BF","orcidId":"0000-0003-1121-6352","documentHash":"bc6c1d9b-8450-4a34-8498-0e87c14cd6d6"}],"doi":"10.46544/ams.v29i1.12"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["environmental monitoring","micropollutants","cadmium","lignite","raw materials","arsenic"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

DC01 steel sheets exhibit high formability, and they are widely used in sheet metal forming operations. The tribological properties of the tool surface, especially the coating used, determine the friction conditions in sheet metal forming. In order to carry out the research, this study developed and manufactured a special bending-under-tension (BUT) friction tribometer that models the friction phenomenon on the rounded edges of tools in the deep-drawing process. The rationale for building the tribotester was that there are no commercial tribotesters available that can be used to model the phenomenon of friction on the rounded edges of tools in sheet forming processes. The influence of the type of coating and sheet deformation on the coefficient of friction (CoF) and the change in the topography of the sheet surface were analysed. Countersamples with surfaces prepared using titanium + nitrogen ion implantation, nitrogen ion implantation and electron beam remelting were tested. The tests were carried out in conditions of dry friction and lubrication with oils with different kinematic viscosities. Under dry friction conditions, a clear increase in the CoF value, with the elongation of the samples for all analysed types of countersamples, was observed. Under lubricated conditions, the uncoated countersample showed the most favourable friction conditions. Furthermore, oil with a lower viscosity provided more favourable conditions for reducing the coefficient of friction. Within the entire range of sample elongation, the most favourable conditions for reducing the CoF were provided by uncoated samples and lubrication with S100+ oil. During the friction process, the average roughness decreased as a result of flattening the phenomenon. Under dry friction conditions, the value of the Sa parameter during the BUT test decreased by 20.3–30.2%, depending on the type of countersample. As a result of the friction process, the kurtosis and skewness increased and decreased, respectively, compared to as-received sheet metal."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945013","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66a33f9dfdbe836c5d88a443","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"15","doi":null,"documentHash":"c7715c0d-8c93-4d5a-a060-d5681e89b317"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/15/3631","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bb2afdbe833174262058","name":"Marek","lastName":"Barlak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"85164c06-7966-4616-8a98-8aa4e6ce9318"},{"objectId":"5f8517f3085dcb410a25ed0c","name":"Marek","lastName":"Szewczyk","uuid":"061018F0B6B70D10386DF789993A8C9F85F31E1C6DC911651D81FEF167F6616F8FA2ECCB0824CA95C978F00D21407A46356B8C5EB18866928F35BC94F08681D3","orcidId":"0000-0002-3622-6613","documentHash":"aee1f202-2b71-49b9-ae8d-4b0b145c1e63"},{"objectId":"5e709411878c28a0473b5bbb","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Zielińska-Szwajka","uuid":"49AD64364D21A828314C0596FD75085DA570E9446C8DB6631BBC544A1FCA28170DE898DB3DAEF447357C9276D0DC7A91DE17660699291FC8E8ED11D39DEBF0D8","orcidId":"0000-0002-6212-2666","documentHash":"9b674641-c845-42e0-9500-b0b5233cddde"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d60b","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Trzepieciński","uuid":"B1173B4E25A04EF20A9FC72135EA66107445195FB931A6F929E34828CBA837AE85B5284995C35F3192186D9A1A95198DD9965EC89FB78C1E42ABBEFD475C5341","orcidId":"0000-0002-4366-0135","documentHash":"819127f8-0b2e-43f0-ae91-077e24078b38"},{"objectId":"5e70923d878c28a0473923d1","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Szwajka","uuid":"BE3DBEF640820E864475437AEC4DB8978AE4FC0B4B3B99093CD4857E27DEEA7E923758AFBB9E791E11BF13C3EA626287D3C4FCE7C77FBDA928B5DCDAAE66EFFE","orcidId":"0000-0002-1038-1148","documentHash":"60c70249-8eb8-40a1-ae88-4991b4235bad"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17153631"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["heavy metals","Chlorella vulgaris","isotherms","kinetics","binary ion adsorption","biosorption"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

This study examined the effectiveness of removing heavy metals (Cu(II) and Co(II)) using Chlorella vulgaris biosorbents (dietary supplements in the form of powder). This study determined the parameters of the biosorbent (point of zero charge (PZC) analysis using scanning electron microscopy with back-scattered electron (SEM-BSE) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis). Batch tests were also performed to determine the kinetic constants and adsorption equilibrium of Cu(II) and Co(II) ions. Based on the conducted research, it was found that a pseudo-second-order equation describes the kinetics of the biosorption process. Among the studied adsorption isotherms, the Langmuir and Freundlich models fit best. The results indicate that single-layer adsorption took place and Chlorella vulgaris is a microporous adsorbent. The maximum sorption capacity in the single-component system for Cu(II) and Co(II) was 30.3 mg·g−1 and 9.0 mg·g−1, respectively. In contrast, in the binary system, it was 20.8 mg·g−1 and 19.6 mg·g−1 (extended Langmuir model) and 23.5 mg·g−1 and 19.6 mg·g−1 (Jain-Snoeyinka model). Chlorella vulgaris is an effective biosorbent for removing heavy metals from freshwater. This technology offers an ecological and economical solution for improving water quality, making it a promising alternative to traditional purification methods."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945015","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66d54c0afdbe8351d921eaf7","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"16","number":"17","doi":null,"documentHash":"ffad2411-e69a-4ae1-be05-ff7fd51bd2c1"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-15","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/16/17/2388","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a1878c28a0473c0b77","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Pająk","uuid":"B32A3C2BC41E16DF4AC4E3736416080A4235E29EF1137BE078D4071AC5D66FCEEFF9C59CB4FD539D7B8F0E879193B30649A069A7825A138D35FE9513C9D7FD66","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c7cbd972-df95-4907-be07-0d40ff0be2a8"},{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5be","name":"Eleonora","lastName":"Sočo","uuid":"0D03D989C7D4F5621EFD09867BBA2034C8BD3E0F6E73339BFABA2A7E0D2FB2EC9143AC67251B88BA535B42A257FD2F4A1CA9652F430F56BAC488F5DE2ED5995F","orcidId":"0000-0003-0658-5049","documentHash":"b6f409df-38fb-4c74-957b-53e8f7d3be8f"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b6c4","name":"Andżelika","lastName":"Domoń","uuid":"1BD2CDA92AE4593863FD3FD5676B94BFC04AAE95DA16C7737233AF3B9B613CF3DDBFF3AF3078797FE47DF6F90DA1F46214653219A3ED8319F91346FEC7BD84C9","orcidId":"0000-0003-2633-9419","documentHash":"f952a053-a74e-417e-8ef0-21857fc4bcfe"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a047395178","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Papciak","uuid":"424CC240B9598145C59FA010063BE7B67946AB41C68AD0570BBC027FDD8577A2DE23BC9CCB989D2C40F1466393E957FF9FBCF585B46F9509E4779639F79CC73E","orcidId":"0000-0002-5744-5292","documentHash":"dea8c024-6966-4687-9bf2-cf93702c3ecb"}],"doi":"10.3390/w16172388"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["keratinocyte HaCaT toxicity","fibroblast BJ toxicity","C. elegans","genistein","PAMAM dendrimer"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Poorly soluble isoflavonoid genistein is known as an anti-nematode agent and also it decreases the risk of certain types of cancer. The biological activity of genistein is limited mostly by its low solubility. Therefore many attempts to increase genistein solubility in water were reported. We applied a polyamidoamine dendrimer, modified its surface by glycidylation, and used this macromolecule as a guest for genistein. Material and methods. Polyamidoamine dendrimer 3rd generation was substituted with 64 glycidol residues to obtain a macromolecule host for genistein. The stoichiometry of this host-guest complex was determined. The complex was tested for skin model permeability, toxicity on fibroblast (BJ) and keratinocyte (HaCaT) cell lines in vitro and anthelmintic activity on the Caenorhabditis elegans nematode. Results. The partition coefficient of genistein between octanol and water was determined (KO/W). The 1:1 host-guest complex was isolated and used as drug delivery system for genistein delivery. PAMAM G3 glycidyled dendrimer containing genistein indicated an anthelmintic activity at 50 µM concentration. Conclusion. The solubility of genistein in water increases 640 times in presence of an equimolar concentration of the dendrimer. One molecule of host dendrimer encapsulates 3 molecules of genistein. The encapsulate is an efficient anti-nematode formulation."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945016","journalIssue":{"objectId":"672b5bd7fdbe83748a7c18c8","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"22","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"b272db59-9f4d-40b3-9a3d-91fa783f5e28"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"292-299","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.ejcem.ur.edu.pl/summary/encapsulation-genistein-glycidylated-g3-polyamidoamine-dendrimers-enables-diffusion","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839ba7ffdbe833174261afd","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Wołowiec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a0728aca-9420-47c9-9a0f-3ee5761997b6"},{"objectId":"6839ba7ffdbe833174261afc","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Zagórska-Dziok","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fc44ffcd-36b8-4979-8455-cd016cf0e89f"},{"objectId":"6839ba7ffdbe833174261afb","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Filipowicz-Rachwał","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"caf80d56-310b-4c3a-a9ed-b80809dd4fef"},{"objectId":"602e20459543c7410626ece4","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Drozdowska","uuid":"0607BBCF08247B7D132B52C16DA046C2539A505CBD2E15469FFD82B486BAC79FB00F152174EC6A93CF703DACC6AE206F53A3CBFCCCF65D2F17CA6160EE65C849","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0ab3fd27-9b15-4ef1-a905-69176e6ade75"},{"objectId":"5e7093af878c28a0473af0d5","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Uram","uuid":"31207AD2C39DC11BA1038A79B03E97D88B8EA9A1E1ADE06B7443EB7AE09F45AA9D004791AD6C0DAC97823654BF9D16A00E8BAFECCA38D4D37CE8A21E5893034C","orcidId":"0000-0002-7964-0777","documentHash":"f5590610-1ff2-4a45-9407-bcc9a92ad585"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Temperature-dependent macromolecules","Atom transfer radical polymerization","β-cyclodextrin"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

For the first time, the use of β-cyclodextrin as a naturally-derived core for thermoresponsive polymeric drug delivery systems was thoroughly investigated depending on the chosen ATRP concept, focusing on precise control of the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) modulating the monomer content. The thermoresponsive properties of the received copolymers were investigated by UV–Vis and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurement to determine the transmittance of solutions containing polymers with different monomer compositions and hydrodynamic diameter of prepared macromolecules upon temperature changes. The developed method allows for fine-tuning of the LCST by adjusting only the composition of the monomers. Synthesized copolymers were subsequently tested for residual copper catalyst content using atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) to ensure compliance with the daily intake framework. The attained results showed negligible copper concentration in the purified products. Encouraged by these findings, cytotoxicity tests were conducted on normal fibroblast, cancer liver, and cancer breast cells, revealing no significant reduction in cell viability even at high polymer concentrations."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945018","journalIssue":{"objectId":"67078f37fdbe831eab1113a7","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"312","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"5be4254c-76dd-4e7c-9223-243781379ced"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-11","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0032386124009819#appsec1","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bc4afdbe8331742628db","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Bałbustyn","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"3cfed114-f016-4290-a394-72ada9e84e69"},{"objectId":"6839bc4afdbe8331742628da","name":"Martyna","lastName":"Niemiec","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"061abc60-be24-4efc-9637-5d3a94bd2854"},{"objectId":"6839bc4afdbe8331742628d9","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Klamut","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9c8026fb-d865-428d-b07b-c8c169c40394"},{"objectId":"602df00c9543c7410626e88e","name":"Izabela","lastName":"Zaborniak","uuid":"0CEC114C8395587A09A27C3EC7F2872B4A597BC58D9323C84E2036ECDD4B140860AA5809C407EA2AC6B58D8909715AB3147437DA22AE5FAF75C2DB8096D5392B","orcidId":"0000-0001-7533-3668","documentHash":"6f6899c6-b435-425b-98a6-0d948c205220"},{"objectId":"5e70941b878c28a0473b654a","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Chmielarz","uuid":"6A3E7B547B6E79C49B5BC8C0B3CBEDE6F7CB6809ACB2F42C4006D62F70B2CD0683DA760527EA0EEE6F2D9C4086F525889DACC4CF86132F3B2557EBC0E485545F","orcidId":"0000-0002-9101-6264","documentHash":"db4553da-d2f7-4416-b876-2d53f3ec7758"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b0860","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Błoniarz","uuid":"27F7144A9B20E8D0F0C5640D0C280A35AB0371487FE34DE3665F586623650D80E886D81F739FA4D6256FDF0453018A4B1AA7692B368EEC0AA5C9096284D957DB","orcidId":"0000-0001-9462-9640","documentHash":"f6054ab6-fc40-4c6c-9476-31cc2cae7269"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d550","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ciszkowicz","uuid":"FD7F95D0B25E5722B9148A2C51DCC7A33070E3DDDEF2CAA372357EAE2D4C9F3F3A6A9A18A7DECF340D736673A5D97F5F394DF30582315C6193E79B15D4A3848B","orcidId":"0000-0003-3401-2264","documentHash":"663d8b75-cb3d-4f9d-879a-ebbb80fcae0d"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.polymer.2024.127645"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Precipitation","Purification","Monoclonal antibodies","Solid-liquid extraction"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The mAb was separated from low molecular mass impurities (LMWI) and high molecular weight impurities (HMWI) by a sequence of two precipitation steps or by a sequence of precipitation and solid-liquid extraction (SLE). In the former approach, HMWI were precipitated from the harvest at pH 5 in the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG), whereas the obtained supernatant was subsequently subjected to precipitation at pH 8 to obtain the mAb of 96 % chromatographic purity in a precipitate form. In the latter approach, the mAb was precipitated from the harvest at pH 8 in the presence of PEG to isolate the mAb from LMWI, then the precipitate obtained was subjected to SLE to extract the mAb of 99 % purity in a form of liquid solution. The coupling of precipitation at pH 8 and SLE allowed effective removal of DNA from 9260 ng/mL in the feed to 1.4 ng/mL in the product of two-stage SLE, and host cell proteins (HCP) from 300 µg/mL to 0.07 µg/mL, which was not possible by the coupling of two precipitation stages at pH 5 and 8.

Electricity distribution companies operating under free-market conditions are increasingly facing the problem of increasing the transmission capacity of their networks. This is related to the increasing demand for electricity from consumers, as well as the emergence of new sources of electricity, mainly renewable sources of electricity. This increase in electricity demand necessitates the need to upgrade existing and build new electricity networks. An alternative solution is the use of dynamic load systems in existing networks. The permissible current in these solutions is adapted to the prevailing external conditions. Determining the ampacity of a electric cable requires complex calculations using mathematical models. The multiple regression model presented in the article for the analysis of ampacity of a 110 kV overhead transmission line was also used to predict the line load current for selected values of air temperature and wind speed."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945024","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bb84fdbe8331742622c5","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"236","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"a5ac6b52-729d-4a66-a1ee-c8eef9d32e30"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-8","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378779624008253","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951c1","name":"Wiesława","lastName":"Malska","uuid":"CF1C62C4A1A616E76491163CE28AA3CEDCC321F97BBB5DFE0D8D58FE1E5148840BC3650ED7A0E625CE63232BAAB51FA58A429EEFBC572020F059275F37766262","orcidId":"0000-0001-5878-4475","documentHash":"f79c8f5d-5aa9-4b90-be3e-7ebeb052a081"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.epsr.2024.110939"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["photopolymer resins","additive manufacturing","optical measurement","micro-geometry","macro-geometry","accuracy"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Unfortunately, the lack of development of metrology guidelines for these methods, related to dimensional and geometry accuracy and surface roughness, significantly limits the commercialization of finished products manufactured using these methods. This paper aims to evaluate the macro- and micro-geometry of models manufactured using the PolyJet method from three types of photopolymer resins: Digital ABS Plus, RGD 720, and Vero Clear. For this purpose, test parts were designed and then manufactured on an Object 350 Connex3 3D printer. The Atos II Triple Scan optical system and the InfiniteFocusG4 microscope were used to evaluate macro- and micro-geometry, respectively. For both systems, measurement procedures were developed to obtain statistical results for evaluating geometric accuracy and surface roughness parameters. In the case of macro-geometry, for Digital ABS Plus and Vero Clear materials, 50% of the central deviations (between first quartile Q1 and third quartile Q3) lie within the range (−0.06, 0.03 mm) and for RGD 720 material within the range (−0.08, 0.01 mm). For micro-geometry, the arithmetic mean height (Sa) values for the Digital ABS Plus and Vero Clear samples were approximately 1.6 and 2.0 µm, respectively, while for RGD 720, it was 15.9 µm. The total roughness height expressed by reduced peak height (Spk) + core height (Sk) + reduced dale depth (Svk) for the Digital ABS Plus and Vero Clear samples was approximately 9.1 and 10.5 µm, respectively, while for the RGD 720, it was 101.9 µm."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945025","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66cd726efdbe832737eb494a","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"17","doi":null,"documentHash":"520b49a2-e905-4a7f-b3e2-8eac8bf38de2"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-16","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/17/17/4315","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b089a","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Turek","uuid":"184E127E4FB99D54AA64869AC593073FCF0CDC80CBDA06041D5261F813F2E7957340952D9226A38CC18CC1899D01D28C58F7ADF099EB94C708E805CD6D92EB97","orcidId":"0000-0002-5926-4815","documentHash":"4947f918-0aaa-4212-a107-b57f9be44a9f"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d590","name":"Anna","lastName":"Bazan","uuid":"967FA371E29ED24ABF925F07CF6105EBD710EFFB90D7C575C0B3F590212E5F0CCB7B0DF7314061152A17200174064F63FFA47AA54CA7A33B2DCED033D81E5ABB","orcidId":"0000-0002-0642-3958","documentHash":"2774275d-15c9-4ad4-9054-26be33ad88fb"},{"objectId":"5e7092d0878c28a04739d583","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Dziubek","uuid":"9EE65B96DD5A4CE806A5E02CFC833F99B4F46D85FB2276DC055BAA7D072726694D5DF00D8CB754CE17B9BF3DE6DFB9FD38733F476453613D23CC90CDB29BA67A","orcidId":"0000-0002-3259-446X","documentHash":"436651ec-5a02-4cf7-a1b9-11be7002310e"},{"objectId":"5e7092c4878c28a04739c42f","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Przeszłowski","uuid":"AD5B037B0C1E89F2F72DE0742DE9DAB4BD07008E377A6405E0BA9DAD301EAA43D78D802CB03E686B07BB690CE8BD4F1D87549E9070E3EB49BDAB6807B65193A9","orcidId":"0000-0002-1212-9069","documentHash":"36c4d08a-2442-49e6-b4d4-a6ca21a703bb"},{"objectId":"5e709268878c28a047395207","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Budzik","uuid":"FFAACEF281085020398E4E1801C3867CBABF71F7832126DBB6AE9DA2045443729E5927B3BF31EE87A652AB7BCA696A655559B046B72FF1A100160DD4C9BA1FD7","orcidId":"0000-0003-3598-2860","documentHash":"9f7f0516-7a6d-4a6c-b589-b2d5bd925e62"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma17174315"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["LDI-MS","low molecular weight compounds","SALDI","Gold nanoparticles","LDI-MSI"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Surface-assisted laser desorption/ionization (SALDI) methodologies, utilizing nanomaterials, have shown promise in overcoming these limitations. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are among the most widely utilized nanomaterials in SALDI-MS applications. AuNPs offer several advantages over traditional MALDI matrices, such as reduced interference, internal calibration potential, and enhanced stability. They have been successfully employed for analyzing a diverse range of analytes, from low molecular weight (LMW) compounds to peptides, proteins, and biological entities. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of various synthesis methods, morphological properties, and comparisons with conventional MALDI matrices.

In this scheme, it is proposed to use the proposed AFNN six-layer hybrid neuro-fuzzy network (NFN) with Sugeno fuzzy inference and a Gaussian membership function for fuzzy variables, which makes it possible to reduce the HTE fuel consumption parameter transient process regulation time by 15.0 times compared with the use of a traditional system automatic control (clear control), 17.5 times compared with the use of a fuzzy ACS (fuzzy control), and 11.25 times compared with the use of a neuro-fuzzy reconfigured ACS based on an ANFIS five-layer hybrid NFN. By applying the Lyapunov method as a criterion, its system stability is proven at any time, with the exception of the initial time, since at the initial time the system is in an equilibrium state. The use of the six-layer ANFF NFN made it possible to reduce the I and II types of error in the HTE fuel consumption controlling task by 1.36…2.06 times compared with the five-layer ANFIS NFN. This work also proposes an AFNN six-layer hybrid NFN training algorithm, which, due to adaptive elements, allows one to change its parameters and settings in real time based on changing conditions or external influences and, as a result, achieve an accuracy of up to 99.98% in the HTE fuel consumption controlling task and reduce losses to 0.2%."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945029","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66b46819fdbe83188052de2b","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"17","number":"16","doi":null,"documentHash":"3a57ee6a-61cd-4a8b-8158-f343ff3be263"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-41","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/16/4195","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bbf2fdbe833174262600","name":"Serhii","lastName":"Vladov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b0bbc879-521f-43f3-83cb-83903c0f5c01"},{"objectId":"6839bbf2fdbe8331742625ff","name":"Ruslan","lastName":"Yakovliev","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fed540e0-b2b4-4509-b265-d745f974628f"},{"objectId":"6839bbf2fdbe8331742625fe","name":"Victoria","lastName":"Vysotska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"21e7dbc9-e301-4259-bec3-dc297c2d7408"},{"objectId":"618b3cb97523400e636ef11d","name":"Maryna","lastName":"Bulakh","uuid":"3B867DE27B63FFC7D27BEA718A673CE67F49423294BD6C0CBDC747AF650E6FEA1DDDDAB9F26F3C528154C064F0985C04A61E5995EC0A83F00ACBB9DF1C846087","orcidId":"0000-0003-4264-2303","documentHash":"7c7031d8-3918-434d-b326-51d823d945f1"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17164195"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Global mining industry","TVP-VAR approach","Multiscale multi-fractal analysis","MENA region","Sustainability investments"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The study conducts a comprehensive analysis of the global mining industry at five distinct levels: mining, mining capweighted, mining coal exclusion, global gold mining tracker, and global electrification minerals mining. The objective is to comprehend the multi-fractal patterns and implications of their interconnectedness with sustainability and conventional investments. By employing a time-varying parameter vector autoregressive (TVPVAR) approach to identify the degree of nexus between each pair consisting of a mining index and sustainability or conventional investments, and utilizing the generalized Hurst exponent of a multiscale multi-fractal analysis (MMA) from September 18, 2017, to July 3, 2023, the study reveals that none of the bi-variate interconnectedness adheres to a random walk process, thereby confirming their inefficient behavior. The level of efficiency among pairs varies, demonstrating heterogeneity across the connections. The analysis indicates a relatively lower level of inefficiency in pairs of pairwise connectedness indices (PCIs) related to sustainable investments compared to conventional investments. Generally, conventional investments exhibit more distinct trends or predictability over various time scales, suggesting a less complex and unpredictable pattern compared to sustainable investments. Additionally, the persistence level in PCIs linked to conventional sustainable investments is higher than that of sustainable investments, implying that conventional investments have more predictable associations with mining consortiums. These findings provide valuable insights into the dynamic relationships between global mining entities and sustainability initiatives in the MENA region, with implications for investors, policymakers, and industry stakeholders. The clarity observed in connectivity patterns with conventional investments presents strategic opportunities for investors, potentially influencing regulatory adjustments for sustainable resource governance. The identified inefficiencies create opportunities for refining risk management tools and optimizing investment strategies. Furthermore, the study highlights the stability of connections between conventional sustainable investments and mining consortiums over time, providing guidance for longterm planning and risk mitigation."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945031","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bb96fdbe83317426234d","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"97","number":null,"doi":null,"documentHash":"4c9280a5-e074-40c5-89b8-e22a8018c085"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301420724006238","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bb96fdbe833174262350","name":"Hamed Tajmir","lastName":"Riahi","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8ba251ee-218a-4251-bb71-75389fa004da"},{"objectId":"6839bb96fdbe83317426234f","name":"Laszlo","lastName":"Vasa","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1010ef1e-9c1e-4561-bb68-0902c2f763fa"},{"objectId":"6839bb96fdbe83317426234e","name":"Parisa","lastName":"Iranpour","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6274c825-2e9e-48a2-9295-acdeebfd8b2f"},{"objectId":"5e7094c5878c28a0473c3744","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Nakonieczny","uuid":"5FB0BD90E409DB46BDDD803FD8E6B9DAA5349C8354EBD79EEBC27C267CE3C5BEB5FDD496E9ED151E9CCEF27752BBCF6D4D9E5017C10C2D4DA42AEEA3533CAB8C","orcidId":"0000-0002-5069-2514","documentHash":"e5de7e6c-2646-4597-94e8-454c407b05ea"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.resourpol.2024.105256"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["zarządzanie rozwojem","transformacja cyfrowa","klaster","dojrzałość cyfrowa"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The quality and subsequent performance of the TBCs are strongly dependent on the adhesion between the coating and the metal substrate. The adhesion strength of TBCs varies depending on the substrate materials and coating, the coating technique used, the coating application parameters, the substrate surface treatments, and environmental conditions. Therefore, the roughness of the substrate surface has a significant effect on the performance of the TBC system. In this work, the roughness and microstructure of the 7YSZ (7 wt.% yttria-stabilised zirconia) top coat under different bond coat roughness treatments were studied. The purpose of this paper was to investigate the influence of the roughness of the bond coat on the adhesion of 7YSZ TBCs prepared by the electron beam–physical vapour deposition (EB-PVD) process. The VPA (vapour phase aluminium) bond coat was deposited on Inconel 718 nickel superalloy substrate using the above-the-pack technique. The ceramic top coat was applied to the bond coat using the EB-PVD process. The dependence between the TBC coating roughness and the bond coat roughness was determined. Adhesion strength measurements were performed according to the ASTM C 633 standard test method. The highest adhesion value observed in the tensile adhesion tests was 105 MPa. However, it was not determined whether the surface roughness of the bond coat affects the adhesion of the 7YSZ top coat."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945034","journalIssue":{"objectId":"66b31e9dfdbe8318804cb9a0","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"14","number":"16","doi":null,"documentHash":"8e967fce-9946-454d-b3d8-4966a0fda55e"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/16/7401","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f813175085dcb410a25ec5f","name":"Grzegorz","lastName":"Maciaszek","uuid":"68F73471E6CE00C70ED90C4D1505A236A3D5C8458AA568A2290BBDBCB387543DF086303F7CA18CF103C4323E4D68B69B7A5D8427B0D5949C6169644FA4A254A0","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b18c78f8-e4db-43e8-ae3e-3f2c5bc51148"},{"objectId":"5e709267878c28a0473951ed","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Nowotnik","uuid":"6F575B0F7905127D0F4BF80F6D6E879F6C7999C7ADFE682A61BD20657A2011B5F4357E3E89E6E5EC472C79DDC4233694EDA36016C94E8A3B4A982DC5375B821E","orcidId":"0000-0001-7620-776X","documentHash":"83ac1527-75f8-4729-aae8-f27ba90ee7d1"}],"doi":"10.3390/app14167401"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["multilayer perceptron","waste heat recovery","SHAP analysis","machine learning","Python programming language","net present value (NPV)"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The analysis was based on net present value (NPV). The research also examined the possibility of using artificial neural networks and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis to assess the profitability of the investment and the significance of individual parameters affecting the NPV of the project related to installing the heat exchanger in buildings. Comprehensive research was conducted, considering a wide range of input parameters. As a result, 1,215,000 NPV values were obtained, ranging from EUR −1996.40 to EUR 36,933.83. Based on these values, artificial neural network models were generated, and the one exhibiting the highest accuracy in prediction was selected (R2 ≈ 0.999, RMSE ≈ 57). SHAP analysis identified total daily shower length and initial energy price as key factors influencing the profitability of the shower heat exchanger. The least influential parameter was found to be the efficiency of the hot water heater. The research results can contribute to improving systems for assessing the profitability of investments in shower heat exchangers. The application of the developed model can also help in selecting appropriate technical parameters of the system to achieve maximum financial benefits."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945036","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6698b331fdbe83588aa94a4e","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"17","number":"14","doi":null,"documentHash":"23589a97-541c-4af9-827c-71abc1d43eca"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-24","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/17/14/3584","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709422878c28a0473b6c38","name":"Beata","lastName":"Piotrowska","uuid":"59279A4488B188E53568D9792058B610E1FA6810E2992E7D1B5100B576772DD4C1FD148DF59378B71D89C3A28E5C0FB491CC13DC05CE895C7E2F54096E3CA84B","orcidId":"0000-0002-5166-9084","documentHash":"ffaef93f-b341-46a8-95f0-b9d37386fe90"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b6c6","name":"Mariusz","lastName":"Starzec","uuid":"5F1B2792387DE491149D420216AB10735B936C18A3A8C332F21F25B733343559B25233EC4C3106C7998B2E6B00FF4BFA1E73E8F891A4A946D0E0CD6D00A32ACB","orcidId":"0000-0002-5817-7517","documentHash":"8bdfb453-029d-402b-bf38-2a1efacd3044"},{"objectId":"5e7092b8878c28a04739b6a0","name":"Sabina","lastName":"Kordana-Obuch","uuid":"5AB38391BB0A4C88F568AF283463BAED2DD8C7E2D50726E967D36490BE6A2744A98A6B9EE3C7198CA7AC9CF11CC4B0316FCF5D045EC481BFCF05D3E1B070E871","orcidId":"0000-0001-6951-1317","documentHash":"ff489fbf-b50a-4039-8bbe-68ece3ed97b5"}],"doi":"10.3390/en17143584"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hydraulic truck concrete mixer","control and measurement system"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

When used in external elements, the key factor is to provide adequate anticorrosion protection. High-temperature, cured-powder coatings are widely used to protect most metals, but their use on magnesium alloys is difficult as a result of the instability of the magnesium substrate at elevated temperatures. Another problem is ensuring the proper adhesion of the organic coating to the magnesium substrate. This paper presents the procedure for the synthesis of a duplex coating on AZ91 magnesium alloy. The topcoat was a powder coating based on acrylic resin, the main ingredient of which was glycidyl methacrylate. Because of the presence of epoxy groups, the coating was cured using ultraviolet (UV) radiation (low-temperature technology). The conversion subcoating was produced by plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO) in an alkaline silicate electrolyte. The synthesized coating system was tested, among others, for microscopic (SEM), adhesive (mesh of cuts), and anticorrosion (EIS). The duplex PEO/UV-curable powder coating showed very good adhesion to the metal and increased the anticorrosion properties of the magnesium substrate, compared to the powder coating produced directly on the magnesium alloy and on an alternative conversion coating (synthesized in the process of chemical zircon phosphating)."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945043","journalIssue":{"objectId":"667aaa6f409707681dcb0f09","year":"2024","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"060834f6-56ec-4320-a0c2-b715aadfa209"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-19","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4701/14/6/733","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5f85558f085dcb410a25ed7f","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Pojnar","uuid":"68C4C90B6C82F1CA01A9CCC5747A019398BE9459FF634D1281FE126D4643B237CE912A4141644CA8919C9C77D9C2FB2A4381EA01CE27067E1748AFBC3028F23B","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d675dda1-d706-49ce-96e9-ad5ebe350435"},{"objectId":"5e70937d878c28a0473aaea1","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Kościelniak","uuid":"AAC6921496E0398B7909DBB31667CE3B594B3C02ADA211502C46E6C99F9D8C13AC286E334D7F8C423382525DD6DC6BCF7A827031A96D3447FD89CE2D0F6C7359","orcidId":"0000-0002-1683-0354","documentHash":"3259c9f7-fe47-4c25-a2eb-caa9cce15f4c"},{"objectId":"5e7092d1878c28a04739d5c7","name":"Barbara","lastName":"Pilch-Pitera","uuid":"76CFF847B5081CA0D4FD7E98D43018CFE47E196F0A3ECEB67CF328187460307F010360F6F0DE0ECA6259565F7C0DB624A8894F7C261EE3B2A8CBF08A6FB5B0E7","orcidId":"0000-0002-2412-2219","documentHash":"1e584fb2-c2be-451a-a749-274c1dd1a339"},{"objectId":"5e7092b7878c28a04739b5c5","name":"Łukasz","lastName":"Florczak","uuid":"2A16C07587CD9C5A7E7D2656050C578E8F42643158D1F52857C51CD8AAB30E070F3645A6179556D874BDD2E2BB4FC7CE8165CDFC56D0CA38E53C526F4B03F4DF","orcidId":"0000-0003-3368-275X","documentHash":"300dea9f-6b47-41e9-a2db-b24786bd2b97"}],"doi":"10.3390/met14060733"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Technological tensioning","Thin plate girder","Prestress","Defection","Technological compression"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

The permanent deformations of the girder lead to a lack of stability, which necessarily leads to its replacement. Replacing permanently deformed thin-walled load-bearing structures requires large financial outlays. Technological prestressing is one of the most effective methods for studying and treating permanent deflections in girder elements. This study looks at the defection of welded thin-plate S235JR steel girders, examining how technological tensioning effects interact with different loading conditions. Four girders, A2 (welded in bottom caps), A3 (welded in two side caps), and A4 (welded in two side caps and bottom caps), as well as the prestressed B2 girder, which has two welded side caps, were subjected to a bend test. The girders were subjected to a load P (20, 40, 60, 80 and 95) kN. All points were examined during the 95 min of cooling time. For technological compression, the results showed that there is a convergence between the analytical solution and the experimental results, as the most significant deviation achieved in the analysis was 5.21 mm compared to 6 mm experimentally. When the girder is loaded with the force P = 50 N, the maximum deflection achieved at girder A4 is 4 mm, compared with 1mm at girder A2. In prestressed girder B, the deflections that were reached were 2.50 mm, 3.50 mm, and 3.52 mm in the analytical, experimental, and FE numerical models, respectively. The tensions that were reached were 36.96 MPa, 44.28 MPa, and 27.93 MPa."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945045","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839bc44fdbe8331742628c1","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"46","number":"9","doi":null,"documentHash":"6176cb0d-be4e-44a4-b729-ac4fa60e67af"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1-13","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40430-024-05144-x","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6839bc44fdbe8331742628c5","name":"Raheem","lastName":"Al-Sabur","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cc7eac75-9c1e-4265-9acd-f8a3e05675ac"},{"objectId":"6839bc44fdbe8331742628c4","name":"Hassanein I.","lastName":"Khalaf","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ed39b060-5071-4e41-9207-e19ff36d80fb"},{"objectId":"6839bc44fdbe8331742628c3","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Macek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a69f1baf-6dbf-4ad9-b1fc-ce59faf563db"},{"objectId":"6839bc44fdbe8331742628c2","name":"D.","lastName":"Chodorowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"55be3728-eb5b-4f4e-86b3-0c66dd659e06"},{"objectId":"5e7093c5878c28a0473b0875","name":"Andrzej","lastName":"Kubit","uuid":"29B02092717238079C51B6A8162C98BB2B91565F926E0BDCD35A57FAE85A972865A9738DC92B81410E29455B3963394D73D5D13EC5422B63CE951F0FCC7B28CE","orcidId":"0000-0002-6179-5359","documentHash":"b521f1c8-5211-40ee-9442-8c524f0bcc3d"}],"doi":"10.1007/s40430-024-05144-x"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["cannabinoids","mass spectrometry quantification","monoisotopic silver nanoparticles","opioids"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.

Monitoring drug use in groups as well as in individuals is an important forensic concern. Analytical methods, such as mass spectrometry (MS), have been found most useful for the identification of drug abuse on a small and large scale. Pulsed fiber laser 2D galvoscanner laser-generated nanomaterial (PFL 2D GS LGN) was obtained from monoisotopic silver-109. Nanomaterial was used for laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry of selected illicit drug standards with standard high-resolution reflectron-based time-of-flight MALDI apparatus. Δ9-THC, 11-OH-THC, 11-COOH-THC, fentanyl, codeine, 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM), heroin, tramadol, and methadone were chosen as test compounds. Illicit drugs were tested in a concentration range from 100 μg/mL to 10 pg/mL, equating to 50 μg to 50 fg per measurement spot. For all analyzed compounds, identification and quantification by silver-109-assisted laser desorption/ionization (LDI) MS was possible, with uncommon [M + 109Ag3]+ and [M – H]+ ions present for certain structures. The results of the quantitative analysis of drugs using silver-109 PFL 2D GS LGN for LDI MS are presented. Laser-generated NPs are proven to be useful for the analysis of selected drugs, with exceptionally good results for fentanyl monitoring in a broad range of concentrations."}],"lastRefresh":"1748646945047","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6839ba9ffdbe833174261c09","year":"2024","publishedYear":2024,"volume":"35","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"bd2fae3e-0330-48b5-9caa-5f49c386078d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"1156-1167","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/epdf/10.1021/jasms.3c00454","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6524b72940e3ff22d34a1632","name":"Sumi","lastName":"Krupa","uuid":"05C1FF1755D2DF1BFF00EF2CED3631B14C919529E0B95F190B14D9B7375566AE12FB74AB288DCBBFB824BF430B60F773FA5B30DC00A2C5B64EB5495D203D9472","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1f297ca3-63f4-4ac4-90a9-81bef603d412"},{"objectId":"5e7092d2878c28a04739d64b","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Nizioł","uuid":"EEF8AF0F934BA048885BDD99FAE22294C6999A8A0967C16734A157E7784D01D5453C2FCD3E4196FB75F178174AFDDD999D60A5F9E0952925FD5B15EB6E3AF050","orcidId":"0000-0002-4783-8615","documentHash":"4e8756d5-6e03-4c94-b661-1af7408535bc"}],"doi":"10.1021/jasms.3c00454"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["negative integers","matrix generators","distance Fibonacci numbers","generalized Fibonacci numbers"]}],"year":2024,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","uid":"b7Ud9uT7O5B0U0x9-D88PfA","uuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","parentUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de33","rootUuid":"63374761-1ae0-43c0-9fa0-dd7d530ea4ab","name":"Politechnika Rzeszowska im.
