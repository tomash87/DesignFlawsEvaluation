An experimental program for the formation of creativity by means of the educational process has been developed as a system of interrelated and interdependent elements. It was based on the model of the formation of a creative personality. When creating the model, it was taken into account that initially the student masters the experience of problem-cognitive activity, and then he masters quasi-professional creative activity. Experiential learning was carried out in three stages. 1. Creation of a creative educational environment; 2. Inclusion of students in systematic creative activities. 3. Participation of students in independent individual creative activity, taking into account creative possibilities and abilities. The training program included simulation-game and problem-situational technologies, modeling of event-role situations of a problematic plan, active methods: business game, discussion, dialogue, debate, brainstorming, etc. The control cut to determine the effectiveness of the experiential training program confirmed the hypothesis of the study, the presence of a relationship between creative learning and the development of creative personality traits. The collected data showed positive changes in the levels of students' creativity in the process of solving learning problems."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199842","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6310a640409707291a633296","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"5","doi":"","documentHash":"e37fdbab-50ed-44dd-8a9e-35d3ae97e130"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"5624-5633","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.int-jecse.net/issue.php?volume=14&issue=35&page=35","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6310a619409707291a633193","name":"Mykola ","lastName":"Mykolayovich Kondrashov ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"2f45c3a5-8c51-4f4a-88a8-7e3ba3899561"},{"objectId":"6310a5fb409707291a63303a","name":"Lidia ","lastName":"Valentinovna Kondrashova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1f64e777-1d91-4cea-81a5-c5a876d0f09b"},{"objectId":"6310a5da409707291a632ef1","name":" Mykhailo ","lastName":"Olegovich Chuvasov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bde2d539-97da-44cf-910b-e37eb9a9b729"},{"objectId":"6310a5ac409707291a632347","name":" Nataliia ","lastName":"Oleksandrivna Chuvasova","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c5f3d563-f5fb-48f6-b172-bec35ae11e15"},{"objectId":"5e709295878c28a047398731","name":"Anna","lastName":"Klim-Klimaszewska","uuid":"799FEC01A265D53468F7D4FC88B35FEBF4EAF48D809ABF5D29FD3F1BC92665799B338A28E7F84ED5B83993AF81DB2EEA4610CBCC453C0C49DBF59D6EE8AF0B7C","orcidId":"0000-0001-7418-9983","documentHash":"d01c3678-f649-4952-9827-822bcef6c28e"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["sports medicine","sleep monitoring","sleep hygiene practices","sleep education","youth athletes training"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de49","uid":"bLWzmffcpX6RSmOhITf-UUA","uuid":"51310d3f-60fd-43e1-a210-07d090082219","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de49","parentUuid":"51310d3f-60fd-43e1-a210-07d090082219","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de49","rootUuid":"51310d3f-60fd-43e1-a210-07d090082219","name":"Akademia Wychowania Fizycznego im.

Materials and methods: A sample of 139 Polish coaches and sports science support staff working with youth athletes volunteered to complete a survey focused on sleep monitoring, hygiene practices, and sleep education. The Sleep Beliefs Scale (SBS) was also included. Results: Overall sleep hygiene knowledge was inadequate for the whole sample (14.86 ± 2.70, score range 0 - 20; mean ± SD). However, the overall SBS score for science support staff was adequate (15.44 ± 2.71) and significantly higher than the inadequate score obtained by coaches (14.48 ± 2.65, p = 0.013). Less than half (48%) of coaches and science support staff promoted or administered sleep hygiene strategies, and only 17% monitored sleep of youth athletes. Most coaches and science support staff (only 35% of \"Yes\" responses) were not educated in sleep knowledge. However, there were significant differences between coaches and science support staff (28 % vs 46 %, respectively; p = 0.030) in their education in the field of sleep hygiene. Conclusions: Coaches working with youth athletes had inadequate overall sleep hygiene knowledge, while sports science support staff’s knowledge was adequate. Sleep hygiene strategies, sleep monitoring practices, and sleep education of coaches and science support staff seemed to be limited. We suggest that a broader approach to sleep education in youth sports staff might be necessary to improve sleep practices in youth athletes."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199844","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"98","pagesFromTo":"21-28","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/292959","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64cd33144097077ac1ddc837","name":"Zuzanna","lastName":"Komarek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b70dad82-2f15-4fad-9161-4c9a923b3bbf"},{"objectId":"64cd33144097077ac1ddc836","name":"Sara","lastName":"Krzysztofik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"bea0698e-4781-4fc9-a1ab-f3d87e985ee3"},{"objectId":"64cd33144097077ac1ddc835","name":"Michał","lastName":"Spieszny","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"88fe2f10-bbdb-4397-8425-181bdab567e3"},{"objectId":"5e709373878c28a0473a9e44","name":"Michał","lastName":"Krzysztofik","uuid":"09B2064AE9D43D6879AE4A67450FA0D08BAB72E52E4AF7A9A3DB21E8CD0D9CFC18B7AC9B5AAE86C4E27C827622E08E19B2338B2B52FF2D1BCD34B4FF452320EC","orcidId":"0000-0003-2797-8431","documentHash":"eb9c811f-81a8-4d79-9155-53e811b9c5f8"},{"objectId":"5e709342878c28a0473a5d25","name":"ALEKSANDRA","lastName":"FILIP-STACHNIK","uuid":"9D80769DE4AE94F78A0B1A5CCCBFA91EEBDD4EC26E82724C281CD76ACACFAEF2982D5CF53180DBEE9814748E2D678A4561536F166C752EB25D706F87FE979CA7","orcidId":"0000-0003-2008-6158","documentHash":"1fc0b46e-d4dd-4e49-b8e7-0a16ff1f9f1e"},{"objectId":"5e709318878c28a0473a2bdf","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Hołda","uuid":"61D30B61B67C96C0BDFAFD7C021352A7E0F5BA56C5173068F203DDD290EF1274E6BEEE6C7D0BDAF56292B2734C62E32E396F7DA7A38C5A82088B44CF502F5940","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"84fa4102-b951-4fe1-b6bf-b1a97ffe32b1"}],"doi":"10.5604/01.3001.0015.8566"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091c6878c28a047388f2e","uid":"bO8jQveXbJUBWXbrYtv52kw","uuid":"ea92c3c3-47a5-46d1-8d6f-a84e87a9fc82","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Katedra Maszyn Rolniczych, Leśnych i Transportowych","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709225878c28a047390aad"]},{"id":"6179f70b7523400564d49029","uid":"bGFBENSeCwlCSgoq-WWmYNQ","uuid":"9da35095-d6ab-46ce-ba3e-e11a86abac6f","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Katedra Biofizyki","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7094a0878c28a0473c08fd"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Application of artificial neural networks, support vector, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems for the moisture ratio of parboiled hulls","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c28514547714f","mniswId":"1518","title":"Applied Sciences (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2076-3417","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"ff202409-59bf-494e-82ae-6802b8fb2444"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-09","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62ce88144097075e7c658da8","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709225878c28a047390aad","5e7094a0878c28a0473c08fd","64a28b2340970713863e3f53","64a28b2340970713863e3f54","64a28b2340970713863e3f55","64a28b2340970713863e3f56","64a28b2340970713863e3f57"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Drying as an effective method for preservation of crop products is affected by various conditions and to obtain optimum drying conditions it is needed to be evaluated using modeling techniques. In this study, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), artificial neural network (ANN), and support vector regression (SVR) was used for modeling the infrared-hot air (IR-HA) drying kinetics of parboiled hull. The ANFIS, ANN, and SVR were fed with 3 inputs of drying time (0–80 min), drying temperature (40, 50, and 60 °C), and two levels of IR power (0.32 and 0.49 W/cm2) for the prediction of moisture ratio (MR). After applying different models, several performance prediction indices, i.e., correlation coefficient (R2), mean square error index (MSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) were examined to select the best prediction and evaluation model. The results disclosed that higher inlet air temperature and IR power reduced the drying time. MSE values for the ANN, ANFIS tests, and SVR training were 0.0059, 0.0036, and 0.0004, respectively. These results indicate the high-performance capacity of machine learning methods and artificial intelligence to predict the MR in the drying process. According to the results obtained from the comparison of the three models, the SVR method showed better performance than the ANN and ANFIS methods due to its higher R2 and lower

suggests there has been a decrease in childhood dairy consumption. There is a need for further studies to evaluate the types of dairy products in relation to the risk of obesity in pediatric population. The aim of the study was to determine the associations between the frequency of consumption of different types of dairy products and body composition and excess adiposity in preschool children from Poland. A cross-sectional study of 1172 children aged 5–6 years was conducted using a bioelectrical impedance analysis for body composition estimation and a modified food frequency questionnaire (FFQ-6) to assess the habitual diets of the participants. Among the analyzed dairy products, milk was consumed most often, followed by fruit yoghurts, yellow cheese, and cottage cheese, and natural yoghurt was the least common. Participants that consumed fruit or natural yoghurt more frequently had higher adipose tissue content. The logistic regression analysis by the method of forward selection showed that more frequent consumption of fruit yoghurt significantly increased the risk of excess adiposity among the total sample (OR = 1.20, p < 0.001). This study revealed that higher consumption of fruit yoghurt could be significant determinant of excess adiposity in Polish preschool children."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199851","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61eaa9aa2467f06f09e1bc9d","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"19","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"2459da2e-8a6b-461b-a1c9-c173120520ea"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"1140","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/3/1140/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7093a1878c28a0473ae1a1","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Matłosz","uuid":"9E2098B690F1F1ED7D5A36628618CE26283DA987704CF7A6FE20CED0C14AA6994329EEFF106441E8307F8E4D0FA9D9580B7EC1ADD6450E0CDDCA7EE1BCFDC05F","orcidId":"0000-0002-7388-5722","documentHash":"af4667f1-fc94-4c3b-b7a2-36097c349875"},{"objectId":"5e709229878c28a047390e80","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Wyszyńska","uuid":"9FBE443BEACE62D62D8AEAA6EC58A5BC30A7720D83BD0646BE87D2CE9B9776A94FDC86BF04970961F750ABDBCE86AAF7EB0A78872EF3FB5ACE3F99BCFD2E8FAD","orcidId":"0000-0002-5786-6214","documentHash":"9ce774c7-5b07-4ffa-a530-a8531423945f"},{"objectId":"5e709229878c28a047390e03","name":"Jarosław","lastName":"Herbert","uuid":"3A893CF3C5C51E1BB7780EDB794E631DE026095237577CC5DA45FB6FB906CC25DC1D1B76B88BC1E98884EF4EA7EF310A97EDC4C7CAF965404A98441BE079BE78","orcidId":"0000-0003-0434-6263","documentHash":"40078a19-cb14-43ef-976b-cfd107fe87fc"},{"objectId":"5e709228878c28a047390d70","name":"Artur","lastName":"Mazur","uuid":"9F159C0AFA3D056D7FD607FB0EF273D59E601695E1A62BC40CA1422DBC5C1D2DAE3B46E82438C4E98E7B9BFC73168C502F2AED0E7969C3157502C07B6861AC82","orcidId":"0000-0001-5393-3515","documentHash":"f1cb99a7-fa58-4b23-849f-c86a8b6e3c68"},{"objectId":"5e709216878c28a04738fb80","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Czarny","uuid":"98873A4B8269865293028640AC2AE4BB5F9DB29AEC5426056C914FC10833617E7A9183B517A175F0B7DF638B7D81FA38784B95CB901AF73996E601D15904DAAF","orcidId":"0000-0001-9481-7609","documentHash":"c74fdcba-acd1-446f-86fd-07c05709567f"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19031140"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet

It should also be mentioned that the modeled systems are often multidimensional, which is an additional serious obstacle. Richard Bellman formulated the concept of the \"dimensional curse\" which says that as the dimensionality of a system increases, difficulties increase geometrically. In this article, the authors consider the problem of dimensionality reduction in order to build a model of the ship's exhaust emissions. It was observed that some data are incomplete or have little impact on the baseline variables. Design/methodology/approach: Two methods of dimensionality reduction were applied (Pearson's linear correlation index and arc-angle index) and their suitability for this process was discussed. Findings: Thanks to the methods used, it was possible to obtain information on the significance level of each of the model inputs. In addition, a lot depends on context, data availability, and much more. In any case, it is worth doing research in this direction. Practical implications: We deal with modeling mainly in cases when we need to rely on measurement data, and the modeled system itself is unknown to us. The only thing the researcher has at his disposal is a certain set of measurement data, which very often lacks metadata. Nevertheless, even the basic information about input and output data allows you to create a model. However, the problem may be too much data. Although their storage itself is nothing difficult at present, the same sending them using means of communication (e.g. sending via the Internet) may already be troublesome. Originality value: Typically, in the analysis of significance, methods that take into account the value of variance are used. Such a method is, for example, PCA (principal component analysis) (Sorzano 2014, Scholkopf 1997). The originality of the approach described in the article, however, consists in building a ranking of the significance of individual variables."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199868","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62c2bc8b40970721cb8f52d6","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"XXV","number":"2","doi":"","documentHash":"79db1a71-5362-4172-9229-1a10c063cb61"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"XXV","pagesFromTo":"587-596","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ersj.eu/journal/2981","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397273","name":"MARCIN","lastName":"MĄKA","uuid":"32196EF592F7563D17EFCA642F762F53E0F35E549328424C7A01B0201D69D57C0EC2834E1AE4D87AC0A2E1B697B31E14FA10965B965C6DC71161279F0F3AB156","orcidId":"0000-0002-1477-2445","documentHash":"38b4b17a-1c45-41d3-8835-865e9dd18a21"},{"objectId":"5e709284878c28a047397251","name":"MARIUSZ","lastName":"DRAMSKI","uuid":"8740D09A875C0281C61F3371B9F5F147FF90828F65DA6AB9CF2C57EB938301CEA5C8FE5328A0B27AD7838C465D5F2F84984C559E2A2B41852666F9C008F0EDC2","orcidId":"0000-0001-5334-1384","documentHash":"c16a0eac-a6bd-40f9-ae04-6c8f1521051c"}],"doi":"10.35808/ersj/2981"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["compressor blades","heat-resistant alloy","surface layer","finishing-strengthening processing","double hardening","endurance limit"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61b08abc2467f078640085e8","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Zaporizhzhia Polytechnic National University","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["6237796e2467f0495b04e339","6237796e2467f0495b04e33a","6237796e2467f0495b04e336"]},{"id":"6237796e2467f0495b04e335","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Zaporizhzhia Machine-Building Design Bureau Progress State Enterprise named after academician O.

Taking into consideration the special role of the finishing-strengthening treatment in the formation of the quality of the surface layer, various options for blade tip processing were investigated. The blade tips were shaped by high-speed line milling. The finishing-strengthening stage of tip machining included manual polishing and ultrasonic hardening operations with steel balls in various combinations.\n\nThe basic regularities have been established in the formation of the roughness of tip surfaces, the maximum height of micro-irregularities, the surface microhardness, and the propagation depth of the hardened layer, depending on the combination of finishing-strengthening machining techniques. The results of tests are given for multi-cycle fatigue of blade batches treated according to various variants of the technological process. The efficiency of polishing the surface of the tip after strengthening treatment has been established. To restore the quality characteristics of the surface layer after polishing, it is proposed to perform repeated strengthening treatment. It is shown that the use of double deformation hardening technology with intermediate polishing at the finishing-strengthening stage of blade manufacturing makes it possible to increase the endurance limit from 320 MPa to 400 MPa while increasing durability. Technology for the finishing-strengthening stage of machining blades made from nickel alloys, characterized by significant viscosity, has been devised. It is shown that based on the criteria of minimum labor intensity of machining and maximum endurance of blades, it is effective to use double deformation hardening with steel balls in an ultrasonic field with intermediate polishing."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199870","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623775112467f0495b04d2df","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"12 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"5191dd5a-a9da-464e-bc55-0935335a9528"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"31-37","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/252292/250743","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6237796e2467f0495b04e33a","name":"Dmytro","lastName":"Stepanov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-1780-3611","documentHash":"0504de2f-15ec-4760-aedb-c4694730691f"},{"objectId":"6237796e2467f0495b04e339","name":"Yevhen","lastName":"Vyshnepolskyi","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8048-7976","documentHash":"27f867b2-6d4d-4035-84f6-0034cefdf8be"},{"objectId":"6237796e2467f0495b04e338","name":"Yuriy","lastName":"Torba","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8470-9049","documentHash":"1f3b72f7-056e-46b1-85c6-e04c1c947587"},{"objectId":"6237796e2467f0495b04e337","name":"Eduard","lastName":"Kondratiuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2672-7174","documentHash":"bb9dd588-c7c6-43ff-b4bb-948559c54aeb"},{"objectId":"6237796e2467f0495b04e336","name":"Dmytro","lastName":"Pavlenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6376-2879","documentHash":"1cb016cc-3644-4cd0-8f9f-0de041e74a74"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.252292"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","uid":"bDhBQQ-KXKw9V_oG5ueXwuQ","uuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","parentUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de18","rootUuid":"ec799b31-2b67-4e3d-b91b-d4bb28f41d43","name":"Uniwersytet Jagielloński w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709319878c28a0473a2cac","5e70946f878c28a0473bcf7b","5e709315878c28a0473a281d","5e709315878c28a0473a2804","5e709409878c28a0473b544c","5e709318878c28a0473a2c13","5e709328878c28a0473a3d88","5e70932c878c28a0473a43db"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Comparison of anti-cancer effects of novel protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) inhibitors in breast cancer cells characterized by high and low PDIA17 expression","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4a878c285145477525","mniswId":"3203","title":"Cancer Cell International","doi":null,"issn":"1475-2867","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"f1df5b12-0e83-445e-ac81-8b19a217f156"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-12","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6310b4ed409707291a63de2b","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709315878c28a0473a2804","64cd34624097077ac1de1ee2","64cd34624097077ac1de1ee3","5e709315878c28a0473a281d","64cd34624097077ac1de1ee4","5e709328878c28a0473a3d88","5e70946f878c28a0473bcf7b","5e70932c878c28a0473a43db","5e709409878c28a0473b544c","5e709318878c28a0473a2c13","5e709319878c28a0473a2cac"]},"issue":"1","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Protein disulphide isomerases (PDIs) play an important role in cancer progression.

Some expectations of parents travelling with children are the same independent of the accommodation location. The purpose of this article is to examine at what level city hotels offer services and amenities within family tourism, how they meet parents’ expectations and whether they adapt offers to children of different ages. Two measurement tools were used for this study. The first one was the authors’ questionnaire addressed to hotel managers. A total of 88 hotels located in Krakow were selected for the study. The survey contained questions on the offers of hotels related to various services and amenities for families with children, which were assigned to one of three groups (24 items): general child-friendly hotel services and amenities, in-room amenities and restaurant amenities. In the second phase of the study, parents of children aged 0–10 years were asked to assess the degree to which the amenities offered by hotels were important for them during the selection of a hotel. In total, 90 surveys were taken into consideration. The tool was designed to examine the needs of parents who have children of different ages, in regard to selected hotel services and amenities (24 items). As in the case of the surveys for hoteliers, the same three groups were created. The research demonstrates that children’s age is the key factor that should lead to the differentiation of the accommodation offer. However, hoteliers largely perceive children as a homogeneous group. In all studied age categories (6) and amenities groups (3), parents’ expectations were higher than the services and amenities offered. No significant differences regarding the category of the hotel or hotel chain membership have been found. The results of the study may provide valuable guidance to hoteliers who wish to attract families with children to urban tourism and adapt their offer to them, thus realising the principle of inclusiveness. They may be also a significant contribution to the literature on the subject, as most published work concerns holiday hotels rather than city hotels."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199873","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cea8ca4097070a2ca43ecc","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"19","number":"14","doi":null,"documentHash":"dbc8b5b3-631f-46db-a34f-9a6f6e6741ed"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"19","pagesFromTo":"id. 8321","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/14/8321/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e7094a8878c28a0473c12b8","name":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Wrześniewski","uuid":"B24128F200C28B0F9BB0A4AF3BE947CEF074B1B3F4EAD052F2451BB0769FC2B2D83C0C597C28B52B93286633E7C01E2C9BDE391DF9CC56574EA8DD8C383343F1","orcidId":"0000-0003-3443-5638","documentHash":"45774c6b-8586-4a81-a939-9f46e16109c7"},{"objectId":"5e709433878c28a0473b7feb","name":"Anna","lastName":"Kolasińska","uuid":"E7C655AE42517814C8B8C36E4AA2C3E17BC24C50D7BEABD8934D783F27AC476A3B39EAD9509338214AF878069C7E973ED71B19FABF889F38C51874230C83D3E7","orcidId":"0000-0001-6990-0128","documentHash":"53e3039e-28c0-48bf-afa2-96e5c61d3eea"},{"objectId":"5e709428878c28a0473b7567","name":"Matylda","lastName":"Siwek","uuid":"84666BBDB297EB4FE06EF86EB4B0D25BFA5BACAB445BFC378A8B9424D08BDDCB1CD31B0F9E7F18A4FCD691E96491DED0CC5041B022E9A4106BD2BBF94FFD7A2B","orcidId":"0000-0002-0487-1263","documentHash":"d8f560cf-56ff-485e-bd1d-d676db23cc9a"},{"objectId":"5e7093bf878c28a0473b022f","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Żmuda-Pałka","uuid":"CA27159452C450E49069B03B12FC410D0857758DC85E3B79C03C8FCBC1D042DD209D96191AD6A695B4A60695DEEAD321D32AAE8560A3C3347F4031AAE00A774E","orcidId":"0000-0002-5344-8998","documentHash":"70f67393-abd4-4e00-a396-00ef9820120b"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijerph19148321"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"62cfd6fd4097075e7c6f74d8","doi":null,"title":"The Evolution of Supplementary Pensions : 25 Years of Pension Reform","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978 1 80037 297 9","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://sin.put.poznan.pl/publications/details/i43009","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"93f6ab1c-2ec1-4ab7-a9b4-940eabf5ef3c","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb753","mniswId":"900","name":"Edward Elgar Publishing","documentHash":"56ae01ea-fe2b-4366-979e-6b9d2f104de5"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092fb878c28a0473a0727"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Poland: a pension system under constant (re)construction","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62cfd7074097075e7c6f7514","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092fb878c28a0473a0727","62cfd7074097075e7c6f7517","62cfd7074097075e7c6f7518","62cfd7074097075e7c6f7519","62cfd7074097075e7c6f751a"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[],"lastRefresh":"1747058199875","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":null,"pagesFromTo":"229 -

It was established that the procedures of conducting state internal audits change under influence of digitization. Conformity of the stages of audit digitization and the applied digital technologies was established. Foreign experience in the digitization of the state internal audit was analyzed. It was also established that the active application of artificial intelligence technologies may be one of the probable scenarios of the development of the state internal audit system in foreign countries in the near future. Types of digital technologies were systematized depending on the field of state internal audit. It was found that the maximum effect from the use of digital technologies in the field of audit will take place in the case of their synergistic combination. Coordinated interaction between constituent elements of the state internal audit has been established. This has made it possible to present the process of development of the state internal audit system in conditions of digitization and determine its main objective: ensure greater transparency and efficiency of accounting for tangible assets by means of new digital technologies. Taking into account the above, a mechanism of development of the system of state internal audit in conditions of use of digital technologies was offered. It is based on corresponding directions and measures. It was established that to assess the efficiency of development of the state internal audit system in conditions of application of digital technologies, it is advisable to use the indicators reflecting overall results of measures taken in state financial control. The application of the proposed mechanism will make it possible to establish the effect of digital technologies on the development of the state internal audit."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199877","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62377dbb2467f0495b04f4e3","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"13 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"d5673221-18b0-40e2-8922-e4fc4e6ebdf4"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"39-48","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/252424/250795","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623789fe2467f0495b051041","name":"Tetyana","lastName":"Mishchenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6740-0581","documentHash":"42ae9f1f-51b1-4ab6-9dc1-d748bd5b6bfa"},{"objectId":"623789fe2467f0495b051040","name":"Eugene","lastName":"Alisov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6708-3854","documentHash":"ed3ea2b8-3cfc-4269-8d38-cf3360471ab8"},{"objectId":"623789fe2467f0495b05103f","name":"Olha","lastName":"Safronova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-3553-2050","documentHash":"20bf9804-5d1c-42df-bde4-ed8a879c7a0d"},{"objectId":"623789fe2467f0495b05103e","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Moroz","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4306-3741","documentHash":"c490cdab-ee3f-4ea7-89e9-890c4bab3bba"},{"objectId":"623789fe2467f0495b05103d","name":"Dmytro","lastName":"Kobylnik","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6777-7963","documentHash":"0ebe69fe-484b-4ff8-869c-083feec01de3"},{"objectId":"623789fe2467f0495b05103c","name":"Oleksandr","lastName":"Basiuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-3224-5489","documentHash":"0fcbaaf0-8c34-4246-a9d1-a23197e0de55"},{"objectId":"623789fe2467f0495b05103b","name":"Valeriia","lastName":"Riadinska","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-2210-5933","documentHash":"ec7399ec-d650-4293-a5b9-3716c33c8089"},{"objectId":"623789fe2467f0495b05103a","name":"Oleksandr","lastName":"Karpenko","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-9301-7973","documentHash":"2c67622a-75e5-4767-84c9-7e62e3197b10"},{"objectId":"623789fe2467f0495b051039","name":"Olga","lastName":"Dmytryk","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-5469-3867","documentHash":"31f08d00-a9b8-4c41-9b7b-0a3097c1bd81"},{"objectId":"623789fe2467f0495b051038","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Korol","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-0021-5389","documentHash":"38bf0e8b-add1-4a1e-8d02-349a1bf9e118"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.252424"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["oś HPA","stres","zdrowie psychiczne","neurotransmitery","depresja"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","uid":"bbrvLTls7geV7LvfvePMCLw","uuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","parentUuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737dea2","rootUuid":"2decf01b-6405-4e8c-9d7c-20c2e63170c2","name":"Instytut Farmakologii im.

In order for the electrical management of an internal combustion engine to function properly, it is necessary that all its electronic components work flawlessly and fulfill their role. Failure of these electronic components can cause incorrect fuel mixture preparation and also affect driving safety. Due to the effect of individual failures, it has a negative impact on road safety and also negatively affects other participants. The task of the research is to investigate the effect of the failure of electronic engine components on the selected operating characteristics of a vehicle. The purpose of this article is to specify the extent to which a failure of an electronic engine component may affect the operation of a road vehicle. Eight failures of electronic systems (sensors and actuators) were simulated on a specific vehicle, with a petrol internal combustion engine. Measurements were performed in laboratory conditions, the purpose of which was to quantify the change in the operating characteristics of the vehicle between the faulty and fault-free state. The vehicle performance parameters and the production of selected exhaust emission components were determined for selected vehicle operating characteristics. The results show that in the normal operation of vehicles, there are situations where a failure in the electronic system of the engine has a significant impact on its operating characteristics and, at the same time, some of these failures are not identifiable by the vehicle operator. The findings of the publication can be used in the drafting of legislation, in the field of production and operation of road vehicles, and also in the mathematical modeling of the production of gaseous emissions by road transport."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199881","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/5/2054","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6238535a2467f067af1212c3","name":"Michal","lastName":"Richtář","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a4736ce2-69ce-4655-9dc6-cd1f2b9eaed9"},{"objectId":"6238535a2467f067af1212c2","name":"František","lastName":"Synák","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5822f9b0-bbbd-4338-ae7b-7a755c24677b"},{"objectId":"6238535a2467f067af1212c1","name":"Michal","lastName":"Loman","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"48f836b7-d8f5-4e26-8ba5-cfb7d509076a"},{"objectId":"6238535a2467f067af1212c0","name":"ranislav","lastName":"Šarkan","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4d87e8e1-afe8-447b-a1cc-9fd4aa601379"},{"objectId":"5e709270878c28a047395b91","name":"Mirosław","lastName":"Gidlewski","uuid":"AD39BF7EEB75E950BB82EAC0C2DCF156E966F8F8545EA9AF510EA3B8C05D6C86CAFA302B09E55840BA4FCC1C1EA3CE5D918A8C2C62CA580C990E1AD77CC1EC2F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5775-184X","documentHash":"b0dfdc92-187c-4fb3-8a4b-ac856ab175be"}],"doi":"10.3390/s22052054"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"An

quantity and quality of soil organic matter (SOM) depending on many edaphic and environmental factors may change in response to agriculture-related practices. The SOM humification process can be supported by the application of mineral fertilizers, but in the production vineyards, such information is lacking. NPK fertilizer alters the soil quality, and therefore, the aim of this study was to: (1) assess the extent and dynamics of different NPK (control—no fertilization; 1st NPK; and 3rd NPK levels) rates to the soil with grass sward cover in a productive vineyard on changes in SOM, humic substances (HSs), and soil structure, and (2) identify relationships between SOM, HSs, and soil structure. Results showed that the share of humic acids in soil organic carbon decreased only in NPK1 compared to control and NPK3 treatments. The color quotient of humic substance values in NPK1 and NPK3 increased by 4 and 5%, respectively, compared to control. Over a period of 14 years, the content of soil organic carbon increased by 0.71, 0.69, and 0.53 g kg−1 year−1 in the control, NPK1, and NPK3, respectively. The content of HSs increased linearly with slight differences due to NPK application. The vulnerability of the soil structure decreased due to fertilization—more at the higher NPK level. The rate of formed soil crust was decreasing in the following order: control &gt; NPK1 &gt; NPK3. In the control treatment, the relations between SOM, HSs, and soil structure were most abundant and with the greatest significance, while with the increasing level of NPK, these relations lost their significance."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199892","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"1-9","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4395/12/6/1460","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"643ad1ce4097076e1e9e9027","name":"Elena","lastName":"Aydın","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"669bf8d3-c21b-4637-b61d-2613d36a2210"},{"objectId":"643ad1ce4097076e1e9e9026","name":"Martin","lastName":"Lukac","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9fbaabef-b707-4143-84e0-b1fcbddf3080"},{"objectId":"643ad1ce4097076e1e9e9025","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Parzych","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a13ac89a-61f7-4fd8-817b-12a5c64cb5dc"},{"objectId":"643ad1ce4097076e1e9e9024","name":"Tomáš","lastName":"Lošák","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"58cc9683-974f-43e2-9fb7-dab364f86bd5"},{"objectId":"643ad1ce4097076e1e9e9023","name":"Dorota","lastName":"Pikuła","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"c01232d1-de77-4dfd-b76b-906a1db20e73"},{"objectId":"643ad1ce4097076e1e9e9022","name":"Jarmila","lastName":"Horváthová","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"a6b832a5-57eb-4212-bbb4-badc7cde1855"},{"objectId":"643ad1ce4097076e1e9e9021","name":"Vladimir","lastName":"Šimanský","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8a1bf211-b348-411e-b867-e895d6210f67"},{"objectId":"5e709257878c28a04739411c","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Wójcik-Gront","uuid":"5FFE1686B5FC530528EEAE738206E3CD5F50A5A6F17842B9DD50950FBBAD93996F4928207F7D0F1C405D18D8AFDB07E80114603C520A0EF98D55A6B116EB497F","orcidId":"0000-0002-7172-0529","documentHash":"683ac6af-19fa-47ba-90bd-2771602686d4"}],"doi":"10.3390/agronomy12061460"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","uid":"bFstCP-XVgvi8lydtQE33_w","uuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","parentUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1f","rootUuid":"1a88b2ad-f6fd-4e5a-b514-27766a21594d","name":"Uniwersytet

of water content in forest habitats is considered essential in ecological research on forests, climate change, or forest management. In the traditional forest habitat classification, two systems of habitat conditions analysis are found: single factor and multifactor methods. Both are laborious and therefore costly. Remote sensing methods provide a low-cost alternative. The aim of the presented study was to find the relationship between the spectral indices obtained from satellite images and the forest habitats moisture indices used traditionally in the Polish forest habitats classification. The scientific hypothesis of the research is as follows: it is possible to assess the variation in the humidity of forest habitats on the basis of spectral indices. Using advanced geographic information system (GIS) technology, 923 research plots were tested, where habitat studies performed with the traditional methods were compared with the analysis of 191 spectral indices calculated for Sentinel-2 image data. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has proved to be the most useful to the assessing of moisture of forest habitats. The ranking of the most correlated indices was calculated as Eintg—the product of the absolute value of the slope and the mean square error complement, and for the top five indices was as follows: NDVI = 0.248619, EXG = 0.242112, OSAVI = 0.239412, DSWI-4 = 0.238784, and RDVI = 0.236995. The results also highlight the impact of water reservoirs on the humidity and trophicity of forest habitats, showing a decrease in the fertility of habitats with an increase in distance from the water reservoir. The results of the study can be used to preparing maps of the diversity of forest types, especially in hard-to-reach places, as well as to assess changes in the moisture status of habitats, which may be useful, for example, in the assessment of the fire risk of forest habitats. We have proved that NDVI can be used in applications for which it was not originally designed.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199897","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/14/17/4267","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"65818f564097076c14b7a27f","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Kowalewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d24c7054-7985-4db1-9544-4146da2c47ee"},{"objectId":"65818f564097076c14b7a27c","name":"Adam Marcin","lastName":"Młynarczyk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8846b6ef-6126-4e21-bf18-0b12a6e90f6b"},{"objectId":"5e7094d7878c28a0473c513b","name":"Monika","lastName":"Konatowska","uuid":"B85BF77FED66D1CFBB24FF5AE79D05CC4FFC80B33443251D7024E8DB72004623F2A66379485A540A33537D671219761B14CD5FDBBA9972B619A5ADC8BF333B18","orcidId":"0000-0001-6552-7055","documentHash":"b274ef9d-9f99-4e3f-a9b3-227929633a55"},{"objectId":"5e709347878c28a0473a641e","name":"Paweł","lastName":"Rutkowski","uuid":"345E9FD35A3E7FB3675120AEE1BD4A99E16021CA789537E901FF5002D931FCB82F1749D0F35B80B89CF9A83C4C743ADE22CD74ADB1E627472E318022E69D904D","orcidId":"0000-0003-3614-8923","documentHash":"7642988c-63d5-4176-99c8-be32f97a8dd1"},{"objectId":"5e709310878c28a0473a23a1","name":"Jan","lastName":"Piekarczyk","uuid":"6A667B7016CAB7FDCE9BCF19D929A337E2B0E2CED86D9C6FF671572EA44DBEFB245ADB5370619E6F678A0DC5A5568224DCCE71026A43604D846A067EEC738787","orcidId":"0000-0002-2405-6741","documentHash":"8c43f2ce-f4bf-4955-83ac-595ce151c192"},{"objectId":"5e709310878c28a0473a2385","name":"Sławomir","lastName":"Królewicz","uuid":"68315C290D2E75503DED8725A37E183A11BBBD73007A70748581F2B229E96C111B5FDC5A4063C8D49BD4540FD2747FC601C8857B285C8D7417144FDEDE1AC7FA","orcidId":"0000-0003-1117-7832","documentHash":"999e2ecb-abf3-424a-9f9d-a7de8c312631"}],"doi":"10.3390/rs14174267"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["poly(L-lactide)","tailor-made properties","chiral nematic","liquid crystal","cyclodextrin"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709191878c28a04737e9dc","uid":"bhuAmiQSz4rgvQiZB33W38w","uuid":"fee3c56b-eccc-4eb9-bca2-5913db555e88","parentId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9dc","parentUuid":"fee3c56b-eccc-4eb9-bca2-5913db555e88","rootId":"5e709191878c28a04737e9dc","rootUuid":"fee3c56b-eccc-4eb9-bca2-5913db555e88","name":"Centrum Materiałów Polimerowych i Węglowych Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af5fb","5e709434878c28a0473b822a","5f111e897523405869ccc2b8","5e709425878c28a0473b71e7","5ebed5ff752340254fc404e2","5e709434878c28a0473b817d","5e70923e878c28a0473925a0","5e709447878c28a0473b97bc","5e709498878c28a0473c013a","5e709498878c28a0473c0198"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Nematic-to-Isotropic Phase Transition in Poly(L-Lactide) with Addition of Cyclodextrin during Abiotic Degradation Study","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4c878c285145478260","mniswId":"9159","title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","doi":null,"issn":"1422-0067","eissn":"1422-0067","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":null,"editor":null,"documentHash":"30236fd5-adc3-4b09-b2c8-6a106b437fa9"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-22","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"630e0b1c4097073ebc9461da","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7093b2878c28a0473af5fb","5ebed5ff752340254fc404e2","5e709498878c28a0473c013a","5e709434878c28a0473b822a","5e709498878c28a0473c0198","5e709425878c28a0473b71e7","5f111e897523405869ccc2b8","5e709447878c28a0473b97bc","5e709434878c28a0473b817d","630e0b1c4097073ebc9461db","630e0b1c4097073ebc9461dc","5e70923e878c28a0473925a0"]},"issue":"14","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Poly(L-lactide) is capable of self-assembly into a nematic mesophase under the influence of temperature and mechanical stresses. Therefore, subsequent poly(L-lactide) films were obtained and characterized, showing nematic liquid crystal properties both before and after degradation. Herein, we present that, by introducing β-cyclodextrin into the polymer matrix, it is possible to obtain a chiral nematic mesophase during pressing, regardless of temperature and time. The obtained poly(L-lactide) films exhibiting liquid crystal properties were subjected to degradation tests and the influence of degradation on these properties was determined. Thermotropic phase behavior was investigated using polarized optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and differential scanning calorimetry. The degradation process demonstrated an influence on the liquid crystal properties of pressed polymer films. The colored planar texture of the chiral nematic mesophase, which was not observed prior to degradation in films without the addition of β-cyclodextrin, appeared after incubation in water as a result of the entrapment of degradation products in the polymer matrix. These unusual tailor-made properties, obtained in liquid crystals in (bio)degradable polymers using a simple method, demonstrate the potential for advanced photonic

hybrid carbon–mineral materials were synthesized by the mechanochemical activation of a mixture of tannin and bentonite in a ball mill with further pyrolysis in an argon atmosphere at 800 °C. The influence of the initial mixture ingredients content on the structural, textural, and thermal characteristics of biochars has been described using X-ray diffraction, Raman and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, nitrogen adsorption–desorption, and scanning electron microscopy. The influence of bentonite clay on the carbon phase characteristics due to the formation of more heat-resistant and structured nanocarbon particles in biochars has been proven. The adsorption effectiveness of the materials towards methylene blue was studied. The adsorption data were analyzed applying Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms with high determination coefficients (R2) in the range of 0.983–0.999 (Langmuir) and 0.783–0.957 (Freundlich). The maximum adsorption amount of MB was 5.78 mg/g. The adsorption efficiency of biochars with respect to phenol was also examined. It was shown that the hybrid biochars show differentiated selectivity to the adsorption of organic compounds. It was concluded that the physicochemical properties of the surface of biochars play an important role in the adsorption effectiveness, making them a good candidate for water and wastewater remediation processes.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199904","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1-17","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/14/15/2407/htm","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63f8b5c740970770356826a4","name":"Volodymyr ","lastName":"Gun’ko ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4c24ffed-1d31-4a99-b5f6-1d9f1da95df3"},{"objectId":"63f8b5c740970770356826a3","name":"Olena","lastName":"Oranska ","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"4d853aae-67c3-44c1-8cb6-ecef79a021a8"},{"objectId":"63f8b5c740970770356826a2","name":"Viktor","lastName":"Bogatyrov","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"19ccfa86-61b1-452b-8f3d-6d6aa49f528f"},{"objectId":"63f8b5c740970770356826a1","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Bosacka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9253a294-30f0-42e4-9c37-36956f07bf61"},{"objectId":"63f8b5c740970770356826a0","name":"Mariia","lastName":"Galaburda","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"57b78e6c-0d77-4fb1-b9e3-e6a91975c520"},{"objectId":"5e7092f8878c28a0473a02ee","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Sternik","uuid":"DC097C64F23520925824CA44B2EA010375A53BA9CF73B7F1B6176FD0DA4F2D6F08C9429B48625C906F10378EF80E5971FBECBD98A0086F778DFE2BEF44C8B180","orcidId":"0000-0002-3063-7542","documentHash":"aacfa026-a5b4-453c-9bf0-74c955ca4631"},{"objectId":"5e7092f8878c28a0473a02ec","name":"Anna","lastName":"Deryło-Marczewska","uuid":"31DD4B3962D924B13870C1856501C9F7087C15D43C70E3B1BA51DA25D46DF02DD44484255BAE0346CD01F503D4D3D126600BC9872600002B92BD3B370B30F34B","orcidId":"0000-0003-0208-1257","documentHash":"c35e33bb-fefb-4874-af00-4ed42430f564"}],"doi":"10.3390/w14152407"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["phenology","life history","immune function","freshwater insect","Ischnura elegans","voltinism","climate change"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","uid":"bqvFVl6-FYxc-KjUUrbTwDw","uuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","parentUuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737debb","rootUuid":"d9533386-e2a3-4492-a638-0128dcb533df","name":"Instytut Ochrony Przyrody Polskiej Akademii Nauk","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093f5878c28a0473b3fa6","5e709400878c28a0473b4ada"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Phenological Shifts in a Warming World Affect Physiology and Life History in a Damselfly","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d59878c28514547c3d4","mniswId":"8403","title":"Insects","doi":null,"issn":"2075-4450","eissn":"2075-4450","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"7c54c228-a3ae-4dee-abb4-5ffeda21746a"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-07-12","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62d0093a40970733e796a91f","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["62d0093a40970733e796a921","62d0093a40970733e796a922","62d0093a40970733e796a923","5e709400878c28a0473b4ada","5e7093f5878c28a0473b3fa6"]},"issue":"7","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"limate warming affects phenological events of cold-blooded organisms. In this analysis we studied, in laboratory conditions, the impact of warming and hatching dates on key life history and physiological traits in a cannibalistic damselfly, Ischnura elegans. Larvae were reared in groups from hatching to emergence through one or two growth seasons, depending on the voltinism. Larvae were equally divided by hatching dates (early and late) and temperature treatment (current and warming). Early and late hatched groups were not mixed. Despite no difference in cannibalism rate between different hatching dates and temperatures, early hatched larvae reared under warming had elevated immune function measured as phenoloxidase (PO) activity. This increased PO activity was not traded off with life history traits. Instead, age and mass at emergence, and growth rate were mainly affected by temperature and voltinism. Our results confirm the importance of phenological shifts in a warming world for shaping physiology and life history in a freshwater

Several factors that can cause pinking were analyzed: the degree of grapes ripeness and enzymatic treatment. The effect of fining agents based on polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) on the elimination of “pinking” was determined. It was proved that pinking in wines decreases with an increase in the sugar content in grape. This is explained by a decrease in the content of anthocyanins at the end of technical ripeness of grape. Experimental studies  confirmed that the use of pectolytic enzymes with cellulase, hemicellulase, β-glucanase activities increases the intensity of straw color and the appearance of body tones, but does not affect pinking. Such treatment contributed to a slight increase in the content of phenolic compounds in wine materials, but did not affect the content of anthocyanins and  “pinking” susceptibility. Treatment of wine materials with complex PVPP-based agents including sorbents and flocculants, is an effective way to eliminate the “pinking” phenomenon. This reduces “pinking” in wine materials from 70…90 % to 1…2 %. This is due to the presence of sorbents and flocculants in the fining agents, which react with phenolic substances that cause “pinking” in white wines, and remove them from the system. So, there are reasons to argue that processing grape at the end of technical ripeness will contribute to a lower “pinking” susceptibility of wine materials; pectolytic enzymes did not affect the appearance of this phenomenon in white wines, and PVPP-based fining agents together with bentonite, activated carbon, gelatin or casein, are an effective way to reduce the “pinking” susceptibility of wine."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199911","journalIssue":{"objectId":"623727112467f0495b045a4e","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"11

after stroke with paretic or plegic hands require frequent exercises to promote neuroplasticity and to improve hand joint mobilization. Available devices for hand exercising are intended for persons with some level of hand control or provide continuous passive motion with limited patient involvement. Patients can benefit from self-exercising where they use the other hand to exercise the plegic or paretic one. However, post-stroke neuropsychological complications, apathy, and cognitive impairments such as forgetfulness make regular self-exercising difficult. This paper describes Przypominajka v2—a system intended to support self-exercising, remind about it, and motivate patients. We propose a glove-based device with an on-device machine-learning-based exercise scoring, a tablet-based interface, and a web-based application for therapists. The feasibility of on-device inference and the accuracy of correct exercise classification was evaluated on four healthy participants. Whole system use was described in a case study with a patient with a paretic hand. The anomaly classification has an accuracy of 91.3% and ??1 value of 91.6% but achieves poorer results for new users (78% and 81%). The case study showed that patients had a positive reaction to exercising with Przypominajka, but there were issues relating to sensor glove: ease of putting on and clarity of instructions. The paper presents a new way in which sensor systems can support the rehabilitation of after-stroke patients with an on-device machine-learning-based classification that can accurately score and contribute to patient motivation."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199919","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6230423d2467f034a5d4d91f","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"22","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"c297c3dc-11d6-43bf-af8e-9e0175dac0a4"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"22","pagesFromTo":"2414","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/6/2414","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"67372e75fdbe832d85af9d8f","name":"Ilona","lastName":"Dominik","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5aeb2a19-4f41-4a83-834c-ca03d4dad70d"},{"objectId":"67372e75fdbe832d85af9d8e","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Prączko-Pawlak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"635fd605-de1d-4aba-ab24-f6da259a784b"},{"objectId":"5e7093c7878c28a0473b0a6d","name":"Igor","lastName":"Zubrycki","uuid":"93F3886FD8414BED0E10B4F54E5564391B1A9BC37B05A6355A22DF116C821296E98DB246912CBD49B7D85EECC33BFD04FC0E28F556B4BDABA7177C539B1E2E65","orcidId":"0000-0002-1229-2173","documentHash":"6d92e6ad-ee8e-48f2-bd0a-f7d2d1a3d817"}],"doi":"10.3390/s22062414"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","uid":"b-COLbcdAG-k5w4OvZzdVBg","uuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","parentUuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737decc","rootUuid":"bdcdbaed-bbf2-43bd-b224-c5d80dd351fb","name":"Narodowy Instytut Onkologii im.

The research aimed to evaluate the influence of the HT on the increase of the coating hardness and changes in anticorrosion properties. Hot-dip zinc coating was deposited in industrial conditions (acc. EN ISO 10684) on chosen bolts (M12x60). The achieved results were assessed based on corrosion resistance tests in neutral salt spray (salt chamber) and microhardness measurements. Tests were conducted in accordance with the adopted fractional plan, generated in the DOE module of the Statistica software. Using the conjugate gradient method optimal parameters of HT were determined. The conducted tests proved that the controlled heat treatment may increase the hardness of the hot-dip zinc coating without a significant deterioration in its basic protective function (corrosion resistance). The observed changes in the hardness and corrosion resistance of the zinc coating are a consequence of changes in its structure."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199928","journalIssue":{"objectId":"630c96334097075e8cd2fd7a","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"17","doi":null,"documentHash":"4dbae414-e20f-43bd-9dbd-9aaae1551f2f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"Art.no. 5887, 1-14","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/17/5887","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6311ee0a409707352b6b1fea","name":"Elżbieta","lastName":"Szatkowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"031cc1a9-cbc8-4e5b-9d89-e2a8ecc48668"},{"objectId":"5e7091f7878c28a04738dc62","name":"Dariusz","lastName":"Jędrzejczyk","uuid":"DEA98770F4F32AF0C3114B6DA136CB52FAC8F63CA879D05D7828C4C66FA1C59E17959D42ADA0FC1577C98F71C2BA97671DD4085C5E76F7B903C4F9A9609DA75C","orcidId":"0000-0002-0541-1373","documentHash":"e4885160-d322-4cd7-b1d1-b32bd108e7c1"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15175887"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Hydrachnidia","Acari","Trichoptera","Piona stjordalensis","larwy","Insecta","Mystacides longicornis","żywiciele"]},{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Hydrachnidia","Acari","Trichoptera","Insecta","Piona stjordalensis","Larvae","Mystacides longicornis","Hosts"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f902","uid":"bk_n03ydqnhCQzeW0cj586g","uuid":"dae78b8a-6bdd-4a4c-aeba-e3409b15c413","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","parentUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1d","rootUuid":"abcd38c3-bc4b-4b17-8dcf-9210f0fba35e","name":"Instytut Nauk o Morzu i Środowisku","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092a7878c28a047399f7b","5e7092a7878c28a047399f8c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"A new pattern of parasitism in water mites (Hydrachnidia)? : an insight into their relationships with pupae of caddisflies (Trichoptera)","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d59878c28514547c415","mniswId":"8562","title":"International Journal for Parasitology: Parasites and Wildlife","doi":null,"issn":"2213-2244","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"54cc30bb-1322-45b6-8cf9-271478a2b3ad"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OTHER","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-04-10","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":null,"isReview":false,"wosConference":null},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62ce94dd4097075e7c66389d","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092a7878c28a047399f7b","5e7092a7878c28a047399f8c","6661a2254097074fa1bcd685","6661a2254097074fa1bcd686","6661a2254097074fa1bcd687"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"To date, relatively few data have been available regarding the parasitism of water mite larvae on caddisflies; most available information relates to the adult stadia, fewer to caddisfly larvae, with just single references to pupae.

In this paper, the resistance to wear of three different internal design hydraulic nozzles was ascertained. Changes in the flow rate and spray distribution as a result of this wear were also investigated. The wear test was done inside a closed system, and it was accelerated using an abrasive material to generate 100 h of wear. The tested nozzles were the Turbo TeeJet (TT)-twin chambered, Turbo Twinjet (TTj60)-dual outlet, and Drift Guard (DG)-pre-orifice. Wear rate, flow rate, and the virtual coefficient of variation (CVv) were measured at different wear intervals. The results showed that the TTj60 type was the most resistant to wear, followed by the TT type and DG. The latter two types showed an increase in the flow rate only in the first 45 h of wear. Virtual coefficient of variation (CVv) values were less than 10% after finishing the test (after 100 h of wear) for the three types of nozzles, which are acceptable values according to International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 16122-2, 2015."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199936","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"889","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/2/889","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"64a28b4240970713863e3f73","name":"Alaa","lastName":"Subr","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"907e716f-2508-457f-ba21-dbc4e174ba6c"},{"objectId":"5e709466878c28a0473bc359","name":"Marek","lastName":"Milanowski","uuid":"A1807D1D94FC8F0C84858C15F64963DB2995AEE3A72F3EA42E0C02453E8979024416CE5F619827BE853C3A28EB9C02D4DAE64EDEF65876EEA6AA0F2FFB33E9F9","orcidId":"0000-0003-3367-7942","documentHash":"92c582dd-c639-492d-bd8e-7d7cc592fc7f"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a0473909af","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Parafiniuk","uuid":"C244833692D0C676DE750D2B5DB6286CA29C3418C56503B3C2BDF6B4C06F27FA5887E8AADB6117C7FE16071AF0272239FF405758A513F6733936FF8CF8ED1ECB","orcidId":"0000-0002-8566-6527","documentHash":"083c650d-0a7f-460d-82e5-8c93d934098a"}],"doi":"10.3390/app12020889"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","uid":"bhdVW0TkXv39ZSgac65mGnw","uuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","parentUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","rootUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","name":"Uniwersytet Komisji Edukacji Narodowej w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709232878c28a047391732","5e70923e878c28a047392614"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Participatory budgeting in Dabrowa Gornicza -

Turkey has grown to become one of the top five producers of olives and olive oils in the world. Olive trees in general are found in the coastal parts of the country. The fruits of six traditional cultivars of olive (Gemlik, Domat, Memecik, Ayvalik, Cilli, and Adana Topagi), grown in Adana, were characterized based on their fruit skin color, the amount of chlorophylls, fatty acids, antioxidant activity, and total phenolic compounds, as well as volatile compounds. The international cultivar Manzanilla, grown in the same orchards as the traditional cultivars, was also included in the study to make a comparison. Compared to the Manzanilla cultivar, Memecik showed the highest amount of total phenolic content and antioxidant activity with the highest level of lightness, blueness/yellowness, and color intensity. Ayvalik presented the highest level of greenness/redness. Although the highest fruit lightness and darkness were found in the Cilli cultivar, with the highest amount of chlorophyll a (2.63 mgL−1), there was more chlorophyll b in Adana Topagi fruits (3.34 mgL−1). The highest percentage of fatty acids was found in the Gemlik cultivar of 66.81%, among which oleic acid was the major component. The total aldehydes ranged between 33.43% and 50.60%. Compared to Manzanilla and the traditional cultivars, the Domat cultivar had the highest amount of hexanal of 44.42%. Adana Topagi had the highest amount of alcohols (61.34%) and acids (1.31%). Memecik registered the highest amount of ketones (17.86%) and terpenes (20.34%). Among all cultivars, Manzanilla displayed the highest amount of esters (2.30%). In this study, traditional cultivars were found to be the richest in health-promoting chemicals. Furthermore, a significant variability among the cultivars was revealed, implying that metabolic fingerprinting approaches could be used to differentiate cultivars once more research into the effects of the growing conditions and environmental factors on the chemical profiles of each cultivar is carried out."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199945","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"8","pagesFromTo":"416","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2311-7524/8/5/416","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62cfcaf44097075e7c6f6923","name":"Rafa","lastName":"Almeer","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"70020d8a-cd3e-4b26-91a6-8f9c21ff953c"},{"objectId":"62cfcaf44097075e7c6f6922","name":"Amine","lastName":"Assouguem","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"249e0a6d-266e-4dbf-84f5-47fe097167cf"},{"objectId":"62cfcaf44097075e7c6f6921","name":"Sezai","lastName":"Ercisli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"1005bb45-d25f-4beb-856c-7a181d4f36c3"},{"objectId":"62cfcaf44097075e7c6f6920","name":"Rayda B.","lastName":"Ayed","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dcd6ef53-5b9f-4495-94a8-ff0c5ee54ea1"},{"objectId":"62cfcaf44097075e7c6f691f","name":"Nesibe E.","lastName":"Kafkas","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d59b18b4-541f-4b70-bf85-e145f5ba3294"},{"objectId":"62cfcaf44097075e7c6f691e","name":"Gozde","lastName":"Nogay","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"e65ce22d-a025-46b9-99f1-b3f0d4d3968c"},{"objectId":"62cfcaf44097075e7c6f691d","name":"Farah","lastName":"Elgudayem","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8ff61c39-2b44-4252-8693-2732494f6372"},{"objectId":"62cfcaf44097075e7c6f691c","name":"Songul","lastName":"Comlekcioglu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"fabfc965-a538-4a78-b7cc-7d4b43845a74"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a04739099f","name":"Agnieszka","lastName":"Najda","uuid":"82DA3F16A75CCC7EB00FFA0D98100368FDDB2BE2B50C92E48C622D16F38935BF0CDFEC99DB04888E16A20EBB67BCAE44D6F16242A60A817AA521EDBC3E77E6A5","orcidId":"0000-0002-1185-8884","documentHash":"0e711e98-6382-428f-b37f-ed6498487ed9"}],"doi":"10.3390/horticulturae8050416"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091be878c28a047387586","uid":"b19pJ6HgFitgkFuk9B9b_iQ","uuid":"4c92ed64-6916-4cbc-b37a-0c120e58fc36","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Instytut Gleboznawstwa, Inżynierii i Kształtowania Srodowiska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7093ab878c28a0473aec7e","5e709224878c28a0473908fd","5e7094a2878c28a0473c0c51"]},{"id":"5e7091be878c28a047387593","uid":"bNZr2n2i3hCzJTLVuUiAwXQ","uuid":"0ab3c874-c919-45ed-b018-73d812460ef7","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Katedra Turystyki i Rekreacji","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709349878c28a0473a66c5"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Residual effects of different cropping systems on physicochemical properties and the activity of phosphatases of soil","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d56878c28514547b8d1","mniswId":"675","title":"Agriculture (Switzerland)","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2077-0472","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"fb8db9b6-d4d7-498a-b26c-2119c1ad43da"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-05-13","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62cfe39f4097075e7c6f9efe","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709224878c28a0473908fd","5e7094a2878c28a0473c0c51","5e709349878c28a0473a66c5","5e7093ab878c28a0473aec7e"]},"issue":"5","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Soil plays a key role in sustainable land management and food production. The objective of the field experiment was to evaluate the subsequent effect of 10-year winter wheat and sugar beet cultivation under conventional and organic systems on selected physicochemical and biochemical properties and enzymatic pH index of lessive soil developed from loess under climatic conditions of Southeastern Poland. The experiment was set up by using the split-plot design, with three replications, on plots of 30 m2. In order to evaluate the soil value of sites cultivated in 2010–2019 in two systems—conventional agriculture and organic agriculture—spring wheat was sown as a test crop in 2020. Fertilization and pesticide applications (herbicides, fungicides and insecticides) were foregone in the cultivation of this crop due to the desire to capture the subsequent impact of 2010–2019. This resulted in soil properties shaped solely by the previous 10 years of cultivation. The obtained results indicate that the organic farming system contributed to the improvement of soil pHKCl compared to the conventional system, with statistically significant differences recorded only for winter wheat cultivation. Compared to the conventional system, in the organic farming system, improvements were recorded in the chemical indicators of loess soil quality (TOC, TN and TOC/TN) and P content, as well as acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase activities. However, statistically significant differences were found only for winter wheat cultivation.

An innovative recipe for powdered fruit and vegetable drinks fortified with lentil proteins (AGF) and stabilized with flax seed gums (FSG) was developed. The study focused on the analysis of potentially bioaccessible fractions from the produced beverages in terms of their antioxidant, antiproliferative activities and physicochemical properties. The contents of bioactive components were tailored by the incorporation of lyophilized fruits and vegetables, the FSG and the AGF. Digestion in vitro effectively released phenolics from all matrices. The highest contents of potentially bioavailable polyphenols were recorded for the AGF based beverages enriched with 5% of FSG and green-leafy vegetables ( 58 mg/100 mL) and those with lyophilized fruit (54 mg/100 mL).\r\nThe reducing power of the beverages was mainly affected by the presence of the AGF, while the FSG and lyophilized fruit improved the chelating power. The digests applied in the concentrations mimicking physiological concentrations showed antiproliferative properties against gastric and colon adenocarcinoma—they seemed to be tailored by bioactive peptides and phenolics, respectively. The addition of the FSG improved the stability of the beverages increasing the time required for a\r\nreduction of 20% of the initial optical density by 16- and 28-times in the beverages without additives or enriched with vegetables. Both, the AGF and FSG stabilize the beverages after rehydration and are sources of bioaccessible antioxidant and anticancer components, which create their functionality."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199952","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"12","pagesFromTo":"7159","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/14/7159","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5ffd633a085dcb6be6b60b37","name":"Justyna","lastName":"Bochnak-Niedźwiecka","uuid":"0EE70DD3C230230B1490890112B8C38D1966750276B2C47F9972129D719DA93AEC0A413C4AF9D1B5EA6C1BC0129B463583521106290B7FCBB824D5FE058E0C6D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"55bb733d-b464-4d4f-921a-2498b7f17a92"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390b4e","name":"Michał","lastName":"Świeca","uuid":"DB0AE014ADDEC7FD2D9DD09EF851EC5B589DFAF362F745304540BF84CB47FD40E4A87B4C312944ECBB1C1242BEABAF354C3BC8877D838BEE9F353D81CB37029B","orcidId":"0000-0002-6513-8399","documentHash":"acb0df58-b62e-4347-9d01-a2da828e0d4a"},{"objectId":"5e709227878c28a047390b1e","name":"Urszula","lastName":"Szymanowska","uuid":"79D7639A54BE6676E23DD9C022244E6E723AC0677C4A820FA189D81F087EC8274587D2FD04BA588687720315055298A294E1146637EE1F42EBF8951F9313DCE3","orcidId":"0000-0001-9692-2111","documentHash":"4ef751f2-ddb5-4d8a-8b57-211ce994e7de"}],"doi":"10.3390/app12147159"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"619eee587523402fabdeb186","uid":"bpyDMJks_pbq-m8ouLLylhw","uuid":"e3afe24a-8d04-4a69-add5-36d14df6e5bc","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Katedra Technologii Żywności Pochodzenia Zwierzęcego","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709225878c28a0473909f3","5e709225878c28a0473909a0"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Sodium reduction by partial and total replacement of NaCl with KCl in serbian white brined cheese","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d58878c28514547c176","mniswId":"6714","title":"Foods","doi":null,"issn":null,"eissn":"2304-8158","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"0f59a8f0-a1f9-45c0-ba10-cec780ad3d19"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-27","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62ce7cb54097075e7c656295","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709225878c28a0473909f3","6065aac99543c745d80e5b5f","5e709225878c28a0473909a0","62ce7cb54097075e7c65629c","62ce7cb54097075e7c65629d","62ce7cb54097075e7c65629e","62ce7cb54097075e7c65629f","62ce7cb54097075e7c6562a0"]},"issue":"3","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Cheese has been listed as one of four priority food groups intended for salt reduction reformulation. The present study aimed to investigate the possibility of producing Serbian white brined cheese (Homoljski Sir) with half of NaCl, three quarters of NaCl and all NaCl replaced with KCl (Na50, Na25 and Na0, respectively). Basic composition, proteolysis and texture profile parameters were monitored during 60 days of ripening. At the end of ripening, an acceptance test was conducted by untrained consumers (N = 46). According to the cluster analysis based on hedonic scores, three clusters emerged: male consumers (47.8%), agreeable consumers (30.4%) and highly educated female consumers (21.8%). Both partial and a total salt replacement had no effect on the course of proteolytical changes, the texture and basic composition during ripening. Female consumers did not accept any level of salt substitution, while male consumers showed dislike only for the Na0 cheese. Almost 80% of all consumers liked moderately-to-very-much the Na25 cheese variant. It implies that it is worth considering the production of cheese with 50–75% of NaCl replaced with KCl. The addition of natural flavoring and clear labeling of the sodium reduction should accompany the salt replacement strategy."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199953","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"11","pagesFromTo":"374","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/11/3/374","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62ce7cb54097075e7c6562a0","name":"Ana","lastName":"Radulovic","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"9790fba6-8dd8-41ed-8ef4-c3a50e6a917b"},{"objectId":"62ce7cb54097075e7c65629f","name":"Sredovic

Although an individual may slip into drug abuse throughout his/her life, adolescents are at higher risk, but, so far, only a few studies have attempted to elucidate the underlying cellular and molecular bases of such vulnerability. Indeed, preclinical evidence indicates that psychostimulants and adolescence interact and contribute to promoting a dysfunctional brain. In this review, we have focused our attention primarily on changes in neuroplasticity brought about by cocaine, taking into account that there is much less evidence from exposure to cocaine in adolescence, compared with that from adults. This review clearly shows that exposure to cocaine during adolescence, acute or chronic, as well as contingent or non-contingent, confers a vulnerable endophenotype, primarily, by causing changes in neuroplasticity. Given the close relationship between drug abuse and psychiatric disorders, we also discuss the translational implications providing an interpretative framework for clinical studies involving addictive as well as affective or psychotic behaviours."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199957","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6315d19f40970717dcf82f9a","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"179","number":"17","doi":"","documentHash":"a159252e-65ad-4cbd-a05f-a505508b6621"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"179","pagesFromTo":"4233-4253","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bph.15523","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"630f54304097071f37aed774","name":"Fabio","lastName":"Fumagalli","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"be8a6d10-ad8e-49ef-9566-18d7e94c9918"},{"objectId":"630f54304097071f37aed773","name":"Gianmaria","lastName":"Zita","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f007bb53-e078-4a75-b922-4380008b5820"},{"objectId":"630f54304097071f37aed772","name":"Francesca","lastName":"Mottarlini","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"562b8206-35e2-4e0f-ac33-8923ab11fa0d"},{"objectId":"630f54304097071f37aed771","name":"Lucia","lastName":"Caffino","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8e3737b8-8a7c-4e20-bea5-d6ca92b83f92"},{"objectId":"5e7094d6878c28a0473c4f0d","name":"Edmund","lastName":"Przegaliński","uuid":"2B45F75BC4F9F75B6130921E84F042956F09C52AE46BC2A349121DEB5E6C22930C8CF217F51A0834B52C77F0E42EF30F13130808D8A767AFB179037C978B9F3B","orcidId":"0000-0002-7578-2196","documentHash":"876a90f1-6439-4df3-b047-f4199db9427c"},{"objectId":"5e7094a2878c28a0473c0c49","name":"Karolina","lastName":"Wydra - Kolarska","uuid":"2B8F34BB832336374386E6C5FB3037482DC66C671C15EFC203E03931BAED0440266979E571F9B1D09149F5D216BDB5FFD27308BFBBDAF68CC0DBB2571687D24D","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f3adc16f-e605-4b6a-9405-e2915d55ccfb"},{"objectId":"5e70932c878c28a0473a440e","name":"Dawid","lastName":"Gawliński","uuid":"318252096ED3D782FE7DD5CF991C02671D0370A9DBBE340F07086FDC7C1641894AD8F1A3A59603E6EF6BDE284AF1D5551FC8CEF15414097D19E98EDEE3557164","orcidId":"0000-0002-9376-0564","documentHash":"77d32955-d84b-456e-b825-6af6c82cbfa3"},{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a0473983e2","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Gawlińska","uuid":"B18A62DF49E8E3A75C6927A58260D97738FFABFF9B6EEF2D124AA5101B273BC878C1DC3B99790B900C89A4B3CA1402579AFBF92117F25476E8B4921F3730741E","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"38ae7821-c80d-4044-b951-47357b7a587d"}],"doi":"10.1111/bph.15523"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["social network","users’ relationships","security system","nonlinearity","differential equations","procedure"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61a7408d2467f03711d1e020","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"State University of Telecommunications","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623499072467f00ffe96e299","623499072467f00ffe96e29b","623499072467f00ffe96e29a","623499072467f00ffe96e29d","623499072467f00ffe96e29c"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Devising a procedure to determine the level of informational space security in social networks considering interrelations among users","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-28","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"623499072467f00ffe96e297","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["623499072467f00ffe96e299","623499072467f00ffe96e29a","623499072467f00ffe96e29b","623499072467f00ffe96e29c","623499072467f00ffe96e29d"]},"issue":"9(115)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Linear and dynamic models of the system of information security in social networks, taking into consideration the relationships between users, were studied and the resistance of the security system was analyzed.\n\nThere is a practical interest in studying dependence of the behavior of the system of social network security on the parameters of users’ interaction. Dynamic systems of information security in social networks in the mathematical sense of this term were considered. A dynamic system refers to any object or process, for which the concept of state as a totality of certain magnitudes at a given time is unambiguously defined and the law that describes a change (evolution) of the initial state over time was assigned.\n\nThe network of social interactions consists of a totality of social users and a totality of the relations between them. Individuals, social groups, organizations, cities, countries can act as users. Relations imply not only communication interactions between users but also relations of the exchange of various resources and activities, including conflict relations.\n\nAs a result of research, it was found that the security systems of a social network are nonlinear. Theoretical study of the dynamic behavior of an actual object requires the creation of its mathematical model. The procedure for developing a model is to compile mathematical equations based on physical laws. These laws are stated in the language of differential equations.\n\nPhase portraits of the data security system in the MATLAB/Multisim program, which indicate the stability of a security system in the working range of parameters even at the maximum value of the impacts, were determined.\n\nThus, the influence of users’ interaction parameters on the parameters of the system of social network security was explored. Such study is useful and important in terms of information security in the network, since the parameters of users’ interaction significantly affect, up to 100 %, the security indicator."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199961","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6234838c2467f00ffe9659c3","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"9 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"089b239a-8df4-4132-9d11-1db8fbe09c4f"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"63-74","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/252135/250758","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623499072467f00ffe96e29d","name":"Serhii","lastName":"Zozulia","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-1733-1415","documentHash":"7af38128-7be3-4e8c-b590-8c4ebdc8637d"},{"objectId":"623499072467f00ffe96e29c","name":"Tetiana","lastName":"Muzhanova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7435-0287","documentHash":"246c67f5-0d9d-4712-9aa2-8ba6a46bf824"},{"objectId":"623499072467f00ffe96e29b","name":"Yuriy","lastName":"Pepa","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2073-1364","documentHash":"a68116a1-f0f1-422d-9e78-d1f60f1fad33"},{"objectId":"623499072467f00ffe96e29a","name":"German","lastName":"Shuklin","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2507-384X","documentHash":"6877874e-b512-4949-b5f8-c69fd8cb9fb4"},{"objectId":"623499072467f00ffe96e299","name":"Volodymyr","lastName":"Akhramovych","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-6174-5300","documentHash":"aa1ff012-2bf1-464c-a6da-041c52ca1b47"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.252135"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["Biochar","Functional materials","Controlled release fertilizer","Pyrolysis","Nutrients"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Biochar and engineered biochar as slow- and controlled-release fertilizers","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4d878c28514547855e","mniswId":"10492","title":"Journal of Cleaner Production","doi":null,"issn":"0959-6526","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"cada1622-e1d1-4d24-aed6-44275f609510"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"ORIGINAL_AUTHOR","license":"CC_BY_NC_ND","releaseDate":"2022-01-25","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"6234539b2467f00ffe94b6a0","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709227878c28a047390aff","659fc2084097076c144aab13"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"Biochar, characterized by high specific surface area and porosity as well as by the presence of various functional groups, can be an excellent matrix for creating fertilizers that slowly release nutrients (slow-release fertilizers and controlled-release fertilizers).

The scent and attractive colours with flower guides and such floral rewards as nectar, pollen, and oil are important attractants for insects visiting and pollinating flowers in the family Iridaceae. The aim of this study was to investigate the morphology of flowers and the micromorphology, anatomy, and ultrastructure of floral nectaries in the rare and endangered species Iris sibirica with the use of light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopes and histochemical assays. Osmophores in the form of papillae were located on the adaxial surface of outer tepals and on the abaxial surface of the stylodium channel. The nectaries were located on the inner surface of the perianth tube and were composed of a single-layered epidermis with papillae and several layers of glandular parenchyma with vascular bundles. I. sibirica nectaries represent the presecretory starch-accumulating type, where nectar is released for a short time immediately after flower opening. Nectar was produced throughout the flower lifespan in both male and female stages. It was secreted in the granulocrine mode and released through microchannels in the reticulate cuticle of nectary papillae. Transport of pre-nectar components proceeded via symplastic and apoplastic pathways. The nectary epidermal cells with papillae and glandular parenchyma cells contained total lipids, acidic lipids, and polysaccharides, whereas the epidermal cells with papillae additionally contained neutral lipids and polyphenol compounds. The nectaries and nectar production in I. sibirica flowers share the common location and follow several secretion patterns characteristic for the nectaries in some members of the family Iridaceae and the subfamily Iridoideae. Nevertheless, the mode of nectar release through the cuticle of epidermal papillae has been described in Iridaceae family for the first time. The visual, aromatic, and food attractants characteristic of I. sibirica flowers probably stimulate potential visits by pollinators, but the short nectar secretion period may limit the effectiveness of pollinators and sexual reproductive success."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199967","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"158","pagesFromTo":"103288","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968432822000841","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a04739094d","name":"Agata","lastName":"Konarska","uuid":"1320B43EC224895B428D55A2472E0B4B3BB6DC1B9D4B3E56EF3E8037755D00A9B13E5054F6305C91456AEAD5B4D55C770230E60D5A62288CA7E1798AB9EDC920","orcidId":"0000-0003-2174-7608","documentHash":"0e165946-e8a2-42aa-a6a4-292a22d51ad1"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.micron.2022.103288"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":"978-953-8446-00-9","book":null,"typeName":"Książka

gamma T is a protein product of the RORC gene belonging to the nuclear receptor subfamily of retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptors (RORs). ROR gamma T is preferentially expressed in Th17 lymphocytes and drives their differentiation from naive CD4+ cells and is involved in the regulation of the expression of numerous Th17-specific cytokines, such as IL-17. Because Th17 cells are implicated in the pathology of autoimmune diseases (e.g., psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis), ROR gamma T, whose activity is regulated by ligands, has been recognized as a drug target in potential therapies against these diseases. The identification of such ligands is time-consuming and usually requires the screening of chemical libraries. Herein, using a Tanimoto similarity search, we found corosolic acid and other pentacyclic tritepenes in the library we previously screened as compounds highly similar to the ROR gamma T inverse agonist ursolic acid. Furthermore, using gene reporter assays and Th17 lymphocytes, we distinguished compounds that exert stronger biological effects (ursolic, corosolic, and oleanolic acid) from those that are ineffective (asiatic and maslinic acids), providing evidence that such combinatorial methodology (in silico and experimental) might help wet screenings to achieve more accurate results, eliminating false negatives."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199974","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61fa5df02467f013ba91dd47","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"23","number":"3","doi":null,"documentHash":"777a1283-1b7b-4880-b166-d90fbed20095"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"1906","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/3/1906/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62cd94454097073c6e329a7d","name":"Błażej A.","lastName":"Wojtczak","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7448-7216","documentHash":"f696164a-966b-4889-9f31-d9ec34b087d7"},{"objectId":"62cd94454097073c6e329a7c","name":"Katarzyna","lastName":"Chałaśkiewicz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"05e45b4a-81a7-439c-9938-ce64a5641a4a"},{"objectId":"60fa43839543c744c19b0ee5","name":"Joanna","lastName":"Pastwińska","uuid":"14781397C7F7AF97AAEE41496FEC60E4D7EB66B223B6AA98976146E70CC314BDFAB9C8D9BCB0169BC46976667BDB2D975E877D83094AB721BB585FA6A160E38B","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b11af012-cc92-49fa-a18a-57f86ca76696"},{"objectId":"5e7094a0878c28a0473c0a85","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Bachorz","uuid":"99D38A7B84E67C8E97FB6073557E6D453AE4F5766853196A832BC1785B6BAA07555D4AD557D884FC674E08992122FD741FE9136200115552FF87EFDF1EDE0547","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ea5271c3-da55-429d-835b-323cdc38a635"},{"objectId":"5e709326878c28a0473a3b52","name":"Iwona","lastName":"Karwaciak","uuid":"07DCCCF633946D0D382FA333B03FA29532E8FAABCE8B31805A354A7069B3E181D2C04FE9EBA0FE5499A48BB2418D45D0FD64AAD6E3B93DCBE6C29AEA62DC47E9","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"0c2307a8-e439-4e83-97a9-8842d78c5e45"},{"objectId":"5e709325878c28a0473a3b0d","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Ratajewski","uuid":"B1291B914CCBBB6C14FBE1C256BB487B869EF5824C470D3BC8E042F7037B0D9B1804950A658997EE241528D9DD362A0B61F1CE4E6FA15E8A2174837A8745BE4F","orcidId":"0000-0001-5391-5843","documentHash":"ebcf4e46-75f1-4c03-8489-9f1302e03e9f"},{"objectId":"5e7092d8878c28a04739de9d","name":"Anna","lastName":"Sałkowska","uuid":"DA9A4C69FA7D8B0BD6B07187A06C61FB2083E34F29908EF7E64B000054F258198BB36B88124A64B310B10A1A32ED0F6FA6DA6B3E4EF9C529977B4429B4C432C5","orcidId":"0000-0002-3607-2888","documentHash":"0bbe42c9-0ed8-4e05-a232-08e015ef999f"},{"objectId":"5e7092b9878c28a04739b7b0","name":"Kaja","lastName":"Karaś","uuid":"110929C60656ECB7DEF1B7327306C4A1680CE63A323B4B9EFC79C2D5852151F2A150F830C5734163364197B896C5894F11CFBF8ECADE2E4D9A286BFAD04BD0DA","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"f79970e8-a9cd-47f4-bdb0-ee79e36c8324"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms23031906"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e7091c6878c28a047388f27","uid":"bAF74zUJTi86T5oCEcTdxGw","uuid":"98954672-07a7-4fdc-b974-3697ae357a44","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Katedra Inżynierii Środowiska i Geodezji","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709434878c28a0473b825a"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Reliability and efficiency of the removal of pollutants in the mechanical–biological wastewater treatment plant A2/O","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4b878c28514547791a","mniswId":"4958","title":"Desalination and Water Treatment","doi":null,"issn":"1944-3994","eissn":"1944-3986","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"WOS","editor":null,"documentHash":"2339c17f-baf6-49b2-bc77-aaa736e408b7"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62ce95f04097075e7c663fdd","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709434878c28a0473b825a","639af95a40970723128422a5"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The aim of the research was to determine the efficiency and reliability of the removal of pollutants\r\nfrom wastewater by the mechanical–biological treatment plant A2/O. The system disposed of\r\non average 4,000–5,000 m3\r\n/d of wastewater, of which about 320 m3\r\n/d was industrial wastewater.\r\nThe evaluation was based on data from 5 y (2015–2019) of the work of this facility. The following pollution indicators were analyzed: biochemical demand for oxygen (BOD5\r\n), chemical oxygen\r\ndemand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP). The efficiency of wastewater treatment during the period under study was good. The pollutant reduction\r\ncoefficients averaged over the years 2015–2019 were: for TSS – 95%, for BOD5\r\n – 98%, COD – 93%\r\nfor TN – 82%, and TP – 88%. The results of the Weibull-based reliability analysis in the case of TSS\r\nand COD indicated that the treatment plant analyzed during the whole test period worked with\r\nhigh efficiency. The study showed that in the case of BOD5\r\n there were 25 d in the year in which the\r\nlimit may be exceeded. Studies have shown that 44% of collected samples of treated wastewater\r\nexceeded total nitrogen concentrations of 15 mg/L. Thus, effluent discharged to the receiver from\r\nthe treatment plant analyzed, on approximately 160 d during a year total nitrogen concentrations\r\nare above limit values. On this basis, it can be concluded that the treatment plant under examination\r\ndoes not comply with the requirements of the Regulation for almost half of the year. The cause of\r\nthis condition is the instability of nitrification and denitrification processes which are responsible\r\nfor the removal of nitrogen compounds in a biological reactor. In the case of the treatment plant\r\nunder consideration, the reliability of the removal of general phosphorus on 55 d/y is reduced, thus\r\nthe values obtained during these days are at a level that does not meet the reliability requirements."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199975","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"246","pagesFromTo":"120-138","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.deswater.com/vol.php?vol=246&oth=246|0|January%20|2022","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"639af95a40970723128422a5","name":"Zbigniew","lastName":"Wasąg","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"27893613-80d4-4a25-af89-b31177ef4305"},{"objectId":"5e709434878c28a0473b825a","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Gizińska-Górna","uuid":"46DAA0D4CD1A6B464BE4A65FDD145CEAFA9E6793CA80BEB88A90FFAF0F3985E518A4C5F251DA2852BA30E268AC7BFBD7828C31C01D5025F27263B6067FB49C40","orcidId":"0000-0002-3943-0249","documentHash":"07088799-c353-46ee-8e9a-d042ac17c2ed"}],"doi":"10.5004/dwt.2022.28006"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["quality","arch","stairs","masonry","vault","TLS","management","clay brick","light detection and ranging (LiDAR)"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","uid":"bsTIibl14j-FXDX1as_pUTA","uuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","parentUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de8f","rootUuid":"e089e89f-100d-4446-96ca-e31f5d670002","name":"Zachodniopomorski Uniwersytet Technologiczny w Szczecinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709302878c28a0473a0ffa","5e7094af878c28a0473c1b3d"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","uid":"bbm_l1g8J7H140nrLv2yooQ","uuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","parentUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de68","rootUuid":"2499ad34-4d7a-48d2-8a89-7695b0f00427","name":"Politechnika Morska w Szczecinie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092ab878c28a04739a546"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Research and TLS (LiDAR) Construction Diagnostics of Clay Brick Masonry Arched Stairs","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c285145478d84","mniswId":"13965","title":"Materials","doi":null,"issn":"1996-1944","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"b9595294-0784-475f-a04c-38770c2329b5"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_REPOSITORY","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-01-12","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":{"indexedJournal":false,"isReview":false,"wosConference":false},"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62d008b040970733e7969ff9","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709302878c28a0473a0ffa","6576cfbc4097071b8ef9f467","5e7092ab878c28a04739a546","5e7094af878c28a0473c1b3d"]},"issue":"2","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The study presents the terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) diagnostic of the clay brick masonry arched staircase in a historic building.

The conducted experimental investigations showed that the key element responsible for the actual load-bearing capacity and stiffness of this type of stair flights were the treads above the masonry arch."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199980","journalIssue":{"objectId":"61e1cce32467f00328313fea","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"15","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"6feccc50-4f6d-4a2d-a4de-8b8445857aea"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"15","pagesFromTo":"552","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1944/15/2/552","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6576cfbc4097071b8ef9f467","name":"Tomasz","lastName":"Kania","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"644d1b6b-adfa-4611-90bf-c32246240f52"},{"objectId":"5e7094af878c28a0473c1b3d","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Ekiert","uuid":"A71EF22CD65F26D34EFB2C5635B72ADC74BE05962AAD74D582A1336863ED56802F0FA50F394CEA92C8D68546630D3E5883E7412990C8D228254EF492AF707228","orcidId":"0000-0002-8403-2119","documentHash":"f41cd233-3610-4c57-be5d-82f52b148acd"},{"objectId":"5e709302878c28a0473a0ffa","name":"Rafał","lastName":"Nowak","uuid":"DBD3B88B8844D71E820B3493ADBFFA72F69F41787B694E930B07D8139B632321F4E9E764C8AD6D60E7DA44D29F46B7B82F17E6E28C150C7FD0D3F924695E1A39","orcidId":"0000-0001-8903-6322","documentHash":"bc8bc8b8-a7de-4374-92ab-b2799b600808"},{"objectId":"5e7092ab878c28a04739a546","name":"RADOSŁAW","lastName":"RUTKOWSKI","uuid":"7F99F8449AD37AA6099F83B45C1EAAA681CA8B232EA0EDFE57AD1069A35B5788CDC2ED0F615FB0C66308AAA9D1F6E40C38C45CF759090CDE36E0749CC4397358","orcidId":"0000-0002-0067-6751","documentHash":"7d7c01f7-d42b-4148-bfc8-5e75f2193a3b"}],"doi":"10.3390/ma15020552"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["humanizacja","humanizacja stechnicyzowanego świata","ulepszanie człowieka","rewolucja przemysłowa 4.0","rewolucja przemysłowa 5.0"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Humanizacja w duchu Industry 5.0 a nowy humanizm","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":{"objectId":"5e7171af46e0fb0001cdfe39","mniswId":null,"title":"Kurier Wnet.

At  the  same  time, considerably  less  attention is  paid  to the so-called  green competitive-ness. Considering a global trend searching for solutions to reduce the environmental impact of the agricultural sector, it seems reasonable to explore the overlap between economic competitiveness and green competitiveness. Purpose of the article: This study aims to answer the following questions: What is the level of economic  and green  competitiveness  of  agriculture  in  respective countries?  What  is  the  level of the comprehensive competitiveness of agriculture in EU member states?  Do the economic com-petitiveness outcomes of respective countries coincide with their green competitiveness rankings?

This structure has a fibro-spongy character but it undergoes constant\r\nmodifications throughout its existence depending on many internal and external factors. ZP consists of\r\nglycoproteins marked as ZP1, ZP2, ZP3 and ZP4, the presence of which is species different. ZP1 and probably\r\nZP4 molecules stabilize the fibrillary skeleton of the zona pellucida formed of ZP2 and ZP3 protein polymers\r\nwhich are ligands for specific spermatozoid receptors. The oligosaccharide chains of ZP3 are responsible for the\r\nprimary attachment of the male gamete which induces the acrosomal reaction. ZP2 enhances this connection\r\nby secondary binding to an acrosome-free spermatozoid. Additionally, oviductal specific glycoprotein 1 which\r\nplays a role in interspecific oocyte-sperm interactions, appears around the postovulatory oocyte surrounded\r\nby ZP. In addition, this protein modifies the resistance of ZP to the action of proteases released as a result of\r\nthe cortical reaction during polyspermia block. After fertilization, ZP not only protects the egg and then the\r\nembryo until implantation, but also has an embryotrophic effect. Understanding the molecular basics of the\r\nstructure and properties of ZP can significantly improve animal fertility as well as reproductive rates."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058199994","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"78","pagesFromTo":"121-125","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://www.medycynawet.edu.pl/images/stories/pdf/pdf2022/032022/2022036626.pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"5e709292878c28a04739836c","name":"Karol","lastName":"Rycerz","uuid":"28907147470DF46A462744D81FF07F72E5F1ADB47A79A330763538D1D5EFDF4F758EE1CA511BE97D61DCA3ED99A34C4D0E61CCE414AB0E050E81586CE4DA07A6","orcidId":"0000-0002-1342-2558","documentHash":"2aade148-5ea2-4d20-9d5a-b2a690098aed"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390964","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Krawczyk","uuid":"31876B1421716471B7860A7A5CBD496E7457F31A61BDA02208C3DC20853EDE670FB4D6D18FF75794EB5A2DF419A8342412531F04A03B7C653CFDCA85817FB39A","orcidId":"0000-0002-5986-2938","documentHash":"8450ac7a-19c5-4e83-822e-530109a9631a"},{"objectId":"5e709224878c28a047390926","name":"Jadwiga","lastName":"Jaworska-Adamu","uuid":"636A890A7A70D6638A7E8244114ECC0516CF49E7E775D78010280F67FED632049A09EBC3E04D2273068C28C90FB46BF45EFE248B5D188BF4230F7F48EE5894EE","orcidId":"0000-0002-8639-7429","documentHash":"3b0e17b4-64d8-4d13-8ef5-55a559e6f9c7"}],"doi":"10.21521/mw.6626"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"pol","keywords":["Nature based tourism","Environment","Economy","Culture","Impact","Management"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737df16","uid":"bGsGbkZIR0c31dlpYIgFXJA","uuid":"76b7738a-266e-4ba8-acb5-41abd6ab009a","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","parentUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de14","rootUuid":"511d4dfc-574e-4801-af14-e99dc24f8209","name":"Wydział Geografii i Studiów Regionalnych","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709253878c28a047393bdf"]},{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","uid":"bhdVW0TkXv39ZSgac65mGnw","uuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","parentUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de46","rootUuid":"0b80a072-b734-4cd9-bf5b-6c8708b7c2f2","name":"Uniwersytet Komisji Edukacji Narodowej w Krakowie","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709291878c28a047398148"]},{"id":"5e709196878c28a04737f921","uid":"b1oK4CitSBwnR2Ia985v-lw","uuid":"b890e7ed-25f7-4907-a412-d1d3a77c331c","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","parentUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1e","rootUuid":"b5db43b9-b076-4a54-8075-1642b7c9fe89","name":"Wydział Nauk Przyrodniczych","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709460878c28a0473bbc58"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Himalayan nature-based tourism.

Sensitive to outside influences, the Himalayan environment of mountain areas has been abruptly exposed to it. The authorities of the Himalayan countries try to conserve them and currently, there are 126 areas under protection. However, due to economic and social reasons in the Himalayan countries, there is currently no possibility of realizing a comprehensive, rational and balanced approach to nature protection and tourism in the region. The reconciliation of two functions, namely nature protection and tourism, is the main challenge for all levels of management of protected areas – from the administration of specific parks or reserves to government administration. Results showed that regional and political diversity of the entire area, limited logistic, economic and technical possibilities, and often the lack of a uniform concept and strategy of actions, result in numerous and diverse problems. These include the state of the natural environment within protected areas and the trends in the changes (degradation, pollution, natural hazards), the impact of tourism on local communities (transformation of economic activities, mentality, ‘tourist-local resident’ relations), management (no long-term development plans, tensions on the ‘government- local communities’ line, poorly and unevenly developed tourist infrastructure, inefficient control system), etc. At the end of the paper, directions for action are indicated that could contribute to increasing the effectiveness of nature protection in the Himalayan Mountain areas in the face of growing tourist pressure.\nNote: This is the second part of the two-set paper about the tourism in the Himalayan PAs.

In addition, the compromised quality of information fails to protect it and provide the speed of information transmission and density of access channels.\n\nIt has been proven that reducing the level of electromagnetic radiation is the main method of ensuring noise immunity in wireless mobile communication systems of infocommunication systems. Therefore, one way to ensure the stable interference-free operation is to reduce the level of the information signal at the receiver input to the noise level when the signal/noise ratio is equal to one.\n\nThis paper reports the results of studying methods and models with correlation reception of ultra-wideband signals. It is proved that according to the level of potential noise immunity, the best indicators are shown by the model of encoding an ultra-wideband information signal by phase manipulation, followed by the coding model with opposite chips, and the code-time manipulation model.\n\nIt is shown that with a large base of the signal B>300 when the intensity of the received signals is below the level of interference, reliable transmission of information is carried out with a probability of error of less than 10-6. This proves that the use of ultra-wide signal technology allows for wireless hidden transmission of information with low radiation power and a low probability of error. Thus, at a speed of 12 Mb/s, it is possible to chain the transmission of information with a probability of error less than 10-6 if there is a large signal base used, B

this study, nutraceutical properties of fruit juice and seeds, which are important for human health, of green (Kabarcik, Cavus), red (red Globe) and black (Honusu, Yildiz, Yediveren and Helvani) skin colored grape cultivars grown in same ecological conditions were investigated. Harvest period, number of seeds, cluster form, cluster weight, berry weight, berry color and usage area were determined as morphological parameters. The Folin-Ciocalteu method was used for total phenol content analysis. The total antioxidant status of juices and seeds of grape cultivars have been determined by 2,2–diphenyl−1–picryl-hydrazyl–hydrate (DPPH), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assays. Seeds of all grape cultivars exhibited higher nutraceuticals than fruit juices. Total phenolic content of seed samples was found to be quite variable in range of 1.90 mg GAE/g (cv. Yildiz)–3.46 mg GAE/g (cv. Honusu) fresh weight base (FW), indicating 2 folds of differences between green and black grape cultivars.

It was found that an increase in pressure from 0.1 to 1.0 MPa gradually increased the conversion degree from 44.1 % to 56.5. An increase in pressure of the FTS process in conditions of aerosol catalysis from 0.1 to 1.0 MPa contributed to a stable yield growth from 14 to 17 %. Selectivity reached its maximum value of 93.1 % at a pressure of 0.3 MPa. Dependence of selectivity on the catalyst MCA intensity was characterized by the constant growth of selectivity of carbon monoxide conversion to hydrocarbons with an increase in MCA frequency from 4 to 8.5 Hz while maximum selectivity reached 91 %. With a further increase in MCA frequency to 11.2 Hz, a decrease (to 83.5 %) in the value of selectivity of carbon monoxide conversion to hydrocarbon products in the FTS process was observed. Therefore, it was recommended to consider the value of the MCA frequency from 6 to 10 Hz as an acceptable range. Maximum yield (73 wt %) of hydrocarbon fraction with a chain length from 5 to 6 carbon atoms was observed for a pressure of 0.3 MPa. The minimum yield was 35 wt % for a pressure of 1.2 MPa. At other pressure values (0.1–0.2 and 0.4–1.1 MPa) of experimental studies, the yield of this fraction varied within 38–52 wt %.

Due to their molecular homology and similar clinical application, both drugs are often regarded as interchangeable. Despite their unique mechanism of action the studies designed for observation and comparison of the prolonged activity of these drugs are rare. (2) Methods: The short-time (20–72 h) and long-term (up to 20 days) anti-cancer activity of decitabine and azacitidine has been studied in colorectal cancer cells. We observe the impact on cell culture’s viability, clonogenicity, proliferation, and expression of CDKN1A, CCND1, MDM2, MYC, CDKN2A, GLB1 genes, and activity of SA-β-galactosidase. (3) Results: Decitabine has much stronger anti-clonogenic activity than azacitidine. We show that azacitidine, despite significant immediate toxicity, has negligible long-term effects. Contrary, decitabine, which does not exert initial toxicity, profoundly worsened the condition of the cells over time. On the 13th day after treatment, the viability of cells was decreased and proliferation inhibited. These functional changes were accompanied by up-regulation of expression CDKN1A, CCND1, and CDKN2A genes and increased activation of SA-β-galactosidase, indicating cellular senescence. (4) Conclusions: Our head-to-head comparison revealed profound differences in the activities of decitabine and azacitidine important in their anti-cancer potential and clinical application. The effects of decitabine need relatively long time to develop. This property is crucial for proper design of studies and therapy concerning decitabine and undermines opinion about the similar therapeutic mechanism and interchangeability of these drugs."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058200032","journalIssue":{"objectId":"624eb13f2467f009a40dea79","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"14","number":"6","doi":null,"documentHash":"7c80c9e8-f947-4f46-9d9c-e6c7ce3ba70d"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"14","pagesFromTo":"1530","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/14/6/1530/pdf","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"631090ba409707291a60e6bc","name":"Alicja","lastName":"Pawlak","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"6e85e65d-f02a-4745-8b64-880d0837994a"},{"objectId":"60c2fde69543c723365437cc","name":"Kinga","lastName":"Godkowicz","uuid":"B16AC41FDEEE4367B7D6FCF1FCCFCD95B2D8F0D6B13ED8CDBE562385E5EAC7DC10B4869327D1E38FE0D7EF308EB9770831E67CF21C16088D292384DE886A329D","orcidId":"0000-0003-3046-7595","documentHash":"c24813a5-ffc0-4cc7-9207-e6bdb82951d2"},{"objectId":"5e70949c878c28a0473c05d2","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Zioło","uuid":"F444B87ACE94425A1640C1FDA5FF265FB949D6DF8BC70496F11EAD1DF5C401A0F03C2DE176021BAB7DCC9350A500EFC63BD6B6A1C9EBF8009AF0ED89DA618255","orcidId":"0000-0002-1439-8975","documentHash":"d02cf1d2-c7af-409b-bb15-a9877fbee18d"},{"objectId":"5e70928e878c28a047397dd9","name":"Wojciech","lastName":"Kałas","uuid":"63AA92CA104AA9ACBF56E9F99AAF0AD2165E36368420263A8E1655D60D24E5E046AA2716E9C4EF2019C98FDFAD5A72CBBCD52AFAD48C2547605BF7C111AF8128","orcidId":"0000-0003-2656-5192","documentHash":"affc067c-041d-4a6f-8064-10f255e2556d"},{"objectId":"5e709288878c28a047397733","name":"Leon","lastName":"Strządała","uuid":"4167C87E7663BF1D93501EA3CED9578582549F233982646F6D19C08FA34796BF4D5B6C71BC8EE2F8176EBC7D01DBC4714C7AFDB63E573A8C8B01AE408447298C","orcidId":"0000-0002-7323-2254","documentHash":"41ac8305-be72-46c9-b632-fa41201406e9"}],"doi":"10.3390/cancers14061530"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"619eee587523402fabdeb186","uid":"bpyDMJks_pbq-m8ouLLylhw","uuid":"e3afe24a-8d04-4a69-add5-36d14df6e5bc","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","parentUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de39","rootUuid":"bc05e3e9-35c4-47a4-be34-d13dd35fd0bf","name":"Katedra Technologii Żywności Pochodzenia Zwierzęcego","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e709225878c28a0473909f8","5e709463878c28a0473bc10e"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitory peptides generated in dry-cured pork loin during aging and gastrointestinal digestion","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d4e878c2851454790a2","mniswId":"15295","title":"Nutrients","doi":null,"issn":"2072-6643","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"IMPORT","editor":null,"documentHash":"249ff7e0-f443-46aa-b5c4-21f8cf400d2e"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-11","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62ce809f4097075e7c65703a","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e709225878c28a0473909f8","5e709463878c28a0473bc10e"]},"issue":"4","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The ability of peptides from an aqueous and salt-soluble protein extract of dry-cured pork loins to inhibit the action of dipeptidyl peptidase IV was determined.

properties and thermal conductivity of epoxy composites reinforced with recycled clamshell container waste as a micro filler (RCCF) were studied. The studies have been carried out to identify the influence of the two variables, the heating time periods (HT) within the range of 2, 4, 6 min., and wt % within the range of 1 %, 2 %, 4 % of recycled clamshell container waste that has been used as a reinforcing filler of epoxy composites. Recycling polyurethane waste aims to control and maintain a pollution-free environment, which is currently considered a difficult issue in addition to achieving low-cost aspects in preparing the composites. According to the method of no-combustion heating, the clamshell waste was converted from the natural plastic state into solids that were later made into 75 μm micro filler by grinding. Composites were ranked using grey relational analysis (GRA). The effect of each control parameter on response variables was analyzed by the Taguchi method. Using MINITAB 19 software, regression equations were obtained for each variable of mechanical properties and thermal conductivity to predict the properties of epoxy composites. The results of the addition of recycled clamshell container waste to epoxy resin show an improvement in the mechanical properties and thermal conductivity of the composites. The optimal value of the two factors was at HT2wt2, i.e. HT and wt % of 4 min and 2 %, respectively. The optimization values for the bending strength, impact strength, tensile strength, stiffness and thermal conductivity are 68.2 MPa, 10.348 kJ/m2, 21.08 MPa, 80 Shore D and 0.504 W/m·C°, respectively. The proposed Taguchi methodology based on grey relational analysis has been shown to be effective in solving multi-feature decision-making

objective of the paper is to analyse changes in the new farm tractor market in Poland and the annual income of farmers’ households gener-ated  in the  same period.  The  studies covered  the period  from 2010  to 2020. The new farm tractors market was analysed with reference to the number of sold tractors, which was measured by the number of regis-trations.  The  paper  considers  quarterly  seasonality  of  sale  along  with demand  for  selected  producers  and  engine-power  categories  of  new farm tractors sold in Poland. By “new tractors” the authors mean those registered for the first time in Poland and manufactured in the same or the  preceding  year.  In  2010-2020,  there  were  over  148,000 new  farm tractors registered in Poland. The highest number of tractors sold was recorded  in 2012, the  lowest  in  2016.  Tractors  from  Western  Europe, USA, and Japan predominate on the Polish market. Among new vehi-cles,  the  highest  number  registered  in  the  investigated  period  consti-tuted New Holland (23,780) tractors, followed by John Deere (19,453), Zetor  (16,398),  Deutz-Fahr  (10,508),  and  Kubota  (7,674).  The  total share of these producers in 2010-2020 amounted to approx. 58%. With regard  to  the  engine-power  categories  in the  analysed  period, tractors with power of 37-73 kW and 74-132 kW (33.85%) constituted the larg-est  proportion  (49.07%).  An  increased  interest  in  tractors  with  power below 36 kW was also observed from 2016 to 2020. Such vehicles ac-counted  for  10%  of  all  registrations. The  general  trend  related  to  the volume  of  average  annual  income  is  not  consistent  with  the  trend  of purchasing new farm tractors, while the highest number of registrations was  recorded  during  the  period  in  which  inflation  rates  reached  their highest values."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058200050","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"26","pagesFromTo":"65-79","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciendo.com/article/10.2478/agriceng-2022-0006","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"63d3b94e4097071d34c39c33","name":"Alexandros

paper undertakes analysis of the dynamic impact of a rail vehicle on various types of a railway infrastructure with particular focus on the phenomenon of threshold effect within the transition zones of an engineering facility. The problem of locally variable stiffness of the railway infrastructure, which in turn could lead to the accelerated infrastructure degradation, is identified. Using the analytical and numerical background, the computational model is presented, based on which, it could be possible to determine the impact of the various rail support on the dynamic response of the entire infrastructure. The dynamic load, caused by the passage of the multiaxle rail vehicle, is taken into account in the paper. The fourth-order differential equation is solved by using the finite differences method with application of the numerical MATLAB script. The created numerical algorithm and a number of calculations allowed the formulation of several solutions that could reduce the dynamic impact of the rail vehicle on the railway surface within the transition zones. In the paper, theoretical results are compared to the field measurements conducted on a real dynamically loaded rail. Field experiments have been carried out on the railway track in operation. The vertical displacement of a rail, dynamically loaded by various types of rail vehicles passing by (both passenger and freight trains) has been investigated. Researches have been carried out in the area of transition zones of engineering facilities. Test points have been selected in places where there is a sudden change in parameters of the track structure (e.g., a change from concrete sleepers to wooden sleepers).

The presence of microplastics in the human body can carry serious health risks, such as biological reactions e.g. inflammation, genotoxicity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, as well toxic compounds leaching of unbound chemicals/monomers, free radicals or adsorbed organic pollutants, which mainly depend on the properties of the ingested plastic. Plastics are exposed to different substances (e.g., enzymes and acids) in the digestive system, which potentially affects their properties and structure. By stimulating the human digestive system and applying a set of advanced analytical tools, we showed that the surface of polystyrene and high-density polyethylene plastics frequently in contact with food undergoes fundamental changes during digestion. This results in the appearance of additional functional groups, and consequent increase in the plastic adsorption capacity for hydrophobic ionic compounds (such as triclosan and diclofenac) while reducing its adsorption capacity for hydrophobic non-ionic compounds (such as phenanthrene). Micro- and nanostructures that formed on the flat surface of the plastics after digestion were identified using scanning electron microscopy. These structures became defragmented and detached due to mechanical action, increasing micro- and nanoplastics in the environment. Due to their size, the release of plastic nanostructures after digestion can become an “accidental food source” for a wider group of aquatic organisms and ultimately for humans as the last link in the food chain. This, combined with improved adsorption capacity of digested plastics to hydrophobic ionic pollutants, can pose a serious threat to the environment including human health and safety."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058200104","journalIssue":{"objectId":"65844ed74097075aba69f160","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"843","number":"","doi":"","documentHash":"371d01dd-6d43-40af-b114-c84837aea571"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"843","pagesFromTo":"157108","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972204205X?via%3Dihub","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62ce934a4097075e7c6635f8","name":"Patryk","lastName":"Oleszczuk","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"7a38a2f1-b7c2-4dc8-9fdd-48c280be84d7"},{"objectId":"62ce934a4097075e7c6635f7","name":"Yong","lastName":"Sik Ok","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b45af2ac-cae2-4ea2-a0e6-75c27d55a2a0"},{"objectId":"62ce934a4097075e7c6635f6","name":"Monika","lastName":"Rek","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"5c8a4bfc-682e-4b81-aa29-f4e04333651c"},{"objectId":"62ce934a4097075e7c6635f5","name":"Bożena","lastName":"Czech","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"ec67616f-f510-4d6a-a784-496ce45000fa"},{"objectId":"62ce934a4097075e7c6635f3","name":"Patrycja","lastName":"Krasucka","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"b1868a42-2c6c-4ba2-84c5-0df72daf55f1"},{"objectId":"5e7094f6878c28a0473c8129","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Baranowska-Wójcik","uuid":"BA2D6DEBB1BBBD6D95BAC304E9982353FA480B4DB5882F3A3CFB013A4618AE1953003159ECCD9FD190912FC1B3CBCF76E20510270E3E6B27AFFC8B84449F401A","orcidId":"0000-0002-2213-9631","documentHash":"a7c57d2c-4362-4ba4-80ae-5d1c6d99230f"},{"objectId":"5e709349878c28a0473a669e","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Bogusz","uuid":"A111BEF12812564F12586E605A52ECE5E56CFC9E84EF2027CA8C5A75C37A1B18B4E7BC7EF13E920023FCE937B51581C3B78E74165585B889E6B92A27358CFB98","orcidId":"0000-0002-5218-381X","documentHash":"2eabd201-0e72-43cb-a383-7e0116520cc5"},{"objectId":"5e709225878c28a047390a14","name":"Dominik","lastName":"Szwajgier","uuid":"FC3B771A10A3781B4F4E1194A7C97404AB57B0EFDD54780C2672965F1EAADAD8A02CE2FB71BD3F1A618F69F4DE5B3B2804E8AF55365EF2801AABCD5F29706A5A","orcidId":"0000-0002-2285-0669","documentHash":"c58e475b-6319-46ba-b3b4-8ada5048c401"}],"doi":null},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["radiation","environmental situation in Japan","nuclear power plant (NPP)","Fukushima","environment","sampling"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"623722b72467f0495b044d13","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Zhetysu State University named after Ilyas Zhansugurov","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623722b72467f0495b044d16"]},{"id":"61ee99f92467f0689140ac1a","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"Kazakh Leading Academy of Architecture and Civil Engineering","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["623722b72467f0495b044d15","623722b72467f0495b044d14"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Radiation environmental situation in Japan, 10 years after the accident at the nuclear power plant \"Fukushima-1\"","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d52878c285145479db1","mniswId":"22093","title":"EasternEuropean Journal of Enterprise Technologies","doi":null,"issn":"1729-3774","eissn":"1729-4061","websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"d5f01e20-db1a-4239-bd94-6786886de8f3"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":false,"openAccess":{"mode":"OPEN_JOURNAL","textVersion":"FINAL_PUBLISHED","license":"CC_BY","releaseDate":"2022-02-25","releaseDateMonth":null,"releaseDateYear":null,"releaseDateMode":"AT_PUBLICATION","months":null},"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"623722b72467f0495b044d11","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["623722b72467f0495b044d14","623722b72467f0495b044d15","623722b72467f0495b044d16"]},"issue":"10(115)","abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"This paper reports the results of environmental studies conducted in May‒June 2021 in 16 prefectures of Japan, over which radioactive clouds spread as a result of the accident at the Fukushima-1 nuclear power plant in March 2011, namely: Aomori, Miyagi, Fukushima, Niigata, Ishikawa, Ibaraki, Kanagawa, Shizuoka, Osaka, Kyoto, Okayama, Tottore, Shimane, Kagoshima, Nagasaki, and Ehime. Some effects of the impact of accidental emissions of BWR-3 and BWR-4 reactors on the environment in the settlements neighboring the Fukushima-1 nuclear power plant were summed up. The methods of conducting research are described, starting with a sampling of environmental objects in the above prefectures (atmospheric air, soil, vegetation, agricultural products, sea and ocean water, and aquatic fauna) and sample preparation up to measurements and data processing to obtain results and their subsequent analysis. A comparison of the results of research with the volumes of emissions of radioactive substances due to the normal operation of various objects for the use of atomic energy was carried out. Conclusions are drawn about the medium-term (after 10 years) consequences of the nuclear accident at the Fukushima-1 nuclear power plant.\n\nThe maximum background radiation equal to 2 µmSv/h observed at point No. 83, 20 km from the Fukushima-1 nuclear power plant, will not lead to irradiation of a person with doses exceeding the permissible limits if the time of his stay at the reference point is limited to 1.36 hours per day. The concentration of cesium-137 in the water of Japanese waters does not exceed the level of the radiation factor, upon reaching which protective intervention is necessary. The maximum specific activity of cesium-137, detected in soil and vegetation samples near the Fukushima-1 nuclear power plant, does not exceed the maximum specific activity (MZUA). In Japan as a whole, the specific activity of radionuclides in soils used for agricultural production and livestock grazing does not exceed the levels of global pollution."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058200106","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62371c532467f0495b043ddb","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"10 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"00866e92-d0a0-418a-ae61-252ac34eb210"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"41-47","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/252944/250697","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"623722b72467f0495b044d16","name":"Meruyert","lastName":"Turlybekova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8591-0051","documentHash":"eb6a9556-c4f0-4c99-a9be-0a9d293ca51b"},{"objectId":"623722b72467f0495b044d15","name":"Gulzhanar","lastName":"Zharaspaeva","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7697-1327","documentHash":"5eeda845-ad60-4614-97e9-088618710bf6"},{"objectId":"623722b72467f0495b044d14","name":"Roza","lastName":"Zhumagulova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-7779-111X","documentHash":"5f12c05d-e140-43f7-b033-7e8c414f2344"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.252944"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["migration","migration policy","human capital","regional development","peripheral regions"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918e878c28a04737e44c","uid":"bOsTJEvmlvq1TPV2NgBPXuw","uuid":"75fdfd10-8c3b-4407-8102-72c611142d0e","parentId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","parentUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","rootId":"5e70918a878c28a04737de1a","rootUuid":"a013df22-d5c5-4871-849c-69e8c6e7e912","name":"Wydział Nauk o Ziemi i Gospodarki Przestrzennej","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e7092f8878c28a0473a040d"]}],"type":"ARTICLE","title":"Towards a Better Future of Peripheries: Regional Migration Policy","mainLanguage":"eng","journal":{"objectId":"5e6f7d50878c285145479bfe","mniswId":"20876","title":"Annales - Universitatis Mariae Curie-Sklodowska, Sectio B","doi":null,"issn":"0137-1983","eissn":null,"websiteLink":null,"metadataSource":"SCOPUS","editor":null,"documentHash":"6faecc49-f50e-4616-b240-a62ffc7a55b6"},"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"62383df72467f067af119c43","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092f8878c28a0473a040d"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"eng","content":"The peripheral regions are areas in need of development support.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of long-term nutrition education for 3- to 6-year-olds on parental nutrition knowledge. Methods: The study was conducted as part of the “Colorful Eating is Healthy Eating” nutrition education program that has been implemented in kindergartens in Lublin since 2016.\r\nA total of 11 kindergartens were involved in this stage of the program, and 733 parents consented to participate in the project. The study was divided into three stages. In the first stage all parents completed a questionnaire containing 54 items. In the next stage, 211 children from four randomly selected kindergartens participated in the “Colorful Eating Is Healthy Eating” educational program that lasted 7 months. In the third stage of the study, the parents of children who had completed the 7-month educational program and the parents of control group children once again completed the questionnaire. Results: A positive outcome of the educational program was that it contributed to a decrease in the consumption of sweetened hot beverages (p = 0.005) and an increase in water intake (p = 0.001). The nutrition education program was also successful in reducing the consumption of sweets. Children’s education improved the parents’ knowledge about dietary sources of fiber and the\r\nrecommended fiber intake, and it contributed to the awareness that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. The program did not enhance the parents’ knowledge about snacking between meals or the role of sweetened beverages in dental caries, overweight and obesity. Conclusions: Long-term multi-stage nutrition education for children aged 3 to 6 years can be helpful in shaping families’ eating habits and improving parental nutrition knowledge.

Two crystal phases are confirmed, and one of them is the conformationally disordered (CONDIS) phase. Complexity of the melt crystallization process is revealed by the analysis with Friedman’s isoconversional method. The melt crystallization of 3F5FPhH6 shows different mechanisms depending on temperature, which is explained by the relation between the thermodynamic driving force and the thermal energy of translational degrees of freedom. The studied compound crystallizes even during fast cooling (30 K/min), unlike similar compounds with different fluorosubstitutions of the benzene ring, which form the smectic glass for moderate cooling rates. The tendency to vitrification of the smectic phase decreases apparently with the decreasing stability width of the $SmC_{A}$* phase and the increasing relaxation time of the collective relaxation process in this phase, at least for homologues differing from 3F5FPhH6 only by the type of fluorosubstitution."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058200113","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"126","pagesFromTo":"6547–6561","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://ruj.uj.edu.pl/xmlui/handle/item/299172","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"602cb61a9543c7410626e22c","name":"Marcin","lastName":"Piwowarczyk","uuid":"A5DEC2CAD417F80D8757A151A051C02510F74D5F5898CEF8CAFA116FBF842F2F9390B170F749542D88E512C88CC165E68D28031E99070C26EDBC81F96C8494AA","orcidId":"0000-0001-9882-3643","documentHash":"c3e124fd-96e8-4770-be5e-73f748a1544f"},{"objectId":"5e709404878c28a0473b4e24","name":"Małgorzata","lastName":"Jasiurkowska-Delaporte","uuid":"A02127F9A4F067BA315CC43C7683DD400E0F9793863F36F60A280E8CAA0A8D2D06946EAFD927E1F00CF1C325DEFE63E266FD175AA5F214971DF8BE0F38B4BB96","orcidId":"0000-0002-7897-3254","documentHash":"5cd30070-9a57-4d51-ae2d-53c2d7426371"},{"objectId":"5e7093ca878c28a0473b0c91","name":"Anna","lastName":"Drzewicz","uuid":"20D2E90B3C555F9B8D07BE4A8861676CEF0E46743EE6EA85C735EC3BFA38FE7660995034FFFBE4A812AB58140A2119A29137CE287E875DD5ED5935EB36692976","orcidId":"0000-0002-1483-5645","documentHash":"5e21388c-1c92-4fef-b935-6236e7fa8172"},{"objectId":"5e70932d878c28a0473a46e7","name":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Deptuch","uuid":"166D5155BD56A6C2A215A5F70D83344F48317C089588A7F0B15B00F71764A5B93E1A5D7019079C58DD171651A783F4A80DCA6413382A56C2A9F6BE4F9892607D","orcidId":"0000-0002-7451-5563","documentHash":"011abbc7-477c-4189-aba8-363067b2485f"},{"objectId":"5e709316878c28a0473a2973","name":"Stanisław","lastName":"Baran","uuid":"8773C6805C24B37BC0D4562BC824878FFF23761120B91D7B2242FEAFCC14B585E511D84BA4EE367EAC2263A3CE9402F0CA78BD33859844E18ADE0418988F5372","orcidId":null,"documentHash":"29007d57-31bf-4a11-88aa-389926cb1e55"},{"objectId":"5e7092cf878c28a04739d261","name":"Ewa","lastName":"Juszyńska-Gałązka","uuid":"4F7A4118E9A5D685AC1C1A2D8276CE16D2B4A7BCAAA830FB97252F20527039BB7820591E8D1FC780FDFA71A04154E8C84F7AD2637BE4D6CC60076456D6228B37","orcidId":"0000-0002-3964-0721","documentHash":"0e8a9d71-8976-48cb-82c5-125eebcdd0fd"},{"objectId":"5e7092a5878c28a047399cdf","name":"Magdalena","lastName":"Urbańska","uuid":"BEDBA86DACF0C0BC96F7CE3D09E84E29327BBAD4BD09E552E350814E259C8AC1F5157670B9B126E180C65F1B69487FA15BC194F8548477B48B15D119BA7A0E8E","orcidId":"0000-0001-6824-363X","documentHash":"c6727f08-f06f-4869-b7dc-5c7d6a9f33f9"}],"doi":"10.1021/acs.jpcb.2c03654"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["COVID-19

It employs an additive value function model to represent indirect Decision Maker’s (DM’s) preferences in the form of pairwise comparisons of reference alternatives. By defining a likelihood for the provided preference information and specifying a prior of the preference model, we apply the Bayesian rule to derive a posterior distribution over a set of all potential value functions, not necessarily compatible ones. This distribution emphasizes the potential differences in the abilities of these models to reconstruct the DM’s pairwise comparisons. Hence a distinctive character of our approach consists of characterizing the uncertainty in consequence of applying indirect preference information. We also employ a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, called the Metropolis-Hastings method, to summarize the posterior distribution of the value function model and quantify the outcomes of robustness analysis in the form of stochastic acceptability indices. The proposed approach’s performance is investigated in a thorough experimental study involving real-world and artificially generated datasets."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058200126","journalIssue":{"objectId":"62cffe464097075e7c6fa4c3","year":"2022","publishedYear":2022,"volume":"299","number":"2","doi":null,"documentHash":"4fe0931e-8591-4426-a88e-d939bfa9a940"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"299","pagesFromTo":"600 - 620","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221721008031","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62cffe464097075e7c6fa4a6","name":"Jiapeng","lastName":"Liu","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"df47431a-7097-48c5-84c4-0586000c57b8"},{"objectId":"62cffe464097075e7c6fa4a5","name":"Zice","lastName":"Ru","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"d537a651-82e2-4cef-9f82-774009aa6457"},{"objectId":"62cffe464097075e7c6fa4a4","name":"Xiuwu","lastName":"Liao","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"97599b43-06fa-411c-9a90-96a60240b949"},{"objectId":"5e7093a9878c28a0473aea7f","name":"Miłosz","lastName":"Kadziński","uuid":"0524DF351F74037796D121D8BF7C1CCA9249345518F29DDEB1C65535048C6204A5AB8E4891A0339577E7CFC30BE45B0CC495E2F95ABE4BDB1176AA365686E5F0","orcidId":"0000-0003-1806-3715","documentHash":"1bcbca85-e703-4477-a88a-b45166e29063"}],"doi":"10.1016/j.ejor.2021.09.028"},{"mainLanguageName":"angielski","keywords":[{"languageCode":"eng","keywords":["hollow aluminosilicate microsphere","structural effectiveness","thermal effectiveness","concrete mixture","strength","energy and heat consumption"]}],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":null,"typeName":"Artykuł","affiliations":[{"id":"61eebfca2467f06891459ae3","uid":null,"uuid":null,"parentId":null,"parentUuid":null,"rootId":null,"rootUuid":null,"name":"S.

Optimum values of temperature, humidity and speed of the medium have been identified. The obtained heat treatment parameters are subject to general regularities of structures for the formation of hydraulic bindings and are in accordance with production conditions, thus providing possibilities for their adaptation into production. The mechanisms for determining the strength of concrete stone according to the structural and thermal effectiveness of the active medium have been defined. Thanks to the strength-building mechanisms obtained, it is possible to reduce the thermal destruction capacity of the system while reducing the process heat consumption. It is confirmed that the main direction in reducing the destructive capacity is determined by the mass flow of moisture, which has the greatest heat capacity and the least thermal conductivity at the initial stages. The invention relates to periods of temperature rise and isothermal heating without impairing the mechanical properties of concrete. It is shown that the real duration excludes high-temperature destruction processes, thereby increasing the mechanical strength of concrete and reducing the overall energy consumption. Thus, there is a reason to argue that it is possible to produce strong and light concrete products under accelerated structure formation and new technologies for heat treatment of concrete based on lightweight fillers with reduced heat consumption."}],"lastRefresh":"1747058200128","journalIssue":{"objectId":"6234728f2467f00ffe957ab6","year":"2022","publishedYear":null,"volume":"1","number":"6 (115)","doi":"","documentHash":"0482f772-1de1-4f25-8803-dec366196436"},"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"1","pagesFromTo":"64-72","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"http://journals.uran.ua/eejet/article/download/251004/250777","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"62347fae2467f00ffe95db58","name":"Natalya","lastName":"Ryvkina","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4646-3348","documentHash":"4eef4bab-05b1-4f47-aabf-cbc812977b43"},{"objectId":"62347fae2467f00ffe95db57","name":"Askar","lastName":"Smagulov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5421-6136","documentHash":"4d8e328c-0f0b-41ab-9e8a-a377744138cd"},{"objectId":"62347fae2467f00ffe95db56","name":"Marat","lastName":"Yermekov","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5226-2710","documentHash":"a5633925-9aae-4c69-b196-d771be57a935"},{"objectId":"62347fae2467f00ffe95db55","name":"Anastassiya","lastName":"Atyaksheva","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-5599-8117","documentHash":"c9dee698-c0b4-438f-bd43-068940961348"},{"objectId":"62347fae2467f00ffe95db54","name":"Yermek","lastName":"Sarsikeyev","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0002-7209-5024","documentHash":"41ccbd1c-3cbb-445a-b02c-c9adfc82c577"},{"objectId":"62347fae2467f00ffe95db53","name":"Olga","lastName":"Rozhkova","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0001-8163-7035","documentHash":"dd90186a-cab0-4fd0-8f36-4eed7d71de94"},{"objectId":"62347fae2467f00ffe95db52","name":"Аlexandra","lastName":"Аtyaksheva","uuid":null,"orcidId":"0000-0003-2523-3890","documentHash":"b4a1ad90-9ae6-4531-a7b8-f8dc918e7fc5"}],"doi":"10.15587/1729-4061.2022.251004"},{"mainLanguageName":"polski","keywords":[],"year":2022,"isbn":null,"book":{"objectId":"6305c09c4097076f71e31609","doi":null,"title":"Trzecie Seminarium Praktyczne Aspekty Inżynierii Chemicznej PAIC-2022 : recenzowana monografia konferencyjna, Zaniemyśl, 7-8 czerwca 2022","year":2022,"volume":null,"isbn":"978-83-7775-659-1","ismn":null,"issn":null,"url":"https://sin.put.poznan.pl/publications/details/i47292","translation":false,"bookEvaluation":null,"documentHash":"1622695c-ed7f-4077-8791-2f6d75332867","publisher":{"objectId":"5d35987b878c28139f4eb899","mniswId":"48400","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","documentHash":"dd2c18f7-1f78-41f5-8057-a22971a308ec"},"openAccess":null},"typeName":"Rozdział","affiliations":[{"id":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","uid":"bBTlzaxIQfaH_WWpG9P4fCg","uuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","parentId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","parentUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","rootId":"5e70918b878c28a04737de31","rootUuid":"2caf49c8-c982-4873-9175-a3fb2ca1ce99","name":"Politechnika Poznańska","type":"AUTHOR","affiliatedPersonIDs":["5e70934f878c28a0473a6f0a","5e7092fb878c28a0473a06f4","5e70934d878c28a0473a6dd8","616e2da875234017e055cfdd"]}],"type":"CHAPTER","title":"Straty ciśnienia podczas przepływu roztworów soli sodowej karboksymetylocelulozy z dodatkiem soli przez złoże cząstek kulistych","mainLanguage":"pol","journal":null,"pages":null,"publicationPlace":null,"translators":[],"institutionProfile":true,"openAccess":null,"bookEvaluation":null,"translationEditors":[],"articleEvaluation":null,"proceedings":null,"_version":4,"objectId":"630ef9e44097076f717a74ff","editors":[],"conferenceSeries":null,"contributionOrder":{"AUTHOR":["5e7092fb878c28a0473a06f4","5e70934d878c28a0473a6dd8","5e70934f878c28a0473a6f0a","616e2da875234017e055cfdd"]},"issue":null,"abstracts":[{"languageCode":"pol","content":"Sól sodowa karboksymetylocelulozy (Na-CMC) należy do polimerów jonowych, zwanych polielektrolitami.

Treatment response, long-term observation, technical data downloaded from electroporator and photographs taken before and after the ECT were assessed in the analysis.\r\n\r\nResults: In total, 200 nodules in 5 patients were treated with ECT in palliative intent. After 5 out of 6 ECT cycles, the particular clinical response has been observed. Four patients with primary unresectable lesions underwent 11 surgeries of the cutaneous metastases. In long-term follow-up in 2 patients, of whom one died 19 months after the ECT, the disease progressed and in another two, no recurrence was observed.\r\n\r\nConclusions: ECT is an encouraging therapy for patients in whom the recurrent cutaneous melanoma cannot be treated with other methods, however, access to this method in eastern part of Central Europe is limited.

Little is known about the sperm proteome changes resulting from the aging process. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the functional quality and proteome of epididymal spermatozoa of dogs that were differing in age. The study was conducted on 30 male dogs that were divided into three age groups. G1—12 to 41 months old, G2—42 to 77 months old, and G3—78 to 132 months old. The sperm samples were assessed using a computer-assisted semen analysis (CASA). The epididymal sperm proteins were analyzed using gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), nano-liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (NanoUPLC-Q-TOF/MS) and bioinformatic tools. The sperm quality parameters were significantly lower in older dogs. NanoUPLC-Q-TOF/MS identification resulted in 865 proteins that were found in the G1, 472 in G2, and 435 in G3. There were seven proteins that were present in all three age groups, and four of them (ACTB, CE10, NPC2, CRISP2) showed significant changes among the studied groups. Age-dependent variations were detected in the sperm proteome composition and were related to important metabolite pathways, which might suggest that several proteins are implicated in sperm maturation and could be potential aging biomarkers.</jats:p>"}],"lastRefresh":"1747058200137","journalIssue":null,"conferenceEdition":null,"originalLanguage":null,"editionNumber":null,"volume":"23","pagesFromTo":"art.9143 [23 s.]","issn":null,"series":null,"translation":false,"publisher":null,"ismn":null,"otherTitles":[],"publicUri":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/23/16/9143","numberInSeries":null,"authors":[{"objectId":"6630bf274097076263e752c5","name":"Marzena","lastName":"Mogielnicka-Brzozowska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"8c8226d6-68e8-4347-9780-89fc571f76df"},{"objectId":"6630bf274097076263e752c4","name":"Piotr","lastName":"Mlynarz","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"cdc862a7-3a46-470e-9872-853e912a6730"},{"objectId":"6630bf274097076263e752c3","name":"Jerzy","lastName":"Wiśniewski","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"dafca789-9ad9-4fc8-aa62-41f2eedef37a"},{"objectId":"6630bf274097076263e752c2","name":"Anna","lastName":"Zmudzinska","uuid":null,"orcidId":null,"documentHash":"08bcaa7d-cef6-4c8a-8278-80e69993df85"},{"objectId":"5e70944b878c28a0473b9ed6","name":"Beata","lastName":"Olejnik","uuid":"8BFE980CB0373D33B16B671D731CA1390C50D571965D803BB56EF97C54DE6672C711C555DF985FDD4CE784F13667747B2CA2900B69161D42833ACE0BC391FBCF","orcidId":"0000-0002-1706-177X","documentHash":"d7a88444-1d22-46c7-8897-e507bbe059a5"}],"doi":"10.3390/ijms23169143"}],"pagination":{"maxCount":316326,"token":"MTc0NzA1ODIwMDEzNw=="},"version":"1.2.8"}
